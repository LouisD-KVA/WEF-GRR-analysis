Assumptions and Conventions
A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook. It has
been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during July 30–August 27,
2012, except for the currencies participating in the European exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II), which are assumed
to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established policies of national authorities will
be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for selected economies, see Box A1 in
the ­Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $106.18 a barrel in 2012 and $105.10 a barrel in 2013
and will remain unchanged in real terms over the medium term; that the six-month London interbank offered rate
(LIBOR) on U.S. dollar deposits will average 0.7 percent in 2012 and 0.6 percent in 2013; that the three-month euro
deposit rate will average 0.6 percent in 2012 and 0.2 percent in 2013; and that the six-month Japanese yen deposit rate
will yield on average 0.4 percent in 2012 and 0.3 percent in 2013. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than
forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that would in any event be involved in the
projections. The estimates and projections are based on statistical information available through mid-September 2012.
The following conventions are used throughout the World Economic Outlook:
. . . to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;
– 	between years or months (for example, 2011–12 or January–June) to indicate the years or months
covered, including the beginning and ending years or months;
/

between years or months (for example, 2011/12) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.

“Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
“Basis points” refer to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of
1 percentage point).
For Cyprus, data reflect a passive scenario based on implementation of approved policies only. It is also
assumed that the government will be able to roll over its debt and finance its deficit at a reasonable cost over
the medium term and that banks will achieve adequate capitalization without government assistance.
Data for South Sudan are now included in the sub-Saharan Africa aggregates and classified under those for a
country with fuel as the main source of export earnings. Sudan, which remains in the Middle East and North
Africa region, is now classified as a country with nonfuel primary products as the main source of export earnings.
Data for San Marino are now included in the advanced economy classification.
As in the April 2012 World Economic Outlook, data for Syria are excluded for 2011 and later due to the
uncertain political situation.
Starting with the October 2012 World Economic Outlook, the label for the Emerging and Developing
Economies group is Emerging Market and Developing Economies. The member countries remain unchanged
with the exception of South Sudan as a new member of the group.
If no source is listed on tables and figures, data are drawn from the World Economic Outlook (WEO) database.
When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size.
Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals reflect rounding.
As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that
is a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial
entities that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.
Composite data are provided for various groups of countries organized according to economic characteristics or region. Unless otherwise noted, country group composites represent calculations based on 90 percent or
more of the weighted group data.
The boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on the maps do not imply, on
the part of the International Monetary Fund, any judgment on the legal status of any territory or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries.

Further information and data

This version of the World Economic Outlook is available in full through the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.
imf.org) and the IMF website (www.imf.org). Accompanying the publication on the IMF website is a larger
compilation of data from the WEO database than is included in the report itself, including files containing
the series most frequently requested by readers. These files may be downloaded for use in a variety of software
packages.
The data appearing in the World Economic Outlook are compiled by the IMF staff at the time of the WEO
exercises. The historical data and projections are based on the information gathered by the IMF country
desk officers in the context of their missions to IMF member countries and through their ongoing analysis
of the evolving situation in each country. Historical data are updated on a continual basis as more information becomes available, and structural breaks in data are often adjusted to produce smooth series with the use
of splicing and other techniques. IMF staff estimates continue to serve as proxies for historical series when
complete information is unavailable. As a result, WEO data can differ from other sources with official data,
including the IMF’s International Financial Statistics.
The WEO data and metadata provided are “as is” and “as available,” and every effort is made to ensure, but
not guarantee, their timeliness, accuracy, and completeness. When errors are discovered, there is a concerted
effort to correct them as appropriate and feasible. Corrections and revisions made after publication are incorporated into the electronic editions available from the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.imf.org) and on the IMF
website (www.imf.org). All substantive changes are listed in detail in the online tables of contents.
For details on the terms and conditions for usage of the WEO database, please refer to the IMF Copyright
and Usage website, www.imf.org/external/terms.htm.

Preface

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s
surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international
financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product
of a comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on
information the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are
carried out in particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific
Department, European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere
Department—together with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets
Department; and the Fiscal Affairs Department.
The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction
of ­Olivier Blanchard, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Jörg
­Decressin, Deputy Director, Research Department, and by Thomas Helbling, Division Chief, Research
Department.
The primary contributors to this report are Abdul Abiad, John Bluedorn, Rupa Duttagupta, Jaime
­Guajardo, Andrea Pescatori, Damiano Sandri, John Simon, and Petia Topalova. Other contributors include
Ashvin Ahuja, Ali Alichi, Peter Allum, Derek Anderson, Michal Andrle, Samya Beidas-Strom, Olivier
Blanchard, Stijn Claessens, Davide Furceri, Nick Gigineishvili, Benjamin Hunt, Joong Shik Kang, M. Ayhan
Kose, Douglas Laxton, Daniel Leigh, Prakash Loungani, Junior Maih, Akito Matsumoto, Dimitre Milkov,
Armando Morales, Malhar Nabar, Marina Rousset, Marco E. Terrones, and Kenichi Ueda.
Hites Ahir, Gavin Asdorian, Shan Chen, Angela Espiritu, Sinem Kilic Celik, Nadezhda Lepeshko, Murad
Omoev, Ezgi O. Ozturk, Katherine Pan, Daniel Rivera-Greenwood, Jair Rodriguez, Marina Rousset, Min Kyu
Song, and Bennet Voorhees provided research assistance. Kevin Clinton provided comments and suggestions.
Tingyun Chen, Mahnaz Hemmati, Toh Kuan, Rajesh Nilawar, Emory Oakes, and Steve Zhang provided technical support. Skeeter Mathurin and Luke Lee were responsible for word processing. Linda Griffin Kean of
the External Relations Department edited the manuscript and coordinated the production of the publication.
External consultants Amrita Dasgupta, Aleksandr Gerasimov, Shamiso Mapondera, Nhu Nguyen, and Pavel
Pimenov provided additional technical support.
The analysis has benefited from comments and suggestions by staff from other IMF departments, as well as
by Executive Directors following their discussion of the report on September 14, 2012. However, both projections and policy considerations are those of the IMF staff and should not be attributed to Executive Directors
or to their national authorities.

FOREWORD

T

he recovery continues, but it has weakened. In advanced economies, growth is
now too low to make a substantial dent
in unemployment. And in major emerging market economies, growth that had been strong
earlier has also decreased. Relative to our April 2012
forecasts, our forecasts for 2013 growth have been
revised from 2.0 percent down to 1.5 percent for
advanced economies, and from 6.0 percent down
to 5.6 percent for emerging market and developing
economies.
The forces at work are, for the most part,
familiar.
Those forces pulling growth down in advanced
economies are fiscal consolidation and a still-weak
financial system. In most countries, fiscal consolidation is proceeding according to plan. While this
consolidation is needed, there is no question that it
is weighing on demand, and the evidence increasingly suggests that, in the current environment, the
fiscal multipliers are large. The financial system is
still not functioning efficiently. In many countries,
banks are still weak, and their positions are made
worse by low growth. As a result, many borrowers
still face tight borrowing conditions.
The main force pulling growth up is accommodative monetary policy. Central banks continue not
only to maintain very low policy rates, but also to
experiment with programs aimed at decreasing rates
in particular markets, at helping particular categories of borrowers, or at helping financial intermediation in general.
More seems to be at work, however, than these
mechanical forces—namely, a general feeling of
uncertainty. Assessing the precise nature and effects
of this uncertainty is essential, but it is not easy.
Essential: If uncertainty could be decreased, the
recovery could well turn out to be stronger than
currently forecast. But not easy: Explicit indexes of
uncertainty, such as the VIX in the United States or

the VStoxx in Europe, remain at fairly low levels.1
Uncertainty appears more diffuse, more Knightian
in nature. Worries about the ability of European
policymakers to control the euro crisis and worries
about the failure to date of U.S. policymakers to
agree on a fiscal plan surely play an important role,
but one that is hard to nail down.
Low growth and uncertainty in advanced economies are affecting emerging market and developing economies, through both trade and financial
channels, adding to homegrown weaknesses. As
was the case in 2009, trade channels are surprisingly strong, with, for example, lower exports
accounting for most of the decrease in growth in
China. Alternative risk-off and risk-on episodes,
triggered by progress and regress on policy action,
especially in the euro area, are triggering volatile
capital flows.
Turning to policy action, the main focus continues to be the euro area. Here, there has been a clear
change in attitudes, and a new architecture is being
put in place. The lessons of the past few years are
now clear. Euro area countries can be hit by strong,
country-specific, adverse shocks. Weak banks can
considerably amplify the adverse effects of such
shocks. And, if it looks like the sovereign itself
might be in trouble, sovereign-bank interactions can
further worsen the outcome.
Therefore a new architecture must aim at reducing the amplitude of the shocks in the first place—
at putting in place a system of transfers to soften
the effects of the shocks. That architecture must aim
at moving the supervision, the resolution, and the
recapitalization processes for banks to the euro area
level. It must decrease the probability of default by
sovereigns, and were default nevertheless to occur,
it must decrease the effects on creditors and on the

financial system. It is good to see these issues being
seriously explored and to see some of these mechanisms being slowly put together.
In the short term, however, more immediate
measures are needed. Spain and Italy must follow
through with adjustment plans that reestablish
competitiveness and fiscal balance and maintain
growth. To do so, they must be able to recapitalize their banks without adding to their sovereign
debt. And they must be able to borrow at reasonable rates. Most of these pieces are falling into
place, and if the complex puzzle can be rapidly

completed, one can reasonably hope that the worst
might be behind us.
If uncertainty is indeed behind the current
slowdown, and if the adoption and implementation of these measures decrease uncertainty, things
may turn out better than our forecasts, not only
in Europe, but also in the rest of the world. I, for
once, would be happy if our baseline forecasts turn
out to be inaccurate—in this case, too pessimistic.

Executive Summary

T

he recovery has suffered new setbacks,
and uncertainty weighs heavily on the
outlook. A key reason is that policies
in the major advanced economies have
not rebuilt confidence in medium-term prospects.
Tail risks, such as those relating to the viability
of the euro area or major U.S. fiscal policy mistakes, continue to preoccupy investors. The World
Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast thus sees only a
gradual strengthening of activity from the relatively
disappointing pace of early 2012. Projected global
growth, at 3.3 and 3.6 percent in 2012 and 2013,
respectively, is weaker than in the July 2012 WEO
Update, which was in turn lower than in the April
2012 WEO (Chapter 1). Output is expected to
remain sluggish in advanced economies but still
relatively solid in many emerging market and
developing economies. Unemployment is likely
to stay elevated in many parts of the world. And
financial conditions will remain fragile, according to
the October 2012 Global Financial Stability Report
(GFSR). Chapter 2 discusses regional developments
in detail.
The WEO forecast rests on two crucial policy
assumptions. The first is that European policymakers––consistent with the GFSR’s baseline
scenario––will adopt policies that gradually ease
financial conditions further in periphery economies.
In this regard, the European Central Bank (ECB)
has recently done its part. It is now up to national
policymakers to move and activate the European
Stability Mechanism (ESM), while articulating a
credible path and beginning to implement measures to achieve a banking union and greater fiscal
integration. The second assumption is that U.S.
policymakers will prevent the drastic automatic tax
increases and spending cutbacks (the “fiscal cliff”)
implied by existing budget law, raise the U.S. federal debt ceiling in a timely manner, and make good
progress toward a comprehensive plan to restore
fiscal sustainability. The WEO forecast could once
again be disappointed on both accounts.

More generally, downside risks have increased
and are considerable. The IMF staff’s fan chart,
which uses financial and commodity market data
and analyst forecasts to gauge risks––suggests that
there is now a 1 in 6 chance of global growth falling
below 2 percent, which would be consistent with a
recession in advanced economies and low growth in
emerging market and developing economies. Ultimately, however, the WEO forecast rests on critical
policy action in the euro area and the United States,
and it is very difficult to estimate the probability
that this action will materialize.
This juncture presents major difficulties for
policymakers. In many advanced economies, injections of liquidity are having a positive impact on
financial stability and output and employment,
but the impact may be diminishing. Many governments have started in earnest to reduce excessive
deficits, but because uncertainty is high, confidence
is low, and financial sectors are weak, the significant fiscal achievements have been accompanied
by disappointing growth or recessions. In emerging
market and developing economies, policymakers are
conscious of the need to rebuild fiscal and monetary
policy space but are wondering how to calibrate
policies in the face of major external downside risks.
An effective policy response in the major
advanced economies is the key to improving
prospects and inspiring more confidence about the
future. In the short term, the main tasks are to rule
out the tail risk scenarios and adopt concrete plans
to bring down public debt over the medium term.
The crisis in the euro area remains the most
obvious threat to the global outlook. The ECB has
put in place a mechanism to improve the transmission of low policy rates to borrowing costs in the
periphery, where investors’ fears about the viability
of the euro have pushed market rates to very high
levels. The periphery economies need to continue
to adjust. Governments must meet their commitment to make the euro area firewall more flexible.
Specifically, the ESM must intervene in banking

systems and provide support to sovereigns, while
national leaders must work toward true economic
and monetary union. This requires establishing a
banking union with a unified financial stability
framework and implementing measures toward fiscal integration, on the principle that more area-wide
insurance must come with more area-wide control.
Unless more action is taken soon, recent improvements in financial markets could prove fleeting.
The WEO forecast may then be disappointed once
again, and the euro area could slide into the October 2012 GFSR weak policies scenario. If, however,
policy actions were to exceed WEO assumptions––
for example, if euro area policymakers were to
deliver a major down payment on the road to more
integration, such as an area-wide bank resolution
mechanism with a common fiscal backstop––real
GDP growth could well be higher than projected,
consistent with the October 2012 GFSR complete
policies scenario.
Reducing the risks to the medium-term outlook presaged by the public debt overhang in the
major advanced economies will require supportive monetary policies and appropriate structural
reforms (Chapter 3), as well as careful fiscal policy.
Good progress has already been made and planned
fiscal consolidation is sizable for the near term, as
discussed in the October 2012 Fiscal Monitor. U.S.
legislators must soon remove the threat of the fiscal
cliff and raise the debt ceiling––if they fail to do
so, the U.S. economy could fall back into recession, with deleterious spillovers to the rest of the
world. Furthermore, policymakers in the United
States urgently need to specify strong medium-term
fiscal plans. Those in Japan need to persevere with
planned adjustments and specify new measures to
halt and soon reverse the increase in the publicdebt-to-GDP ratio.
More generally, policymakers need to specify realistic fiscal objectives and develop plans for contingencies. This means adopting structural or cyclically
adjusted targets, or anchoring plans on measures
and their estimated yields, rather than on nominal
targets. Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to
play freely. Also, should growth fall significantly
short of WEO projections, countries with room to
maneuver should smooth their planned adjustment
xviii

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

over 2013 and beyond. At the same time, declining inflation rates, growing slack, and sizable fiscal
adjustment in the advanced economies argue for
maintaining very accommodative monetary conditions, including unconventional measures because
interest rates are near the zero lower bound.
So far, policymakers’ record in meeting structural
challenges has been mixed; therefore, further efforts
are needed. Programs to relieve chronic household
debt burdens, where these have been tried, have not
been commensurate with the scale of the problem.
Efforts to strengthen the regulatory framework for
financial institutions and markets have been patchy,
according to Chapter 3 of the October 2012 GFSR,
with some success in rebuilding capital but less in
lowering reliance on wholesale funding and containing incentives for excessive risk taking and regulatory arbitrage. In addition, in the euro area, the
restructuring or resolution of weak financial institutions has advanced slowly and only in response to
major market pressure––a more proactive, area-wide
approach is urgently needed. Increases in statutory
retirement ages have reduced the long-term path
of pension outlays, but as health care spending
continues to increase quickly, more measures will
be needed to contain the growth of entitlements
to a sustainable rate. Some countries, notably the
economies of the euro area periphery, have introduced reforms to make labor markets more flexible.
However, many economies need to take stronger
action to help the long-term unemployed, including
through improvements to job-search support and
training.
In emerging market and developing economies,
activity has been slowed by policy tightening in
response to capacity constraints, weaker demand from
advanced economies, and country-specific factors.
Policy improvements have raised their resilience to
shocks (Chapter 4). Since the crisis erupted in 2008,
expansionary policies have buffered the negative
impact of the weakness in advanced economy markets:
fiscal deficits have typically been above precrisis levels,
whereas real interest rates have been lower. Domestic
credit has grown rapidly. Over the medium term,
policymakers will need to ensure that they retain the
ability to respond flexibly to shocks by maintaining
a sound fiscal position and by keeping inflation and

Executive Summary

credit growth at moderate rates. In this respect, the
policy tightening during 2011 was appropriate. Given
the growing downside risks to external demand, central banks have appropriately paused or reversed some
of the monetary policy tightening. Many have scope
to do more to support demand if external downside
risks threaten to materialize.
Global imbalances, and the associated vulnerabilities, have diminished, but there is still a need
for more decisive policy action to address them.
Within the euro area, current account imbalances––
the large surpluses in Germany and the Netherlands
and the deficits in most periphery economies––need
to adjust further. At the global level, the current
account positions of the United States, the euro area
as a whole, and Japan are weaker than they would
be with more sustainable fiscal policies—and the
real effective exchange rates of the dollar, euro, and
yen are stronger. In contrast, the current account
positions of many Asian economies are undesirably
strong and their exchange rates undesirably weak.
In part, this reflects distortions that hold back consumption. But it also reflects the effect of large-scale
official accumulation of foreign exchange.

In general, the policies required to lower current account imbalances and related vulnerabilities
suit the interests of the economies concerned.
More adjustment in external-deficit economies
and more internal demand in external-surplus
economies would contribute not only to a safer
global economy but also to stronger growth for
all. Many external-deficit economies need further
fiscal adjustment and strengthened financial sector
supervision and regulation. These efforts need to be
complemented with structural measures, the details
of which differ widely across the external-deficit
advanced and emerging market economies but
include labor and product market reform, improvements to governance and the business environment,
and measures to boost private saving for retirement.
The structural measures needed in external-surplus
economies with undervalued exchange rates also
vary by country but include boosting investment
in Germany, reforming the social safety net in
China to encourage consumption, and reducing the
accumulation of official reserves in many emerging
market economies, which would also help rein in
high credit and asset price growth.

GLOBaL prOSpectS aND pOLIcIeS

The global economy has deteriorated further
since the release of the July 2012 WEO Update, and
growth projections have been marked down (Table
1.1). Downside risks are now judged to be more
elevated than in the April 2012 and September 2011
World Economic Outlook (WEO) reports. A key issue
is whether the global economy is just hitting another
bout of turbulence in what was always expected
to be a slow and bumpy recovery or whether the
current slowdown has a more lasting component.
The answer depends on whether European and
U.S. policymakers deal proactively with their major
short-term economic challenges. The WEO forecast
assumes that they do, and thus global activity is projected to reaccelerate in the course of 2012; if they
do not, the forecast will likely be disappointed once
again. For the medium term, important questions
remain about how the global economy will operate
in a world of high government debt and whether
emerging market economies can maintain their
strong expansion while shifting further from external
to domestic sources of growth. The problem of
high public debt existed before the Great Recession,
because of population aging and growth in entitlement spending, but the crisis brought the need to
address it forward from the long to the medium
term.

recent Developments
Indicators of activity and unemployment show
increasing and broad-based economic sluggishness
in the first half of 2012 and no significant improvement in the third quarter (Figure 1.1). Global
manufacturing has slowed sharply. The euro area
periphery has seen a marked decline in activity
(Figure 1.2, panel 1), driven by financial difficulties
evident in a sharp increase in sovereign rate spreads
(Figure 1.2, panel 2). Activity has disappointed in
other economies too, notably the United States
and United Kingdom. Spillovers from advanced
economies and homegrown difficulties have held

back activity in emerging market and developing
economies. These spillovers have lowered commodity
prices and weighed on activity in many commodity
exporters (see the Special Feature).
The result of these developments is that growth
has once again been weaker than projected, in
significant part because the intensity of the euro area
crisis has not abated as assumed in previous WEO
projections. Other causes of disappointing growth
include weak financial institutions and inadequate
policies in key advanced economies. Furthermore,
a significant part of the lower growth in emerging market and developing economies is related to
domestic factors, notably constraints on the sustainability of the high pace of growth in these economies
and building financial imbalances. In addition, IMF
staff research suggests that fiscal cutbacks had largerthan-expected negative short-term multiplier effects
on output, which may explain part of the growth
shortfalls (Box 1.1).

the crisis in the euro area Intensified
Notwithstanding policy action aimed at resolving it, the euro area crisis has deepened and new
interventions have been necessary to prevent matters from deteriorating rapidly. As discussed in the
October 2012 Global Financial Stability Report
(GFSR), banks, insurers, and firms have swept spare
liquidity from the periphery to the core of the euro
area, causing Spanish sovereign spreads to hit record
highs and Italian spreads to move up sharply too
(Figure 1.2, panel 2). This was triggered by continued doubts about the capacity of countries in the
periphery to deliver the required fiscal and structural adjustments, questions about the readiness of
national institutions to implement euro-area-wide
policies adequate to combat the crisis, and concerns
about the readiness of the European Central Bank
(ECB) and the European Financial Stability Facility/
European Stability Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) to
respond if worst-case scenarios materialize.

These concerns culminated in questions about the
viability of the euro area and prompted a variety of
actions from euro area policymakers. At the June
29, 2012, summit, euro area leaders committed to
reconsidering the issue of the seniority of the ESM
with respect to lending to Spain. In response to
escalating problems, Spain subsequently agreed on a
program with its European partners to support the
restructuring of its banking sector, with financing of
up to €100 billion. Also, leaders launched work on a
banking union, which was followed up recently with
a proposal by the European Commission to establish
a single supervisory mechanism. Leaders agreed that,
once established, such a mechanism would open
the possibility for the ESM to take direct equity
stakes in banks. This is critical because it will help
break the adverse feedback loops between sovereigns
and banks. Moreover, in early September, the ECB
announced that it will consider (without ex ante
limits) Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs)
under a macroeconomic adjustment or precautionary program with the EFSF/ESM. The transactions
will cover government securities purchases, focused
on the shorter part of the yield curve. Importantly,
the ECB will accept the same treatment as private
or other creditors with respect to bonds purchased
through the OMT program.
The anticipation of these initiatives and their subsequent deployment set off a relief rally in financial
markets, and the euro appreciated against the U.S.
dollar and other major currencies. However, recent
activity indicators have continued to languish, suggesting that weakness is spreading from the periphery to the whole of the euro area (Figure 1.3, panel
2). Even Germany has not been immune.

Output and Employment Weakened Again in the
United States
The U.S. economy also has slowed. Revised
national accounts data suggest that it came into 2012
with more momentum than initially estimated. However, real GDP growth then slowed to 1.7 percent
in the second quarter, below the April WEO and
July WEO Update projections. The labor market and
consumption have failed to garner much strength.
The persistent weakness has prompted another round

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

Figure 1.2. Euro Area Developments
The crisis in the euro area has deepened. Activity is contracting, mainly due to deep cutbacks
in production in the periphery economies, because ﬁnancial and ﬁscal conditions are very
tight. Sovereign issuers and banks in the periphery are struggling to attract foreign investors.
Their sovereign debt spreads have risen appreciably, and their banks rely increasingly on the
European Central Bank (ECB) for funding. As a result, they have cut back domestic credit.

of policy stimulus by the Federal Reserve. Because
of ongoing political gridlock, the fiscal cliff will not
be addressed before the November elections. On the
positive side, the housing market may be stabilizing, albeit at depressed levels, and private credit has
continued to expand despite retrenchment in the U.S.
market by EU banks.

Domestic Demand Continued to Lose Momentum in
Key Emerging Market Economies
Policy tightening in response to capacity constraints and concerns about the potential for
deteriorating bank loan portfolios, weaker demand
from advanced economies, and country-specific
factors slowed GDP growth in emerging market and
developing economies from about 9 percent in late
2009 to about 5¼ percent recently. Indicators of
manufacturing activity have been retreating for some
time (Figure 1.3, panel 1). The IMF staff’s Global
Projection Model suggests that more than half of the
downward revisions to real GDP growth in 2012 are
rooted in domestic developments.
•• Growth is estimated to have weakened appreciably in developing Asia, to less than 7 percent in
the first half of 2012, as activity in China slowed
sharply, owing to a tightening in credit conditions
(in response to threats of a real estate bubble),
a return to a more sustainable pace of public
investment, and weaker external demand. India’s
activity suffered from waning business confidence
amid slow approvals for new projects, sluggish
structural reforms, policy rate hikes designed to
rein in inflation, and flagging external demand.
•• Real GDP growth also decelerated in Latin America to about 3 percent in the first half of 2012,
largely due to Brazil. This reflects the impact of
past policy tightening to contain inflation pressure and steps to moderate credit growth in some
market segments—with increased drag recently
from global factors.
•• Emerging European economies, following a strong
rebound from their credit crisis, have now been
hit hard by slowing exports to the euro area,
with real GDP growth coming close to a halt. In
Turkey, the slowdown has been driven by domestic demand, on the heels of policy tightening and

chapter 1

a decline in confidence. Unlike in 2008, however,
generalized risk aversion toward the region is no
longer a factor. Activity in Russia, which has benefited various economies in the region, has also
lost some momentum recently.

Figure 1.3. Current and Forward-Looking Growth Indicators
Purchasing managers’ indices for the manufacturing sector do not yet point to a signiﬁcant
reacceleration of activity—they remain below the level of 50, indicating falling output. The
deterioration is particularly pronounced in the periphery of the euro area. Investment in
machinery and equipment has also weakened, especially in the euro area. Furthermore, the
pace of stock building has moved into a lower gear. Consumption has shown greater
resilience, especially in emerging market and developing economies. Somewhat lower oil
prices may support consumption in the advanced economies. However, higher food prices
will harm many households, especially in emerging market and developing economies.

Prospects Are for Sluggish and Bumpy Growth
Looking ahead, no significant improvement
appears in the offing. The WEO forecast includes
only a modest reacceleration of activity, which would
be helped along by some reduction in uncertainty
related to assumed policy reactions in the euro area
and the United States, continued monetary accommodation, and gradually easier financial conditions.
Healthy nonfinancial corporate balance sheets
and steady or slowing deleveraging by banks and
households will encourage the rebuilding of the
capital stock and a gradual strengthening of durables
consumption. In emerging market and developing
economies, monetary and fiscal policy easing will
strengthen output growth. However, if either of two
critical assumptions about policy reactions fails to
hold, global activity could deteriorate very sharply.
•• The first assumption is that, consistent with the
October 2012 GFSR baseline scenario, European
policymakers take additional action to advance
adjustment at national levels and integration at
the euro area level (including timely establishment
of a single supervisory mechanism). As a result,
policy credibility and confidence improve gradually
while strains remain from elevated funding costs
and capital flight from the periphery to the core
countries. If these policy actions are not taken, the
WEO forecast may be disappointed once again and
the area could slide into the GFSR’s weak policies
scenario, which is described in further detail below.
•• The second assumption is that U.S. policymakers avoid the fiscal cliff and raise the debt ceiling,
while making good progress toward a comprehensive plan to restore fiscal sustainability.

Fiscal Adjustment Will Continue but Not in Many
Emerging Market Economies
Fiscal adjustment has been detracting from activity in various parts of the world and will continue

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

Figure 1.4. Fiscal Policies
In 2012, ﬁscal policy became more contractionary in the advanced economies. It became
much less contractionary in the emerging market and developing economies, where the ﬁscal
deﬁcit is expected to be about 1½ percent of GDP—much lower than the 6 percent of GDP level
projected for the advanced economies. However, before the crisis, emerging market and
developing economies were running surpluses. Over the medium term, many should
strengthen their ﬁscal positions to rebuild room for policy maneuvering. The main challenges
with respect to deﬁcit reduction lie, however, in the advanced economies, where public debt is
in excess of 100 percent of GDP and rising.

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

to do so over the forecast horizon in the advanced
economies but not in the emerging market and
developing economies. The October 2012 Fiscal
Monitor discusses the trends.
In major advanced economies, general government structural balances are on course to tighten by
about ¾ percent of GDP in 2012, which is about
the same as in 2011 and in line with the April 2012
WEO projections (Figure 1.4, panel 1). In 2013,
the tightening is projected to increase modestly
to about 1 percent of GDP, but its composition
across countries will be different (see Table A8 in
the Statistical Appendix). In the euro area, much
adjustment has already been implemented and the
pace of tightening will diminish somewhat. In the
United States, the budget outlook for 2013 is highly
uncertain, given the large number of expiring tax
provisions and the threat of automatic spending cuts
and in the context of highly polarized politics. The
fiscal cliff implies a tightening of more than 4 percent of GDP, but the WEO projection assumes that
the outcome would be only a 1¼ percent of GDP
reduction in the structural deficit, which is slightly
more than in 2012, mainly on account of expiring
stimulus measures, such as the payroll tax cut, and a
decline in war-related spending. The budget outlook
has also become uncertain in Japan, where a political
impasse has delayed approval of budget funding for
the remainder of the fiscal year ending in March
2013. Earthquake-related spending has lent support
to growth in 2012 but will decline sharply in 2013.
As a result, there will be a fiscal withdrawal of about
½ percent of GDP. This withdrawal could be much
larger if the political impasse is not resolved soon.
In emerging market and developing economies,
no significant fiscal consolidation is on tap for
2012–13, following a 1 percent of GDP improvement in structural balances during 2011 (Figure 1.4,
panel 1). The general government deficit in these
economies is expected to remain below 1½ percent
of GDP, and public debt levels are expected to
decline as a share of GDP, toward 30 percent. Fiscal
prospects, however, vary across economies. Policy
will be broadly neutral in China, India, and Turkey
in 2012 and 2013. In Brazil, policy will be broadly
neutral in 2012 and tighten somewhat in 2013. In
Mexico, there will be a roughly 1 percent of GDP

chapter 1

fiscal tightening in 2012, followed by a modest
further fiscal withdrawal in 2013. Russia is loosening noticeably in 2012, but its stance is projected to
become broadly neutral in 2013.

Monetary Policy Is Expected to Support Activity
Monetary policy has been easing and will
remain very accommodative, according to market expectations (Figure 1.5, panel 1). The ECB
recently launched its OMT program (see above)
and broadened collateral requirements. The Federal
Reserve recently announced that it would purchase
mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion a month, consider additional asset purchases,
and employ its other policy tools until economic
conditions improve. It also extended its low-interestrate guidance from late 2014 to mid-2015. Earlier,
the Bank of England had expanded its quantitative easing program. Various advanced economies
recently cut policy rates (Australia, Czech Republic,
Israel, Korea) or postponed rate hikes. The Bank of
Japan expects a roughly 5 percent of GDP monetary
expansion during the coming year on account of
its Asset Purchase Program and estimates that this
would suffice to push inflation up to its 1 percent
goal. It recently eased its monetary policy further
by expanding its asset purchase program ceiling for
government bonds.
The Bank of England launched some innovative
measures. Under its Funding for Lending Scheme
(FLS), banks and building societies will be able to
borrow U.K. Treasury bills in exchange for less liquid collateral. Banks may borrow bills in an amount
equal to 5 percent of their June 2012 stock of loans
to the U.K. nonfinancial sector, plus any expansion
of lending from that date until the end of 2013.
Swap fees will be lower for banks that maintain or
expand rather than cut their lending. These measures
should encourage bank lending and ease access to
wholesale credit by improving the quality of assets
held by banks.
Emerging market and developing economies
launched a variety of easing measures in response
to softening activity and inflation. Many postponed
anticipated tightening, and some cut policy rates,
including Brazil, China, Colombia, Hungary, the

Global Prospects and Policies

Figure 1.5. Monetary Policies
Expectations are for very accommodative monetary policies in the major advanced
economies. Real interest rates are also low in many emerging market and developing
economies, and several economies have cut their policy rates in the past six months.
However, only a few economies implemented large cuts. Over the medium term, policy
rates will have to be raised, but considering the downside risks to the outlook, many central
banks can afford to hold steady now or ease further. In advanced economies, central bank
balance sheets have expanded appreciably, but their size is not unusual compared with
those of various emerging market economies.

Equity markets recently registered large losses and have been very volatile. Policy
pronouncements have had large effects. Bank lending conditions are gradually easing from
very tight levels in the United States but are continuing to tighten in the euro area. U.S. credit
to households and nonﬁnancial ﬁrms is growing again; euro area credit remains in the
doldrums, amid cutbacks in the periphery.

However, only Brazil cut aggressively, also easing
­macroprudential measures to further encourage
lending. On the whole, real interest rates in many
emerging market and developing economies are still
relatively low and credit growth is high. For these reasons, many central banks have chosen to hold steady.

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

Financial Conditions Will Remain Very Fragile
Despite the summer 2012 market rally, financial
vulnerabilities are higher than in the spring, according to the October 2012 GFSR. Confidence in the
global financial system remains exceptionally fragile.
Bank lending has remained sluggish across advanced
economies (Figure 1.6, panels 2 and 3). U.S. credit
standards have been easing modestly for some time,
although not yet for residential real estate. In the
euro area, by contrast, lending surveys point to
a further tightening of standards and falling loan
demand. Bank credit has contracted sharply in the
periphery, and credit growth slowed to a crawl in
the core economies amid large increases in periphery
credit spreads.
Increased risk aversion has dampened capital flows
to emerging markets (Figure 1.7, panel 1), although
local-currency debt has continued to attract inflows
throughout the euro area crisis. Concerns center on
slowing domestic growth and heightened financial
vulnerabilities. Sovereign and corporate spreads
edged up (Figure 1.7, panel 2). Emerging market
banks have been tightening lending standards in the
face of rising nonperforming loans and worsening
funding conditions (Figure 1.7, panel 4). Survey
responses suggest that tightness in global funding
markets played a major role in this regard. Indicators
for loan demand are still expansionary in all major
regions (Figure 1.7, panel 5). Credit growth itself fell
off its very high pace but remains elevated in many
economies.
Financial conditions are likely to remain very
fragile over the near term because implementing a
solution to the euro area crisis will take time and the
U.S. debt ceiling and fiscal cliff raise concerns about
the U.S. recovery. Bank lending in the advanced
economies is expected to stay sluggish—much
more so in the euro area, where the periphery will

chapter 1

suffer further reductions in lending. Most emerging markets will likely experience volatile capital
flows. In economies where credit growth has already
slowed appreciably, such as China, credit is likely to
rebound further as project approvals are fast-tracked;
elsewhere, growth rates are likely to move sideways
or decline. External funding conditions are likely
to have a larger impact on credit developments in
emerging Europe than in other emerging market
economies.

Global Prospects and Policies

Figure 1.7. Emerging Market Conditions
Emerging markets suffered capital outﬂows until recently, their equity markets declined, and
their risk spreads widened somewhat. Banks are tightening credit standards in the face of
credit and asset price booms and reduced external funding. However, demand for loans
continues to expand.

Activity Is Forecast to Remain Tepid in Many
Economies
The recovery is forecast to limp along in the
major advanced economies, with growth remaining
at a fairly healthy level in many emerging market
and developing economies. Leading indicators do
not point to a significant acceleration of activity,
but financial conditions have recently improved in
response to euro area policymakers’ actions and easing by the Federal Reserve.
•• In the euro area, real GDP is projected to decline
by about ¾ percent (on an annualized basis) during the second half of 2012 (Figure 1.8, panel 2).
With diminishing fiscal withdrawal and domestic
and euro-area-wide policies supporting a further
improvement in financial conditions later in
2013, real GDP is projected to stay flat in the
first half of 2013 and expand by about 1 percent in the second half. The core economies are
expected to see low but positive growth throughout 2012–13. Most periphery economies are likely
to suffer a sharp contraction in 2012, constrained
by tight fiscal policies and financial conditions,
and to begin to recover only in 2013.
•• In the United States, real GDP is projected to
expand by about 1½ percent during the second
half of 2012, rising to 2¾ percent later in 2013
(Figure 1.8, panel 1). Weak household balance
sheets and confidence, relatively tight financial
conditions, and continued fiscal consolidation
stand in the way of stronger growth. In the very
short term, the drought will also detract from
output.
•• In Japan, the pace of growth will diminish noticeably as post-earthquake reconstruction winds down.

Real GDP growth is projected to move sideways or accelerate modestly in 2012. Activity
is expected to continue to contract during 2013 in the periphery economies of the euro
area. In emerging Asia and Latin America, the projected acceleration is mainly driven
by China and Brazil, which have been easing their macroeconomic policies in response

Real GDP is forecast to stagnate in the second half
of 2012 and grow by about 1 percent in the first
half of 2013. Thereafter, growth is expected to
accelerate further (Figure 1.8, panel 1).
Fundamentals remain strong in many economies
that have not suffered a financial crisis, notably in
many emerging market and developing economies.
In these economies, high employment growth and
solid consumption (Figure 1.3, panel 3) should continue to propel demand and, together with macroeconomic policy easing, support healthy investment
and growth. However, growth rates are not projected
to return to precrisis levels.
•• In developing Asia, real GDP is forecast to
accelerate to a 7¼ percent pace in the second
half of 2012 (Figure 1.8, panel 3). The main
driver will be China, where activity is expected
to receive a boost from accelerated approval of
public infrastructure projects. The outlook for
India is unusually uncertain: For 2012, with
weak growth in the first half and a continued
investment slowdown, real GDP growth is
projected to be 5 percent, but improvements in
external conditions and confidence––helped by a
variety of reforms announced very recently––are
projected to raise real GDP growth to about 6
percent in 2013.
•• In Latin America, real GDP growth is projected
to be about 3¼ percent for the second half of
2012. It is then expected to accelerate to 4¾
percent in the course of the second half of 2013
(Figure 1.8, panel 4). The projected acceleration is strong for Brazil because of targeted fiscal
measures aimed at boosting demand in the near
term and monetary policy easing, including policy
rate cuts equivalent to 500 basis points since
August 2011. The pace of activity elsewhere is not
forecast to pick up appreciably.
•• In the central and eastern European (CEE)
economies, improving financial conditions in the
crisis-hit economies, somewhat stronger demand
from the euro area, and the end of a boom-bust
cycle in Turkey are expected to raise growth back
to 4 percent later in 2013.
•• Growth is projected to stay above 5 percent in
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and above 4 percent in
the Commonwealth of Independent States (see

chapter 1

Table 1.1). In both regions, still-high commodity
prices and related projects are helping.
•• In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA),
activity in the oil importers will likely be held
back by continued uncertainty associated with
political and economic transition in the aftermath
of the Arab Spring and weak terms of trade—real
GDP growth is likely to slow to about 1¼ percent
in 2012 and rebound moderately in 2013. Due
largely to the recovery in Libya, the pace of overall
growth among oil exporters will rise sharply in
2012, to above 6½ percent, and then return to
about 3¾ percent in 2013.

Cyclical Indicators Point to Slack in Advanced
Economies
Cyclical indicators point to ample slack in many
advanced economies but to capacity constraints in a
number of emerging market economies (Figure 1.9).
WEO output gaps in the major advanced economies are large, varying from about 2½ percent of
GDP in the euro area and Japan to 4 percent in the
United States for 2012 (see Table A8 in the Statistical Appendix). These gaps are consistent with weak
demand due to tight financial conditions and fiscal
consolidation. By contrast, most emerging market
and developing economies that were not hit by the
crisis continue to operate above precrisis trends.
However, their potential growth rates in recent
years are judged to have been higher than indicated
by the 1996–2006 precrisis average, and therefore
WEO output gap estimates do not signal much
overheating.
Amid sharply differing developments across
advanced and emerging market and developing
economies, the world unemployment rate is estimated to remain flat during 2012–13, near 6¼ percent (Figure 1.1, panel 2). Unemployment rates have
on average declined below precrisis levels in emerging market and developing economies, but they
remain elevated in advanced economies and are not
expected to fall significantly during 2012–13.
•• In the United States, the unemployment rate
dropped from close to 10 percent in 2010 to
about 8 percent lately, where it is expected to
remain through 2013. However, a large part of

Global Prospects and Policies

the decline is due to sluggish labor force expansion through 2011. In addition, more than 40
percent of those unemployed have been out of
work for more than six months. In Europe, more
than 1 in 10 labor force participants are projected
to be unemployed through 2013; in Greece and
Spain the ratio is 1 in 4 workers. More generally,
almost half of all young labor force participants
are without jobs in the periphery of the euro area.
As in the United States, the number of long-term
unemployed has also risen starkly, increasing the
risk of hysteresis and skills atrophy.
•• In emerging market and developing economies,
the unemployment record varies widely. Rates
are very high in economies that were hit by the
crisis, such as in many of the CEE and a few CIS
economies, but relatively low in most parts of
developing Asia and Latin America. Unemployment rates are projected to remain high in the
MENA region, mainly among the oil importers.
These economies face a number of challenges,
ranging from major political changes, to social
needs related to rapidly expanding populations, to
decreased revenues from tourism—all of which are
weighing on employment prospects in the short
term.
The slowdown in global activity and ample slack
in many advanced economies have meant that
inflation has fallen (Figure 1.10, panels 1 and 2).
In advanced economies, lower commodity prices
reduced headline inflation to about 1½ percent as
of July 2012, down from more than 3 percent in
late 2011. Core inflation has been steady at about
1½ percent. In emerging market and developing
economies, headline inflation has declined by almost
2 percentage points, to slightly under 5½ percent,
in the second quarter of 2012; core inflation too has
declined, although to a lesser extent. The forecast
is for further easing of inflation pressure in the
advanced economies, with headline inflation moving
to about 1¾ percent in 2013; in emerging market
and developing economies, headline inflation is
projected to move broadly sideways.
This inflation forecast assumes broadly unchanged
commodity prices, but sharply rising food prices raise
increasing concern (see the Special Feature and Box
1.5). Thus far, price pressures do not encompass all

Figure 1.9. Overheating Indicators for the G20 Economies
Domestic overheating indicators point to ample slack in the advanced economies—most indicators ﬂash blue. By contrast, a number of yellow and red indicators for the emerging market and developing
economies point to capacity constraints. External overheating indicators ﬂash yellow or red for Japan and China—rather thanraising concerns, these are symptoms of an internal demand rebalancing
process that has helped bring down global current account imbalances. However, in China, the rebalancing is overly reliant oninvestment. In Germany, which is the world’s other major surplus economy, the
rebalancing process is lagging. The red indicators for Turkey point to external vulnerabilities.Credit indicators point to excesses in many emerging market and developingeconomies. Other ﬁnancial
indicators are mostly reassuring about overheating, except for Brazil.

Note: For each indicator, except as noted below, economies are assigned colors based on projected 2012values relative to theirprecrisis (1997–2006) average. Each indicator is scored as red = 2, yellow=
1, and blue = 0; summary scores are calculated as the sum of selected component scores divided by the maximum possible sum of those scores. Summary blocks are assigned red if thesummaryscore is
greater than or equal to 0.66, yellow if greater than or equal to 0.33 but less than 0.66, and blue if less than 0.33. When data are missing, no color is assigned. Arrows up (down) indicate hotter (colder)
conditions compared with the April 2012 WEO predicted values for 2012.

Output more than 2.5 percent above the precrisis trend is indicated by red. Output less than 2.5percent below the trend is indicated by blue. Output within ±2.5 percent from the precrisis trend is
indicated by yellow.

For the following inﬂation-targeting economies, the target inﬂation rate was used instead of the 1997–2006 average in the calculation of the inﬂation indicator: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Korea,
Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom. For the non-inﬂation-targeting economies, red was assigned if inﬂation is approximately 10 percent or higher, yellow if inﬂation is approximately 5 to 9
percent, and blue if inﬂation is less than 5 percent.

Arrows in the ﬁscal balance column represent the forecast change in the structural balance as apercent of GDP over the period 2011–12. An improvement of more than 0.5 percent of GDP is indicatedby
an up arrow; a deterioration of more than 0.5 percent of GDP is indicated by a down arrow.

Real policy interest rates below zero are identiﬁed by a down arrow; real interest rates above 3 percent are identiﬁed by an up arrow. Real policy interest rates are deﬂated by two-year-ahead inﬂation
projections.

Calculations are based on Argentina’s ofﬁcial GDP data. The IMF has called on Argentina to adopt remedial measures to address the quality of the ofﬁcial GDP data. The IMF staff is also using alternative
measures of GDP growth for macroeconomic surveillance, including data produced by private analysts, which have shown signiﬁcantly lower real GDP growth than the ofﬁcial datasince 2008. The IMF
staff’s estimate of average provincial inﬂation is used as a measure of inﬂation and to deﬂate nominal variables.

major food crops, unlike in 2007–08. As discussed
further below, monetary policy should not react to
food-price-driven increases in headline inflation unless
there are significant risks for second-round effects on
wages. Governments may need to scale up targeted
social safety net measures and implement other fiscal
measures (such as reducing food taxes) where there is
fiscal space to do so. Also, countries should avoid any
restrictions on exports, which would exacerbate price
increases and supply disruptions. Over the longer
term, broader policy reforms are necessary to reduce
global food price volatility.

Figure 1.10. Global Inﬂation

(Twelve-month change in the consumer price index unless noted otherwise)
Headline inﬂation has declined everywhere, helped by lower commodity prices. In the
emerging market and developing economies, core inﬂation has declined too. In advanced
economies, it has remained stable around 1½ percent. House price developments
increasingly diverge across economies. In various smaller advanced and a number of
emerging market and developing economies, upward pressure remains, notwithstanding
already high prices.

The WEO’s standard fan chart suggests that
uncertainty about the outlook has increased markedly (Figure 1.11, panel 1).1 The WEO growth
forecast is now 3.3 and 3.6 percent for 2012 and

The Outlook Has Become More Uncertain
Risks to the WEO forecast have risen appreciably
and now appear more elevated than in the April
2012 and September 2011 WEO reports, whose
policy assumptions and hence growth projections
for advanced economies proved overly optimistic. Although standard risk metrics suggest that
downside risks are much higher now than only a
few months ago, upside risks appear higher too,
although to a lesser extent. This may be a reflection
of the fact that many market participants have a
bimodal view of global prospects: the recovery could
be set back if European and U.S. policymakers fail
to live up to expectations, but it could also be stronger if they deliver on their commitments. The most
pertinent near-term risks––escalation of the euro
area crisis and fiscal policy failures in the United
States––are quantified and discussed with the help of
scenarios. In addition, this section considers a variety
of medium- and long-term risks and scenarios.

April 2012. The probability of global growth falling
below 2 percent in 2013––which would be consistent with recession in advanced economies and a
serious slowdown in emerging market and developing economies––has risen to about 17 percent, up
from about 4 percent in April 2012 and 10 percent
(for the one-year-ahead forecast) during the very
uncertain setting of the September 2011 WEO.
The IMF staff’s Global Projection Model (GPM)
uses an entirely different methodology to gauge risk
but confirms that risks for recession in advanced
economies (entailing a serious slowdown in emerging market and developing economies) are alarmingly high (Figure 1.12, panel 1). For 2013, the
GPM estimates suggest that recession probabilities
are about 15 percent in the United States, above 25
percent in Japan, and above 80 percent in the euro
area.

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

Risk Scenarios for the Short Term
As emphasized, immediate risks relate to the
assumptions about the sovereign debt crisis in the
euro area and about the U.S. budget, both of which
could negatively affect growth prospects. Furthermore, oil prices could again provide a shock.
A further deepening of the euro area crisis
The euro area crisis could reintensify again. The
OMT program will reduce risks from self-fulfilling
market doubts related to the viability of the Economic
and Monetary Union (EMU) most effectively if it is
implemented decisively. However, serious risks remain
outside this safety net—posed, for example, by rising
social tensions and adjustment fatigue that raise doubts
about adjustment in the periphery or by doubts about
the commitment of others to more integration.
The downside scenario developed here uses the
IMF staff’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal
Model (GIMF) to consider the implications of an
intensification of euro area sovereign and banking stress. Unlike in the WEO forecast and GFSR
baseline scenario, European policymakers in this
scenario do not strengthen their policies, as discussed in further detail in the weak policies scenario
in the October 2012 GFSR. In this scenario, the
forces of financial fragmentation increase and

chapter 1

become entrenched, capital holes in banking systems
expand, and the intra-euro-area capital account crisis
increasingly spills outward. Within the GIMF, this
scenario features the following shocks relative to the
WEO forecast (Figure 1.13): lower credit, mainly in
the periphery; higher sovereign risk premiums for
the periphery; modestly lower premiums for the core
sovereigns, which benefit from a flight to safety; an
even larger fiscal consolidation in the periphery; and
increases in corporate risk premiums for all (including non-European) advanced and emerging market
economies. Capital flight from the euro area and
emerging markets is assumed to benefit the United
States, and its sovereign risk premium falls. Monetary policy is constrained at the zero interest rate
floor in the advanced economies, and the assumption is that they do not proceed with additional
unconventional easing. Emerging market economies,
by contrast, are assumed to ease as growth and inflation fall, which considerably reduces the impact of
the external shock on their economies.
In this scenario, output in the euro area core
would fall by about 1¾ percent relative to the WEO
projections within one year; in the periphery, the
decline would be about 6 percent. Output losses in
non-European economies would be about 1 to 1½
percent. Chapter 2 provides further details for the
various regions.

Figure 1.12. Recessions and Deﬂation Risks
Risks for a prolonged recession and for sustained deﬂation are elevated in the euro area,
notably in periphery economies. The risk of deﬂation continues to be a problem in Japan.
In other areas, the risks are minimal.

Stronger-than-expected euro area policies
This second GIMF scenario assumes that national
policymakers follow up the latest ECB actions with a
more proactive approach toward domestic adjustment
and EMU reforms. The details are discussed in the
complete policies scenario in the October 2012 GFSR.
This scenario requires regaining credibility through
an unflinching commitment to implementing already
agreed plans. Policymakers need to build political
support for the necessary pooling of sovereignty that
a more complete currency union entails. It envisages
that they quickly introduce a road map for banking union and fiscal integration and deliver a major
down payment. Examples of possible action include
implementation of a bank resolution mechanism
with common backstops or a pan-European deposit
insurance guarantee plan (for both, concrete proposals still need to be spelled out) and concrete measures

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

Figure 1.13. Upside and Downside Scenarios

(Percent or percentage point deviation from WEO baseline)
The Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF) is used to consider a scenario in
which policy is initially unable to prevent the intensiﬁcation of euro area sovereign and
banking stress as well as a scenario in which policy action quickly alleviates the current
level of stress. The model contains two blocks of euro area countries, those with acute ﬁscal
sustainability issues (referred to as “periphery”) and those with less acute ﬁscal
sustainability issues (referred to as “core”).
The intensiﬁcation-of-stress scenario (red bars) assumes that policymakers delay taking
sufﬁcient action to prevent a sharp intensiﬁcation of ﬁnancial stress. Consequently,
deleveraging by euro area banks leads to a sharp credit contraction in periphery countries
but milder contraction elsewhere. Credit in periphery countries falls €475 billion below the
WEO baseline in 2013, while that in the core countries falls by €50 billion. Concerns about
ﬁscal sustainability raise periphery sovereign spreads 350 basis points in 2013; however,
subsequent policy action results in spreads falling thereafter and returning fully to baseline
by 2016. The core countries’ sovereign risk premium is assumed to decline by 50 basis
points in 2013 as a ﬂight to quality within the euro area occurs. Sovereigns in the periphery
are forced into more front-loaded ﬁscal consolidation, averaging an additional 2 percentage
points of GDP in 2013. Risk concerns are also assumed to spill over to all other regions, with
corporate risk premiums rising by 50 basis points in advanced economies and 150 basis
points in emerging market and developing economies in 2013. The capital ﬂight is assumed
to beneﬁt the U.S. sovereign, with the risk premium falling by 50 basis points in 2013.
Monetary policy is constrained at the zero interest rate ﬂoor in the G3 countries (euro area,
Japan, United States), whereas elsewhere monetary policy eases to help offset the impact
on market interest rates of rising risk premiums.
In the scenario in which policy is able to alleviate the stress (blue bars), credit in the euro
area expands relative to the baseline and sovereign spreads decline. In the periphery
countries, credit expands by roughly €225 billion relative to the baseline, and sovereign
spreads decline by roughly 200 basis points in 2013. In other advanced economies,
corporate spreads fall by 50 basis points in 2013, and in emerging markets, the decline is
100 basis points.

toward fiscal integration. Under this scenario (Figure
1.13), the euro area begins to reintegrate as policy
credibility is restored and capital flight reverses.
Relative to the WEO forecast and the GFSR baseline
scenario, credit expands by roughly €225 billion and
sovereign spreads decline by about 200 basis points
in 2013 in the periphery of the euro area. Economic
growth resumes in the periphery and picks up in
the core. In other advanced economies, corporate
spreads fall by 50 basis points; in emerging market
economies, by 100 basis points. Output would then
be roughly ½ to 1 percent higher within one year in
most other parts of the world.
The U.S. debt ceiling and fiscal cliff
The U.S. fiscal cliff could entail significantly more
fiscal tightening (by about 3 percent of GDP) than
assumed in the WEO projections. A recent Spillover
Report (IMF, 2012e) finds that if this risk materializes and the sharp fiscal contraction is sustained, the
U.S. economy could fall into a full-fledged recession.
The global spillovers would be amplified through
negative confidence effects, including, for example,
a global drop in stock prices. The impact of hitting
the debt ceiling is more difficult to model. Political delays before the previous deadline, in summer
2011, led credit rating agencies to downgrade the
United States, and major market turmoil ensued.
At this stage, markets appear to consider the fiscal
cliff a tail risk, given that Congress has in the past
eventually reached a compromise to resolve similar
high-stakes situations. However, this implies that,
should this risk actually materialize, there would be
a great shock to confidence that would quickly spill
over to financial markets in the rest of the world.
Notice that risks for a sudden fiscal withdrawal are
also present in Japan: however, if they materialize,
they will probably have spillovers that are not as
large as those from the U.S. fiscal cliff.

A renewed spike in oil prices
If either the euro area or U.S. downside scenario were to materialize, oil prices would likely fall
substantially. But there is also an important risk that
intensified geopolitical tensions could boost oil prices.
The April 2012 WEO included a scenario featuring
oil supply disruptions that showed that a 50 percent

chapter 1

increase in oil prices due to less supply would lead to
a 1 to 1½ percent decline in output in many parts of
the world. The latest distribution of options prices for
oil––which is skewed to the upside, implying a downside skew for the distribution of global growth––suggests that this scenario remains relevant for the global
economy (Figure 1.11, panel 2).

Risk Scenarios for the Medium Term
A large number of risks and scenarios can be
envisaged for the medium term. This section focuses
on two specific risk scenarios and one general risk
scenario that appear pertinent for policymakers at
this juncture. The specific risk scenarios relate to
large central bank balance sheets and high public
debt––they are directly relevant for monetary and
fiscal policy in the advanced economies. The general
risk scenario is for globally lower growth over the
medium term. This is akin to the experience following the shocks of the 1970s, but this time rooted
in other shocks and policy failures—and, for the
advanced economies, similar to the experience of
Japan after the mid-1990s.
Risks related to swollen central bank balance
sheets
The concern is that the vast acquisition of assets
by central banks will ultimately mean a rise in the
money supply and thus inflation (Figure 1.5, panel
3). However, as discussed in previous WEO reports,
no technical reason indicates this would be inevitable.
Central banks have more than enough tools to absorb
the liquidity they create, including selling the assets
they have bought, reverting to traditionally short
maturities for refinancing, raising their deposit rates,
and selling their own paper. Furthermore, in principle, central bank losses do not matter: their creditors
are currency holders and reserve-holding banks; neither can demand to be paid with some other form of
money.2 The reality, however, may well be different. A
national legislature may see such losses as a symptom
that the central bank is operating outside its mandate,
2Central

bank capital is, in many ways, an arbitrary number, as
is well illustrated by the large balance sheets of central banks that
intervene in foreign exchange markets (Figure 1.5, panel 4).

Global Prospects and Policies

which could be of concern if it led to efforts to limit
the central bank’s operational independence. A related
concern is that economic agents may begin to doubt
the capacity of central banks to fight inflation. Two
scenarios come to mind:
•• Public deficits and debt may run out of control,
causing governments to lean on central banks to
pursue more expansionary policies with a view to
eroding the real value of the debt via inflation.
Similarly, losses on holdings of euro area, Japanese, and U.S. (G3) government securities may
cause emerging market economies’ central banks
or sovereign wealth funds to buy fewer G3 government assets, investing instead in better opportunities at home and triggering large depreciations
of G3 currencies.
•• Policymakers may falsely perceive central bank balance sheet losses to be damaging to their economies.
Such perceptions may make central banks more hesitant to raise interest rates, because doing so would
decrease the market value of their asset holdings. The
mere appearance of such hesitation may lead private
agents to expect an increase in inflation.
Risks related to high public debt levels
Public debt has reached very high levels, and
if past experience is any guide, it will take many
years to appreciably reduce it (see Chapter 3). Risks
related to public debt have several aspects. First,
when global output is at or above potential, high
public debt may raise global real interest rates,
crowding out capital and lowering output in the
long term.3 Second, the cost of debt service may lead
to tax increases or cutbacks in infrastructure investment that lower supply. Third, high public debt in
individual countries may raise their sovereign risk
premiums, with a variety of consequences—from
limited scope for countercyclical fiscal policies (as
evidenced by the current problems in the euro area
periphery) to high inflation or outright default in
the case of very large increases in risk premiums.
Simulations with the GIMF suggest that an
increase in public debt in the G3 economies of

of the literature and Kumar and Woo (2010) for some recent
evidence.

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

about 40 percentage points of GDP raises real interest rates almost 40 basis points in the long term
(Box 1.2). This simulation and discussion necessarily
abstracts from the potential long-term benefits of
fiscal stimulus. The 2009 stimulus, for example, was
likely instrumental in averting a potential deflationary spiral and protracted period of exceedingly high
unemployment, macroeconomic conditions that
general equilibrium models such as the GIMF are
not well suited to capture. Bearing this in mind, the
simulation suggests that in the long term the higher
debt lowers real GDP by about ¾ percent relative to
a baseline without any increase in public debt. This
is because of the direct effect of higher interest rates
on investment and the indirect effect via higher taxes
or lower government investment. The GIMF simulations indicate that within the G3 the negative effects
would be larger, with output 1 percent below baseline projections. The loss of output over the medium
term would be even larger if, for example, savings
were to drop more than expected because of aging
populations in the advanced economies or if the
consumption patterns of emerging market economies with very high saving rates align more quickly
than expected with those of advanced economies.
Scenarios that involve very high levels of debt and
high real interest rates may not only result in lower
growth but may also involve a higher risk of default
when fiscal dynamics are perceived to be unstable. This
combination of high debt and high real interest rates
can lead to bad equilibriums, when doubt about the
sustainability of fiscal positions drives interest rates to
unsustainable levels.
Disappointing potential output and growing risk
aversion
Looking beyond the near term, a concern is that
output growth may disappoint in both advanced and
emerging market economies, albeit for different reasons, and will precipitate a general flight to safety. As
noted, growth outcomes have already disappointed
repeatedly, including relative to the September 2011
and April 2012 WEO projections. These disappointments could be symptomatic of medium-term
problems.
•• In advanced economies that suffered from the
financial crisis, prospects for employment remain
18

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

dim, and many workers may ultimately drop out
of the labor force. Banks are in the middle of an
arduous process of lowering their leverage and
strengthening their funding models. High public
debt and, for some economies, external liabilities
could mean new bouts of instability and generally low growth. Projections for these economies
already incorporate marked-down estimates for
potential output relative to precrisis trends, typically by 10 percent or more (Figure 1.14, panel 1).
However, output could be lower still over the
medium term.
•• In response to forecast errors and policy changes,
estimates for the medium-term output levels of
emerging market economies have been marked
down (relative to September 2011 estimates)—by
about 3 percent for Brazil, 5 percent for China,
and 10 percent for India, for example—and there
may be more to come (Figure 1.14, panel 4). The
April 2012 WEO already featured a downside
scenario with weaker potential output in emerging Asian economies. Given recent disappointments elsewhere, this scenario is broadened to
other emerging market economies. In fact, many
emerging Asian and Latin American economies
have seen growth above the 10-year precrisis
average, and the IMF staff sees further scope for
such high growth, as evidenced by WEO output
gap estimates that point to slack (Figure 1.14,
panel 1). The findings of Chapter 4 justify this
optimism to some extent: there are indications of
growing resilience on the part of emerging market
and developing economies, mainly reflecting
stronger policies. However, the chapter’s findings
suggest that less frequent adverse funding and
terms-of-trade shocks have also played a role in
these economies’ recent strong performance, and
the frequency of such shocks could increase again.
Moreover, strong credit growth, which likely supported demand, cannot continue at the present
pace without raising concerns about financial
stability in many of these economies (Figure 1.14,
panels 2 and 3). In short, there may be less cyclical slack and scope to grow over the medium term
than suggested by IMF staff projections.
The scenario used to model lower potential
output and the global macroeconomic implications

chapter 1

is the IMF staff’s Global Economy Model. Figure
1.15 shows the impact of downward revisions to
medium-term output growth by about ½ percent in
the United States, the euro area, and Latin America
and by about 1 percent in Asia. Along the transition
path to lower equilibrium output is a flight into the
most liquid and safest assets—mainly cash—because
of growing concern about prospects, and private
and public risk premiums increase temporarily. In
this scenario, global growth for 2013–16 is only
about 2 to 3 percent, or 1½ to 2 percentage points
below the baseline WEO forecast. The euro area and
Japan would experience several years of stagnation or
recession, whereas the United States would see positive but very modest growth. Eventually, advanced
economies have some scope to ease monetary policy
as the zero bound no longer binds, which helps
support growth toward the very end of the WEO
horizon and bring inflation back toward the baseline. Growth in emerging Asia would be closer to
5 to 6 percent, rather than 7 to 8 percent; in Latin
America, it would be about 2½ percent rather than
4 percent as weaker global growth translates into
significantly weaker demand for commodities. The
price of oil falls by roughly 30 percent after three
years, with prices for non-oil commodities falling
by roughly 20 percent. These drops, in turn, lower
growth in Africa and the Middle East. Developments in the real world could easily be much worse
than the model suggests. The reason is that the
model does not consider the social and political
ramifications of rising unemployment; nor can it do
justice to the adverse feedback loops between activity, banks, and sovereigns that can be triggered by
unusually large shocks.

Global Prospects and Policies

Figure 1.14. Output in Emerging Market and Developing
Economies
Output in emerging market and developing economies in Asia and Latin America is above
precrisis trends, but WEO output gap estimates still see some slack. Amid disappointment
relative to output projections, estimates for medium-term output have been lowered. For
China and India, the reduction amounts to 5 to 10 percentage points by 2016; for all emerging
market and developing economies, the reduction amounts to about 3½ percentage points.
Buoyant activity in many emerging market and developing economies has been driven partly
by better policies and partly by high credit growth and favorable terms-of-trade shocks. In
many economies, the high credit growth will be difﬁcult to sustain at present rates without
weakening bank balance sheets. Also, future improvements in the terms of trade may be
more limited. Thus, there are risks that medium-term output could surprise further on the
downside.

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

Figure 1.15. Lower Global Growth Scenario

(Percent or percentage point deviation from baseline)
This scenario uses the IMF’s Global Economy Model to trace the global macroeconomic
implications of slower potential growth and temporarily higher risk premiums. For the
United States and the euro area, this scenario assumes that annual potential output growth
is ½ percentage point below baseline over the WEO horizon, whereas for Japan, growth is ¼
percentage point below baseline. In emerging Asia, potential growth is assumed to be 1
percentage point lower than baseline. For Latin American and all remaining countries,it is
assumed that potential growth is ½ percentage point below baseline. It takes until mid-2015
before it becomes clear that potential growth will be lower until end-2017. For advanced
economies, this raises debt-sustainability concerns, and sovereign risk premiums rise by
50 basis points by 2016 before gradually returning to baseline. As sovereign risk premiums
rise, advanced economies gradually tighten ﬁscal policy. The ﬁscal balance improves by 1
percent of GDP by 2016, and then gradually returns to baseline once the debt-to-GDP ratio
declines and risk premiums moderate. In emerging market and developing economies,
lower growth prospects raise concerns about the viability of some private investment, and
corporate risk premiums rise, particularly in the tradable sector. In this sector, corporate
risk premiums peak roughly 200 basis points above baseline in 2016 in emerging Asia and
about 150 basis points above baseline in Latin America. In the G3 (euro area, Japan, United
States), monetary policy is constrained by the zero bound on nominal policy interest rates.
For the ﬁrst few years, interest rates cannot ease at all relative to the baseline, and beyond
that, there is only limited scope for easing.
GDP growth in all regions is well below the WEO baseline between 2013 and 2016,with
global growth roughly 2 percentage points lower in 2015. Eventually, advanced economies
have scope to ease monetary policy, which helps support growth toward the end of the WEO
horizon and bring inﬂation back toward the baseline. Lower global growth translates into
weaker demand for commodities, and the price of oil falls by roughly 30 percent after three
years, with non-oil commodities falling by roughly 20 percent.

A basic challenge for policymakers is thus to move
away from an incremental approach to policymaking
and address the many downside risks to global activity with strong medium-term fiscal and structural
reform programs in order to rebuild confidence.
In the euro area, action is also needed to address
the current crisis and, over the medium term, to
complete the EMU. Only after substantial progress
is made on these various fronts will confidence and
demand strengthen durably in the major advanced
economies. Investors will be reassured that public
debt is a safe investment and that advanced economy
central banks have scope to use monetary policy to
maintain low inflation and forestall renewed bouts
of financial instability. Policymakers in emerging
market and developing economies will need to balance two priorities: rebuilding policy buffers so as to
maintain hard-won increases in the resilience of their
economies to shocks and supporting domestic activity in response to growing downside risks to external
demand.

Addressing the Euro Area Crisis
Despite policy progress, the euro area crisis has
deepened. Unless recent ECB actions are followed
up with more proactive policies by others, the
WEO forecast and GFSR baseline scenario may
once again prove overly optimistic and the euro
area could slide into the weak policies scenario,
with deleterious consequences for the rest of
the world.
Ensuring market confidence in the viability of the
EMU will require robust action on multiple fronts.
Sovereigns under stress must continue to adjust, and
support for these countries and their banks needs to
be provided via the EFSF and the ESM to relieve
funding pressures and break the adverse feedback
loops between sovereigns and banks. Meanwhile, the
ECB’s commitment to act on secondary markets via
the OMT program is very important to address elevated risk premiums due to convertibility concerns,
and monetary policy should be very accommodative to support demand. Anticrisis measures must
be anchored by the vision of—as well as reasonably
fast and tangible progress toward—a more complete
monetary union.

chapter 1

•• EU partners should support countries making
adequate adjustment efforts but still subject to
market pressure. While economies in the periphery must continue to adjust their fiscal balances at
a pace they can bear, it is essential to ensure their
access to funding at reasonable cost. Common
resources can be channeled via the EFSF or the
ESM—and countries in need should request those
resources, with the goal of preserving or regaining
market access.
•• Direct equity injections into banks are key to
cutting bank-sovereign loops in the near term.
For this to happen, the ESM needs to be made
operational as soon as possible, and a single
supervisory mechanism—a precondition for the
ESM to take a stake in banks—should be established quickly, following up on the European
Commission’s proposals to that effect. Viable
banks should be recapitalized, but those that are
nonviable should be resolved, in part to minimize fiscal costs.
•• An integrated regulatory and supervisory structure—a banking union—is indispensable for
the smooth functioning of integrated financial
markets in the EMU. Such a union should rest
on four pillars: common supervision, harmonized
regulation, a pan-European deposit guarantee
scheme, and a pan-European resolution mechanism with common backstops. The last two building blocks are critical, and proposals for them still
need to be spelled out.
Fiscal integration would provide critical tools to
support a banking union, improve fiscal discipline,
and enhance adjustment to idiosyncratic shocks
while preventing them from becoming systemic.
The immediate priority is to establish a common
fiscal backstop for a banking union anchored on a
single supervisory mechanism. More generally, fiscal
risk sharing is an integral component of common
currency areas. However, mutual support needs to
be complemented by stricter and more robustly
enforced rules and greater coordination of national
policies—including through swift approval and sensible implementation of the Fiscal Compact (at the
country level). There are different ways to achieve ex
ante risk sharing, but all approaches would benefit
from a clear road map.

Global Prospects and Policies

Rebuilding Room for Fiscal Policy Maneuvering
Fiscal adjustment has become necessary in many
cases to strengthen confidence in sovereign balance
sheets and in many other cases because the prospects
for future potential output—and hence revenue
growth—are substantially less promising than they
were before 2008. Unless governments spell out
how they intend to effect the necessary adjustment
over the medium term, a cloud of uncertainty will
continue to hang over the international economy,
with downside risks for output and employment in
the short term.
Fiscal adjustment should be gradual and sustained, where possible, supported by structural
changes, as, inevitably, it weighs on weak demand.
Developments suggest that short-term fiscal multipliers may have been larger than expected at the
time of fiscal planning (Box 1.1). Research reported
in previous issues of the WEO finds that fiscal
multipliers have been close to 1 in a world in which
many countries adjust together; the analysis here
suggests that multipliers may recently have been
larger than 1 (Box 1.1).4 There are other reasons
for avoiding abrupt adjustments: fiscal problems
can be rooted in structural problems that take time
to address, and sharp expenditure cutbacks or tax
increases can set off vicious cycles of falling activity
and rising debt ratios, ultimately undercutting political support for adjustment. The historical record
for public debt reduction suggests that a gradual,
sustained approach supported by structural changes
offers the best chance for success within today’s
constraints (Chapter 3).
To build credibility, governments should commit
to measures and medium-term targets that are actually under their control. They must clearly explain
how they will react to such setbacks as unexpected
slowdowns in activity or increases in funding costs.
Except in economies facing acute financing constraints, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to
operate freely. Budget forecasts must be based on
realistic assumptions about the negative short-term
impact of adjustment on output and employment.
Similarly, projections for the evolution of debt
4See for example, chapter 3 of the October 2010 World Economic Outlook.

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

21

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

ratios should be based on realistic, not optimistic,
assumptions about the growth of potential output
and interest rates. In short, fiscal policy must be
transparent, realistic, and predictable, and although
geared toward medium-term objectives, it should
be a stabilizing factor against short-term downturns
or booms. Clear analogies can be drawn with the
practice of successful monetary policy.
Among the advanced economies, planned fiscal
adjustment is sizable over the near term. The main
policy shortfalls, discussed in more detail in the
October 2012 Fiscal Monitor, relate to the need for
stronger commitment to a sound fiscal framework:
•• To anchor market expectations, policymakers need
to specify adequately detailed medium-term plans
for lowering debt ratios, which must be backed by
binding legislation or fiscal frameworks. Among
large advanced economies, the United States lacks
such a plan, and Japan’s medium-term plan needs
to be strengthened, notwithstanding the welcome
legislative passage of the doubling of the consumption tax. U.S. authorities must now urgently
deal with the debt ceiling and the fiscal cliff,
which would severely affect growth in the short
term; the Japanese authorities also need to quickly
approve funding for this year’s budget.
•• Countries should go much further in reducing the
growth of aging-related expenditures—an issue that
they cannot avoid forever—because such reductions
can greatly improve debt dynamics without detracting severely from demand in the short term.
•• More countries need to define targets in structural
or cyclically adjusted terms and prepare contingency plans for coping with shocks. The first
line of defense against shocks should be automatic stabilizers and monetary policy, including
unconventional support and measures to improve
the transmission of already low policy rates to
demand. But these efforts might not suffice.
Should growth fall significantly short of WEO
projections, countries with room to maneuver
should smooth their planned adjustment over
2013 and beyond.
•• Emerging market and developing economies
typically have much lower public debt than do
advanced economies and therefore less urgent
need for fiscal adjustment, but they still should
22

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

rebuild room for policy maneuvering. Deficits
are appreciably larger than before 2008, even in
countries that were not hit by the crisis. These
countries have typically experienced a relatively
quick recovery and are operating above precrisis
trends. Therefore, now is an appropriate time for
them to adopt fiscal consolidation to fully restore
their flexibility to deal with unexpected adverse
contingencies. They should leave the task of
supporting demand in response to greater-thanexpected external weakness to monetary policy.
Among the major emerging market economies,
more effort is needed in India, Russia, and, over the
medium term, Turkey. China, also slowing, is different for two reasons: first, the authorities are trying
to rebalance economic growth toward consumption, which will require expanding social support
programs, and second, less scope is available for
credit growth because the economy is still digesting
a large expansion of credit released in response to the
Great Recession. Similarly, the major oil exporters
are also increasing spending to address social challenges, which is helping to rebalance global demand.
Over the medium term, however, these economies
will need to bring spending growth down to more
sustainable levels.

Supporting Adjustment with Liquidity
In many advanced economies, ample liquidity
provision continues to be essential given the weakness of demand and the very protracted implementation periods for fiscal, financial, and structural
adjustment. Prudential authorities must ensure that
they control the risks that may be created by the
extended period of low yields and exceptionally easy
access to central bank funding. Easy credit provides
incentives for excessive risk taking and also gives
banks easy options for postponing desirable restructuring. Over time, very low interest rates may distort
the efficient investment of savings, which is an
underlying function of the financial system. Credible medium-term fiscal adjustment programs and
banking system restructuring are extremely valuable
supports to the monetary policy objective of keeping
inflation expectations firmly anchored at a low rate
while maintaining financial stability.

chapter 1

A widespread concern is that monetary stimulus is
not reaching all markets evenly. Households and small
companies struggle to obtain bank loans, whereas
large corporations are paying record low rates in bond
markets. In the euro area, bank lending is slumping in
the periphery but still growing in Germany. Changes
in borrower risk premiums in response to changes in
economic conditions and tighter bank lending policies
in response to strained capital and funding are playing
important roles. However, large differences in financing conditions do not mean that monetary policy is
not working. The actions taken by central banks have
forestalled worse outcomes. In some euro area economies, such as France and Italy, credit has thus far
fared better during the current recovery than during
the post-1993 recovery, despite a much larger drop in
output (Figure 1.16, panels 3–6). The same holds in
comparison with U.S. credit after 1989 (Figure 1.16,
panels 1 and 2). More generally, liquidity provision
has prevented a collapse of the banking systems in the
periphery economies.
Specific monetary policy requirements vary across
economies. In many advanced economies, the stance
should remain very accommodative, given that inflation expectations are well anchored, headline and
core inflation are receding, and activity is typically
well below potential. Policymakers should continue
to help reduce risk premiums and improve the
transmission of monetary policy to the real economy, with direct interventions in key asset markets
or with measures to strengthen banks’ incentives
to lend, such as the Bank of England’s FLS. The
specific policy requirements for the major economies
are the following:
•• The Federal Reserve has recently adopted strong
measures to ease monetary and financial conditions, consistent with high unemployment and
headline inflation that is projected to drop below
2 percent. The traction of these and previous unconventional measures would be greatly
enhanced if more progress were made in mortgage
debt relief for overly burdened households and in
the reform of the housing market.
•• In the euro area, underlying inflation pressure
is low––core inflation has been running about
1½ percent for some time, with tax and administrative price hikes contributing about ¼ to ½

Figure 1.16. Crisis Comparisons
(Index; years from crisis on x-axis)

Credit appears to be doing better after the Great Recession than after previous recessions
associated with credit crises. For example, domestic credit in the United States has held up
better than after 1989, notwithstanding a much sharper drop in output. The same holds for
credit in France and Italy when compared with the European exchange rate mechanism
(ERM) crisis, although real credit is now falling in Italy. In Spain, credit is doing less well,
consistent with a larger drop in output. Overall, these output and credit developments
suggest that low policy rates and unconventional measures have, thus far, helped
avert a much deeper credit crunch. However, more action is needed to sustain and
improve credit, especially in the euro area periphery.

percentage point. Headline inflation is forecast to
decline to about 1½ percent during the course of
2013, and risks from domestic wages and profits
are to the downside––the IMF staff ’s Global
Projection Model suggests that the probability of
falling prices is unusually high, reaching almost
25 percent (Figure 1.12, panel 2). This projection gives the ECB ample justification for keeping
policy rates very low or cutting them further.
•• In Japan, inflation is forecast to remain near zero
in 2012 and 2013. The easing of monetary policy
announced in September is welcome and should
help support economic growth and an exit from
deflation. However, further easing of monetary
policy may be needed to accelerate achievement
of the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ’s) inflation goal of 1
percent, supported by enhanced communication
of the policy stance and framework. Any further
easing by the BoJ could include purchasing Japanese government bonds with longer maturities, as
well as selected private paper.
Among emerging market and developing economies, policy requirements differ, but many can afford
to wait and see or to ease policy further because of
downside risks to activity. Headline and core inflation
are generally declining. The main reason for caution is
that although credit growth rates have recently come
down, they remain at fairly elevated levels (Figure
1.14, panels 2 and 3). Supervisory and macroprudential measures should be employed to counter any
emerging credit bubbles, such as in real estate.
•• In emerging Asia, headline and core inflation rates
have been low or declining. In many economies,
inflation is forecast to be close to 3 percent over
the medium term. Credit has expanded rapidly
in a number of these economies (China, India)
and is still expanding quickly in some (Indonesia
and, to a lesser extent, Malaysia); several have
also seen booming real estate prices. Various
economies’ currencies are undervalued relative to
medium-term fundamentals (China, Malaysia,
Thailand). Considering this credit and exchange
rate picture, these countries should wait and see
or consider modest further easing of monetary
policy stances and rely mainly on fiscal policy
to support demand. Those with less fiscal space
could proceed to more monetary easing, provided
24

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

macroprudential measures keep credit growth in
check. Those with high inflation (India, Vietnam)
cannot afford to loosen monetary policy unless
they slow down domestic demand with more fiscal adjustment.
•• In Latin America, many economies are forecast
to operate with inflation near or below 5 percent
in 2013, which is appreciably less than in 2011.
High credit growth rates bear watching. Considering the downside risks to the global growth
outlook, many central banks can afford to hold
steady; if these risks materialize, they can reduce
policy rates. High or rising real estate prices or
growing household debt burdens, notably in
Brazil, call for continued vigilence by policymakers. Central banks in economies with relatively
high inflation (Argentina, Venezuela) will need to
tighten further.
•• Inflation rates are low or forecast to decline
noticeably in many emerging European economies, typically to about 3 percent. There is
therefore room for easing in various economies
in response to very high unemployment rates and
sluggish activity. Much higher and more volatile
inflation in the CIS stands in the way of lower
policy rates. The same holds for a number of
economies in the MENA region and SSA.
Sharp increases in food prices present significant
challenges for policymakers on many fronts (see the
Special Feature). Regarding monetary policy, the
concern is that the heavy weight of food in the consumption baskets of poorer households could trigger
a push for higher wages and thus second-round
effects on inflation. In this setting, monetary policymakers need to communicate that they will tighten
policy if threats of second-round effects build. Until
they do, however, central banks should not react
to food prices, which would destabilize output and
inflation over the medium term.5

Advancing Global Demand Rebalancing
The slowdown in global trade and activity has
been accompanied by a marked narrowing of global

chapter 1

imbalances, and this is projected to persist (Figure
1.17, panel 1).6 As discussed in the April 2012
WEO and a recent IMF Pilot External Sector Report
(IMF, 2012d), most of this narrowing reflects weaker
domestic demand from crisis-stricken, externaldeficit economies rather than stronger demand from
external-surplus economies. But healthier adjustments have taken place—improvements in fiscal
balances in external-deficit economies, resilient
domestic demand in China, and more social spending by oil exporters—which are bringing down their
large surpluses.
In the euro area, imbalances have narrowed but
mainly because of lower demand in the deficit economies of the periphery; labor costs have adjusted
relative to the core but this process has much further
to go (Figure 1.18, panels 1–3). Adjustments in
surplus economies toward stronger, domesticdemand-driven growth are at an early stage. External
indicators for Germany, the main surplus country,
suggest that its internal demand rebalancing process
is less advanced than that of Japan or China (see
Figure 1.9). Furthermore, major adjustment is still
needed in the deficit economies, notably Greece and
Portugal, to reduce their net foreign liabilities to 35
percent of GDP, the indicative guideline under the
European Commission’s Macroeconomic Imbalance
Procedure (Figure 1.18, panel 4).
Despite recent improvements, global imbalances
and the associated vulnerabilities are likely to remain
well above desirable levels unless governments take
additional, decisive action (IMF, 2012d). The current
account positions of the G3 economies are all estimated to be weaker and their real effective exchange
rates stronger than desirable because of unduly large
fiscal deficits (Figure 1.17, panel 3). By contrast, in
many Asian economies, including China, Korea,
Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, current account
positions are stronger and currencies weaker than they
would be with a more desirable set of policies. Several
of these economies have accumulated very high
levels of official reserves or have internal distortions
that hold back consumption (Figure 1.17, panel 4).
Among the large economies of the euro area, policies

Global Prospects and Policies

Figure 1.17. Global Imbalances
Global current account balances narrowed sharply during the Great Recession and are not
projected to widen again, except for the contribution of emerging Asia. Exchange rate
developments since the onset of the crisis have been consistent with global demand
rebalancing. However, the appreciation of external surplus currencies has stopped during the
past eight months. IMF staff assessments suggest that current account balances remain
larger than desirable in emerging Asia and weaker elsewhere. Sustained accumulation of
international reserves in these economies is contributing to global current account
imbalances and associated vulnerabilities that are larger than desirable.

Figure 1.18. Euro Area Imbalances
Current account imbalances have also narrowed within the euro area, reﬂecting mainly a
collapse of demand in the deﬁcit economies in the periphery rather than stronger demand in
surplus economies, such as Germany and the Netherlands. Since the onset of the crisis, unit
labor costs have grown less in the deﬁcit economies than in the surplus economies, but
more adjustment will be needed. Reducing global and euro area current account imbalances
will also require further policy changes. In external-deﬁcit economies, these include reducing
large ﬁscal deﬁcits, slowing entitlement spending, and, within the euro area, reforming labor
and product markets. In external-surplus economies, policies should improve social
protection and remove a variety of distortions.

that would result in stronger domestic demand for
Germany and stronger competitiveness for France,
Italy, and Spain would be beneficial.
It must be emphasized that the policies that
would most effectively lower global imbalances and
related vulnerabilities serve the self-interests of the
countries concerned, even when considered purely
from a domestic viewpoint (Figure 1.18, panel
5). Many external-deficit economies need strong
medium-term fiscal adjustment programs––the need
is urgent for the United States. In the euro area,
much of the planned adjustment in the periphery
economies would be warranted regardless of their
external positions, and such fiscal efforts must be
complemented with structural reforms to labor and
product markets that help rebuild competitiveness.
The requirements for emerging market economies
with external surpluses and undervalued currencies are to cut back official reserve accumulation,
adopt more market-determined exchange systems,
and implement structural reforms, for example, to
broaden the social safety net.

Improving Growth Prospects with Structural Policies
Structural problems shape much of the legacy of
the Great Recession. They also contribute to wide
global current account imbalances, which have
exacerbated the crisis in the euro area. The impact
on growth of reforms to alleviate these structural
problems can be significant. In an upside policy scenario produced by the IMF staff for the G20 Mutual
Assessment Process, most of the 2½ percent increase
in global output is generated by reforms to labor
and product markets and the beneficial spillovers via
international trade (IMF, 2012e). Through confidence and wealth effects and by facilitating relative
price adjustments, structural reforms can promote
aggregate demand, particularly investment, over
time. But these benefits are unlikely to accrue unless
such reforms are supported with macroeconomic
policies that lower uncertainty and improve confidence among investors.
Structural policies in crisis-hit economies
Household debt and bank restructuring: Although
only a few countries have adopted effective house-

chapter 1

hold debt restructuring programs, others should
consider following their lead. Programs in the
United States got off to a sluggish start, but the
recent expansion of the modification and refinancing
programs is welcome. Further steps would help support a recovery of the housing market. These could
include participation by government-sponsored
enterprises in the principal reduction program,
implementation of the administration’s proposal to
further expand refinancing, timely expansion of the
program aimed at fostering conversion of foreclosed
properties into rental units, and permitting mortgages to be modified in bankruptcy courts. Other
economies suffering from housing market slumps
may also benefit from policies to directly alleviate
household debt.7
Progress in financial sector reform, which is
critical to building a safer global economy, has
been patchy. Chapter 3 of the October 2012 GFSR
observes that a host of regulatory reforms are under
way but that the structure of financial intermediation remains largely unchanged and vulnerable.
Areas that require further attention from policymakers include a global-level discussion of the pros and
cons of direct restrictions on business models, monitoring and a set of prudential standards for nonbank financial institutions that pose systemic risks,
incentives for the use of simpler financial products,
further progress on recovery and resolution planning
for large institutions, and cross-border resolution.
Crucially, none of the current or prospective reforms
will be effective in the absence of enhanced supervision, incentives for the private sector to follow the
reforms, and the political will to deliver progress.
Bank restructuring has advanced on a broader
front. Many countries have adopted programs to
strengthen bank balance sheets and to tide banks
over during temporary liquidity difficulties. Capital
bases have been strengthened: between 2008 and
2011, for example, large European and U.S. banks
raised common-equity-to-asset ratios by about onefifth and one-third, respectively. They also reduced
their reliance on wholesale funding, although such

Economic Outlook.

Global Prospects and Policies

funding remains extensive in Europe. However, the
worsening euro area crisis and weak global economy
are posing increasingly severe banking difficulties.
Prudential authorities must continue to push balance
sheet repair and, where necessary, impose losses on
bank stakeholders and force recapitalization. This
may require the injection of public funds or the
winding-up of weak institutions. In the periphery
economies of the euro area, external support in the
form of equity injections is critical to breaking the
vicious feedback loops between deteriorating sovereigns and weakening banks.
Labor and product market reform: Progress has
been uneven. A number of countries, especially
in the euro area, are beginning to take action to
improve the functioning of their labor markets, but
there has been less action to tackle stubborn longterm unemployment or to reform the markets for
products and, especially, for services.
Labor market reforms can boost employment in
various ways. Reforms can lower hiring and firing
costs or reduce minimum wages when they are high
enough to undercut employment of the young or
the less skilled. Such reforms are under way in Italy
and Spain. Trilateral agreements between unions,
employers, and their governments can be an important element of reform efforts by helping coordinate
relative labor cost adjustment, which is essential
for realigning competitiveness between deficit and
surplus economies in the euro area. Unions and
employers can also develop more flexible collective wage bargaining agreements, as they have done
with much success in Germany. To the extent that
large-scale wage cuts occur in deficit economies,
households may need help to cope with their debt
burdens, underscoring the significance of effective household debt restructuring programs. Active
labor market policies can have very positive effects
on employment by promoting better job matching
and supporting education and vocational training
for workers displaced by sector-specific shocks, such
as the collapse of construction activity in Spain and
the United States. Labor force participation can be
buoyed by subsidies for jobs filled by the long-term
unemployed or jobs created by small and mediumsize firms, many of which are finding it hard to
obtain credit.
International Monetary Fund | October 2012

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

In various economies, especially in Europe, reform
of the services sector should be accelerated, not least
to help generate more employment over the medium
term. Stronger competition and lower barriers to
entry would help ensure that lower wages result
in more job creation rather than higher profits for
firms. The business environment in various euro area
economies also needs to be improved by reducing
procedures and costs that weigh on entrepreneurship and by streamlining bankruptcy proceedings to
better defend property rights and facilitate exit of
inefficient firms (Barkbu and others, 2012).
Structural reforms to facilitate global demand
rebalancing
Structural reforms will be important in boosting
growth and fostering global demand rebalancing while
reducing associated vulnerabilities. In surplus countries such as China and Germany, reforms are needed
to boost domestic demand; in deficit countries such as
Brazil and India, they are needed to improve supply.
•• In Germany, structural reforms will be needed to
boost the relatively low level of investment and,
more generally, increase potential growth from
domestic sources. In the near term, the underlying strength in the labor market should foster a
pickup in wages, inflation, and asset prices, and
this should be seen as part of a natural rebalancing process within a currency union. By way of
example, inflation in Germany and the Netherlands, the other major surplus economy in the
euro area, would have to be about 3 to 4 percent
to keep euro area inflation close to the ECB’s
target of “below but close to 2 percent,” if inflation in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain

28

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

were kept around zero to 1 percent and inflation
elsewhere remained in line with the ECB target.
This underscores the importance of wage and
spending adjustments in the surplus economies
for the proper functioning of the EMU.
•• Previous reports for China have stressed the need
for better pension and health care support to
lower precautionary saving and boost consumption. Progress is being made on these fronts, but
the measures will take time to exert their effects
on demand. Meanwhile, support for demand continues to come mainly from measures that support more investment. An obvious risk is that the
quality of bank lending could be further lowered,
adding to already ample capacity in the export
sector or boosting already-high real estate prices.
•• In India, there is an urgent need to reaccelerate
infrastructure investment, especially in the energy
sector, and to launch a new set of structural
reforms, with a view to boosting business investment and removing supply bottlenecks. Structural
reform also includes tax and spending reforms, in
particular, reducing or eliminating subsidies, while
protecting the poor. In this regard, the recent
announcements with respect to easing restrictions
on foreign direct investment in some sectors,
privatizations, and lowering fuel subsidies are very
welcome.
•• Brazil’s consumption boom has been a large
component of its strong growth performance, and
domestic saving and investment remain relatively
low. Reforms could usefully focus on further
developing the defined-contribution pillar of the
pension system, streamlining the tax system, and
developing long-term financial instruments.

Special Feature: Commodity Market Review

Special Feature: Commodity Market Review
The first section of this special feature discusses
developments in commodity prices, and the second
confirms that fluctuations in demand have played a
key role in the drop in prices during the second quarter
of 2012. The important complementary role of supply
developments is discussed for energy markets in the
third section and for food markets in the fourth, as these
contributed to sharp price increases during the third
quarter of 2012. The special feature concludes with the
outlook for commodity markets.
Figure 1.SF.1. IMF Commodity Price Index

Price Developments during 2012

(2005 = 100)

Broad developments
After a robust recovery during 2009–10, the
IMF’s Primary Commodities Price Index (PCPI)
stayed essentially flat during 2011 and then fell
during the second quarter of 2012, only to stage a
comeback in the third quarter (Figure 1.SF.1). The
PCPI is a weighted average of prices for 51 primary
commodities, grouped into three main clusters—
energy, industrial inputs (mainly base metals), and
edibles (of which food is the main component—
Table 1.SF.1). Among the three clusters, energy and
base metal prices declined during the second quarter
by nearly 30 and 20 percent, respectively, from
their first quarter peaks. Although metal prices have
leveled off during the third quarter, energy prices
increased sharply once again, by about 13 percent
(through August). Food prices remained broadly flat
until mid-June, but have increased since then, by
about 10 percent.

Intermediate (WTI) crude oil varieties—increased
from a low of $35 a barrel in late 2008 to a high of
$120 a barrel in March 2012. Since then, oil prices
declined during the second quarter only to climb back
during the third, albeit with some volatility. Implied
volatility remained moderate when compared with the
spikes after the Libyan revolution in 2011 but picked
up during the summer months (Figure 1.SF.2).

These two components comprise the remaining

After a strong rally earlier in 2012, base metal prices
declined in tandem with petroleum prices—albeit less
sharply—during the second quarter and have leveled
off somewhat during the third quarter (Figure 1.SF.3).
After remaining broadly flat for much of the year,
food prices started to pick up strongly in mid-June.
Grain and soybean prices rose, offsetting the weakness
in seafood, sugar, and vegetable oil prices. Implied
volatility also rose significantly (Figure 1.SF.4).

First, on occasion, causality goes the other way:
supply disruptions can sometimes lead to price
spikes and declines in economic activity (Hamilton,
2008). Second, developments on the supply side
or concerns about supply depletion can be important enough to break the tight connection between
economic activity and commodity prices even if
they are not significant enough to derail economic
activity (see Benes and others, 2012, for the case of
oil prices). Third, concerns that speculative commodity trading has decoupled price movements from
economic activity have been a constant refrain during the past few years despite the lack of conclusive
supporting evidence.1
These caveats notwithstanding, a tight link
between economic activity and commodity price
fluctuations is evident in the data, and this appears
to be the leading factor behind the broad commodity price declines during the second quarter. Commodity markets rallied somewhat in early 2012 on
the back of recovering market confidence in response
to the European Central Bank’s longer-term refinancing operations as well as better-than-expected
global growth in the first quarter. However, with
renewed setbacks to the global recovery in the
beginning of the second quarter, leading indicators
pointed to a synchronized slowing in the momentum of global activity. In particular, growth in a
number of major emerging market economies,
notably China, has slowed significantly. These common macroeconomic factors affect commodity prices
through changes in current and prospective demand
and the cost of carrying inventories.

The influence of common macroeconomic factors on commodity markets can be examined using
principal component analysis, which extracts key
factors that account for most of the variance in the
observed variables. Individual commodity prices are
affected by both commodity-wide and commodityspecific factors. The first principal component of
commodity prices captures price movements driven
by commodity-wide factors. The strong correla1See Box 1.4 of the September 2011 World Economic Outlook
for a detailed discussion.

Special Feature: Commodity Market Review

tion between this first principal component and
actual commodity prices across the board—more
than 0.85 for all major commodity groups, including crude oil, food, and base metals—implies that
individual commodity prices have been significantly
affected by commodity-wide factors (Figure 1.SF.5,
panel 1). Similarly, the first principal component
from industrial production indices (IPs), purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs), and equity returns
(using MSCI)—which are good proxies for global
economic activity, economic sentiment, and broad
asset market performance, respectively—capture the
underlying common macroeconomic factors (Figure
1.SF.5, panel 2).
The strong correlations between the first principal
components for commodity prices and aggregate
economic activity suggest that commodity-wide
factors have mainly reflected common macroeconomic developments. Especially during the second
quarter, the first principal component of commodity
prices has shown a declining trend in line with the
first principal component of IPs, PMIs, and equity
returns, implying that the recent declines in commodity prices over this period were largely driven by
global economic conditions (Figure 1.SF.6).
Metal prices and Chinese activity
The link between prices and activity is also
apparent for base metal prices. The slow recovery of
advanced economies continued to exert a drag on
base metal consumption, but it was the significant
slowdown in major emerging market economies,
notably China, that led to a sharp decline in global
base metal consumption. In China, growth has
been steadily moderating as the authorities have
pursued policies aimed at slowing the economy to
a more sustainable pace. Reflecting these policies,
growth in industrial production fell to single digits
after April for the first time since mid-2009, and
real estate investment also slowed in recent months.
China’s base metal consumption, which has been
steadily increasing and now accounts for more than
40 percent of global consumption (Figure 1.SF.7,
panel 1), slowed sharply in the second quarter. As a
result, growth in global consumption of base metals
slowed significantly in the second quarter (Figure
1.SF.7, panel 2). In line with this trend, base metal

prices declined the most among major commodities,
despite some supply response to lower prices.
Demand factors play a critical role by driving
commodity-wide movements in prices, but the role
of commodity-specific factors—which generally
reflect specific developments on the supply side—is
important as well. In petroleum markets, production
decisions by producers, supply disruptions, and geopolitical concerns are often decisive in determining
the course of prices, particularly when inventories
are low. For food prices, weather is the predominant
commodity-specific factor. The next two sections
discuss the supply-demand balance in oil and food
markets, respectively.

Supply-Demand Balance in Oil Markets
Supply surge
Oil supply expanded at an annual rate of 3.2
percent during the first half of 2012—on average by
2.4 million barrels a day (mbd)—more than double
the growth rate during 2011 (Table 1.SF.2). Since
then, supply has moderated.
•• Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC): As of the end of June, increased supply reflected an eight-month ramp-up in OPEC
production (an increase of 2.1 mbd), well above
the cartel’s production quota ceiling of 30 mbd
for crude oil. The OPEC crude oil production
quota is only a guideline, however, and actual
production was considerably higher (by 1.9 mbd)
during the first half of 2012 (Figure 1.SF.8, panel
1), largely attributed to the recovery in Libyan
production and increased Saudi output. While
still above quota, OPEC production moderated
(by 0.5 mbd) during the third quarter.2
2Before the full effects of the sanctions and oil embargo kicked
in, Iranian crude oil during the second quarter was at half of
peak production (in 1974, at more than 6 mbd), hovering at an
average of 3.2 to 3.3 mbd between April and June 2012, only to
fall to below 2.9 mbd in August (according to the International
Energy Agency, IEA). Given the use of flagging out and floating
storage, the IEA suggests caution when interpreting the data,
especially pre-July data. The EU oil embargo also barred European
insurance companies from insuring Iranian oil-related transactions. As the insurance market for Iranian oil disappeared, Japan
decided to provide its own insurance and Iran offered to provide
insurance coverage to tankers carrying Iranian oil.

Demand growth was flat during the first half of
2012 relative to the 2011 average, at 89.1 mbd, thus
contributing to the easing in crude oil prices, particularly toward the end of the second quarter. Yearover-year demand was up during the second quarter
of 2012 (by about 1.2 mbd), but largely from Asia
and the Pacific—namely, China, India, and Japan—
and the Middle East; there was a slowdown relative to the last quarter of 2011 in other advanced
economies (Figure 1.SF.8, panel 2; Table 1.SF.2).
This slowdown is a continuation of the trend decline
in OECD demand (except in Japan) owing to lower
oil intensity. Much of China’s demand increase was
reportedly to add to the country’s strategic petroleum reserve and, to a lesser extent, to support the
still-expanding vehicle usage and growth in petrochemical demand. India’s strong demand intensified
initially from irrigation needs given a weak monsoon
and then from electricity blackouts and power shortages during the third quarter. Increased Japanese
demand reflects the use of oil for power generation
after nuclear production was halted in the wake of
the Fukushima disaster. Japanese demand is expected
to remain high despite the restart of two nuclear
plants during July 2012, given the country’s recent
decision to phase out nuclear power by 2040.
Reflecting these supply and demand developments,
there was a replenishment of inventories among
OECD countries. Inventory levels were close to their
five-year averages in July 2012, while spare capacity in
OPEC countries hovered at 2.5 mbd (Figure 1.SF.9).3

3Reliable

data on inventory accumulation from non-OECD
economies are scarce. However, industry analysts report some
buildup in forward demand (particularly in Asia), but this
remains well below the OECD average (55 days) for many large
emerging market economies (for example, India and Indonesia).

Robust demand
Food demand remained robust in 2012 despite
the slowdown in global economic activity. Most of
the demand growth for major crops—corn, wheat,
soybeans, and rice—is expected to come from
emerging market and developing economies this
year, with China being the single largest contributor. Among individual food commodities, wheat
accounts for more than half the global consumption
growth for major crops.
Declining stocks
Global food markets are vulnerable to supply
setbacks because of low buffers. Stock-to-use ratios
remain below their long-term historical average levels
for corn and rice and have been declining for wheat
and soybeans. Compared with the 2007–08 food
crisis, global stock-to-use ratios have improved significantly for rice and wheat but deteriorated most notably for soybeans and to a lesser extent for corn and
other grains and oilseeds. (Figure 1.SF.10, panel 1). In
the absence of adequate food reserves, threats of production shortages caused an immediate price response
in grains, which has significant spillovers to other
food commodities. ­Rising corn prices in particular
have important spillover effects in meat and ethanol
markets. The share of the U.S. corn crop going to fuel
use declined noticeably with the expiration of government support for the ethanol industry through tariffs
and tax credits to gasoline refiners. This year, all the
growth in U.S. corn consumption is expected to come

The prices of major crops—corn, soybeans, and
wheat—have risen strongly amid concern about
weather-related supply disruptions worldwide. Earlier
in the year, the La Niña weather pattern contributed
to drought in South America, which significantly
hurt corn and soybean crops in Argentina, Brazil, and
Paraguay. Since mid-June, other supply concerns have
emerged as hot and dry weather in the U.S. Midwest
lowered corn and soybean yields. At the same time,
wheat crop estimates have been downgraded in the
Black Sea region (Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine) and in
China because of adverse weather conditions.

from its use as animal feed (Figure 1.SF.10, panel 2).
Although other grains can be substituted for corn in
animal feedstock, corn remains the primary feed grain
in the United States. Another key grain, rice, posted
only a marginal price change since mid-June because
markets are well supplied, despite some concern
about the Indian harvest from a weaker monsoon
season, but global rice output is projected to reach
record levels next year. Substitution on the supply and
demand sides between rice and other grains is also less
prevalent, and the rice market is more segmented.

The current food price shock is less severe than
the shock in 2007–08 because it has not affected all
key crops uniformly and has not been aggravated by
trade restrictions and high energy input costs (Box
1.5). However rising food prices could have a number
of macroeconomic implications. First, rising prices
translate into higher headline inflation, which erodes
consumers’ buying power. This erosion is felt particularly sharply in low- and middle-income countries,
where the share of food in the consumption basket
is higher and the pass-through from international to
domestic prices is larger than in advanced economies.
Second, they erode the fiscal balance through higher
government subsidies and safety net measures for
affected households. And finally, rising food prices
have a negative effect on the trade balances of foodimporting countries. Rising food prices also have
political economy dimensions: they contribute to
widespread discontent, thus destabilizing fragile postconflict political systems. Therefore, countries should
avoid protective trade policies such as export bans and
export taxes and quotas, which further drive up food
prices and volatility, and instead should adopt appropriate policies to maintain macroeconomic stability
while protecting the poor.4
In the near term, countries should expect rising
inflation and balance of payments pressures. During
the 2007–08 food price surge, low- and middleincome countries bore the brunt of the inflationary
impact, because volatile items such as food and fuel

account for a large share in the consumption basket.
Recent IMF research suggests that, despite a variety
of appropriate monetary policy tools to combat rising inflation across countries, commodity importers
are better off targeting underlying inflation rather
than headline inflation, which includes volatile food
and fuel, thus improving central bank credibility
by stabilizing both output and inflation volatility.5
In this context, near-term macroeconomic policies
should also include scaling up well-targeted social
safety nets and other fiscal transfers where space is
available, allowing the real exchange rate to move
flexibly for net importers, and accessing multilateral
finance to support balance of payments needs.

Outlook for Commodity Markets

105

For all their faults, futures prices remain the most
favored way to gauge the outlook for spot prices
(Chinn and Coibion, 2009). The predictions by
futures markets for the main commodities are shown
in Figure 1.SF.11, and market assessments of the balance of risks from the prices of futures options are
shown in Figure 1.SF.12.6
•• Oil: With the decline in inventory buffers and their
return in May to five-year averages, futures curves
for the Brent crude oil variety—the predominant
price benchmark outside the North American
market—continue to exhibit backwardation,
implying a gradual decline in oil prices to less than
$100 in the medium term. However, reflecting
physical market (for example, North Sea) disruptions, ongoing geopolitical risks and concern
about associated potential supply disruptions, and
expectations of stimulus in China, the United
States, and Europe, the risk to oil prices is tilted
to the upside. In contrast, futures curves for WTI
are still sloping upward at the front end, reflecting
localized pockets of excess supply in the landlocked

areas of the North American oil supply system.7
­However, because still-limited transportation capacity constrains the scope for arbitrage to reduce price
differentials, and given that these constraints are
expected to persist, current futures prices imply
that markets expect WTI to be priced at a discount
to Brent through 2015. Overall, risks around
the APSP baseline are more balanced than at the
time of the April 2012 World Economic Outlook,
although upside risks are wide and thus cannot be
easily dismissed (see Figure 1.SF.12).
•• Food: Although short-term supply constraints are
likely to keep food prices elevated, in the medium
term the current food price spike should subside
in the absence of major additional disruptions to
supply and resulting trade restrictions. Futures
price curves indicate that markets expect the
prices of key food crops to moderate by the end
of 2013.
•• Metals: Markets are expecting some rebound after
the sharp price declines in recent quarters. This
could reflect anticipation of a pickup in economic
activity beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 and
the impact of possible stimulus measures in China.

200

7With

above-average temperatures in the United States during
June and July coinciding with the summer driving season, oil spot
prices rose in response to strong refinery runs, reduced imports,
and falling stocks. The upward-sloping WTI futures curve at
the front end, however, reflects still-large stocks in the midcontinent—from increased light tight oil in the United States and
heavy crude oil from Canada—and a lack of pipeline capacity to
ship crude oil to Gulf Coast refineries. The buildup in landlocked
crude oil has driven the price of WTI below that of Brent, in part
as a reflection of the higher cost of moving surplus crude oil to
market by rail, barge, and truck. The ahead-of-schedule reversal
of the direction of the Seaway pipeline, which now delivers heavy
crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma, to Gulf Coast refineries,
helped alleviate at the margin some congestion this spring at
Cushing—where stockpiles had been at an all-time high—but
not enough to remove the surplus. The WTI-Brent spread is
likely to persist until new pipelines to the Gulf Coast are built,
existing pipelines expanded, and new refining capacity comes
online to handle the increase in heavy crude: the first large-scale
refining facility is scheduled to open in Indiana in mid-2013. The
expected narrowing of the WTI-Brent spread is reflected in the
middle and back end of both futures curves: both slope downward, reflecting expectations of future lower prices.

Global Prospects and Policies

Box 1.1. Are We Underestimating Short-Term Fiscal Multipliers?
With many economies in fiscal consolidation
mode, a debate has been raging about the size of
fiscal multipliers. The smaller the multipliers, the
less costly the fiscal consolidation. At the same time,
activity has disappointed in a number of economies
undertaking fiscal consolidation. So a natural question is whether the negative short-term effects of fiscal cutbacks have been larger than expected because
fiscal multipliers were underestimated.
This box sheds light on these issues using international evidence. The main finding, based on data for
28 economies, is that the multipliers used in generating growth forecasts have been systematically too low
since the start of the Great Recession, by 0.4 to 1.2,
depending on the forecast source and the specifics of
the estimation approach. Informal evidence suggests
that the multipliers implicitly used to generate these
forecasts are about 0.5. So actual multipliers may be
higher, in the range of 0.9 to 1.7.

Forecast Errors and Fiscal Multipliers
Our basic approach is the following: focusing on the
recent episode of widespread fiscal consolidation, we
regress the forecast error for real GDP growth during 2010–11 on forecasts of fiscal consolidation for
2010–11 that were made in early 2010. Under rational
expectations, and assuming that the correct forecast
model has been used, the coefficient on planned fiscal
consolidation should be zero. The equation estimated is
forecast error of growth = α + β forecast of fiscal
consolidation + ε.
(1.1.1)
The forecast error of growth is equal to actual
cumulative real GDP growth during 2010–11 minus
the forecast of growth in the April 2010 World
Economic Outlook. The forecast of fiscal consolidation is the forecast of the change in the structural
fiscal balance as a percentage of potential GDP
during 2010–11 as of the April 2010 WEO. We also
investigate forecasts other than the WEO. If the fiscal
multipliers used for forecasting are accurate, the slope
coefficient, β, should be zero. Our baseline sample
consists of 28 economies: the major advanced economies included in the G20 and the member countries
of the EU for which forecasts are available.
The authors of this box are Olivier Blanchard and Daniel
Leigh.

What Do the Data Show?
We find the coefficient on planned fiscal consolidation to be large, negative, and significant.
The baseline estimate suggests that a planned fiscal
consolidation of 1 percent of GDP is associated with
a growth forecast error of about 1 percentage point
(Table 1.1.1 and Figure 1.1.1, panel 1). This result
indicates that the multipliers underlying growth projections have been too low by about 1. The systematic
relationship between fiscal consolidation and growth
holds up to a battery of robustness tests. Overall,
depending on the forecast source and the specification, our estimation results for the unexpected output
loss associated with a 1 percent of GDP fiscal consolidation are in the range of 0.4 to 1.2 percentage
points. First, we establish that the baseline result is
not driven by crisis economies––those that had IMF
programs—or other outliers (Table 1.1.1).1
Next, we check whether the results are robust to
controlling for additional variables that could plausibly have triggered both planned fiscal consolidation
and lower-than-expected growth. The omission of
such variables could bias the analysis toward finding
that fiscal multipliers were larger than assumed. We
consider two groups of variables: those that were
known when the growth forecasts were made and
those that were not (Table 1.1.1).
•• Variables known at the time the forecasts were
made: We start by considering the role of sover­
eign debt problems. Are the baseline results picking up greater-than-expected effects of sovereign
debt problems rather than the effects of fiscal
consolidation? Reassuringly, the results are robust
to controlling for the initial (end-2009)
­government-debt-to-GDP ratio and for initial
sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads.
Controlling for the possible role of banking
crises—based on the data set of systemic banking
crises of Laeven and Valencia (2012)—yields
similar results. The baseline finding also holds up
to controlling for the fiscal consolidation of trading partners. To the extent that fiscal consolidations were synchronized, fiscal consolidation by

advanced economies are included (Iceland, Israel, Norway,
Switzerland, Taiwan Province of China).

others may be driving the results. However, when
we control for trade-weighted fiscal consolidation
of other countries (scaled by the share of exports
in GDP), the results are virtually unchanged.
Finally, to investigate the role of precrisis external
imbalances that may have triggered both fiscal
consolidation and larger-than-expected headwinds
to growth, we try controlling for the precrisis
(2007) current-account-deficit-to-GDP ratio and
find similar results.2
•• Variables not known at the time the forecasts were
made:3 We consider the role of the sharp increase
in sovereign and financial market stress during
2010–11, measured by the change in the sovereign CDS spreads. Controlling for these developments again yields similar results. We also address
the possibility that, even if the assumed multipliers were correct, countries with more ambitious
consolidation programs may have implemented
more fiscal consolidation than originally planned.
2The

baseline results also hold up to additional robustness checks, including controlling for the initial forecast for
2010–11 growth and for initial trade openness and its interaction with planned fiscal consolidation.
3It is possible that developments that occurred after the
forecasts were made could be partly the result of lower-thanexpected growth rather than the cause of lower growth.

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

As Table 1.1.1 reports, including unexpected fiscal consolidation does not significantly affect the
results, suggesting that the baseline specification
is appropriate.4 In line with this result, we find
that there was no systematic tendency for economies with larger initial fiscal consolidation plans
to implement larger additional consolidation.

GDP Components, Unemployment, and Different
Forecasters
When we decompose GDP, we find the largest
coefficient for forecasts of investment and the most
statistically significant coefficient for forecasts of
consumption (Figure 1.1.1, panel 2). The coefficient
associated with forecasts of the unemployment rate
is also large and significant.
We also consider four different sets of forecasts:
those of the WEO, the European Commission
(EC), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the Econo4Unexpected

consolidation is defined as the actual (ex post)
change in the structural fiscal balance minus the forecast—
that is, the forecast error of fiscal consolidation. The results
also hold up to additional robustness checks, including
controlling for the revision to the initial (end-2009) debt-toGDP ratio, defined as the actual debt ratio in 2009 minus the
estimate of the debt ratio published in the April 2010 WEO.

What Does This Say about Actual Fiscal
Multipliers?
These results suggest that actual fiscal multipliers
were larger than forecasters assumed. But what did
forecasters assume about fiscal multipliers? Answering this question is complicated by the fact that not
all forecasters make these assumptions explicit. Nevertheless, a number of policy documents, including
IMF staff reports, suggest that fiscal multipliers used
in the forecasting process are about 0.5. In line with
these assumptions, earlier analysis by the IMF staff
suggests that, on average, fiscal multipliers were near
0.5 in advanced economies during the three decades
leading up to 2009.6
If the multipliers underlying the growth forecasts
were about 0.5, as this informal evidence suggests,
our results indicate that multipliers have actually been in the 0.9 to 1.7 range since the Great
Recession. This finding is consistent with research
suggesting that in today’s environment of substantial
economic slack, monetary policy constrained by the
zero lower bound, and synchronized fiscal adjustment across numerous economies, multipliers may
be well above 1 (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko,
2012; Batini, Callegari, and Melina, 2012; IMF,
2012b; Woodford, 2011; and others). More work
on how fiscal multipliers depend on time and economic conditions is warranted.

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

Box 1.2. The Implications of High Public Debt in Advanced Economies
The analysis presented in this box examines
the potential long-term macroeconomic implications of advanced economies’ accumulation
of large quantities of public debt, as currently
forecast in the World Economic Outlook baseline
scenario. Two models are used to illustrate the
implications. The first is the Global Integrated
Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF),1 and the
second is a small stochastic macroeconomic
model that emphasizes uncertainty in fiscal
dynamics (FiscalMod). The GIMF is used to
illustrate the implications for the baseline of an
accumulation of large stocks of debt by advanced
economies, while the FiscalMod is used to
illustrate the distribution of outcomes around
possible baselines in an uncertain world with
macroeconomic surprises.

A stylized simulation that incorporates some
aspects of recent economic experience in the G3
(euro area, Japan, United States) is used to illustrate the long-term implications for the baseline
of higher public debt. In recent years G3 countries’ fiscal positions have deteriorated, resulting
in a sharp increase in public debt levels. This was
driven largely by the financial crisis: public spending was increased to address financial institution
problems and help maintain output in the face
of diminished private demand. In addition, weak
private demand has also led to lower public revenue. The GIMF simulation, represented by the
blue line in Figure 1.2.1, replicates this development and shows a rise in G3 debt-to-GDP ratios
over roughly a 10-year period by the amounts
forecast in the WEO baseline between 2007 and
2017. In the simulation, the weakness in private
demand also initially results in low real interest
rates. However, once private demand normalizes
and public debt converges to a new higher level,
the increased demand for savings from G3 economies raises the global real interest rate, which over

the long term rises almost 40 basis points above
the baseline. Although the following discussions
focus largely on the macroeconomic implications
of these higher real interest rates, this simulation
analysis necessarily abstracts from the potential
long-term benefits of the stimulus. The stimulus
was likely instrumental in averting a potential
deflationary spiral and protracted period of
exceedingly high unemployment, macroeconomic
conditions that general equilibrium models such
as the GIMF are not well suited to capture.
Higher real interest rates have two important
implications for the subsequent level of economic
activity. First, higher real interest rates raise the
servicing cost of outstanding public debt. To
finance those increased debt-service costs, fiscal
policy adjustments must occur.
It is assumed that higher labor income taxes
and consumption taxes each account for 30 percent of the required funding, with an additional
10 percent coming from higher taxes on capital
income and the final 30 percent coming from a
reduction in transfers to households. Higher labor
and capital income taxes reduce the amount of
labor and capital used in production, and hence
output, and lower transfers; and higher consumption taxes reduce household demand. The effects
jointly lead to a lower level of sustainable output.2
Second, higher real interest rates raise the cost of
capital, further reducing the level of capital stock,
firms’ labor demand, and ultimately sustainable
output. Together these two effects lead to GDP
converging to a new long-term level roughly 1
percent below the previous baseline (as shown by
the blue line in Figure 1.2.1). (This analysis does
not consider the possibility of a simultaneous rise
in the sovereign risk premium in these economies
with higher public debt. Should that occur, the
new long-term level of output would be even
lower than simulated here.)
Although the run-up in public debt in G3
economies represents a significant decrease in

2Relying on a different mix of fiscal instruments to generate the improvement in the primary fiscal balance necessary
to cover increased debt-service costs would lead to slightly
different outcomes for long-term sustainable GDP.

public saving, another worry is that private saving
rates could also decline. In emerging markets,
notably emerging Asia, private saving rates have
been very high and are likely to moderate in the
future. In G3 economies, aging is likely to have
a negative impact on private saving rates. The
red line in Figure 1.2.1 represents the macro

implications if, in addition to the reduction in
public saving, private saving rates also decline. A
reduction in the private saving rate as a share of
GDP in emerging market economies of roughly
2 percentage points is considered in this analysis.
For the G3 economies, the decline in the saving
rate is estimated using the United Nations’ low-

working-age population projections. For every 1
percent decline in the working-age population, it
is assumed that saving declines by 0.7 percent.3
The first point to note is that this implies that
the real interest rate must rise by an additional
120 basis points. Higher real interest rates then
lead to more of the behavior noted above. Tighter
fiscal policy to finance increased debt-service costs
further reduces the incentive to work, invest,
and consume. Higher real interest rates further
increase the cost of capital, adding to a decline in
the incentive to invest. The net result is that GDP
falls even further below the baseline if private saving rates decline along with the projected decline
in public saving rates in the G3.
Focusing on relative impacts, Japan becomes
worse off compared with the United States and
the euro area because it had the highest debt level
in the initial control and the largest increase in
3We abstract from the direct impact on output from the
decline in the labor force itself and focus purely on the
implications for saving. Implicitly, this assumes that the
impact of the decline in the labor force on output and all the
fiscal implications, such as pension and health care expenditures, are built into the baseline.

the initial scenario. The rising real interest rate
adds to debt-service costs in Japan, so the fiscal
adjustment to pay those costs is larger, as is the
resulting impact on the incentive to work, invest,
and consume.
Moreover, higher public debt in advanced
economies does not reduce only their potential
baseline GDP outcomes: all countries suffer
because higher global real interest rates affect
everyone. Figure 1.2.2 shows the outcomes for
global GDP, GDP in the aggregate of the G3,
and GDP in the aggregate of all other countries.
Even though the G3 suffer the worst outcomes, all
countries are worse off.
The simulated impact on real interest rates
and thus on real GDP of higher debt and lower
private saving in advanced economies is highly
dependent on the rate at which households
are willing to substitute consumption at some
point in the future for consumption today—the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution. The
simulations presented in Table 1.2.1 assume an
intertemporal elasticity of substitution of 0.5,
roughly in the middle of the range of the empirical estimates. However, given the uncertainty

Stochastic Analysis
GIMF simulations are a useful way to trace
potential long-term trend outcomes for GDP
when G3 countries have high public debt, but
in an uncertain world, the distributions around
those trend outcomes must be considered, given
the potential range of future macroeconomic
surprises. To compute the distributions for the
outcomes for GDP, public debt, and real interest
rates, a small empirical model, FiscalMod, is used.
This model is semistructural, with a maturity
structure of government debt and a yield curve.
The model includes stochastic shocks to output,
potential output, deficits, inflation, and interest
rate term premiums and is simulated around an
extended WEO baseline for a typical advanced
economy. Illustrative base-case distributions
(showing 90 percent confidence intervals) for the
outcomes for GDP, the output gap, public debt,
inflation, and real interest rates are presented in
Figure 1.2.3.
To illustrate the risks associated with allowing debt to drift upward, Figure 1.2.3 presents a
scenario that makes the following two assumptions. First, reduced world private saving rates
(for example, due to aging) drive up the world
real interest rate. Second, after the WEO horizon
(2017) the baseline (median) value of net debt
is allowed to increase to more than 100 percent
of GDP. The distributions around this baseline
are based on a fiscal policy rule allowing it to be
easier to increase government deficits during bad
economic times than it is to cut deficits during

good economic times—that is, it is assumed that
there is a bias toward higher debt ratios even if
the macroeconomic shocks are symmetric. Because
of this assumption, outcomes around the baseline
are asymmetrical: the upward drift in debt, combined with the assumption that high debt leads to
higher risk and term premiums, results in positive
skewness in real interest rates. Given the negative
relationship between real interest rates and GDP,
the result is negative skewness in GDP.4
Scenarios that involve very high levels of debt
and real interest rates not only result in lower
growth, but they imply a higher risk of default
when fiscal dynamics are perceived to be unstable.
In the model these scenarios would result in
explosive dynamics and simulation failures. To
illustrate the importance of these disaster scenarios, Figure 1.2.3, panel 6, shows the probability of
net debt rising to more than 100 percent of GDP
and the proportion of scenarios that fail because
of unstable debt dynamics. As the distribution of
debt drifts up, the proportion of scenarios with
unstable debt dynamics rises because of a larger
gap between an economy’s real interest rate and
real growth rate.
This analysis shows the importance of prudent
fiscal policy frameworks that gradually reduce
debt over time and prevent debt from drifting
up too high. Still, it is important to consider the
speed at which debt is reduced, given advanced
economies’ weakness and constraints on mon4The

asymmetry in the distributions also reflects nonlinearity in which incremental increases in real interest rates
caused by increases in debt become larger when the baseline
value of debt is higher. For empirical evidence on the link
between government debt and real interest rates, see Engen
and Hubbard (2004); Gale and Orszag (2004); and Laubach
(2009).

etary policy to offset the contractionary effects
of fiscal consolidation. As shown in Figure 1.2.3,
the WEO baseline assumes a gradual closing of
the output gap and little risk of a deflationary
spiral (negative inflation and larger output gaps).
Although it is not illustrated with an alternative
scenario, the same model suggests that an excessively rapid reduction in debt would risk reducing
growth and pushing the advanced economies into
a deflationary spiral.

Global Prospects and Policies

Box 1.3. How Does Uncertainty Affect Economic Performance?
Bouts of elevated uncertainty have been one of
the defining features of the sluggish recovery from
the global financial crisis. In recent quarters, high
uncertainty has once again coincided with weakness in the global recovery. Many commentators
argue that uncertainty is a major cause of escalating financial stress and recession in the euro area,
stalling labor markets in the United States, and
slowing growth in emerging market and developing
economies.
This box explores the role of uncertainty in
driving macroeconomic outcomes. Specifically, it
addresses three major questions: How is uncertainty
measured? How does it evolve over the business
cycle? And what is the impact of uncertainty on
growth and business cycles? To address these questions, the box briefly analyzes the main features of
various measures of uncertainty and their association with growth and business cycles in advanced
economies, and it interprets the evidence in light of
findings from recent research.
Uncertainty is shown to have a harmful impact
on economic activity. First, the adverse effects
are transmitted through multiple channels, with
financial market imperfections and institutional
constraints often magnifying them, so the effects
of uncertainty are likely to vary across sectors and
countries. Second, as experienced acutely since
the global financial crisis, uncertainty is highly
countercyclical. Third, cross-country evidence indicates that high uncertainty is often associated with
deeper recessions and weaker recoveries.

How Is Uncertainty Measured?
Economic uncertainty frequently refers to an
environment in which little or nothing is known
about the future state of the economy. Shocks
that lead to economic uncertainty can stem from
a variety of sources, including changes in economic and financial policies, dispersion in future
growth prospects, productivity movements, wars,
acts of terrorism, and natural disasters (Bloom,
2009). Although uncertainty is difficult to quantify
because of its latent nature, it can be measured

indirectly in a number of ways. These measures
emphasize distinct aspects of uncertainty facing an
economy over time. Some of the measures focus on
macroeconomic uncertainty, including the volatility
of stock returns, variation in aggregate productivity, dispersion in unemployment forecasts, and the
prevalence of terms such as “economic uncertainty”
in the media. Others consider uncertainty at the
microeconomic level, which is often measured
by various indicators of dispersion across sectoral
output, firm sales, and stock returns.
Because we are concerned primarily with macroeconomic uncertainty, we concentrate on four measures based on the volatility of stock returns and
economic policy. The first is the monthly standard
deviation of daily stock returns in each advanced
economy in our sample.
The second is the Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index (VXO), which is an
indicator of the implied volatility of equity prices
calculated from S&P 100 options. The third refers
to uncertainty surrounding economic policies.1 The
fourth, which represents uncertainty at the global
level, is the estimated dynamic common factor of
the first measure using the series of the six major
advanced economies with the longest available data.

How Does Uncertainty Evolve?
Both macroeconomic and policy measures of
uncertainty tend to rise during global recessions
(Figure 1.3.1). Policy uncertainty in the United
States and the euro area has remained high since
the global financial crisis and the recent sovereign
debt problems in the euro area. Moreover, during
the lethargic global recovery, uncertainty has been
unusually high and volatile. This contrasts with the
recoveries following the other three global reces1The economic policy uncertainty measure employed here
is from Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2012), who use a weighted
average of the following three indicators: the frequency with
which terms like “economic policy” and “uncertainty” appear
together in the media, the number of tax provisions that
will expire in coming years, and the dispersion of forecasts
of future government outlays and inflation. Because most of
this information refers to outcomes it does not distinguish
between uncertainty about policy goals and uncertainty
about policy instruments.

sions shown in Figure 1.3.1, which were accompanied by steady declines in uncertainty.
Uncertainty is highly countercyclical. Macroeconomic uncertainty varies over different phases of
the business cycle: during expansions in advanced
economies uncertainty is, on average, much lower
than during recessions, regardless of the measure
(Table 1.3.1). Microeconomic uncertainty, measured by the volatility of movements in plant-level
productivity in the United States, also behaves
countercyclically and reached a post-1970 high
during the Great Recession (Bloom and others,
2012).
Causality between uncertainty and the business
cycle is difficult to establish—does uncertainty
drive recessions or do recessions lead to uncertainty? Empirical findings on this question are
mixed.2 However, economic theory, as discussed
next, points to clear channels through which
uncertainty can have a negative impact on growth.
Some uncertainty is likely to be an intrinsic feature
of the business cycle: firms and households will
learn only over time which sectors of the economy
will do better and which will do worse—and for
how long—in response to the shocks that cause
recessions.

What Is the Impact of Uncertainty on Growth
and Business Cycles?
Economic theory suggests that macroeconomic
uncertainty can have an adverse impact on output
through a variety of channels. On the demand side,
for example, when faced with high uncertainty,
firms reduce investment demand and delay their
projects as they gather new information, because
investment is often costly to reverse (Bernanke,
1983; Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). Households’
response to high uncertainty is similar to that of
2Bachmann

and Moscarini (2011) find that the direction
of causality runs from recessions to uncertainty. In contrast,
Baker and Bloom (2011) offer evidence, using disaster data
as instruments, that the causality runs from uncertainty to
recessions, and Bloom and others (2012) report that growth
does not cause uncertainty. Predictions of theory and findings from empirical studies collectively indicate that uncertainty can play a dual role over the business cycle: it can be
an impulse as well as a propagation mechanism.

Note: The dependent variable is the level of uncertainty. Recessions and expansions in regressions refer to dummy variables taking the values of 1 and zero when the
economy is in recession and expansion, respectively. The periods of recession and expansion are defined following Claessens, Kose, and Terrones (2012). Countryspecific uncertainty refers to the monthly standard deviation of daily stock returns in each country. Daily returns are calculated using each country’s stock price index.
Data series cover the period 1960–2011, but coverage varies across economies. Uncertainty in the United States refers to the Chicago Board Options Exchange VXO
index, which is calculated from S&P 100 options. Prior to 1986, this series has been extended following Bloom (2009). The policy uncertainty measure is an index of
economic policy uncertainty for the United States from Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2012). It refers to the weighted average of three indicators, including the frequency
of the appearance of terms like “economic policy” and “uncertainty” in the media, the number of tax provisions that will expire in coming years, and the dispersion of
forecasts of future government outlays and inflation. Global uncertainty is the estimated dynamic common factor of the first measure using the series of France, Italy,
Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. (These countries have the longest series of stock market indices.) *** denotes that the coefficients are
statistically significant at the 1 percent level. Standard errors are in parentheses.

firms: they reduce their consumption of durable
goods as they wait for less uncertain times. On the
supply side, firms’ hiring plans are also negatively
affected by higher uncertainty, reflecting costly
adjustment of personnel (Bentolila and Bertola,
1990).
Financial market imperfections can amplify
the negative impact of uncertainty on growth. In
theory, uncertainty leads to a decline in expected
returns on projects financed with debt and makes it
harder to assess the value of collateral. Thus, creditors charge higher interest rates and limit lending
during uncertain times, which reduces firms’ ability
to borrow. The decline in borrowing causes investment to contract, especially for credit-constrained
firms, and results in slower productivity growth
because of reduced spending on research and development. These factors together can translate into a
significant reduction in output growth (Gilchrist,
Sim, and Zakrajsek, 2010).
The impact of uncertainty differs across sectors
and countries. The sectors that produce durable
goods—including machinery and equipment, automobiles, houses, and furniture—are often the most
affected by increases in uncertainty. The impact
of an uncertainty shock on consumption and
investment is larger in emerging market economies
than in advanced economies, probably because the

former group tends to have less developed financial
markets and institutions (Carrière-Swallow and
Céspedes, 2011).
Empirical evidence suggests that uncertainty
tends to be detrimental to economic growth. The
growth rate of output is negatively correlated with
macroeconomic uncertainty (Table 1.3.2). A 1 standard deviation increase in uncertainty is associated
with a decline in output growth of between 0.4 and
1.25 percentage points depending on the measure
of macroeconomic uncertainty. There were indeed
multiple episodes during which uncertainty rose
by 1 standard deviation or more, including at the
onset of the Great Recession and during the recent
debt crisis in the euro area. High uncertainty tends
to be associated with a larger drop in investment
than in output and consumption growth. These
findings lend support to the validity of different
theoretical channels through which uncertainty
adversely affects economic activity. They are also
consistent with recent studies documenting a negative relationship between growth and uncertainty.3
3Empirical evidence based on vector autoregression (VAR)
models points to a significant negative impact of uncertainty
shocks on output and employment (Bloom, 2009; Hirata
and others, 2012). These results also echo the findings in a
broader area of research on the negative impact of macroeconomic and policy volatility on economic growth (Ramey and

Note: A recession is associated with high uncertainty if the level of uncertainty at its trough falls in the top quartile of uncertainty
measured at the troughs of all recessions. A recovery is associated with high uncertainty if the average uncertainty during the
recovery is in the top quartile of average uncertainty of all recovery episodes. The periods of recession and recovery are defined
following Claessens, Kose, and Terrones (2012). All statistics except “Duration” correspond to sample median. For duration,
means are shown. For recessions, duration is the number of quarters between peak and trough. Duration for recoveries is the time
it takes to attain the level at the previous peak after the trough. The amplitude for recessions is calculated based on the decline in
output during the recession and expressed in percent. The amplitude for the recoveries is calculated based on the one-year change
in output after the trough and expressed in percent. The slope of the recessions is the amplitude from peak to trough divided by
the duration. The slope of recoveries is the amplitude from the trough to the period where output has reached the level at its last
peak divided by the duration. Cumulative loss combines information about duration and amplitude to measure the overall cost
of a recession and is expressed in percent.** and * denote that features of recessions (recoveries) with high uncertainty differ

Policy-induced uncertainty is also negatively
associated with growth. The adverse impact of
policy uncertainty on economic growth works
mainly through two channels. First, it directly
affects the behavior of households and firms as they
postpone investment and consumption decisions
when uncertainty about future policies is elevated.
Second, it breeds macroeconomic uncertainty,
which in turn reduces growth. As noted, policy

uncertainty has increased to record levels since the
Great Recession. Specifically, the increase in policy
uncertainty between 2006 and 2011 was about 5
standard deviations. This sharp increase in policy
uncertainty may have stymied growth in advanced
economies by 2½ percentage points during this
period.4
4This finding is consistent with results from a recent study
by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2012). They employ a VAR
model and report that a jump in policy uncertainty, such
as the one observed between 2006 and 2011 in the United

Box 1.3. (continued)
The degree of economic uncertainty also appears
to be related to the depth of recessions and strength
of recoveries. In particular, recessions accompanied by high uncertainty are often deeper, longer,
and more severe than other recessions. Moreover,
recessions in highly uncertain environments are
associated with cumulative output losses roughly
two times larger than those during other recessions
(Table 1.3.3). Similarly, recoveries coinciding with
periods of elevated uncertainty are weaker and
slower than other recoveries.5 Both consumption
States, is associated with about a 3 percent decline in real
GDP and a 16 percent contraction in private investment.
5The unusually high levels of uncertainty the global
economy experienced since the 2007–09 financial crisis and
the associated episodes of deep recessions and weak recoveries
play an important role in explaining these findings. Uncertainty shocks account for about one-third of business cycle
variation in advanced economies and up to half of cyclical
volatility in emerging market and developing economies,
implying that these shocks play a sizable role in driving the
dynamics of recessions and expansions (Bloom and others,

and investment tend to grow at a slower pace during recoveries associated with high uncertainty.

Global Recovery in Times of Manifold
Uncertainty
Elevated uncertainty historically coincides with
periods of lower growth, and the recent pickup
in uncertainty raises the specter of another global
recession. Policymakers can do little to alleviate the
intrinsic uncertainty economies typically face over
the business cycle. However, policy uncertainty
is unusually high, and it contributes significantly
to macroeconomic uncertainty. By implementing
bold and timely measures, policymakers can reduce
policy-induced uncertainty and help kick-start economic growth. What precisely policymakers need
to do is discussed in the main text of Chapter 1.
2012; Baker and Bloom, 2011). Other relevant research concludes that shocks associated with uncertainty and financial
disruptions were the primary factors that led to the Great
Recession (Stock and Watson, forthcoming).

Box 1.4. Unconventional Energy in the United States
U.S. natural gas and oil production has
increased in recent years, driven largely by the
commercialization of horizontal drilling and
hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) technology from
shale rock.1,2 The “unconventional energy revolution” began in the natural gas sector during the
past decade, and gas production rose 28 percent
between 2005 and 2011, and continued to climb
in 2012 albeit at diminishing rates.3 The rise in
unconventional gas contributed to the plunge
in natural gas prices, and producers have since
focused on liquids-rich gas plays or have migrated
to pure oil (or tight oil) plays.
Since 2005, application of this technology has
put an end to the trend decline in U.S. oil output
by increasing oil production from unconventional
formations—first by maintaining total U.S. oil
production at about 7 million barrels a day (mbd)
until 2008 (8 percent of daily global production). More recently, from 2009 to the first half of
2012, oil output rose by about 2 mbd to about 9
mbd (10 percent of daily global oil production).
This more recent rise stems largely from tapping
unconventional shale deposits in North Dakota
and Texas for “tight” oil and other liquid byproducts (that is, natural gas liquids) through the
use of techniques similar to those pioneered to tap
unconventional shale gas (see Table 1.SF.2).
The authors of this box are Samya Beidas-Strom and Akito
Matsumoto.
1Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a mix of water,
sand, and chemicals into wells at high pressure, thereby
cracking the rock containing the liquids. Horizontal drilling
enables greater access to pockets of liquids, allowing more
to be pumped to the surface. Application of this technique
to hydrocarbon liquids (oil) was previously considered too
challenging or uneconomic and has raised environmental
concerns—notably about possible contamination of aquifers.
2“Oil” in this box refers to crude (conventional) oil, condensates, natural gas liquids, and unconventional oil.
3Unconventional natural gas is found in locations requiring special extraction technologies such as horizontal drilling
and fracking. It includes shale gas, tight gas, and coal-bed
methane; this gas is similar to conventional natural gas,
with the only difference being that their extraction requires
unconventional methods. Unconventional oil, such as shale
oil (or tight oil), is recovered from shale using the same
unconventional technologies as for shale gas but is conventional oil, similar in quality to light crude oil.

54

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

The boom in unconventional energy affects
other energy markets as well. The downturn in
natural gas prices has led to displacement of coal
in the U.S. electric power sector and decoupling
of U.S. natural gas from crude oil prices. The
displacement of coal is largely attributed to the
shift from coal to natural gas by U.S. electric
power companies in response to lower natural gas
prices. On the one hand, coal displacement in
the United States has been beneficial to Europe,
where demand has increased because of substitution away from higher-priced fuels—notably
(non-U.S.) natural gas, whose price is still linked
to that of oil—and from a phaseout of nuclear
power. On the other hand, rising unconventional
natural gas production has also led to a decoupling of U.S. natural gas prices from crude oil
prices; gas prices have fallen to their lowest level
in a decade.4 Rising unconventional oil production has also contributed to the stock buildup in
the mid-continent, which led to a large discount
in the price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude
oil compared with internationally traded crude oil
varieties—for example, Brent and Dubai Fateh.
The future of unconventional extraction is
uncertain given its relative cost: crude oil prices
would have to range between $50 and $90 a
barrel to guarantee commercial viability (breakeven). Hence a drop in crude oil prices to levels
seen during the 2008 slump could set back U.S.
unconventional oil production. Despite uncertainty, industry analysts suggest that U.S. production could increase by 1 mbd annually until
2015, and possibly beyond. Moreover, because
there are large tight oil reserves in other regions
of the world, if commercially viable, extraction
could offset declining production in maturing
conventional fields, thus alleviating concern about
oil scarcity. Finally, abundant unconventional
energy might not keep oil prices from rising in
the short term, but it could have that effect in the
4Until

the early 1990s, natural gas prices were heavily
regulated, with regulators using oil prices as a reference for
gas prices. Deregulation and restructuring of the pipeline
sector led to a competitive market with direct gas-on-gas
competition.

long term—because higher energy prices would
stimulate unconventional oil development if oil
prices remain above $80 a barrel. At the same
time, energy substitutability depends on a number
of factors: electric power companies switched from
coal to natural gas as did the petrochemical sector,

but a shift from oil to natural gas in transportation has proved to be much slower.5

Box 1.5. Food Supply Crunch—Who Is Most Vulnerable?
Food prices are increasing worldwide, raising
fears of another food crisis like that in 2007–08.
How is 2012 different? Which regions are most
vulnerable to the current food price surge?1 The
current food price shock is less severe than that of
2007–08 because it has not affected all key crops
uniformly and has not been aggravated by trade
restrictions and high energy input costs. However,
when focusing on vulnerability, there are significant variations across regions: the African, Central
American, Caribbean, and Middle Eastern regions
appear to be the most exposed to rising food prices
amid low inventory buffers and high dependence
on the global market for their food supplies.
The 2007–08 food crisis was exacerbated by various
forms of export restrictions by major food exporters;2
in contrast, no such policies have been implemented by
major food exporters during 2012. Since the last food
crisis, supply has responded to robust demand and relatively high prices through higher acreage and yields as
well as productivity gains. As a result, global inventory
buffers, measured by stock-to-use ratios, have improved
significantly, especially for rice and wheat.
The author of this box is Marina Rousset.
1Regional composition is as defined by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture. Note that North America includes Mexico, and
Oceania includes Australia and New Zealand. Pacific island
nations, which are vulnerable to food price shocks, could not be
disaggregated from Oceania due to data limitations.
2A survey by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
prepared in 2008 showed that of the 77 surveyed countries,
roughly one-quarter imposed some form of export restrictions during the food crisis.

Spillovers from energy markets are much more
limited in 2012. Energy prices feed into global
food prices through two main channels: cost push
and demand pull. First, energy-intensive inputs
such as ammonia-based nitrogen fertilizers and
power provide a transmission mechanism from
energy prices into food prices. Second, the diversion of crops from food to fuel production has
become an important factor in recent years—corn
and sugar have been increasingly used for ethanol
production and soybeans and other oilseeds for
biodiesel production. Energy prices surged alongside food prices during the 2007–08 food crisis,
intensifying the spillover through both channels,
but energy prices have recently declined, limiting the spillover to food prices. The expiration of
government subsidies to the U.S. ethanol industry
in 2011 also helped reduce the use of food crops
for energy production. Therefore, the pass-through
from energy prices to food prices plays a less
important role than in 2007–08.
Nevertheless, countries in Africa, Central
America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East are
vulnerable to rising food prices. Despite significant
heterogeneity, regions with low inventory buffers,
high dependence on the global market for their
food supply, and a high share of food in final consumption seem to be the most vulnerable to recent
food price hikes (Table 1.5.1, Figure 1.5.1).3
3Compared with 2007–08, the extent of regional
exposure to global food price fluctuations has not changed
significantly.

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

Box 1.5. (continued)
•• Naturally, regions that are not self-sustaining in
agricultural production, and therefore dependent
on the global food market, are the most exposed
to the effects of global price instability. These
regions include Caribbean and Central American
nations, which import three-quarters and onehalf of their corn demand, respectively, and have
lower inventory buffers than in 2007–08.
•• Countries in the Middle East and sub-Saharan
Africa, which import more than half of their
wheat consumption and whose stock-to-use
ratios for wheat and rice are below historical
averages, could also be heavily affected if global
wheat prices rise further because of lower inventory buffers.
•• North Africa, where about 40 percent of final
consumption is food, is also vulnerable to high
food prices given significant reliance on food
imports.
Exposure to global food price volatility for other
regions is crop specific. The former Soviet Union
region has a high share of imports and household
consumption dedicated to food, but, because of
interregional trade, its exposure to global markets for wheat—its main consumption and trade
crop—is fairly limited. East Asia, in particular

58

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

China, depends on the global market to satisfy
a large portion of its domestic soybean demand
but has accumulated substantial inventory buffers.
Although inventory buffers in North America,
which is a net exporter of major crops, have
deteriorated significantly, especially for corn, food
expenditures in North America account for a lower
share of imports and household income than in
other regions, making North America less vulnerable to food price increases.
On the global level, the current stock-to-use
ratios for corn and soybeans are lower than they
were during 2007–08, but are higher for rice and
wheat. Many regions have undertaken self-sufficiency initiatives to reduce their dependence on
global food markets, and some regions increased
their precautionary demand for key grains to mitigate food price increases while others initiated food
and fertilizer subsidies and farm lending programs.
However, alleviating the burden of global food
price volatility calls for broader policy reforms,
including to address agricultural infrastructure
improvement, effective safety nets for the poor, and
climate change, as well as to encourage additional
agricultural food production (and eliminate policies
that discourage it).

Global growth slowed again during the second
quarter of 2012 after rebounding during the first.
The slowing has been observed in all regions. This
synchronicity suggests an important role for common factors, many of which reflected wide-ranging
spillovers from large country-specific or regional
shocks. A first shock was the ratcheting up of financial stress in the euro area periphery in the second
quarter. Second, domestic demand in many economies in Asia and Latin America (notably Brazil,
China, and India, but also others) slowed, owing
not just to weaker external demand from Europe but
also to domestic factors. Growth also decelerated in
the United States.
The theme of spillovers runs throughout this
chapter, because spillovers are important to both the
baseline projections and the risks to the outlook.
With respect to the former, near-term growth projections across most regions have been revised down
relative to the April 2012 World Economic Outlook
(Figure 2.1). Activity is projected to gradually gather
speed beginning in late 2012, later than had been
expected in April, led by a pickup in emerging
market economies owing to recent policy easing. The
relatively small revisions to global growth under the
baseline are predicated on the assumption that there
will be sufficient policy action for financial conditions in the euro area periphery to gradually ease
and that the fiscal cliff will be avoided in the United
States.
Downside risks have increased relative to the April
2012 WEO and also have important global spillover
potential.1 The most immediate downside risk—that
delayed or insufficient policy action will further
escalate the euro area crisis—remains in place. Other
short-term risks are the looming U.S. “fiscal cliff”
and delays in raising the U.S. debt ceiling.

Note: Peak deviation of real GDP growth from the WEO baseline, under the “disappointing potential output and growing risk aversion” scenario described in Chapter 1.
Simulations were conducted using the IMF’s Global Economic Model, a six-region model (supplemented with satellite models) that does not explicitly model individual
countries (except the United States and Japan).

A medium-term risk is the possibility of lowerthan-expected growth in many major economies and
regions, including China, because of lower mediumterm growth potential and temporarily higher global
risk aversion. As illustrated by the corresponding
scenario analysis in Chapter 1, if this risk materializes, sharply lower growth will be experienced in all
regions—including regions with no or only minor
declines in potential growth, which underscores the
large spillovers (Figure 2.2).
The Spillover Feature in this chapter assesses the
potential transmission of financial stress in advanced
economies via capital flows, sovereign yields, and
equity prices. The analysis highlights the strong
response of global capital flows and asset prices to
increased financial stress in advanced economies
during several recent episodes, pointing to important
differences across episodes depending on the source
of stress (Figure 2.3). It also shows that stress related
to downswings in China’s real activity has become a
source of financial market contagion, particularly for
62

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

commodity-exporting emerging market and developing economies. Because capital flows and asset prices
affect domestic financial conditions and business
and household confidence, the real effects can be
important.

Europe: In the Orbit of the Euro Area Crisis
Financial stress in the euro area periphery has
ratcheted up. The recession in most of the periphery is
increasingly spilling into other economies in the region.
The measures agreed to at the June 29, 2012, European Union (EU) summit and the European Central
Bank’s (ECB’s) establishment of the Outright Monetary
Transactions (OMT) program were steps in the right
direction and have improved financial conditions,
which nevertheless remain fragile. The baseline outlook
for the region, weaker now than expected in the April
2012 WEO (Figure 2.4), is for further anemic growth
or contraction in 2012 and a moderate pickup in
growth in 2013. The possibility that the euro area crisis

chapter 2

will escalate remains a major downside risk to growth
and financial sector stability until the underlying issues
are resolved.
Activity in Europe contracted by about ¼ percent
during the first half of 2012. The main new development was a further escalation of financial stress during
the second quarter in the euro area periphery, which,
despite some easing, did not fully reverse in the third
quarter through mid-September. The impact is most
direct in these economies themselves, and all except
Ireland are in recession now. But spillovers are increasingly reaching other economies in the region, given
strong trade and financial linkages (Figure 2.5). Rising
uncertainty about the viability of the Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) has been another drag on
the region. Tellingly, there has been no contribution
to growth from investment, in sharp contrast to other
advanced economies and major emerging market
economies. Finally, precrisis legacy issues, including
high household debt following housing booms, have
constrained private consumption, notably in Spain, but
also in Denmark and the United Kingdom.
Another factor has been the diminishing offset
from trade with faster-growing emerging market
and advanced economies. Economies in the region
with higher growth, including in the euro area core,2
have benefited from stronger trade linkages with
faster-growing economies outside the region. Still,
robust growth in Russia has provided some offset to
the weaker euro area external demand in emerging
Europe. On the financial side, capital outflows from
the periphery to perceived safe haven economies
in the region (Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavian
countries) have continued. These flows contributed
to declining yields on government bonds and have
fostered expanded domestic lending in recipient
economies, including for housing.
Monetary policy remains accommodative across the
region. But with increasing financial market segmentation due to country risk premiums in the euro area,
the transmission of conventional monetary policy
impulses to the periphery is impaired. The fiscal policy stance has been contractionary overall, especially
in the euro area periphery, where the structural fiscal

deficit as a share of GDP is expected to decline by
about 2½ percentage points in 2012, compared with
a decline of about ½ percentage point in 2011.
Near-term prospects for Europe are weaker now
than they were at the time of the April 2012 WEO.
The forecast assumes that policymakers in the euro
area succeed in containing the crisis through a combination of continued crisis management (including
implementation of reforms agreed to at the June summit), supportive demand management, and further
advancement of measures to deepen fiscal integration
and create a full-fledged banking union. Still, uncertainty will constrain confidence and activity for some
time, and downside risks loom large.
The baseline projects that economic activity will
pick up gradually, primarily in 2013 (Table 2.1). This
increasing activity reflects a number of factors, including improving external demand due to the pickup in
growth in some major emerging market economies,
a moderating pace of fiscal consolidation throughout
much of the region—Spain is an exception given that
consolidation must accelerate to meet deficit targets
in 2012–13—and a gradual further easing of financial
64

stress in the euro area periphery as fiscal adjustment
advances, policy support increases, and policy credibility and confidence improve. There are broad differences among European economies.
•• In the euro area, real GDP is projected to contract
at a rate of ½ percent in 2012 and to increase by
¼ percent in 2013. In the core economies, growth
will broadly stall in 2012, except in the Nether­
lands, where intensified fiscal consolidation is
expected to contribute to contraction. Except for
Ireland, which is in a bumpy recovery, the recessions
in the economies of the euro area periphery have
been deeper, and recovery is generally expected to
begin only in 2013, once adjustment moderates.
•• Growth in other advanced economies in Europe is
projected to moderate to ¼ percent in 2012 before
picking up in 2013. Domestic demand has generally remained stronger in many economies, reflecting lower precrisis imbalances and balance sheet
pressure, which, together with declining yields
from safe haven inflows, have helped cushion the
spillovers from the euro area crisis. One exception
is the United Kingdom, where the financial sector

chapter 2

was hit hard by the global financial crisis and where
ongoing repair of overstretched private and public
balance sheets weighs on domestic demand.
•• Emerging Europe was significantly affected by
the euro area crisis during the past year, including through the deleveraging of western European
banks and declining capital inflows (see Chapter
2 of the October 2012 Global Financial Stability
Report). Credit growth, in turn, decreased significantly. Trade with the euro area also decelerated
rapidly, and growth slowed sharply from late 2011.
Nevertheless, unlike in 2008, risk contagion from
the euro area crisis has remained limited, and credit
default swap spreads for most countries in the
region remain well below those for the economies
of the euro area periphery. Growth is projected to
strengthen from 2 percent in 2012 to about 2½
percent in 2013, largely owing to improving conditions elsewhere in Europe.
Headline inflation generally moderated in 2012
and is projected to decline further in the remainder
of 2012–13. In fact, where inflation either increased
or remained above target recently, the causes were
primarily one-time factors such as increases in energy
prices and indirect taxes. Although core inflation
has remained relatively stable over the past year, it is
expected to decrease as well, given the slowdown in
activity and large output gaps. With large downside
risks to the near-term growth outlook, there is a risk
of core inflation undershooting targets, especially in
other advanced Europe.
Downside risks predominate in Europe’s nearterm growth prospects. The most immediate risk
remains that delayed or insufficient policy action
will lead to further escalation of the euro area crisis.
Until the crisis is resolved, the situation remains precarious, and the broad interconnections among most
economies in the region point to larger spillovers in
Europe than in other regions.
The growth implications and spillovers from any
further escalation of the crisis will depend on the
scale and reach of the deterioration in confidence
and the response of capital flows.3 If the deterio3Chapter 2 of the April 2012 World Economic Outlook provides
an in-depth analysis of these linkages. It highlights the important
role of adverse feedback loops between rising funding pressure in
the banking system, increasing fiscal vulnerability, and slowing
aggregate demand and growth.

Country and Regional Perspectives

Figure 2.5. Europe: In the Midst of Economic and Financial Stress
Activity has slowed throughout Europe, with recession in the euro area periphery and the
United Kingdom. Increased uncertainty about policy and prospects has weighed on
conﬁdence and investment throughout the region. Growth in real private credit has fallen
below that of GDP in some economies, highlighting pressure from bank balance sheet
deleveraging and funding problems.

ration is confined to the periphery economies—
broadly mirroring developments during the past two
years—private capital outflows from crisis to core
economies will increase. The direct negative impact
on the periphery through external current accounts
and domestic demand would remain limited, however, because the euro system provides for automatic,
offsetting inflows. Still, financial conditions would
tighten as prospective bank losses increase; banks
in the periphery and, to a lesser extent, in the core
economies (largely because of cross-border asset
holdings in the periphery) would increase provisions
and precautionary cash holdings; and lending rates
would rise.
In contrast, if the euro area core economies were
hit by contagion—for example, resulting from
rapidly intensifying concerns about the integrity of
the EMU and its ability to manage the crisis—the
loss of investor confidence would also hit the core.
Sovereign risk premiums and yields would increase
in the periphery and the core, requiring additional
fiscal adjustment everywhere. Increased capital
outflows from the euro area as a whole would cause
depreciation of the euro by more than in the case of
limited contagion. Current accounts throughout the
euro area would adjust. Obviously, the output losses
in Europe and also outside the region would be
larger under this scenario.
The highest policy priority in Europe is to resolve
the crisis in the euro area. All other economies in the
region need a policy mix that supports their recoveries in a weak global growth environment, and many
also need to address fiscal sustainability challenges
and financial sector vulnerabilities.
Resolving the euro area crisis requires progress
toward banking and fiscal union in combination
with short-term demand support and crisis management at the euro area level.4
•• The agreements reached at the June 29, 2012, EU
summit, if fully implemented, will create a banking union and help break the adverse feedback
loops between sovereigns and banks—once an
effective single supervisory mechanism for euro
area banks is established, the ESM, which will be
operational beginning in October 2012, could be

Country and Regional Perspectives

able to recapitalize banks directly. But implementation hurdles are a concern, and additional steps
are needed. Banking union also requires a panEuropean deposit insurance guarantee program
and a bank resolution mechanism with common
backstops.
•• Regarding demand support, the ECB should keep
its policy rate low for the foreseeable future or
reduce it even further. OMTs, which the ECB will
consider for countries under a macroeconomic
adjustment or precautionary program with the
European Financial Stability Facility and its successor, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM),
should help ensure that low policy rates transmit
to borrowing costs in countries in the periphery
with a program. The ECB should also continue to
provide ample liquidity to banks.
•• The viability of the EMU must be supported by
wide-ranging structural reforms throughout the
euro area to raise growth and competitiveness,
thereby helping the resolution of intra-euro-area
current account imbalances.
•• Fiscal consolidation plans in the euro area must
be implemented. In general, attention should be
paid to meeting structural fiscal targets, rather
than nominal targets that will likely be affected by
economic conditions. Automatic stabilizers should
thus be allowed to operate fully in economies not
subject to market pressure. Considering the large
downside risks, economies with limited fiscal vulnerability should stand ready to implement fiscal
contingency measures if such risks materialize.
In other advanced economies in the region,
monetary policy needs to respond effectively to
a much weaker near-term environment that will
dampen price pressures, including through the use
of further unconventional measures. In the United
Kingdom, further monetary easing through unconventional measures may be necessary, depending
on the effects of the easing measures implemented
recently. With the prospect of somewhat weaker
global growth, automatic stabilizers should be
allowed to operate fully, and economies with
limited fiscal vulnerability (see the October 2012
Fiscal Monitor) should stand ready to implement
fiscal contingency measures if large downside risks
materialize.

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

In emerging Europe, the need for fiscal consolidation varies widely; economies with a high public
debt burden and exposed to market volatility must
continue with steady consolidation (Hungary).
Inflation pressure is set to decline rapidly in many
countries, giving central banks new room for easing.

The United States and Canada: Growth
Continues, but Slack Remains
In the United States, a modest recovery with weak
job creation continues amid a weak global environment, although the housing market is stabilizing. In
Canada, the recovery has been more robust, reflecting partly the effects of favorable financing conditions
with less pressure for balance sheet adjustment and
the commodity boom. The expansion is expected to
remain modest throughout 2012–13 (Figure 2.6). Both
external and domestic downside risks to the outlook
remain elevated. In the United States, it is imperative
to avoid excessive fiscal consolidation (the fiscal cliff ) in
2013, to raise the debt ceiling promptly, and to agree

on a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan. In
Canada, a priority is to limit risks related to elevated
house prices and household debt levels.
Output in the United States rose above the
precrisis peak in the second half of 2011, sooner
than in many other advanced economies (Figure
2.7, panels 1 and 2). Still, compared with earlier
recoveries, growth remains sluggish, consistent with
the broad evidence of significant legacy effects of
financial crises and housing busts. Job creation,
which accelerated in the second half of 2011, slowed
again in 2012. Weaker external conditions and
the confluence of global spillovers discussed above
explain much of the slowing, with a payback from
the unusually warm winter weather also temporarily weighing on growth in the second quarter. On
the demand side, growth in business investment lost
some momentum, in part due to the partial expiration of bonus depreciation allowances, although
uncertainty related to the fiscal and economic
outlook may have also played a role. Private consumption has also moderated since early 2012. The

Figure 2.7. United States and Canada: A Weak Recovery
Growth in the United States has been sluggish, and job creation has weakened. The recovery
is expected to remain tepid, given a weaker global environment and signiﬁcant domestic
policy uncertainty, including about the ﬁscal cliff. In Canada, easy ﬁnancing conditions, strong
credit growth, and robust commodity market conditions have supported domestic demand,
and activity has expanded at a faster pace than in other major advanced economies.

housing market is showing signs of stabilizing after a
sharp correction (Figure 2.7, panels 3 and 4).
In Canada, growth has been constrained by the
sluggish expansion in the United States—a result
of the two economies’ deep economic and financial
linkages—and the ongoing fiscal consolidation. Still,
activity has recovered at a faster pace than in the
United States. Domestic demand—both business
investment and private consumption—has been
supported by exceptionally favorable financing
conditions, including low interest rates and credit
availability. These factors, along with the commodity boom, have also boosted the housing sector,
especially in provinces with strong mining activity.
However, housing-related credit and household
leverage have risen markedly since the Great Recession, despite measures to limit mortgage growth
(Figure 2.7, panels 4 and 5).
The U.S. and Canadian economies are both projected to grow at about 2 percent during 2012–13
under the baseline, with uncertainty and weaker
external demand weighing on aggregate demand
(Table 2.2). U.S. inflation will stay subdued, given
lower commodity prices and persistent economic
slack, averaging 2 percent this year and declining to
1¾ percent in 2013.
The near-term growth outlook is subject to large
downside risks from both external and domestic
factors. The main external risk pertains to a further
escalation of the euro area crisis. Although safe
haven capital flows into the United States could help
to lower bond yields, supporting interest-sensitive
components of aggregate demand, they also have
been associated with real appreciation pressures,
which dampen exports. As noted above, U.S. growth
will also fall sharply if potential output in the United
States and its major trading partners disappoints and
risk aversion increases (Figure 2.2).
A major U.S. domestic risk is the potential
for much sharper fiscal contraction (Figure 2.7,
panel 6) if policymakers fail to reach agreement to
prevent large automatic tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect at the beginning
of 2013. At the extreme, the fiscal cliff could result
in a fiscal withdrawal of more than 4 percent of
GDP in 2013—about 3 percentage points of GDP
larger than the fiscal adjustment assumed under the

baseline. Growth would stall in 2013 with the full
materialization of the cliff and, as detailed in the
2012 Spillover Report (IMF, 2012b), would inflict
large spillovers on major U.S. trading partners and
also on commodity exporters (because of declines in
commodity prices).
Another fiscal risk, although relatively more
medium term, relates to a potential jump in the
risk premium on U.S. Treasury bonds, reflecting
investor concerns about the sustainability of U.S.
debt levels in the absence of a credible plan for
medium-term consolidation. The rise in longterm interest rates would lead to lower aggregate
demand and growth, particularly in the United
States but also elsewhere through asset price and
trade spillovers (see IMF, 2012b). More generally,
a deterioration in economic conditions in the U.S.
economy that hurts investor confidence and raises
risk aversion at the global level could induce sharp
swings in global capital flows and asset prices (see
the Spillover Feature).
Given its strong economic and financial ties with
the U.S. economy, Canada is equally exposed to
the risks facing its trading partner. In addition, an
important domestic vulnerability in Canada relates
to the housing market. A sharp or sustained decline
in house prices could seriously set back the leveraged
household sector and domestic demand.

Current Account Balance2

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

The urgent policy priorities in the United States
are to avoid excessive fiscal contraction in the short
term, promptly raise the debt ceiling, and agree on a
credible fiscal consolidation plan—centered around
entitlement and tax reforms—that places government
debt on a sustainable path in the medium term. The
latter would also contribute to global demand rebalancing, given that the U.S. current account position is
estimated to be weaker and the real effective exchange
rate stronger than they would be if a more desirable
path for fiscal deficits over the medium term were in
place (IMF, 2012a). Notwithstanding recent steps and
nascent signs of stabilization in the housing market,
more must be done to reduce the rate of foreclosures
and remove impediments to the transmission of low
long-term policy rates to mortgage rates.5 In this
regard, the recent measures by the Federal Reserve
on additional quantitative easing and the extension
of its low-interest-rate guidance until mid-2015 were
timely in limiting downside risks. Monetary policy
needs to remain accommodative while the government and household sectors continue to consolidate
5Key measures include increasing the participation of
government-sponsored enterprises in the principal reduction
program, supporting refinancing on a larger scale, and converting
foreclosed property into rental property to limit the downward
price pressure. See IMF (2012c) and Chapter 3 of the April 2012
World Economic Outlook.

their balance sheet positions. These and other priorities—including financial regulatory, labor market, and
structural reforms—are discussed in detail in Chapter
1 and in previous WEO reports.
In Canada, the key priority is to ensure that risks
from the housing sector and increases in household
debt remain well contained and do not create financial sector vulnerabilities. Thus far, mortgage credit
growth has slightly decelerated in response to the
measures taken by the authorities, including tighter
mortgage insurance standards. If household leverage
continues to rise, additional measures may need to
be considered.

Asia: Calibrating a Soft Landing
Growth in Asia has moderated further with weaker
external demand and the soft landing of domestic
demand in China. The outlook is for a modest pickup
in growth on the back of recent policy easing. Limited
direct financial spillovers and some room for policy easing
should be helpful in minimizing external downside risks.
Balancing external and internal risks will be important,
however, given that output gaps are still positive in some
economies in the region while credit growth remains
strong and that lower-than-expected potential output
growth and domestic imbalances are still risks.
Growth continued to moderate in much of
Asia during the first half of 2012. Slower growth
in import demand in most advanced economies
corresponded with weaker export growth in Asia.
Growth in China slowed further in the second
quarter of 2012, as the economy continued to adjust
to the policy tightening undertaken in 2010–11.
The tightening of monetary and credit policies has
been partly reversed in 2012, as price pressures
have eased and the residential real estate market has
cooled. This easing, however, has not yet gained the
traction expected earlier in the year. Slowing growth
in China has affected activity in the rest of Asia, a
consequence of the deepening of linkages throughout the region in the past decade.
In other parts of Asia, activity was boosted by
recovery from natural disasters and reconstruction,
notably in Japan and Thailand, but also in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, continued
strong mining activity and related investment have

also supported growth. In India, growth weakened
more than expected in the first half of 2012, an
outcome of stalled investment caused by governance
issues and red tape, and a deterioration in business
sentiment against the backdrop of a rising current
account deficit and the recent rupee depreciation.
Compared with the region’s growth performance
in recent years, the near- and medium-term outlooks
are less buoyant. This view reflects weaker anticipated
external demand resulting from the tepid growth prospects in major advanced economies and a downshift
in China’s and India’s growth prospects, with a return
to double-digit growth in China unlikely given the
policy objectives laid out in the 12th Five-Year Plan.
The main impetus for a moderate pickup in growth
from late 2012 will come from recent policy easing
in China and elsewhere. Specifically, growth in the
region is projected to average 5½ percent this year and
rise to 5¾ percent in 2013 (Table 2.3), downward
revisions of more than ½ percentage point for both
years relative to the April 2012 WEO (Figure 2.8).
•• Growth in China is projected to be about 7¾
percent this year and then to strengthen to 8¼
percent in 2013 as domestic demand growth,
especially investment growth, picks up with the
policy easing now under way.
•• Growth in India is projected to average 5 to 6
percent in 2012–13, more than 1 percentage
point lower than in the April 2012 WEO. The
downgrade reflects both an expectation that current drags on business sentiment and investment
will persist and a weaker external environment.
•• In Japan, growth is expected to reach almost 2¼
percent in 2012. Much of the recent strength is
attributable to reconstruction activity and some
rebound in manufacturing activity in the first half
of the year following the supply shocks associated
with the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami
and the Thai floods in October 2011. The effects
of these factors will fade, however, and growth is
projected to moderate to 1¼ percent in 2013.
•• Weaker external demand is the main factor underpinning generally modestly weaker growth in the
ASEAN-56 economies in 2012 (Figure 2.9, panels

growth has bounced back sharply, led by reconstruction and investment after the devastating floods in
October 2011. Overall, growth in the ASEAN-5
is projected to accelerate slightly to 5¾ percent in
2013, up from about 5½ percent in 2012.
•• In Korea, growth is projected to moderate to 2¾
percent this year but to pick up to about 3½
percent in 2013 because of a rebound in exports
and private investment, which is geared toward
the tradables sector.
Inflation in the region is projected to decline
from 5 percent in 2011 to about 4 percent during
2012–13. This is due, in part, to the recent decline
in commodity prices but also to the lagged effect of
the policy tightening during 2010–11 put in place
to relieve overheating pressure.
72

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

The balance of risks to the near-term growth
outlook is tilted to the downside, reflecting external
and, to a lesser extent in the near term, internal risks
to the region. In the short term, a further escalation of the euro area crisis and failure to address the
U.S. fiscal cliff are the main external risks for the
region. If these risks were to materialize, Asia’s open,
trade-oriented economies would be faced with lower
external demand and other spillovers (for example,
on confidence), and growth could be substantially
lower.
Much of the discussion of spillovers from
advanced economies to economies in emerging
Asia has focused on spillovers through trade and
confidence channels. However, as discussed in the
Spillover Feature, emerging Asia, like other emerging
markets, has become more integrated with global

financial markets (Figure 2.9, panels 3 and 4). With
the resulting higher exposure to financial shocks,
increases in financial stress in advanced economies
during the past few years have indeed been associated with lower capital flows and asset price declines
in the region. Overall, though, private capital flows
to the region have remained sizable and credit
growth strong (Figure 2.9, panel 5). With increased
exposure, volatility in global capital markets also
can have larger effects, including through effects on
exchange rates (as illustrated by safe haven effects
and the recent yen appreciation).
Among internal risks to the region, lower-thanexpected potential growth in emerging Asia in the
medium term is a key risk. As noted in Chapter 1,

the housing boom and similar temporary factors in
the major advanced economies may have contributed to the recent strong growth performance in the
region. China experienced residential real estate and
investment booms of its own, which accelerated during 2009–10 subsequent to macroeconomic policy
stimulus actions taken in response to the global
financial crisis. Strong credit growth has supported
demand across emerging market economies more
broadly, including in Asia, but cannot continue at its
recent pace without creating large financial stability
risks. In the event of simultaneous lower potential
growth in emerging Asia and in other regions, the
impact on growth would be sizable in Asia, as would
be the outward spillovers on commodity ­exporters

Growth in Asia has moderated further, given weaker external demand and the soft landing in
China. The downgrading of medium-term growth prospects in China will affect regional
growth performance because of China’s expanding trade linkages with other economies in
the region. The region has been exposed to ﬁnancial spillovers from advanced economies,
but capital ﬂows to its emerging market economies and credit growth both remain strong.

(see Figure 2.2). A related risk is that the recent surge
in investment in China could be reversed and result
in a sharper-than-expected investment slowdown
in the future. Such a shock would strongly affect
economies in the highly interlinked Asian supply
chain—for example, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan Province of China, and Thailand—including indirectly
through the large effects on other major manufacturing exporters, especially Germany and Japan.7
Policies must strike the right balance between
managing external and internal risks and orchestrating a soft landing. External risks have been more
pressing, and the recent shift toward monetary
easing across much of the region seems appropriate
for most economies, given decelerating inflation in
both advanced and emerging Asia. Even so, recent
rate cuts have used some of the available space in
emerging Asia—output gaps are still positive and
real policy rates remain well below their precrisis
averages. In India, where inflation is still high, monetary policy should stay on hold until a sustained
decrease in inflation materializes. In Japan, the
easing of monetary policy announced in September
should help support economic growth and exit from
deflation. Further easing of monetary policy may,
however, be needed for inflation accelerating toward
the Bank of Japan’s goal of 1 percent.
Should downside risks materialize, some economies (ASEAN-5, China, Korea) still have the fiscal
space to allow automatic stabilizers to operate fully,
if appropriate, or to use discretionary fiscal stimulus
(Figure 2.9, panel 6). In a number of economies,
however, addressing debt sustainability through credible fiscal consolidation remains a priority (India,
Japan, Vietnam). In Japan, the recent approval of a
gradual doubling of the consumption tax rate to 10
percent by 2015 is an important step toward putting public debt on a sustainable trajectory, although
further consolidation measures are needed to achieve
this goal. Structural fiscal policy reform is needed in a
number of economies in the region, including China,
to address social spending and protection as well as
infrastructure needs. By reducing distortions that hold
back private consumption, such reforms would lower

risks of a buildup in domestic imbalances and are part
of the set of desirable policies that would help rebalance global demand. Indeed, in a number of Asian
economies—including China, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand—current account positions are
stronger and currencies are weaker than they would
be with a more desirable set of policies.8
Against the risks of deteriorating credit quality
while growth is slowing, policymakers in many Asian
economies also need to guard against financial stability risks arising from recent rapid credit growth,
including by closely monitoring balance sheet health
and funding conditions in the banking and shadow
banking systems. In the event of global or local
liquidity shortages, central banks should stand ready
to backstop liquidity.

Latin America and the Caribbean: Losing
Some Buoyancy
With slowing growth, overheating pressures and
inflation in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)
have declined. Private capital flows remain strong and
financing conditions favorable. The outlook has deteriorated compared with the April 2012 WEO (Figure
2.10). Growth is expected to pick up later this year, as
recent policy easing gains traction. Risks to the nearterm growth outlook are to the downside, as elsewhere.
With continued rapid credit growth and inflation above
the midpoint of the target band in many economies in
the region, however, the priority is to rebuild macroeconomic policy space unless downside risks materialize.
Growth in the LAC region decelerated further
in the first half of 2012. Activity outside the region
moderated more than expected, including in emerging
Asia, which weakened external demand for LAC goods
and services. Together with weaker near-term global
prospects, this slump in activity also led to lower prices
for most commodities and terms-of-trade losses for
commodity exporters, which account for three-quarters of the region’s output. Domestic demand growth,
especially investment, cooled on the back of past policy tightening. The pickup in growth was lower than
expected in Brazil—an important cause of the weaker
regional growth performance—an acknowledgment of
8See

Country and Regional Perspectives

both poorer external conditions and slower transmission of the monetary policy easing since August 2011
as a result of an increase in nonperforming loans after
several years of rapid credit growth.
The LAC region has been exposed to financial spillovers from the euro area crisis and concerns about global
growth prospects, but their effects have been contained.
These spillovers contributed to increased risk aversion
and temporarily reduced capital flows to the region but
have not caused a reversal of flows (Figure 2.11). Foreign
currency debt spreads have increased, as in other emerging markets, but they remain well below recent highs.
At the same time, most of the region’s currencies have
appreciated, with the notable exception of the Brazilian
real (Figure 2.11, panels 1 and 2).
Spillovers from the region’s exposure to the operations of European banks, predominantly Spanish
banks, have also been contained, primarily because
the LAC operations of these banks are largely conducted by subsidiaries and funded by local deposits. Credit growth throughout the region has thus
remained robust, notwithstanding slowing activity.
Growth in the region is projected to moderate to
3¼ percent in 2012, before strengthening to about 4
percent in 2013 (Table 2.4). Among the commodity
exporters, recent monetary policy easing is expected
to spur stronger growth in Brazil from late 2012, led
by domestic demand. Employment growth is also
expected to remain robust, primarily in the domestic
services sectors. In most other commodity exporters,
growth is expected to remain close to potential for
the remainder of 2012 and in 2013, after moderating gradually during the past year or so. In Mexico,
growth has remained strong in 2012 but is expected
to moderate with the weaker near-term U.S. growth
prospects. Overall, growth is forecast to average 3¾
percent in 2012–13, somewhat above potential. In
Central America, where the outlook is closely tied
to developments in the United States, growth is
expected to moderate by ½ percentage point from
2011 to 4¼ percent in 2012–13. In the Caribbean,
high public debt and weak tourism and remittance
flows continue to constrain the outlook, and growth
is expected to remain lackluster at about 2¾ to 3½
percent.
Risks to the growth outlook are to the downside,
and the main risks are broadly aligned with those

affecting the global economy. The main near-term
risks relate to an escalation of the euro area crisis
and the U.S. fiscal cliff. The euro area risk scenario
analysis in Chapter 1 suggests that the peak decline
in regional output could amount to about ½ percent
relative to the baseline. This is modest compared
with other regions and reflects the LAC region’s
relatively low level of trade with Europe (only about
10 percent of goods exports) and limited financial
linkages. If global growth slowed sharply because
the United States failed to avoid the fiscal cliff, the
impact on the LAC region would be relatively larger
because of stronger linkages with the U.S. economy.
In both cases, countercyclical policy responses in the
region could help dampen the spillover effects on
domestic output.

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

In view of the region’s dependence on commodity
market developments, particularly in the Southern
Cone, the medium-term risks that have the greatest
impact on commodity prices are of particular concern. The Chapter 1 risk scenario of lower potential
growth in systemically important economies and
temporarily higher global risk aversion illustrates
this concern. Even if potential growth in the LAC
region were only ½ percentage point lower, the
short-term growth impact would be considerably
larger because a commodity price bust would follow the large output declines in emerging Asia and
the advanced economies. A sharper-than-expected
investment slowdown in China is another important
medium-term risk that could affect the LAC region.
China’s economic boom of the past decade has been

chapter 2

commodity intensive, boosting its market share in
global commodity markets, especially in industrial
base metals and raw materials, and leading to much
greater trade linkages with the LAC region. Among
the commodity exporters, the largest spillover effects
of an investment shock in China would be on undiversified exporters specializing in metal extraction
and trade; diversified exporters such as Brazil would
be relatively less affected (see IMF, 2012b).
Lower potential growth also is a risk from an
intraregional perspective because growth in the
region has been above historical trends during the
past decade or so, supported in part by financial
deepening and rapid credit growth. This success may
well have generated overly optimistic expectations
about potential growth in the medium term. There
are related risks of domestic financial instability after
years of rapid credit growth.
Against this backdrop, policymakers in the region
must be alert to spillovers from weaker prospects in
advanced economies and major emerging markets
outside the region, volatile capital flows, and emerging domestic financial risks. Nevertheless, policymakers must carefully balance these downside risks
with the remnants of recent overheating and reduced
policy space. Despite recent declines, inflation is still
above the midpoint of target bands, and output gaps
are close to zero or still positive. Concerns about
upside risks to inflation are particularly acute in
Venezuela and Argentina, where policies have not
been tightened noticeably and inflation continues
at high levels. Still, monetary policy should be the
first line of defense if global growth slows more than
expected, especially in economies with established
and tested inflation-targeting frameworks. As for
risks related to capital flows and financial stability,
policies must build on a strong foundation of prudential measures and further enhance risk-based prudential regulation and supervision. At the same time,
liquidity provision may also be needed if a change in
global risk sentiment leads to acute funding pressure
in the region’s banking systems.
Fiscal policy should continue to rebuild room
for maneuvering unless large downside risks materialize. New fiscal space is particularly important
for commodity exporters to buffer the downside
risks to global growth and commodity prices.

Country and Regional Perspectives

Figure 2.11. Latin America: A Moderate Slowdown
Private capital ﬂows to Latin America remain strong despite increased global risk aversion
and concerns about domestic strains. Inﬂation and overheating risks have declined, but with
continued rapid credit growth and inﬂation above the midpoint of the target band in many
economies in the region, the priority remains to rebuild macroeconomic policy space and
build on progress in macroprudential regulation and supervision unless downside risks
materialize.

More ­generally, the move to countercyclical macroeconomic policies has been an important factor
underpinning greater resilience in emerging market
economies (see Chapter 4). With output gaps close
to zero or still positive in many economies in the
region, a countercyclical policy stance would indicate
that fiscal policy needs to remain tight. Many economies in the region should also include structural
reforms aimed at boosting medium-term growth. In
Brazil, for example, infrastructure bottlenecks are a
constraint on growth. Recent steps to grant private
concessions to develop critical road and railway
78

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

infrastructure are a welcome step forward, but
increased public investment is also needed. Greater
resolve is required to reduce debt overhang in the
Caribbean while addressing weak competitiveness.

Commonwealth of Independent States:
Growth Is Still Robust
Growth in the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) is expected to moderate slightly in line with
the projected small decline in commodity prices and
a weaker external environment. The region remains

chapter 2

vulnerable to stress from advanced economies, given
the CIS’s deeper economic and financial linkages with
the euro area. The region should take advantage of the
still-favorable current economic conditions to rebuild
policy space.
Growth remained robust in the CIS through the
beginning of 2012, supported by high prices for key
commodities, good harvests in 2011, and strong
remittance flows. However, financial conditions
in the three largest CIS economies (Kazakhstan,
Russia, Ukraine) have been significantly affected by
increased financial stress in the euro area periphery
and higher global risk aversion: sovereign spreads
have widened; stock prices have fallen; and capital
outflows have risen. Investment growth has weakened, but expansionary fiscal policies and strong
credit growth in Russia and other energy exporters
have dampened the overall growth impact.
Regional growth is expected to average 4 percent
during 2012–13 compared with close to 5 percent in
2011, in response to a weaker external environment

Country and Regional Perspectives

and terms-of-trade losses from the slight decline
in commodity prices (Table 2.5; Figures 2.12 and
2.13).
•• Russia’s growth is projected at about 3¾ percent
during 2012–13, led by domestic demand, which
is supported by an expansionary fiscal stance and
a rebound in credit growth. Growth is projected
to moderate in the region’s other energy-exporting
economies, mainly owing to weaker growth in the
energy sector, although strong public spending
should help sustain activity in other sectors.
•• The global growth slowdown is projected to have
a larger impact on some of the region’s energyimporting economies. Growth in Ukraine will
slow to 3 percent in 2012 compared with more
than 5 percent in 2011, driven by weaker export
and domestic demand growth. In Belarus, lower
domestic demand after the 2011 currency crisis
will weigh on growth. In the Kyrgyz Republic
and Tajikistan, activity is supported by strong
remittances and import demand from Russia

(deferred gold production increases planned for
2012 will temporarily lower growth in the Kyrgyz
Republic).
Inflation is projected to moderate during 2012–
13 compared with 2011, reflecting favorable harvests
in many economies of the region, monetary policy
tightening in some, and a slight retreat in commodity prices. The recent surge in global food prices,
however, could push prices up temporarily, and
demand pressures remain strong in energy exporters.
As in other regions, the balance of risks to the
near-term outlook is tilted to the downside. In view
of the region’s strong dependence on commodity
exports, most major risks to global growth discussed
in Chapter 1 would be of concern to the CIS region
because they would involve large commodity price
80

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

declines. For the energy importers in the region,
direct trade spillovers from a further escalation of
the euro area crisis would also be sizable given that
Europe is the most important trading partner outside the region.
If downside risks materialize, external balances
would deteriorate, which would tend to exacerbate
capital outflows and put pressure on currencies,
especially in energy importers with large external
financing needs (Ukraine). More flexible exchange
rates and a reduction in balance sheet mismatches
(Kazakhstan, Russia) would help cushion the growth
impact compared with the 2009 downturn. The
impact on Russia, should any of the downside risks
materialize, would be critical for the region as a
whole, given the tight linkages between Russia and

chapter 2

other CIS economies via trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), and remittances.
Against this backdrop, the major CIS economies
should take advantage of the current, still-robust
economic conditions to rebuild fiscal policy buffers. In Russia, the non-oil fiscal deficit is more
than three times larger than it was before the
Great Recession. In energy importers, the fiscal
adjustment should aim to put public debt on a
downward trajectory (Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan),
which would also lower external vulnerabilities by
reducing large current account deficits (Armenia,
Georgia).
Consolidation efforts should be accompanied
by structural reforms, a strengthening of fiscal
frameworks, and improvements in the quality and
efficiency of public spending.
In some economies, further monetary policy
tightening is needed to rein in inflation expectations
(Belarus, Mongolia, Uzbekistan). If downside risks
materialize, however, monetary and fiscal policies may need to be eased, maintaining a balance
between immediate stabilization needs and mediumterm objectives.
Global risks also call for speeding up financial
system repair and improving the region’s resilience to
negative external spillovers of financial stress (see the
Spillover Feature). Although progress has been made
to strengthen the banking system, bank balance
sheets are still impaired in a number of economies
faced with a significant share of nonperforming
loans (Ukraine) and poor capital adequacy (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan).

Country and Regional Perspectives

Figure 2.13. Commonwealth of Independent States: Vulnerable to
Negative Spillovers
Growth in the CIS has remained robust, supported by high prices for key commodities and
good harvests in 2011, although indicators suggest some moderation of activity in recent
months. Financial conditions in the three largest CIS economies (Kazakhstan, Russia,
Ukraine) have deteriorated with increased ﬁnancial stress in the euro area periphery and
higher global risk aversion. Given downside risks, the priority is to strengthen policies by
improving ﬁscal balances, accelerating ﬁnancial system reform, and tightening the monetary
stance where inﬂation risks are high.

Differences in the economic performance of oil exporters and oil importers have widened. Higher government
spending in most oil exporters has supported robust
growth. Elsewhere, uncertainties from political and
economic change after the Arab Spring, slowing growth
in major trading partners, and, in some cases, internal
conflict have led to a marked weakening in activity. For
oil importers, the policy priority will be preserving or
rebuilding macroeconomic stability while defining and
implementing a reform agenda to accelerate growth. For

high oil prices to diversify their economies.
Growth in the Middle East and North Africa
(MENA) region was relatively subdued at 3¼ percent in 2011, but is projected to strengthen to 5¼
percent in 2012 on account of oil exporters (Table
2.6).9 Growth in oil exporters is expected to accelerate from about 4 percent in 2011 to 6½ percent
in 2012, largely as a result of a strong rebound of
activity in Libya since late 2011. In most other
oil exporters, non-oil GDP growth is expected to
remain robust in 2012, supported by ratcheted-up

government spending as oil prices remain at historically high levels, while oil sector growth is forecast to
moderate somewhat after a strong increase in 2011
(Figure 2.14). The boost from Libya will moderate
in 2013, when growth in the oil exporters of the
region is projected to be 3¾ percent.
In contrast, growth in oil importers has been about
1¼ percent during 2011–12, reflecting the effects of
social unrest and political uncertainty, weak external
demand, and high oil prices. Uncertainty and unrest
have led to a pullback from the region, evidenced most
dramatically in steep declines in tourism and FDI (Figure 2.15). At the same time, the contraction of activity
in advanced Europe—a major trading partner for most
economies in the group—has been a drag on growth.
Looking forward, uncertainty is expected to decrease
as political transitions stabilize, while external demand

picks up, and growth in oil importers is projected to
recover to 3¼ percent in 2013.
Risks to the near-term outlook for oil exporters
revolve primarily around oil prices and global growth,
given that all major risks to global growth discussed in
Chapter 1 involve lower oil prices. For oil exporters,
government expenditures have risen to such a degree
that substantial declines in the price of oil could
undermine fiscal positions. Despite significant accrued
financial buffers, such declines could put at risk ongoing infrastructure investment and growth. On the
upside, Iran-related and other geopolitical risks could
lead to higher oil prices.
Oil importers face both external and internal
risks. On the external side, they are vulnerable to
trade spillovers if downside risks to growth in major
economies materialize.10 Another concern is risks
to internal and external balances from upside risks
10 The November 2012 Regional Economic Outlook: Middle East
and Central Asia provides a detailed analysis of spillovers from the
economies of the Gulf Cooperation Council to other MENA
economies.

to food and fuel prices (see the Special Feature in
Chapter 1). Because of extensive food and fuel
subsidies in most economies, the immediate concern
with spikes in commodity prices is not the effect
on inflation and disposable income, but rather the
strain on budgets and foreign exchange reserves.
More broadly, meeting social demands when growth
has slowed and political uncertainty has increased
has resulted in higher budget deficits and declines in
foreign exchange reserves in non-oil importers.
A general policy priority in the MENA region is
to secure economic and social stability through more
inclusive medium-term growth. Achieving this goal
will require institutional and regulatory reform to
stimulate private sector activity and ensure greater
and more equal access to economic opportunities
and measures to address chronically high unemployment, particularly among the young.
Maintaining macroeconomic stability while supporting strong, inclusive medium-term growth will be an
important policy challenge. Increased spending on food
and fuel subsidies, along with pressure to raise civil serInternational Monetary Fund | October 2012

Figure 2.15. Middle East and North Africa: An Uneven Recovery
Continued high oil prices, increased oil production, and increased government spending have
supported robust activity in oil exporters. Internal conﬂicts and their aftermath remain a
source of uncertainty, and tourism has not yet recovered. The increases in government
expenditure in oil exporters in the region have raised the break-even oil price (the price at
which oil revenue covers the non-oil budget deﬁcit), implying that signiﬁcant oil price
declines could undermine ﬁscal positions.

vice wages and pensions, risks straining public finances.
In oil exporters, it will be critical to contain increases
in spending on entitlements that are hard to reverse.
Instead, the focus should be on productivity-enhancing
spending on human capital and infrastructure investment, which could also support diversification of their
economies. In oil importers, policy buffers have been
diminished, creating pressures for fiscal consolidation.
Structural fiscal reforms aimed at reorienting government spending toward poverty reduction and the
promotion of productive investment will be crucial to
improving the budget outlook. Improved targeting of
subsidies, especially through fuel subsidy reforms, will
be an important step in this respect.

Sub-Saharan Africa: A Continued Favorable
Outlook
Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to continue growing
strongly in the near term, with regional differences in
prospects reflecting in part economies’ varying exposure
to external shocks (Figure 2.16). As elsewhere, external
risks remain elevated. Policymakers in the region should
use the window provided by strong growth to rebuild
budgetary space and normalize monetary conditions to
be better prepared for downside risks.
Economic activity in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has
expanded by more than 5 percent in each of the past
three years—continuing a decade-long run of strong
performance that was only briefly interrupted by the
global downturn in 2009 (Figure 2.17, panels 1 and
2). Most SSA economies are participating in this
solid expansion, with the notable exception of South
Africa, which has been hampered by its strong linkages with Europe, as well as some countries in western
Africa affected by drought and civil conflict. More
recently, some food importers in the region have also
been hit by the sharp increase in global food prices for
a few major crops—leading to higher headline inflation and widening trade imbalances—although so far
with less severe effects than during the 2007–08 food
price shocks (see Chapter 1, Box 1.5).
The region’s recent growth has occurred against a
backdrop of difficult external conditions, including
the escalation of the euro area crisis. But apart from
South Africa, financial spillovers from Europe to the
region have been modest (Figure 2.17, panel 3).

Export diversification has reduced exposure to weak
demand from advanced economies, and high commodity prices have supported the region’s commodity exporters and boosted investment in resource
extraction. However, as documented in Chapter 4,
improved policy frameworks and judicious use of
policy space in response to adverse shocks have been
important elements in these economies’ improved
performance during the past decade.
In the baseline scenario, under which strains
in the euro area remain contained and the global
economy expands by 3¼ to 3½ percent this year
and next, growth in SSA will continue above 5 percent during 2012–13 (Table 2.7).
•• Growth in the oil-exporting economies is projected to remain high, near 6 percent in 2012;
increased oil production in Angola will expand its
GDP by close to 6¾ percent this year. In Nigeria, non-oil GDP growth will moderate with the
softer external environment and tighter macroeconomic policies, but a slight rebound in oil output
will keep overall GDP growth at 7 percent.

•• Among the middle-income countries, growth
in South Africa is projected to be 2½ percent
in 2012—below most estimates of potential
growth—largely because of strong linkages with
Europe. Growth is expected to rebound to 3
percent next year under the relatively favorable external conditions of the WEO baseline.
Output growth in Cameroon is expected to
strengthen this year and next, with the non-oil
sector being supported by major public investment projects and measures to boost agricultural
productivity.
•• The region’s low-income economies face varying outlooks. In Ethiopia, growth is projected to
decelerate moderately this year and next, reflecting
weaker external demand and an increasingly constrained environment for private sector activity.
In Kenya, tight monetary conditions have slowed
consumption, but construction activity and
corporate investment remain buoyant and will
support an acceleration of growth to 5 percent
this year and 5½ percent in 2013.

Figure 2.17. Sub-Saharan Africa: A Strong Expansion
Economic activity in sub-Saharan Africa has been expanding by 5 percent or more a year
throughout the past decade, except during the global downturn in 2008–09. High commodity
prices have supported the region’s commodity exporters and boosted investment in resource
extraction. Better policy frameworks and judicious use of policy space in responding to
adverse shocks have also contributed to this improved performance. But with
macroeconomic policies still accommodative in much of the region, rebuilding policy buffers
is a priority.

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

Risks to the outlook remain high, primarily
because of global uncertainties. If the euro area crisis
escalates further and global growth slows further,
SSA’s prospects will be less favorable. The primary
channel for spillovers is trade. South Africa, strongly
linked to Europe, would be particularly affected,
with possible repercussions for some economies in
southern Africa, and softer commodity prices would
adversely affect the region’s natural resource exporters.11 Another key risk relates to the possible further
elevation of global food prices, which would undermine the external and fiscal balances of the food
importers in the region. For the medium term, a
potential sharp slowdown in China would also affect
the region adversely, not only because of the region’s
deepening trade linkages with China in the past several years (see Figure 2.SF.7) or through the effect on
global commodity prices (see IMF, 2012b), but also
because of China’s increasingly important contribution to the region’s FDI and official financing.12
The priority in much of the region is to continue to
strengthen policy buffers and prepare contingency plans
if downside risks materialize. Macroeconomic policies
have remained generally accommodative, although
a surge in inflation during 2011 prompted a sharp
tightening of monetary policy in several east African
economies. In several countries, some fiscal consolidation is also under way. If downside risks to the global
economy materialize, economies without significant
financing constraints should stand ready to ease policies
in response. But countries that are in the process of
reducing elevated inflation will need to maintain tight
monetary policies. The situation is different in South
Africa, where four years of macroeconomic stimulus
have significantly diminished the policy space available to deal with an adverse shock. This constraint is
particularly acute on the fiscal side, where fiscal space
will shrink further in a global slowdown; under such a
scenario the authorities may need to rely more heavily
on countercyclical monetary policy to cushion the
economy against adverse spillovers.

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

Spillover Feature: The Financial Transmission of Stress in the Global Economy
Four years after the global financial crisis, the
world economy is still struggling to achieve sustained
expansion amid major downside risks. This Spillover
Feature sheds light on a number of concerns relating
to the weak recovery: Could a major intensification of the euro area crisis or renewed U.S. financial
stress induce contagion effects? Have such spillovers
increased over time? Can a sharp economic slowdown in China affect financial conditions elsewhere?
Financial markets react differently to stress
depending on the strength of offsetting factors.
Capital may flow out of economies under stress to
regions in which perceived economic prospects and
financial returns are higher. However, if banks in the
economies under stress are forced to reduce leverage by unwinding their cross-border exposures, this
would cause capital outflows from across the world.1
Stress could also dampen risk appetite more generally and precipitate a flight to safety out of all risky
assets, depressing asset prices and financing conditions more broadly.
We assess the nature of global contagion during episodes of financial stress in the United States
and the euro area as well as the contagion of shocks
to real activity specific to China. We gauge this
contagion by tracking developments in weekly bond
and equity flows to advanced and emerging market
economy funds and daily equity prices and sovereign
yields in the immediate aftermath of these stress
episodes. However, the spillovers evident in the
analysis should be interpreted as associations rather
than drivers of stress because we do not identify the
factors underlying the stress nor control for common
factors that may be affecting global financial markets
concurrently.2

Feature in Chapter 2 of the April 2012 World Economic Outlook.

markets depend on the level of global risk repricing.

The findings confirm that global financial conditions are vulnerable to stress in major economies.
Global capital flows and asset prices tend to be
weaker in the period after stress compared with the
period before. However, the magnitudes of the spillovers are generally smaller now than they were during the global financial crisis. Stress related to sharp
economic downswings in China has also become a
source of financial contagion, although more so for
emerging market and developing economies than
for advanced economies. For many emerging market
and developing economy regions, stress during the
euro area crisis has been transmitted more quickly to
equity than to bond flows, whereas in the aftermath
of the global financial crisis, both bond and equity
flows were similarly affected by stress. The greater
persistence of bond flows may be indicative of
increased investor confidence about these economies,
but could also be the result of a search for yield in a
time of low global interest rates.
The consequences of stress vary by region, likely
reflecting differences in underlying vulnerabilities
and in exposures to the various types of stress. The
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and
emerging Europe—which have deeper economic and
financial ties with the euro area—have experienced
somewhat larger swings in financial conditions than
others during the euro area crisis. Spillovers for other
regions are relatively smaller. Stress emanating from
China coincides with sharper declines in financial
conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean
(LAC), sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and the Middle
East and North Africa (MENA) than elsewhere—
possibly because of these regions’ ties with China
for oil and other commodity exports. These findings
resonate with recent studies highlighting the role of
spillovers.3
3Fratzscher,

Lo Duca, and Straub (2012) analyze the spillover
consequences of unconventional monetary policy announcements
by the Federal Reserve. Bayoumi and Bui (2011) document the
consequences of U.S. fiscal, financial, and monetary policies on
asset prices for a number of systemically important economies.
IMF (2011a, 2012b) consider other scenarios to analyze the
potential global effects of a further intensification of the crisis

Spillover Feature: The Financial Transmission of Stress in the Global Economy

Defining Stress
To compare the consequence of stress in recent
years with that during the global financial crisis, we
distinguish between two sample periods: (1) January 2007 through 2009, which included the U.S.
subprime mortgage meltdown and culminated in
the global financial crisis; and (2) January 2010 to
mid-2012, the period of the euro area crisis.
Financing conditions for sovereigns in the euro
area periphery have sharply deteriorated only with the
escalation of their debt crises.4 The volatility in their
financing conditions, as measured by the range of
daily 10-year sovereign spread changes relative to German bunds, has also increased (Figure 2.SF.1, panels 1
and 3). Conversely, U.S. financial market uncertainty,
as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Market Volatility Index (VIX), is relatively lower now
(Figure 2.SF.1, panels 2 and 4). However, the VIX
has experienced occasional volatility in recent years:
in May 2010, possibly related to contagion from the
outbreak of the Greek crisis, and in late 2011 during
the acrimonious U.S. debt-ceiling debate and the
escalation of sovereign funding pressure in Italy.
How were episodes of financial stress in the
advanced economies chosen? Drawing on Romer
(2012), episodes of high stress in a euro area periphery economy are defined as days in which the change
in the daily 10-year sovereign spread was in the 95th
percentile of its distribution for the given sample
period (see Figure 2.SF.1). The euro area periphery
as a whole is considered to have been under stress
when all periphery economies were under stress as
defined by the above metric. For the United States,
stress is defined as days in which the VIX level is
higher than 30 and the daily VIX increase is in the
95th percentile of the distribution.5 We filter out
in the euro area. See also Chapter 4 of the October 2009 World
Economic Outlook.
4The euro area periphery economies considered here comprise
Greece, Ireland, Italy, and Spain.
5Although the U.S. 10-year sovereign yield could serve as an
alternative proxy for tracking U.S. stress, this yield has declined
in periods of stress in part because of the dollar’s status as a
safe haven currency and in part because of the Federal Reserve’s
unconventional measures to lower rates (see IMF, 2012b, for
the effects of unconventional Federal Reserve measures on U.S.
sovereign yields). Therefore, the VIX is a better gauge of U.S.
financial stress.

Economies and the United States, 2007–12
(Percentage points for daily spread changes and points for VIX)1

Financing conditions faced by the euro area periphery economies sharply deteriorated
during the euro area crisis. In contrast, U.S. ﬁnancial market stress is somewhat lower now
than during the global ﬁnancial crisis.

Global ﬁnancial crisis
(Jan. 2007–Dec. 2009)

consecutive days of stress in a region by restricting
each stress episode to those that occur at least one
month after the previous episode. The final number
of stress episodes is determined by the days during
which the euro area periphery, the United States, or
both were under stress.
Focusing on the euro area crisis period, we
identify episodes of real activity-related stress from
China as periods during which China’s manufacturing activity is weaker than can be explained by its
external trade links. Specifically, we first single out
residuals from a 12-month rolling regression of the
Chinese manufacturing purchasing managers’ index
(PMI) on U.S. and euro area PMIs only when
they are in the bottom quartile of the distribution.
Among these, episodes since 2011 that do not
coincide with the episodes of advanced economy
stress are considered China-induced stress events.6
The above criteria identify 15 stress episodes for
the advanced economies and 2 for China (Figure
2.SF.2, Table 2.SF.1). As expected, during the
global financial crisis, stress was experienced mainly
in the United States, whereas during 2010 through
mid-2012, stress was experienced by both the
United States and the euro area periphery, although
increasingly by only the latter since late 2011.

We use data on portfolio capital flows compiled
by Emerging Portfolio Fund Research (EPFR) to
track capital flow movements at a weekly frequency.
These data suggest a drying up of capital flows from
most regions at the outbreak of the global financial
crisis (Figure 2.SF.3, panels 1 and 2).7 However,
6Manufacturing PMIs are released on the first working day of
the month, so the specific China-induced stress date is the first
working day of the month identified as a stress episode. Even
so, given the lower frequency for the PMI data, the case for a
correctly identified shock emanating from China is weaker than
for the advanced economies, whose stress dates were identified
using daily data. Thus, the results relating to China-specific stress
should be treated with caution.
7These data are not available at daily frequency for most
regions. Although EPFR funds do not cover all portfolio flows,
recent studies find a close match between EPFR and balance of
payments gross portfolio flows (Fratzscher, 2011; Miao and Pant,
2012).

capital flow volatility increased even before the
crisis—as early as January 2007 for developing Asia
and late 2007 for LAC economies. Flows picked
up for most regions from the second half of 2009,
although volatility has increased again since early
2011. Since late 2009, there has also been a change
in the composition of portfolio flows toward bond
flows for both advanced and emerging market and
developing economies (Figure 2.SF.3, panel 3). The
rise in bond flows for the latter marks a shift from
the steady decline in the share of debt-creating
inflows in the run-up to the global financial crisis.8
8See

Chapter 4 of the April 2011 World Economic Outlook.

Event studies based on the identified stress episodes confirm that stress in major economies tends
to be associated with lower global capital flows. The
exercise compares the level of capital flows to alternative regions in the week of and the weeks before
and after stress, and then averages across all stress
episodes within each sample period. Lower flows
in the weeks of and after stress relative to the week
before suggest that foreign investors’ appetite for
cross-border investment is lower during stress (Figure 2.SF.4). The poststress decline in flows during
the euro area crisis is generally not as sharp as that
observed during the global financial crisis, although
there is considerable regional heterogeneity:

•• Advanced economies tend to experience greater
declines in capital flows when their own economies are under stress compared with periods of
China-specific stress (Figure 2.SF.4, panels 1–4).
With the exception of advanced Asia, flows to
advanced economies do not fall immediately
after China-related stress and, in fact, increase
for some.
•• Although capital flows to emerging market and
developing economies also dry up after stress,
the scale varies by region (Figure 2.SF.4, panels
5–10). For the CIS, poststress capital outflows
during the euro area crisis are larger than in
other emerging market and developing economies and almost as sharp as outflows during
the global financial crisis, whereas for emerging
Europe flows continue to be lower even in the
week after stress. This may reflect in part these
regions’ ties with the euro area and the effects of
increased deleveraging by euro area banks, many
of which have a strong presence in the CIS and
emerging Europe.
•• The evidence of contagion from China is
stronger for emerging market and developing
economies, particularly in the LAC, MENA, and
SSA regions, likely reflecting commodity trade
linkages, but also for emerging Europe.9
Stress has affected bond and equity flows differently over time, suggesting that investors are
increasingly distinguishing between asset classes
rather than between economies (Figure 2.SF.5).10
During the euro area crisis, bond flows—including
to emerging market and developing economies—
have held up more than equity flows after stress,
declining in level but not reversing immediately.
The decline in equity flows is generally sharper. In
contrast, during the global financial crisis, bond
flows were generally negative and fell further after
stress (equity flows behaved in a similar fashion). It
is possible that investors increasingly consider that

Chinese investment growth on growth in commodity exporters
through direct trade linkages and global commodity prices.
10The EPFR database does not have data on bond and equity
fund flow breakdowns for every country. Therefore, total flows
for a country are included in the regional aggregates only if both
bond and equity fund flows are available. See Table 2.SF.2 for

Spillover Feature: The Financial Transmission of Stress in the Global Economy

Figure 2.SF.4. Global Fund Flows during Stress

Figure 2.SF.5. The Composition of Capital Flows during Stress

Global capital ﬂows are generally weaker during the week of and the week after advanced
economy stress than during the week before stress. For most regions, the swings in ﬂowsaround stress episodes are still somewhat smaller compared with those experienced during
the global ﬁnancial crisis. Stress from China also tends to coincide with lower ﬂows but
more dominantly for emerging market and developing economies that have strong traderelated ties with China.

Bond ﬂows have tended to be relatively more resilient to stress than equity ﬂows during the
euro area crisis.

these economies issue higher-quality assets given
the resilience of their expansions. However, it could
also reflect a greater thirst for yield in an environment of ultra-low interest rates.

Contagion through Asset Prices
The above results using weekly capital flows are
complemented by studying the poststress behavior
of global sovereign yields and equity prices, the
data for which are available at a daily frequency.
Global asset prices tend to tighten in periods of
stress—sovereign yields rise and equity prices fall
(Figure 2.SF.6)—although the size of spillovers has
typically varied across regions:
•• During the euro area crisis, for emerging
Europe, the CIS, and LAC, the average sovereign yields in the two days after stress were 8
to10 basis points higher compared with average
yields in the two days before stress. During the
global financial crisis, the rise in yields after
stress was generally larger, particularly for the
CIS. For developing Asia, stress has been associated with a decline in sovereign yields in both

96		 International Monetary Fund | October 2012

crisis periods, but more so during the euro area
crisis. This observation is consistent with the
greater persistence of bond flows observed for
emerging market and developing economies over
time. Yields in most advanced economies also
tend to be lower after stress, more so during the
euro area crisis period, reflecting in part a flight
to quality.
•• Both equity and financial equity prices are lower
after stress, with the poststress declines in financial equity prices slightly larger than those in
overall equity prices for most regions. During the
euro area crisis, for most regions, equity prices
were lower by 1 to 3 percentage points for the
two days after stress (compared with the average
two-day prices before stress), while the decline
was about 4 percentage points for the CIS and
euro area economies. These declines were larger
during stress in the global financial crisis.
•• Sovereign yields do not exhibit any specific pattern during China-specific stress episodes. Equity
and financial equity prices are generally weaker
after such stress, particularly for commodityexporting regions (LAC, MENA).

Spillover Feature: The Financial Transmission of Stress in the Global Economy

Conclusions
The analysis confirms that financial or real stress
in major economies can affect global financial
conditions either because stress occurs concurrently everywhere or because of spillover effects.
Global capital flows decline, equity prices fall,
and sovereign yields generally rise following such
stress. Although spillovers have been smaller in
recent years than during the global financial crisis,
economies with greater linkages to advanced economies—emerging Europe and the CIS region—
remain vulnerable. Swings in financial conditions
are also experienced around stress from downswings
in Chinese real economic activity, particularly for
commodity exporters. The recent shift in financial markets away from equity to bond flows in
emerging market and developing economies could
suggest that bonds issued by the latter are now
considered safer for investors than before. However,
it could also reflect a search for yield in the face
of low global interest rates, which raises concerns
about a potential increase in the exposure of these
economies to such debt-creating flows.
The real implications of stress can be severe
in the context of strong macrofinancial linkages
in systemically important economies.11 Growth
spillovers from these economies can be large given
the sizable trade linkages of most regions with these
economies (Figure 2.SF.7). More generally, a sharp
rise in global risk aversion—the proxy used here
for U.S. financial strain—is also associated with a
higher likelihood of the end of economic expansions in emerging market and developing economies (see Chapter 4).
Policymakers should focus on limiting the
potential for such stress in the first place, which
involves a range of policies, as discussed in Chapter
1. For economies at the receiving end, it is crucial
to maintain strong macroeconomic and prudential
policies that sustain market confidence and increase
resilience to potential contagion.

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: 100 Years of Dealing with
Public Debt Overhangs

Throughout the past century, numerous advanced
economies have faced public debt burdens as high, or
higher, than those prevailing today. They responded
with a wide variety of policy approaches. We analyze
these experiences to draw lessons for today and reach
three main conclusions. First, successful debt reduction requires fiscal consolidation and a policy mix
that supports growth. Key elements of this policy mix
are measures that address structural weaknesses in the
economy and supportive monetary policy. Second, fiscal
consolidation must emphasize persistent, structural
reforms to public finances over temporary or short-lived
fiscal measures. In this respect, fiscal institutions can
help lock in any gains. Third, reducing public debt
takes time, especially in the context of a weak external
environment.
Public debt in advanced economies has climbed
to its highest level since World War II. In Japan,
the United States, and several European countries,
it now exceeds 100 percent of GDP (Figure 3.1).
Low growth, persistent budget deficits, and high
future and contingent liabilities stemming from
population-aging-related spending pressure and weak
financial sectors have markedly heightened concerns
about the sustainability of public finances. These
concerns have been reflected in ratings downgrades
and higher sovereign borrowing costs, especially for
some European countries. Correcting fiscal imbalances and reducing public debt have therefore
become high priorities.
There is, however, a widespread and ongoing debate over the most appropriate policy mix
for achieving a successful adjustment. According
to some, fiscal austerity is essential to resolve the
current crisis. Others argue that fiscal austerity is
self-defeating, given its contractionary effect on
output, and that reinvigorating growth through fiscal

Figure 3.1. Public Debt in Advanced Economies
Gross public debt as a percent of GDP among advanced economies has reached historical
highs: Japan, the United States, and many European countries currently have debt-to-GDP
ratios close to or above 100 percent.

stimulus is more important.1 Still others point to the
experience of financial repression after World War II
and suggest this as a model for resolving the current
debt overhang.2
This chapter informs the current policy debate
by reviewing the historical experiences of advanced
economies that have reached debt-to-GDP ratios as
high as today’s. The policy responses differed greatly,
as did the outcomes. The richness of this historical
experience provides insight into the full spectrum of
policy options currently under consideration. In particular, the chapter addresses the following questions:
•• How successful were countries in reducing high
public debt ratios in the past?
•• Which policy mix proved most effective? What
were the contributions of fiscal, monetary, and
financial sector policies?
•• What were the macroeconomic consequences of
the policies pursued?
•• What does historical experience suggest for countries dealing with high debt today?
To address these points, we do not focus only on
large debt reductions, as done in previous studies, but we review more broadly “what happens
next?” after debt rises above 100 percent of GDP.
This allows us to take in the full range of possible
outcomes rather than just the successes, which might
paint a distorted picture of debt dynamics. Indeed,
some of the most instructive episodes are those in
which public debt increased.3
We focus on six case studies spanning almost 100
years, from the United Kingdom in the immediate
aftermath of World War I, through the United States
after World War II, to Belgium, Canada, Italy, and
Japan in the 1980s and 1990s. These episodes cover
1See,

for example, Krugman (2012).
repression occurs “when governments implement
policies to channel to themselves funds that in a deregulated
market environment would go elsewhere” (Reinhart, Kirkegaard,
and Sbrancia, 2011). It commonly involves explicit or indirect
caps on government debt interest rates, combined with other
regulations to ensure a market for this debt. See also Reinhart and
Sbrancia (2011).
3By selecting the sample of episodes on the basis of ex ante
criteria rather than ex post success, this chapter is similar in spirit
to, though distinct from and complementary to, the approach of
Mauro (2011), which looks at large planned fiscal consolidations
and compares plans against outcomes for the G7 countries and
EU member countries during the past few decades.

a full range of policy approaches and economic outcomes. In-depth analysis allows us to more clearly
identify the policy mix pursued by each country and
assess its relative effectiveness. Importantly, we not
only focus on fiscal policies, but also consider the
broader macroeconomic environment encompassing the countries’ monetary stance, financial sector
policies, and external environment. That said, past
country experiences are not necessarily prescriptions
for the future, given changes in economic structures
and in policy and regulatory frameworks. Moreover, we review actual policy strategies and do not
consider whether other policies would have produced better outcomes. These caveats must be taken
into account when drawing implications for today.
Finally, given the high starting point, even relatively
successful debt reductions can still leave countries
with high debt and, thus, a vulnerability to renewed
setbacks. For example, in Belgium, where debt was
reduced substantially between 1993 and 2007, debt
levels are again approaching 100 percent because of
the setbacks from the Great Recession.
The next section looks at the full historical record,
focusing on episodes that begin when public debt
rose above 100 percent of GDP and reviewing
the macroeconomic environment and outcomes.
The chapter then discusses how the six cases were
selected before turning to the in-depth case studies.
It then synthesizes the findings from the case studies
and, finally, draws lessons for today.

Historical Overview
The IMF Fiscal Affairs Department recently compiled a comprehensive database on gross government
debt-to-GDP ratios covering nearly the entire IMF
membership back to 1875.4 We use these data to
4See

Abbas and others (2010) for a detailed description of the
database, which is available at www.imf.org/external/datamapper/
index.php?db=DEBT. The use of gross debt data reflects the
difficulty of collecting net debt data on a consistent basis across
countries and over time. Nonetheless, even gross debt data may
not be immune to measurement problems (see Dippelsman,
­Dziobek, and Gutiérrez Mangas, 2012). We also use supplementary data on interest payments and primary deficits for 19
advanced economies from Abbas and others (2011) as well as real
GDP data from Maddison (2003) and other data from Reinhart
and Rogoff (2010).

identify all advanced economy episodes that begin
when gross public debt rises above 100 percent of
GDP.5 High-debt episodes of emerging market and
developing economies are not included in our analysis. This is not because they may not offer interesting insights. Rather, it is because their experiences
typically differed in two important respects. First,
their debt was mostly external and denominated in
foreign currency, which presents different challenges
from those faced by advanced economies today.6 Second, their economic structures and institutions can
differ substantially from the structures and institutions of advanced economies, especially going back
in time.7 Finally, narrowing our analysis to advanced
economies is a simple and transparent criterion for
selecting the sample.
The 100 percent threshold is used for a number
of reasons. First, it is most relevant today given the
number of countries currently close to or above
that threshold. Second, 100 percent is high relative to historical experience: only 15 percent of the
observations in our advanced economy database are
above 100 percent. Third, our analysis suggests that
political and economic forces do not tend to exert
5The

starting date of an episode is the first year in which the
debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 100 percent, conditional on the ratio
being below 100 percent in the previous year. In a few instances,
missing data prevent us from identifying the exact year in which
the debt-to-GDP ratio crossed the 100 percent threshold. In these
cases, we interpolate the data linearly and date the episode from
the time the interpolated data show the 100 percent threshold was
crossed. Furthermore, given our focus on the 15 years after the
100 percent threshold is crossed, we consider only episodes that
begin by 1997 and, thus, end by 2012. We have experimented
with different windows (for example, 10 years and 20 years) and
the results are essentially unchanged.
6The inability of emerging markets to borrow abroad in their
own currency has been referred to in the literature as “original
sin” (Eichengreen, Hausmann, and Panizza, 2005). In particular, a
debt denominated in foreign currency, especially if issued at shortterm maturities, introduces an exchange rate channel through
which sharp depreciations of the currency, by increasing the debt
burden, can fuel additional exchange rate depreciation and trigger
a vicious cycle. The presence of this channel, then, has various
ex ante implications—for example, posing a stricter limit on the
amount of debt that can be issued and constraining the set of
monetary policy options.
7Some of the earliest episodes in our sample involve economies
that share features similar to those of emerging market economies
(for example, Greece in 1888 or Greece in 1931). For the sake of
completeness, we retain these episodes in the historical overview
but do not include them in the case studies or draw important
conclusions from them.

downward pressure on debt on average until public
debt reaches this level.
The 26 identified episodes are shown in Figure
3.2, which also traces the evolution of the debtto-GDP ratio for 15 years after the 100 percent
threshold was crossed. The chart conveys three key
insights.
•• Public debt levels above 100 percent of GDP are
not uncommon. Of the 22 advanced economies
for which there is good data coverage, more than
half experienced at least one high-debt episode
between 1875 and 1997. Furthermore, several
countries had multiple episodes: three for Belgium
and Italy and two for Canada, France, Greece, the
Netherlands, and New Zealand.
•• The dynamics of the debt-to-GDP ratios are quite
diverse, with some countries experiencing additional large increases and others witnessing sharp
reductions.
•• The episodes are clustered around four major eras:
the last quarter of the 19th century, the periods
following the two world wars, and the last quarter
of the 20th century. The 19th century debt
buildup was related mainly to nation building
and the railroad boom. The post–World War II
episodes are connected with the enormous and
widespread military effort and subsequent rebuilding, although some start earlier, during the Great
Depression. The episodes in the last cluster during
the 1980s and 1990s have their genesis in the
breakdown of the Bretton Woods system, when
government policy struggled with social issues and
the transition to current economic systems.
Figure 3.3, panel 1, combines the full set of
episodes to trace the distribution of the debt-toGDP ratio for 15 years after debt crosses the 100
percent threshold. The range of experiences is broad:
the 10th and 90th percentiles are associated with a
reduction of 60 percentage points and an increase of
90 percentage points in debt, respectively. Focusing
on the median, the debt ratio does tend to fall, but
only at a moderate pace. After 15 years, the median
debt-to-GDP ratio is only about 10 percentage
points lower than in the first year after debt rises
above 100 percent.
This pattern of falling median debt ratios emerges
only at high original debt ratios. Panel 2 of Figure

Figure 3.2. Debt-to-GDP Dynamics after Public Debt Reaches 100 Percent of GDP
(Percent of GDP, advanced economies)

Increases in public debt to above 100 percent are reasonably frequent, with very diverse dynamics of the debt-to-GDP ratios. These episodes are clustered around four major
eras: the last quarter of the 19th century, the periods following the two world wars, and the last quarter of the 20th century.

debt-to-GDP ratios for the subsequent 15 years. Where data are missing, dotted lines represent linear interpolations between available observations.

3.3 repeats the same exercise shown in panel 1, but
uses a 60 percent threshold. The interesting difference is that 15 years after debt rises above 60
percent, the median debt level shows no tendency to
decrease, and the average debt level is actually higher
(which can be inferred from the positively skewed
distribution).
To provide a framework for thinking about
the evolution of debt-to-GDP ratios during these
episodes, one can think about four key variables that
affect the stock of debt, bt: the interest rate paid on
the stock of debt, it ; the inflation rate of the GDP
deflator, pt ; the real GDP growth rate, gt ; and the
primary deficit–to-GDP ratio, dt . The relationships
among these variables are described by the following
formula:
1 + it
bt = ——————
b + dt + et,
(1 + pt)(1 + gt ) t–1

(3.1)

in which et is a residual that takes into account valuation effects and other accounting adjustments not
104

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

fully captured by changes in the primary deficit.8 As
a result of compounding over long periods, the difference between the real interest rate and real GDP
growth plays a crucial role in determining the stability
of public debt. While a high difference can set debt
on an unstable path, the difference is normally close
to zero. In particular, for the 22 advanced economies in our database, the average difference is –0.7
percent.9 Furthermore, primary deficits respond
slowly to changes in debt—Ostry and others (2010)
8The

residual can be significant and can vary across countries
depending on, among other things, the accounting rules followed
by governments (for further details see Appendix 4 of the September 2011 Fiscal Monitor). This residual is particularly pronounced
in the periods preceding World War II, when accounting standards were not reliable or uniform.
9A differential of –0.7 percent implies that the term in front of
bt–1 in the equation for debt dynamics is approximately equal to
0.99. Or, put another way, the half-life of public debt, abstracting
from changes in the primary balance or other adjustments related
to the stock of debt, would be almost 100 years. For additional
details on the negative interest rate growth differential, see
Escolano, Shabunina, and Woo (2011).

chapter 3

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: 100 Years of Dealing with Public Debt Overhangs

estimate that the elasticity of the primary balance to
debt is quite low at about 0.05. Thus, the evolution of
the stock of debt tends to be quite persistent and to
undergo large, long swings, as evident in Figures 3.2
and 3.3.
This framework helps us explore other aspects
of these countries’ experiences. Panel 1 of Figure
3.4 shows the average growth rate of real GDP per
capita and the change in the debt-to-GDP ratio
for each high-debt episode. With the exception of
Greece (1931),10 the United Kingdom (1918) had
the worst growth performance, with negative growth
and a considerable increase in its debt burden. At
the opposite extreme is Ireland (1986), with the
fastest average growth rate, more than 6 percent, and
substantial debt reduction. The largest debt reductions followed the world wars, usually as a result
of hyperinflation. The United States (1946) stands
out as an exception, as we discuss below; however,
inflation was still an important contributor to debt
reduction during this episode. Finally, there is no
clear correlation between growth and debt reduction
in this group of high-debt episodes.
Another way to look at these high-debt episodes
is by tracking the average primary fiscal balance
and the average inflation rate over the 15 years after
public debt reaches 100 percent of GDP. Because
these are the main targets of fiscal and monetary
policy, they lay a foundation for examining the various policy approaches of the case studies. Figure 3.4,
panel 2, shows that when these countries reached
high levels of debt, their fiscal balances and inflation
rates differed considerably. We see some obvious
outliers in the United Kingdom (1918) and Japan
(1997) along with a number of war-related highor hyperinflation episodes, including in France,
Germany, Greece, Italy, and Japan. By and large,
however, the more modern episodes are much more
tightly clustered, with modest inflation and modest
primary surpluses. As is evident in the case studies
below, the modern episodes differed in ways not
readily apparent in the aggregate analysis.
Table 3.1 presents a third perspective on these
episodes, which are separated into two broad

Figure 3.3. Debt-to-GDP Dynamics
(Percent of GDP, advanced economies)

After reaching 100 percent of GDP, the debt-to-GDP ratio tends to decline, even though at a
very moderate pace. This tendency to reverse is not present at lower levels of debt, for
example when debt rises above 60 percent of GDP.

groups: those in which debt levels increased and
those in which debt levels decreased. The primary
fiscal surplus is, on average, about 2.4 percent of
GDP during episodes where the debt-to-GDP ratio
decreases, but it is only 1.2 percent where the debt
ratio increases. This foreshadows a finding from our
case studies—debt reduction ultimately requires
primary surpluses. The relationship between inflation
and debt reduction is more ambiguous. Although
hyperinflation is clearly associated with sharp
debt reduction, when hyperinflation episodes are
excluded, there is no clear association between the
average inflation rate and the change in debt. Finally,
a relatively stronger growth performance is associated
with debt reduction when hyperinflation episodes
are excluded.
Among our 26 episodes, only 3 feature default:
Germany (1918), which suspended war reparations
in 1932, and Greece (1888, 1931), which defaulted
in 1894 and 1932, respectively. These episodes have
little relevance for the challenges faced by advanced
economies today for at least two reasons. First, they
involve very peculiar features that set them apart
from others: the post–World War I political instability in Germany, the nation-building effort of Greece
at the turn of the 19th century and the subsequent
Greco-Turkish war of 1897, and a period of deep
internal political instability in Greece after the
1919–22 war with Turkey. Second, in these defaults
a large proportion of public debt was denominated
in foreign currency (or gold), which made debt
repayment subject to exchange rate fluctuations.
For example, the Greek episodes are more similar
to the sovereign debt crises commonly experienced
by emerging markets, during which a sharp drop in
the exchange rate leads to a dramatic increase in the
value of foreign-currency-denominated liabilities.

Public Debt and Economic Growth
One particular concern with high public debt
ratios is that they may lower economic growth.
Several empirical papers document a negative correlation between public debt and GDP growth, with
some suggesting that a debt-to-GDP ratio of 90
percent or more may constrain growth (Kumar and

Mohanty, and Zampolli, 2011).11 However, high
debt may itself be the result of sluggish growth, or
it could reflect a third factor that at the same time
increases debt and reduces growth (for example,
a war or a financial crisis). Indeed, Panizza and
11Reinhart, Reinhart, and Rogoff (2012) find that debt above
90 percent reduces growth by 1 percent. Kumar and Woo (2010)
find that when debt is at 90 percent, an additional 10 percent
increase in the debt ratio reduces future growth by about 1
percent for advanced economies and that this is not the case
for some selected lower levels of debt. Cecchetti, Mohanty, and
Zampolli (2011) obtain a similar result when debt is in a range of
85 percent of GDP.

Presbitero (2012), who use an instrumental variable
approach to control for reverse causality, reject the
hypothesis that high debt causes lower growth. We
do not address the challenging causality issue here.
Rather, by focusing on performance after a certain
debt-to-GDP ratio has been crossed, we highlight
a few additional and important stylized facts about
debt and growth.
Figure 3.5, panel 1, explores whether entering a
high-debt phase is followed by relatively low growth
over the subsequent 15 years. Growth rates during each
of the episodes are compared with those of a control

Figure 3.5. Debt and Growth Performance
Countries whose debt-to-GDP ratio rises above 100 percent tend to experience lower GDP
growth than other advanced economies. However, countries with a debt level between 90
and 110 percent can actually grow faster than other advanced economies if debt is on a
declining trajectory. In fact, the growth performance in countries whose debt is decreasing
when crossing a given threshold is better than that in countries where it is increasing.

group of all other advanced economies during the same
periods. If growth rates are unrelated to debt levels, the
growth of countries with high debt should be, on average, about the same as those of other countries—that
is, the points plotted in Figure 3.5, panel 1, should be
randomly scattered around zero. The scatter plot, however, shows that countries that crossed the 100 percent
threshold typically experienced lower GDP growth
than the advanced economy average. In this respect at
least, these results are consistent with the findings of
Reinhart and Rogoff (2010).
Figure 3.5, panel 2, explores debt levels and
growth performance in more breadth. This figure
is also based on the difference between the average
growth rate during a set of high-debt episodes and
the average growth rate for all advanced economies during matching periods. But the threshold
for selecting episodes varies between 10 percent of
GDP and 140 percent of GDP, with the threshold
increasing in 5 percentage point increments. For
each threshold, the average growth rate during the
selected episodes is plotted against the advanced
economy average. Furthermore, in addition to
episodes where debt is increasing when the threshold
is crossed, the figure also shows relative growth for
episodes where debt is decreasing when the threshold
is crossed. This yields two interesting observations.
First, it matters whether a country’s debt level is
increasing or decreasing. Among countries with the
same debt levels, the growth performance over the
subsequent 15 years in countries for which debt is
decreasing when the threshold is crossed is better
than in countries for which it is increasing. This
difference is statistically significant across the whole
sample. It is particularly striking for debt levels
between 90 and 115 percent of GDP (where average
growth is 0.5 percentage point higher).12 Second,
there is no particular threshold that consistently
precedes subpar growth performance. In fact, Figure
3.5, panel 2, shows that countries with a debt level
between 90 and 110 percent outperform the control
group when debt is on a declining trajectory.
12Countries

with very low debt levels (for example, below 25
percent of GDP) tend to have higher public debt levels after 15
years. In such cases, whether debt is increasing or decreasing at
the time they cross the threshold has much less of an effect on the
level of debt at the end of the episode.

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: 100 Years of Dealing with Public Debt Overhangs

Our analysis is not meant to dispute the notion
that, all else equal, higher levels of debt may lead to
higher real interest rates. Rather it highlights that
there is no simple relationship between debt and
growth. In fact, our subsequent analysis emphasizes that there are many factors that matter for a
country’s growth and debt performance. Moreover,
there is no single threshold for debt ratios that can
delineate the “bad” from the “good.” For this reason,
we explore public debt dynamics, the macroeconomic environment, and policies in a number of
case studies.

Case Studies
We turn now from the aggregate analysis of the
26 high-debt episodes to more detailed analyses of
6 individual cases: the United Kingdom (1918), the
United States (1946), Belgium (1983), Italy (1992),
Canada (1995), and Japan (1997) (Figure 3.6). The
selected cases meet three criteria: the episodes cover
each of the main eras of high debt; they reflect the
full range of outcomes; and they cover the full range
of macroeconomic policy approaches.
The case studies cover the two postwar eras and
the most recent era of debt buildup in peacetime.
High-debt episodes that occurred before World War
I are excluded because of the lack of detailed data
and because the structure of economies was substantially different during that era, making comparisons
with today less meaningful. For the interwar period,
we consider the United Kingdom (1918) because it
provides important lessons about fiscal austerity and
the difficulties created by deflation.13 Among post–
World War II episodes, we analyze the United States
(1946) because it is representative of the financial
repression policies adopted after the war and that
have recently been suggested as a possible solution
to current debt problems (Reinhart and Sbrancia,
2011). The more recent cases of Belgium (1983),
Canada (1995), Italy (1992), and Japan (1997)

13We did not select Germany because its experience was very
extreme and that experience is already relatively well known: the
limited ability to raise taxes combined with large expenditures and
war-reparation requirements caused serious fiscal imbalances that
led the Weimar Republic to monetize the fiscal deficits, producing
bouts of hyperinflation.

capture a wide range of debt-to-GDP dynamics
and policy approaches.14 Together, the case studies
capture the full range of debt outcomes for countries whose public debt rises above 100 percent of
GDP. The cases are also representative of the range
of policies pursued to address high public debt (see
Figure 3.4, panel 2). The United Kingdom (1918) is
an extreme case of large fiscal surpluses and strong
deflation. Japan (1997) also endured deflation but
pursued the opposite fiscal stance, with large and
persistent fiscal deficits. Finally, the United States
(1946), Belgium (1983), Italy (1992), and Canada
(1995) are representative of the fiscal primary surplus and positive inflation policy mix followed by
the majority of countries since World War II.15
We start with the United Kingdom after World
War I, whose experience set a clear foundation
for all subsequent thinking about public debt and
economic policy. We follow with the United States
after World War II, where initial circumstances were
very similar but outcomes were very different. We
then turn to more modern examples and emphasize
not the extremes but the more typical experiences
of Belgium, Canada, and Italy. Nonetheless, to
reinforce the message that the United Kingdom’s
experience with deflation after World War I has not
been consigned to the dustbin of history, we discuss
Japan since the 1990s.

The United Kingdom in 1918: Deflation
In the aftermath of World War I, the United
Kingdom’s stock of debt had ballooned to about 140
percent of GDP and prices were more than double
14Among the recent episodes of substantial debt reduction,
Ireland (1986) stands out. Starting from a relatively low level
of GDP per capita, however, this remarkable decline was driven
mainly by the very high growth rate resulting from the process
of catching up with the other European economies. Ireland
experienced a structural transformation in the late 1980s from an
agriculture-based economy, which had already occurred earlier in
many other advanced economies (see Honohan and Walsh, 2002;
and Perotti, 2012). We therefore have not included this episode in
our case studies because it does not seem repeatable by countries
currently dealing with high public debt.
15A number of countries experienced primary deficits and positive (usually hyper-) inflation, but these were all war related, with
Germany (1918) the most extreme example. We do not investigate these cases further here because of their limited relevance for
today.

their prewar level. Policymakers’ priorities were
twofold. First, return to the gold standard at the
prewar parity to restore British trade, prosperity, and
prestige (Pollard, 1992, p. 106). Second, pay off the
debt to preserve Britain’s proverbial creditworthiness.
Indeed, by returning to prewar parity, the United
Kingdom intended to prove its commitment to
repay its debt in real terms, rather than in devalued
currency.16
To achieve its objectives the U.K. government
implemented a policy mix of severe fiscal austerity and tight monetary policy. The primary surplus
was kept near 7 percent of GDP throughout the
1920s.17 This was accomplished through large
expenditure decreases, courtesy of the “Geddes axe,”
and a continuation of the higher tax levels introduced during the war.18 On the monetary front, the
Bank of England raised interest rates to 7 percent
in 1920 to support the return to the prewar parity,
which—coupled with the ensuing deflation—delivered extraordinarily high real rates.
The United Kingdom’s resulting economic performance was very poor. Economic growth was weak
and considerably below the advanced economy average, unemployment was high, and deflation was the
order of the day (Figure 3.7). Real output in 1938
was barely above the level in 1918, and growth averaged about ½ percent a year. This was not merely
because of the Great Depression—real output in
1928 was also below that in 1918. The export sector
was particularly weak as a result of the revaluation
of the currency—the real exchange rate drifted up
initially as price and wage reductions failed to keep
up with the nominal appreciation. Unemployment
reached 11 percent in 1921. Indeed, the weakness
16David Lloyd George, prime minister from 1916 to 1922,
said this about the desire to pay off the debt and return to the
gold standard: “It was not policy that determined the action
of the government in Britain. It is just because a Briton has an
ineradicable habit of paying what he owes and it never occurred
to him to abandon that habit because he had fought a victorious
war. Great Britain thought it her duty to uphold her credit, even
at the highest cost.” Lloyd George (1928)
17The headline balance remained slightly negative given the size
of the debt and the interest rate on it.
18Sir Eric Geddes was appointed to chair a committee on ways
to reduce expenditures in August 1921. It was, on its terms, very
successful. But, as Pollard (1992) puts it, “The Geddes axe became
a by-word for callous meanness” (p. 106).

chapter 3

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: 100 Years of Dealing with Public Debt Overhangs

of the labor market was part and parcel of the policy
to induce large reductions in prices and, perforce,
wages. A comparison with the other continental
powers, particularly France and even Germany,
suggests that the costs of this mix of tight fiscal and
monetary policies were high. These outcomes led to
the cynical observation from Keynes (1928, p. 218)
that “assuredly it does not pay to be good.”
If the policies pursued had successfully reduced
debt and restored British growth and prosperity, the short-term costs perhaps would have been
acceptable. Unfortunately, they did not. In fact, the
policies had the opposite effect: British prosperity
was hampered by the dual pursuit of prewar parity
and fiscal austerity. Most European countries were
enhancing their competitiveness through exchange
rate devaluation, and British export industries
suffered accordingly. Furthermore, managing the
exchange rate forced the Bank of England to maintain high interest rates, which increased the burden
of the national debt and generally constrained economic activity—further undermining tax receipts.
The policy of fiscal austerity, pursued to pay down
the debt, further limited growth. Debt continued to
rise and was about 170 percent of GDP in 1930 and
more than 190 percent of GDP in 1933. It was not
until 1990 that debt approached its pre–World War
I level. Lloyd George (1928) observed about Britain
that “her present activity and profit-earning power
have been sacrificed in large measure to the maintenance of integrity and good faith to all her creditors
at home and abroad.”
The effects of deflation, economic growth, interest
rates, and fiscal austerity on the public debt can be seen
in Figure 3.7, panel 3. This figure calculates the average
annual contribution to the change in the debt-to-GDP
ratio over five-year periods from 1919 to 1933 and for
the period as a whole. The calculation is based on the
formula for debt dynamics given in equation (3.1).
Primary surpluses contributed on average about 7 percentage points a year, but they were easily overwhelmed
by deflation and high interest rates, which added 12
percentage points a year to the stock of debt. Furthermore, there was little to no positive contribution from
economic growth. Only during 1924–28, when the
United Kingdom experienced modest growth, did the
debt level actually decline.

Figure 3.7. United Kingdom: Deﬂation in the Aftermath of
World War I
After World War I, the United Kingdom experienced strong deﬂation, anemic growth, and
high unemployment. Despite large primary surpluses, the debt ratio continued to increase
due to high nominal interest rates and deﬂation.

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

The U.K. interwar episode is an important
reminder of the challenges of pursuing a tight fiscal
and monetary policy mix, especially when the external sector is constrained by a high exchange rate.

The United States in 1946: Financial Repression and
Surprise Inflation
By the end of World War II the U.S. stock of
debt had swelled to 10 times higher than it was
before the war, about 120 percent of GDP. The
U.S. economy was also confronting a rapid rise in
inflation associated with the removal of wartime
price controls and the release of pent-up demand. In
this respect, at least, the U.S. situation was similar
to that of the United Kingdom after World War I.
Many feared a similar outcome.19 The success of the
Keynesian revolution in economic thinking and the
fear of repeating the mistakes of the interwar period,
however, led to a very different policy approach and
to better economic results.
Between 1946 and 1948, U.S. public finances
swung quickly from deficit to surplus, as is common
in postwar periods. The primary balance went from
a deficit of 5 percent of GDP in 1946 to a surplus
of 6½ percent of GDP in 1948 before stabilizing
near 2 percent through most of the 1950s. In this
respect, U.S. performance was qualitatively, if not
quantitatively, similar to that of both the United
States and the United Kingdom after World War I.
The monetary policy situation was, however, very
different. In fact, unlike after World War I, various extraordinary measures used to support wartime deficits were removed only partially or slowly.
In particular, the bond-support program, which
placed a floor under the price of government bonds
during the war, was continued, and this prevented
the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates to

19“As

the year 1947 opens America has never been so strong or
so prosperous. Nor have our prospects ever been brighter. Yet in
the minds of a great many of us there is a fear of another depression, the loss of our jobs, our farms, our businesses…The job at
hand today is to see to it that America is not ravaged by recurring
depressions and long periods of unemployment, but that instead
we build an economy so fruitful, so dynamic, so progressive that
each citizen can count upon opportunity and security for himself
and his family.” (Truman, 1947)

control inflation.20 Despite proposals to remove this
restriction on the operation of monetary policy, fear
of repeating the mistakes of the past and causing
a repeat of the boom-bust cycle after World War I
persuaded policymakers to stay the course.21
The removal of price controls in mid-1946 led to
a burst of inflation in late 1946 and 1947, which
was ended by the 1949 recession and the concomitant mild deflation. Notwithstanding the burst of
inflation, between 1946 and 1948 there was a widespread belief that prices were destined to fall quickly,
which—coupled with a high government surplus
and the fear of a major recession—meant that the
Federal Reserve did not actually have to intervene to
support government bond prices.22 Serious inflation
pressure was building nonetheless, and it emerged at
the outset of the Korean War in 1950. To mitigate
the rise in inflation without disrupting the bond
market, consumer credit limits were reintroduced
and there was a call for voluntary restraints on bank
credit.23 Nonetheless, between 1950 and 1951
inflation increased substantially again. This second
burst of inflation coupled with that during 1946–47
contributed substantially to lower U.S. public debt,
which by 1951 was down to 75 percent of GDP.
The Korean War finally demonstrated that the
policies being pursued by the government made
inflation rather than deflation the real danger. This
20Under

the program, the Federal Reserve was responsible for
intervening in the market to buy bonds if the price fell below par.
The practical effect was to cap nominal interest rates at various
maturities, with the Treasury bill rate at 0.375 percent and the
long-term bond rate at 2½ percent.
21“The financial world should rest easy that the investment
market will not be subject to the demoralization which swept over
it in 1920 when the unsupported market for Government bonds
fell about 20 percent below par” (Truman, 1947, p. 202).
22Friedman and Schwartz (1963) and Meltzer (2003) provide
various arguments in support of the thesis that there was a “willingness on the part of the public to hold relatively large amounts
of money and government securities at fairly low rates of interest”
as reflected by the relatively small rise in the money stock over
that period. In their view the “expectation of subsequent contraction and price decline […] induced [the public] to hold larger
real money balances than it otherwise would have been willing to.
In this way it made the postwar rise more moderate.” (Friedman
and Schwartz, 1963)
23The Defense Production Act, enacted September 8, 1950,
in response to the start of the Korean War, sought, among other
things, to restrain inflation through control of consumer and real
estate credit.

chapter 3

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: 100 Years of Dealing with Public Debt Overhangs

realization enabled the Federal Reserve to regain
some independence in setting interest rates.24 The
Federal Reserve was formally freed from the obligation to support the government bond market in
1951, although this was only the first step in dismantling the bond-support program.25 Still, the idea
of capping nominal interest rates while limiting the
quantity of credit (credit controls) permeated U.S.
economic policy at the time and persisted at least
until the 1980s.
Figure 3.8 shows the contributions of the various
forces to changes in the U.S. public debt level and the
two distinct phases of the debt reduction. In the early
years, high rates of surprise inflation combined with
low nominal interest rates to reduce the debt by almost
35 percentage points. The rest of the debt reduction is
attributable to solid growth, which contributed 2 percentage points each year; primary surpluses contributed
an additional 2 percentage points.26
In summary, financial repression evolved logically and gradually from the reality of high public
debt and the fear of what would happen if interest
rates were raised to fend off postwar inflation. But,
because direct control of quantities replaced the
price mechanism, controls had to be in place across
a wide range of activities. Credit controls and higher
reserve requirements were imposed on banks. Bank
competition was limited by various rules such as

24As noted by Friedman and Schwartz, “World War II was
widely expected to be followed by severe unemployment. The
Reserve System girded itself for the possibility and welcomed the
bond-support program, because the System thought it would be
consistent with the easy-money policies which would be required
after the war. In the event, inflation rather than deflation loomed
as a greater danger and, under the added impetus to inflation
given by the Korean War, the Federal Reserve was finally led to
divest itself of the self-imposed chains of the bond-supporting
program.” (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963, p. 700)
25In March 1951 an agreement was reached by President Truman, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve (the 1951 Accord)
that relieved the Federal Reserve of the responsibility of supporting the government securities market. Support for government
securities, however, continued under the principle of “bills only”
or “bills preferably,” which facilitated large-scale Treasury refunding operations during times of stringent money market conditions. See Young and Yager (1960).
26Although strong, the U.S. growth rate after World War II was
below the advanced economy average (see Figure 3.8). This was
largely because of the high growth rates in Europe, which resulted
from the reconstruction efforts.

Regulation Q and limits on branching.27 Some of
these restrictions (for example, interest ceilings on
deposits) were eventually circumvented by financial
innovation (for example, money market funds)
and thus led to additional intervention in later
years (for example, the extension of credit controls
by the Consumer Credit Protection Act of 1969).
More generally, these restrictions only partially succeeded in stabilizing inflation. In fact, even though
the U.S. exchange rate policy fixing the gold value
at $35 an ounce did not destabilize prices,28 inflation remained very volatile throughout the episode
and beyond.29

Japan 1997: Deflation Redux
Gross Japanese public debt rose above 100
percent of GDP in 1997, during the middle of
Japan’s “lost decade”—an extended period of mild
deflation and output growth near zero, a growth
level considerably below that of other advanced
economies and Japan’s own historical levels (see
Figure 3.5, panel 1).30 The primary cause of the
rising debt was a bursting of the stock market and
real estate bubbles in 1989–90 and the subsequent
weakness in the financial and real sectors of the
economy. The initial policy response involved fiscal
stimulus, with a sharp deterioration of the fiscal

27From 1933 to 1986 Regulation Q imposed maximum
interest rates on various types of bank deposits, such as demand
deposits, savings accounts, and time deposits, which limited
competition among banks for funding. Interstate branching was
not allowed until 1994.
28Given widespread concern about competitive devaluations,
the overriding objective of postwar U.S. exchange rate policy was
the maintenance of a fixed par value of the dollar as established
by the Bretton Woods agreement. Moreover, given that there were
relatively few revaluations or devaluations of foreign currencies
against gold, the overall system ensured fairly stable exchange
rates during this high-debt episode.
29Inflation volatility during the episode was more than four
times higher than U.S. inflation volatility from 1997 to 2012.
30In the case of Japan, the difference between gross and net
debt is significant. Due to large gross lending and borrowing positions within the public sector, the net debt-to-GDP ratio in 1997
was only 34 percent. However, both gross debt and net debt have
followed a similar trend, with net debt currently exceeding 130
percent of GDP.

114

balance, and interest rate cuts (Figure 3.9). The
sharp reduction of inflation expectations, however,
was larger than the reduction in interest rates, leading to a real exchange rate appreciation.31 Moreover, this policy response did not directly address
the structural weaknesses in Japan’s financial sector.
There was a moderate recovery that ended in 1997
when a confluence of events weakened the economy. Though there was a tightening of fiscal policy
through a rise in consumption and payroll taxes
that had been induced by the growing public debt
and rising social security expenditures, the main
causes of the economic downturn were as follows.
First, the Asian financial crisis occurred and the
exchange rate appreciated substantially. Moreover,
structural weakness in the banking sector was
exacerbated by the poor economic performance,
resulting in the onset of a serious banking crisis.
The end result was a severe recession that forced
the government to abandon its fiscal consolidation
plan and led to continued increases in public debt
levels.
Monetary policy in this period had limited effect
in stimulating economic activity. Although interest
rates were close to zero, no credit or quantitative
easing policies were implemented. Furthermore,
and more seriously, structural problems in the
banking sector remained, and this compromised
the transmission of monetary policy to lending
conditions. Finally, a premature increase in interest
rates in 2000 and repercussions from the bursting
of the dot-com bubble in the United States exacerbated the situation. The economy again fell into
recession in 2001.
There was a second and more effective phase
of policy action beginning in 2001. The government turned its attention to fixing the underlying
structural problems in the economy. The authorities took significantly more resolute steps to resolve
problems in the financial sector, forcing the writedown of bad loans and the recapitalization of banks
with private and public funds. The Bank of Japan
also began a program of quantitative easing and in
31The yen’s real trade-weighted exchange rate appreciated by
about 60 percent in early 1990s, peaking in 1995; after that, it
depreciated temporarily during the economic recovery, only to
rise again during the Asian crisis.

chapter 3

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: 100 Years of Dealing with Public Debt Overhangs

2002 publicly committed to keeping interest rates
low until stable positive inflation returned. The
structural reforms to the financial sector and the
more accommodative monetary policy environment
reversed the downward trend in inflation and led
to a relatively strong recovery phase that finally
allowed for a mild correction of the fiscal imbalance. A weakening exchange rate and very favorable
external environment also contributed to the positive outcomes.32 During this period, the debt-toGDP ratio stabilized at about 185 percent. Since
then, the Great Recession pushed Japan back into
recession, leading to yet another large deterioration
in the fiscal balance.
The various phases of this episode are summarized
in Figure 3.9, panel 3, which shows the decomposition of Japan’s debt dynamics. Growth and inflation made virtually no direct contribution to debt
dynamics during this period as a whole—although
the increase in debt slowed between 2002 and
2007, when the policy response emphasized monetary measures and growth was stronger. The largest
contribution to debt dynamics, however, comes from
the primary deficit.
This episode highlights the need to deal with
banking sector weakness and ensure a supportive
monetary environment before fiscal consolidation
can succeed. It also highlights the difficulties that
can be created by adverse external developments
when domestic conditions are already stretched.
When structural weakness in the financial system
prevents the normal transmission of monetary
stimulus and when policy rates are constrained
by the zero lower bound, the risk of anemic and
fragile growth is high regardless of the fiscal setting. Such a macroeconomic environment clearly
precluded successful fiscal consolidation: whenever
such measures were taken the economy dipped into
recession.

Figure 3.9. Japan: Lost Decade
After stock market and real estate bubbles burst, Japan’s weak growth and large ﬁscal
deﬁcits caused a strong increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio. The gradual reduction in policy
rates to the zero bound was not sufﬁcient to prevent deﬂation.

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

Italy in 1992: European Monetary Union
Italy’s ratio of public debt to GDP rose 70 percentage points in the quarter-century after World
War II, a period marked by relatively high inflation
and the subordination of monetary policy to the
government’s desire for low financing costs. In 1992,
the debt-to-GDP ratio rose swiftly past 100 percent,
peaking at about 120 percent between 1994 and
1996. It subsequently declined moderately, reaching
a trough of 104 percent in 2004, as a result of Italy’s
strong political desire to be a founding member of
the euro area.
The criteria of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which
set out the conditions for membership in the euro
area, however, were a serious challenge to Italian ambitions because they required a very strong
monetary and fiscal effort from Italian policymakers.
Unfortunately, the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) crisis in September 1992 and the disintegration of long-standing Italian political parties
following widespread corruption scandals appeared
to further complicate Italian hopes of participating
in the euro area. In practice, however, the political
instability reinforced a pro-Europe sentiment at various levels of society and opened the door to three
technocratic governments that were able to implement a substantial fiscal adjustment and initiate
unpopular structural reforms.33
On the fiscal front, the consolidation effort
included structural reforms that affected pension
payments, health services, local authority finance,
wage setting, and public employment. An important step was breaking the wage-price spiral, which
was accomplished with the suspension and subsequent removal of wage indexation (scala mobile) in
December 1991 and July 1993.34 This smoothed the
way for the transition to a low-inflation monetary
policy regime in line with the Maastricht criteria. In
1993 the government was granted special power to
33The technocratic governments were led by Giuliano Amato
(June 1992–April 1993), Carlo Azeglio Ciampi (April 1993–May
1994), and Lamberto Dini (January 1995–May 1996) after a
brief interlude under Silvio Berlusconi.
34The new labor agreement in July 1993 sought greater
employer and trade union support for policy targets by explicitly
mentioning the policy goals of reducing inflation, cutting the
budget deficit, and stabilizing the exchange rate (OECD, 1994).

116

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

cut primary spending, thus breaking with the past
practice of using one-time measures as the main
vehicle for deficit reduction, and action was taken
to curb the Parliament’s power to implement new
spending initiatives. Pension reform was particularly
important given the rapidly aging population and
a generous pension provision that gave Italy one of
highest ratios of pension spending to GDP in the
world—14 percent in 1994. The reform was a step
in the right direction, but there were two drawbacks:
first, it was not enough given the demographic
trends, and second, the transition phase was particularly long.35 Thus, although necessary, the benefits of
the reform took a long time to directly affect public
finances. Despite these promising developments, and
reflecting the delay in bottom-line results from some
of them, almost half the consolidation was achieved
through tax increases.36
On the monetary front, 1992 was a year of
market turbulence, with Italy’s exit from the ERM
and the subsequent devaluation of the lira. The
currency crisis had two distinct implications for
public finances. On one hand, it delivered gains
in competitiveness much needed by Italian export
industries, thus supporting economic growth. On
the other hand, the sharp devaluation stoked inflation and, especially, inflation expectations, which led
the Bank of Italy to raise interest rates significantly.
The burden of interest payments rose to more than
11 percent of GDP between 1993 and 1995, and
this prevented a significant reduction in the overall
deficit, which remained stuck above 7 percent.
35The 1995 Dini reform of the public pension system was
intended to ensure the long-term viability of pension funds by
instituting sustainable contribution rates (the system shifted from
linking old-age pensions to earnings, sistema retributivo, to linking
benefits to lifetime contributions, sistema contributivo); linking
benefits to residual life expectancy at the time of retirement;
reviewing pensions for the disabled and survivors; and reviewing
guaranteed minimum pensions. The 1995 Dini reform would
have eliminated the possibility of retiring after 35 years of service
regardless of age (pensioni di anzianità), which constituted one of
the more generous provisions of the old system, by 2013; starting in 2008, seniority pensions would have required 40 years of
service. A few years later, the Prodi Agreement tried to shorten
the very long transition phase.
36The fiscal consolidation amounted to 13.6 percent of GDP
from 1992 to 1995, of which just over 40 percent was from tax
increases—the primary balance went from –4 percent in 1987 to
2.9 percent in 1995 (see Devries and others, 2011).

chapter 3

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: 100 Years of Dealing with Public Debt Overhangs

In 1996, immediately after taking office, the
government led by Romano Prodi declared as its
primary objective Italy’s admission to the euro area
as a founding member. Prodi’s goal was to break the
vicious cycle of high expected inflation, high interest rates, high deficits, and again to high expected
inflation that would have prevented admission.
He gained support from unions and the public
to embark on further substantial fiscal consolidation, and this led to implementation of additional
measures that eventually reduced the overall deficit
to 2.7 percent in 1997, reaching a record primary
surplus of 6.1 percent of GDP in 1997.37 This
consolidation topped a 10-year period during which
Italy improved its primary balance by slightly more
than 10 percentage points—an exceptional performance by historical standards.
Furthermore, the credibility of Italy’s commitment to European integration and the feasibility of
meeting the Maastricht criteria as perceived by the
markets led to a dramatic drop in interest rates in
early 1996.This effectively broke the previous vicious
cycle and replaced it with a virtuous one. Given the
tight timetable, however, some of the deficit reduction inevitably consisted of one-time measures. This
is exemplified by the 0.6 percent of GDP “tax for
Europe” and by the fact that part of the debt reduction was achieved with substantial proceeds from
privatization.38
Joining the euro area lowered borrowing costs for
the Italian Treasury and made it possible to extend
the average maturity of its debt (Figure 3.10), which
helped reduce the public debt over the following seven
years. After 1998, however, the zeal gradually faded
and no substantial additional discretionary consolida-

37The

convergence was assessed in 1998 on figures for 1997.
38From 1990 to 2000, Italy’s privatization proceeds were estimated at about $108 billion—the highest relative to GDP among
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) countries in both absolute and relative terms (OECD,
2003b). Over the entire episode, privatization receipts accounted
for about 10 percentage points of GDP. This means that more
than half of the peak-to-trough debt reduction can be attributed
to privatization receipts. It is also worth noting that, according to
the Maastricht Treaty, privatization proceeds are treated as financing, and therefore they matter for debt reduction but not for the
deficit target. In our analysis, however, privatization receipts are
included in the primary deficit.

Figure 3.10. Italy: Fading Zeal
In order to meet the Maastricht criteria, Italy achieved large primary surpluses at the end of
the 1990s. The debt ratio also started to decline thanks to the reduction in real interest
rates. Fiscal consolidation efforts, however, waned during the 2000s.

tion efforts were undertaken.39 Moreover, because
some of the fiscal measures were temporary, the primary surplus started to decline after peaking in 1997.
As a result the speed of debt reduction was modest
and reflected momentum more than ongoing effort.
These developments can be seen in the debt
decomposition summary in Figure 3.10, panel 3. A
move into primary surplus during 1993–97 was offset by tight monetary policy, but with the easing of
monetary conditions during 1998–02, debt dropped
more significantly—at least until the primary surpluses faded away during 2003–07. Also notable is
that GDP growth made a very modest contribution
to debt reduction throughout this period. Indeed,
the economy’s growth rate remained weak, considerably below the advanced economy average (see
Figure 3.5, panel 1).

Belgium in 1983: Ten Years of Consolidation before
Currency Union
A comparison of the Italian experience with that
of Belgium is quite instructive, because Belgium
experienced, eventually, a more successful outcome
under very similar circumstances. The Belgian story
starts approximately 10 years earlier with the debtto-GDP ratio crossing the 100 percent threshold in
1983. As in Italy, Belgium’s large primary deficits,
slow growth, and the central bank’s relatively tight
anti-inflation stance combined to put the debt-toGDP ratio on an unsustainable path.
From 1982 to 1987 Belgium embarked on a
serious fiscal consolidation effort that culminated
with the 1987 “Sint-Anna” or “Val Duchesse” deficit
reduction plan. This plan consisted mainly of structural reforms that delivered permanent spending
cuts of 2.8 percent of GDP. The plan, coupled with
previous fiscal consolidation efforts (again, mainly
structural and spending based), led to substantial
primary surpluses and even a temporary reduction
in the debt-to-GDP ratio. Over the 10-year period
from 1981 to 1991, Belgium improved its primary
39During the period 2003–05 the European Union Stability and Growth Pact was watered down, in part because of core
European countries’ poor growth performance. In any case, Italy
undertook some additional consolidation from 2004 to 2007,
after the 2003 recession.

balance by 11 percentage points—the largest consolidation over any 10-year period among advanced
economies since World War II.40
The policies pursued focused on trimming the
share of public employment, reducing an excessively generous system of welfare payments, cutting
family allowances and unemployment insurance
benefits, and increasing the retirement age. In the
business sector, there was little scope for privatization compared with other countries such as Italy,
but corporate tax expenditures and subsidies—
among the highest in the OECD—were reduced
substantially.41 These priorities were a reaction to
policies pursued between the mid-1970s and early
1980s that markedly increased subsidies to business,
public sector employment, and transfer payments
to households. Finally, in the early 1990s, under the
“global plan,” pension expenditures and health care
costs were curbed further. 42 However, during the
past 30 years there was no relevant structural reform
to improve the flexibility and efficiency of the labor
market, which has left Belgium plagued with low
labor participation and high short- and long-term
unemployment for most of the high-debt episode
and beyond. The main achievement with respect to
the labor market was the wage moderation process,
which since the mid-1980s has linked wage increases
to those in Belgium’s major trading partners (Germany, France, Netherlands).43
40For a list of the largest primary balance improvements in
advanced economies and emerging markets, see Abbas and others
(2010).
41It was estimated that “total aid to business—subsidies, capital
transfers, loans and government equity investment has averaged
5.5 percent of GNP (gross national product) a year since the early
1970s, attaining 8.9 per cent in 1982” (OECD, 1986, p. 25). For
comparison, in Italy business subsidies were equal to only about 3
percent of business sector value added during 1980–87 (OECD,
1994, p. 54).
42On November 17, 1993, a comprehensive plan for employment, competitiveness, and the social security system was
approved by the Belgian government. OECD (2003a) reports that
“a new method of calculating pensions will be introduced (the
base period for calculating pensions will be longer, and pensions
for men and women will be harmonized)”; other constraints and
cost-cutting measures are mentioned for health care costs. The age
limit for early retirement was raised from 55 to 58.
43Also, like Italy, Belgium was listed among OECD countries
as having the most market-unfriendly product market regulation, mainly because of barriers to entrepreneurship (see OECD,
2003a).

chapter 3

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: 100 Years of Dealing with Public Debt Overhangs

Belgium’s fiscal effort was hampered by monetary
conditions at the time and by a slowdown in global
activity in the early 1990s.44 Although the wage
moderation process helped break the wage-price
spiral, which contributed to endemic inflation, it
still took some time and a period of high interest
rates (aimed at maintaining the peg to the European
Currency Unit) for monetary policy to succeed
in delivering low and stable inflation. Hence, the
debt-to-GDP ratio started to rise again in 1990 and
peaked at 134 percent in 1993, a recession year.
Even during the recession, however, the Belgian government was able to run a primary surplus—highlighting how beneficial the structural measures taken
in the 1980s were for public finances.
A second multiyear convergence plan was enacted
in the early 1990s to meet the Maastricht criteria
by reducing the budget deficit to less than 3 percent
by 1997.45 This plan included a mix of additional
spending cuts and tax increases—but it was fundamentally built on the foundation established by
the successful 1980s consolidation. Moreover, the
fiscal framework was strengthened: first, in 1989 the
High Council of Finance was vested with a renewed
advisory role for budgetary policy; second, in 1994,
the National Accounting Institute was established to
provide macroeconomic forecasts for use in budget preparation. Both actions were fundamental to
increasing government accountability for budgetary
policy.46
On the monetary front, the successful fiscal consolidation of the 1980s gave markets confidence that
the convergence plan would likewise be successful.
As a result, in 1993 short-term bond rates were on a
steep downward path, and long-term bond rates soon
followed.47 Inflation, which had been reduced in the

Figure 3.11. Belgium: A Marathon Not a Sprint
Belgium achieved large primary surpluses in the late 1980s and maintained them for about
15 years. The debt ratio also fell considerably in the 1990s thanks to a reduction in real
interest rates and fairly strong growth.

real growth rate deteriorated from more than 3 percent

45The fiscal consolidation of the 1990s included privatization and sales of assets (such as the central bank gold reserve).
The impact of these temporary measures, however, was minor in
Belgium compared with Italy.
46See European Commission (2012).
47The decomposition in Figure 3.11, panel 3, shows that the
more benign monetary conditions, evidenced by falling interest
rates during the episode, contributed significantly to the reduction
in debt levels.

late 1980s, oscillated around 2 percent.48 One consequence was that, in contrast to the first effort, this
convergence plan led to a sustained drop in debt.
In sum, Belgium’s public finances were already
on a sounder footing than Italy’s by the end of the
1980s. The permanent structural measures taken in
the 1980s projected beneficial effects into the future.
As a result Belgium required a milder fiscal adjustment to meet the Maastricht criteria than Italy, and
the changes in the fiscal framework adopted in the
1990s helped prevent slippages and the onset of
fiscal consolidation fatigue. At the same time, given
the credibility attached to the 1992 convergence
plan, Belgium benefited from a much needed reduction in real interest payments earlier than Italy. It is
hard to say whether this is what contributed to its
relatively better growth performance, but between
1993 and 2007 Belgium reduced its debt-to-GDP
ratio by 50 percentage points—substantially more
than Italy.

Canada in 1995: Success from Failure
As in Belgium, there were two phases to Canada’s
fiscal consolidation: an initial unsuccessful phase in
the second half of the 1980s and a later successful
consolidation starting in 1995. We discuss them
both here because the earlier consolidation effort
provides a valuable comparison with the ultimately
successful consolidation in the mid-1990s.
In the early 1980s, a combination of high primary
deficits and tight monetary policy put the Canadian
general government debt on an unstable path—from
1981 to 1986 the debt increased by about 25 percentage points (Figure 3.12, panel 1). This prospect
induced the newly elected government of Brian Mulroney to embark on a multiyear fiscal consolidation
plan that, beginning in 1985, aimed at stabilizing
the debt-to-GDP ratio at 65 percent by 1990–91.
The actual implementation of the 1985 plan
implied a fiscal consolidation that was split roughly
evenly between tax hikes and spending cuts (see
Guajardo, Leigh, and Pescatori, 2011) and was able
to achieve a temporary balanced primary budget in
48As for various other European countries, 1994, the year after
the ERM collapse, was an exception.

120

1989. The overall debt performance was less successful. In fact, given the high real and nominal interest
payments followed by the sharp 1990–91 recession,
the debt-to-GDP ratio kept rising and peaked at
102 percent in 1995. The recession left a large scar
on fiscal revenue,49 while government spending
kept increasing in real terms until 1993, mainly as a
result of automatic stabilizers.
Various reasons have been advanced for the failure
of the 1985 consolidation.50 One explanation is that
the adjustment in expenditures relied mainly on
poorly specified across-the-board cuts and efficiency
gains that did not impose fundamental changes in
the way government expenses were determined and
so did not persist. Moreover, some of the measures
were also temporary. For example, the plan imposed
a temporary surtax on higher-income individuals
and large corporations and garnered some savings
from privatization. Thus, while the primary balance
did improve during the 10 years from 1985 to 1995,
the improvement amounted to just under 6 percentage points of GDP because it was interrupted by the
recession of the early 1990s. The consolidation effort
did, however, introduce a number of permanent
measures that helped future Canadian governments,
including a change from full to partial indexation of
tax brackets. Another factor, which becomes clearer
on examination of the 1995 consolidation, is that
both the monetary and external environments were
hostile to debt reduction. Monetary policy was
particularly tight because the Bank of Canada was
attempting to reduce inflation with high real interest
rates during this time (Figure 3.12, panel 2), and the
recession, which coincided with a global slowdown,
undermined growth and government finances (more
below).
In 1995, after having crossed the 100 percent
debt-to-GDP threshold and with substantial public
support, the Canadian government launched another
ambitious fiscal consolidation plan.51 Given the
49Revenue recovered slowly, possibly due to the performance
of the housing market: housing prices dropped by 7 percent from
their peak in 1990 and did not recover quickly, while stock prices
started to increase only in 1995.
50See, for example, Sancak, Liu, and Nakata (2011) for a more
detailed discussion of the Canadian experience.
51Convincing the public of the importance of reducing public
debt was an important element in the government’s approach to

chapter 3

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: 100 Years of Dealing with Public Debt Overhangs

already high level of taxation and disappointment
with the earlier consolidation, this plan was mainly
spending based and tackled some fundamental
structural issues behind the fiscal imbalances. In particular, the plan implemented structural reforms to
the unemployment insurance system, the system of
transfers to provinces, and the pension system.52 The
reduction in transfers to the provinces imposed additional fiscal discipline at the subnational level, with
the effect of improving provincial finances as well.
Moreover, the consolidation was supported by the
fact that in the mid-1990s, most Canadian provinces
legislated some form of fiscal regulation that explicitly imposed specific limits on fiscal indicators such
as budgetary balances, spending, and taxation.53 This
helped boost the persistence of the fiscal effort. As
a result, the primary balance moved to a consistent
strong surplus, and debt fell by 35 percentage points
over the subsequent 10 years.
The success of the fiscal consolidation effort of the
1990s was clearly amplified by the benign external
and domestic environment. Domestically, after the
Bank of Canada adopted an inflation-targeting
framework in 1991, the country was enjoying the
benefits of relatively low interest rates in an environment of low and stable inflation, while the exchange
rate depreciated slowly but steadily over the period.54
As a consequence, real rates dropped substantially
along with the premium associated with the risk
of resurgent inflation. The debt-service burden fell
from almost 10 percent of GDP in 1995 to about
7 percent in 2000. Moreover, the United States,
Canada’s foremost trading partner, experienced an
extraordinary boom in the late 1990s. This, coupled
with a strong decrease in the real effective exchange
rate, helped spur the Canadian export sector: the
contribution of exports to GDP growth averaged
more than 3 percentage points between 1993 and
2000. Despite the propitious monetary and exter-

Figure 3.12. Canada: Fiscal Consolidation after 1985
Canada went through two distinct consolidation phases in the 1980s and 1990s, the latter
leading to larger primary surpluses and declining debt. The 1990s debt reduction was also
supported by strong growth.

underscored the importance for the public of dealing with debt.

Despite large ﬁscal surpluses, the United Kingdom experienced sharply higher debt due to
very high real interest rates caused by deﬂation. The United States successfully reduced
debt through a combination of negative real interest rates and growth. Japan’s increase in
debt resulted mostly from its large ﬁscal deﬁcits. The second phase of debt reduction for
Belgium, Canada, and Italy was supported by larger ﬁscal surpluses and lower real interest
rates.

nal environment, GDP growth remained below the
advanced economy average (see Figure 3.5, panel 1).
Figure 3.12, panel 3, shows the decomposition
of the debt dynamics over these years. Given the
relevance of the 1985 consolidation, two bars are
added to cover this period, although the average is
still for the 15 years following 1995. Strong growth,
a large primary surplus, and falling real interest rates
contribute strongly to debt reduction after 1995.
Finally, the effect of the Great Recession is visible in
the last bar—weak growth and countercyclical fiscal
stimulus added to the debt during this period.
Overall, this episode highlights how fiscal,
monetary, and external factors all contribute to
the outcome. The shift in the composition of fiscal
efforts toward structural reforms and a rule-based
fiscal framework at the subnational level contributed
to the success of consolidation in 1995. But the
influence of both monetary and external conditions
is also evident. In the 1985 plan, both monetary and
external conditions hampered contraction, whereas
in 1995 these influences were supportive. Furthermore, even in a sound monetary and fiscal setting,
the effects of the Great Recession show that external
events can still compromise domestic debt reduction.

Analysis
This section draws together the experiences of
the countries covered in the case studies by comparing the policy objectives pursued, the instruments
used (such as policy rates, exchange rates, primary
surpluses, and institutional frameworks), and the
outcomes achieved. To facilitate this comparison,
Figure 3.13 shows debt decompositions for the six
cases. This comparison yields a number of lessons on
how to best deal with high levels of public debt.
The first key lesson is that a supportive monetary
environment is a necessary condition for successful
fiscal consolidation. This is evident from the cases of
the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan
(Figure 3.13, panel 1). In the United Kingdom,
despite substantial fiscal efforts that achieved and
sustained large primary surpluses, public debt ratios
were not reduced. The reason is the simultaneous
pursuit of a return to the gold standard at the prewar
parity, which required a tight monetary policy stance

chapter 3

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: 100 Years of Dealing with Public Debt Overhangs

and exceptionally high real interest rates, which offset
the contribution of fiscal surpluses to debt reduction.
At the same time, domestic prices did not fall enough
to produce a real exchange rate depreciation due to
the concomitant appreciation of the pound to prewar
parity. Furthermore, this combination of tight fiscal
and monetary policies delivered negative growth,
exacerbating the debt problem.
Given that both fiscal and monetary policies were
tight in the United Kingdom, it is conceivable that
either or both were to blame for the poor outcomes.
However, the cases of Japan, which had tight monetary
conditions and loose fiscal conditions, and the United
States, which had loose monetary and tight fiscal conditions, allow us to attribute the outcomes more clearly
to the monetary stance, as explained below.
In Japan, monetary policy was constrained by
the zero lower bound after the bursting of the stock
market and real estate bubbles in the early 1990s.
In addition, the monetary transmission mechanism
was impaired by financial sector problems. With low
growth and deflation, the Japanese authorities were
in a difficult position with respect to fiscal consolidation. Attempts to tighten fiscal policies were
either quickly abandoned after economic conditions
deteriorated or not seriously pursued. If Japan had
persisted with tight fiscal policy, it seems likely that
it would have experienced even stronger deflation
and lower growth, just as in the United Kingdom.
Still, despite an expansionary fiscal policy stance,
growth remained anemic and public debt ratios kept
increasing.
In the United States after World War II, vivid
memories of the Great Depression led people to
fear deflation more than inflation. The high level
of war debt and the associated potentially high
interest burden were also a source of concern. The
authorities adopted a policy mix that resulted in
an exceptionally supportive monetary environment
combined with tight fiscal policy. Specifically, they
adopted various policy measures (often referred to
as “financial repression”) that aimed at keeping the
nominal rates on government bonds low, while controlling inflation with a tight fiscal stance and credit
controls. This policy mix resulted in two substantial
bursts of inflation, which led to large negative real
rates and a sharp reduction in the debt-to-GDP

ratio. The supportive monetary stance was also
instrumental in lowering private borrowing rates,
thus providing stimulus to the economy. Based on
growth and fiscal performance, this policy mix was
undoubtedly successful—although inflation volatility
remained relatively high. Thus, we conclude that a
supportive monetary policy stance is a key ingredient
in successful debt reduction.
What is less clear, however, is whether this
approach could be applied in today’s economic and
financial environment. The set of controls and regulations needed for financial repression to be effective
would lead to a much less internationally integrated
financial system than we have today. Furthermore,
an unexpected burst of inflation—which accounted
for much of the debt reduction in the United States
episode—could jeopardize the institutional framework built by central banks over the past 30 years
for controlling inflation.55
Leaving aside the possibility of large inflation
surprises and financial repression, the most realistic
policy options for today appear to be those followed
by Belgium, Canada, and Italy. All three countries
implemented large fiscal adjustment in an environment where the goal of reaching or maintaining
low inflation was considered necessary for economic
stability. Their degrees of success in reducing public
debt, however, varied.56 This variation leads us to
three additional conclusions and reinforces our first
conclusion about the importance of monetary policy
in successful debt reduction.
First, even in an environment where inflation is
low, a supportive monetary environment with low
real rates is important to facilitate a reduction in
public debt. The monetary environment was tight
in the 1980s (and in Italy until the mid-1990s)
because of disinflationary efforts by central banks.
As a result, debt continued to increase in all three
countries. Figure 3.13, panel 2, shows that high real
55It is also worth noting that the period of financial repression
ended with the collapse of the Bretton Woods international monetary system because of the loss of U.S. competitiveness vis-à-vis
its trading partners, which opened the doors to the great inflation
of the 1970s.
56This can be seen from Figure 3.13, panel 2, where we present
the debt decompositions for each country across the two main
phases (that is, a tight or supportive monetary policy stance) that
we have identified in the previous case studies.

interest rates contributed to the rise in debt levels in
the initial years of each episode, despite tight fiscal
policies. It was only when real rates fell—after disinflation was achieved and credible monetary policy
frameworks were established—that all countries were
able to reduce their debt.
Second, debt reduction is larger when fiscal
measures are permanent or structural and buttressed
by a fiscal framework that supports the measures
implemented. Italian fiscal adjustment efforts led to
a considerable improvement in the fiscal balance.
However, especially before 1992, they were biased
toward temporary measures that failed to put public
debt on a steadily decreasing path—in part because
of the lack of a fiscal framework to lock in the fiscal
gains achieved.57 In fact, faced with very high levels
of taxation, fiscal efforts waned after Italy entered the
EMU. Similarly, Canada in the 1980s complemented
tax hikes with spending cuts, but the reduction in
spending was achieved with across-the-board cuts that
proved to be short lived. In contrast, in the 1990s,
Canada’s fiscal plans were much more successful in
persistently reducing public debt. This is because they
were based on well-targeted and structural measures,
including pension and entitlement reforms in a
context of tight fiscal rules at the subnational level.
Similarly, Belgium’s ability to achieve large and persistent primary surpluses can largely be explained by
structural spending cuts, which involved reductions
in public employment and reforms to the excessively
generous welfare system in the context of a fiscal
framework that enhanced accountability.
Third, the relatively successful experiences of
Belgium and Canada in the 1990s were facilitated by
a boost from strong external demand (Figure 3.14).58
While external demand is influenced by various factors,
currency depreciation helped in both cases (Canada in
the first half of the 1990s, Belgium in the second half
of the 1990s). The Italian economy benefited from the
sharp devaluation after the 1992 ERM crisis, but, in
part because of its relatively more closed economy, the
57As a matter of fact, Italy passed important entitlement
reforms in the mid-1990s, but their major benefits accumulated
only very gradually over time.
58The average ratio of exports to GDP between 1992 and
2007 in Belgium, Canada, and Italy was 0.65, 0.34, and 0.23,
respectively.

export contribution to output growth was smaller and
relatively short lived. Hence, although precise attribution is difficult here, a supportive external environment clearly contributes to the relatively better growth
performance and relatively better debt reduction in
Canada and Belgium compared with Italy.
Fourth, it takes time to turn around primary
deficits. Emblematic is the case of Belgium, which,
despite achieving the largest peacetime improvement
in the primary balance since World War II between
1981 and 1991, still took 10 years to move from a
deficit of about 7 percent to a surplus of 4 percent.
The effect of this transition on the level of debt is
visible in Figure 3.13, panel 2: the average contribution of the primary balance to debt reduction
between 1982 and 1992 was actually very small. The
observation that it takes time to turn around primary
balances is confirmed by looking at the full sample of
countries. Among advanced economies since 1980,
improvements of greater than 10 percentage points
over a 10-year period are exceedingly rare. Canada’s
best improvement was 6.7 percentage points between
1990 and 2000, and Italy achieved a 10.2 percentage
point improvement between 1987 and 1997—both
among the best since 1980 among advanced economies. In short, sustained improvements of more than
1 percentage point a year are rare, and this means
that, when starting from a primary deficit, debt
reduction takes a particularly long time.
Summing up, historical experience suggests
that countries dealing with high debt burdens are
unlikely to experience strong improvements in their
debt ratios while real rates are high and monetary
conditions remain tight. Assuming that sufficiently
supportive monetary conditions can be achieved,
fiscal policy focused on permanent or structural
reforms appears to provide larger and more enduring debt reductions than do policies based on more
temporary measures.

Conclusion
For countries currently struggling with high public
debt burdens, the historical record offers both instructive lessons and cautionary tales. The first lesson is
that fiscal consolidation efforts need to be complemented by measures that support growth: structural

issues need to be addressed and monetary conditions need to be as supportive as possible. In Japan,
for example, weaknesses in the banking system and
corporate sector limited monetary policy efficacy and
led to weak growth, which prevented fiscal consolidation. As a result, debt continued climbing until these
issues were addressed. In Italy, Belgium, and Canada,
debt did not fall until monetary conditions were supportive. Here, reforms to wage-setting mechanisms
that broke the wage-price spiral were an important
contributor to the establishment of the supportive
monetary environment. Furthermore, monetary easing also fostered exchange rate depreciation, which
supported external demand and growth.
The case of the United Kingdom reinforces this
message but also offers a cautionary lesson for countries attempting internal devaluation. The combination of tight monetary and tight fiscal policy, aimed
at significantly reducing the price level and returning to the prewar parity, had disastrous outcomes.
Unemployment was high, growth was low, and—
most relevant—debt continued to grow. Although
the price level reduction the United Kingdom was
attempting to achieve is larger than anything likely
to happen as a result of internal devaluation today,
similar dynamics are evident. A reduction in the
price level, a necessary part of internal devaluation,
comes at a high cost, and determining whether the
cost outweighs the benefit to competitiveness from
internal devaluation requires further work.
The case of the United States, although supporting the general finding about the contribution of
monetary policy, points to more outside-the-box
possibilities. U.S. monetary policy was very supportive in the immediate postwar years as a result of limits on nominal interest rates and bursts of inflation.
This particular combination quickly reduced the
debt ratio while growth remained robust. Whether
financial repression could assist in reducing debt
burdens in today’s environment, however, is much
harder to gauge. Given that the major problem for
the United States in those years was controlling
excess demand and inflation—which is not a problem faced by the countries struggling with public
debt today—it seems likely that financial repression
as practiced by the United States after World War
II would not be effective today for countries already

benefiting from historically low sovereign interest
rates. Moreover, the inflationary consequences of
financial repression could endanger the institutional
frameworks established over the past 30 years to
control inflation. Whether policies inspired by this
experience could help remains an open question.
The implications vary for countries dealing with
high debt levels today. For some, such as the United
States, where financial sector weakness has largely
been addressed and monetary policy is as supportive
as possible, it would seem that conditions are in
place for fiscal consolidation. In others, such as the
European periphery, where financial sectors remain
weak and fundamental issues relating to monetary
union remain to be addressed, progress may be limited until these issues are resolved.
A second lesson is that consolidation plans
should emphasize persistent, structural reforms over
temporary or short-lived measures. Belgium and
Canada were ultimately much more successful than
Italy in reducing debt, and a key difference between
these cases is the relative weight placed on structural
improvements versus temporary efforts. Moreover,
both Belgium and Canada put in place fiscal frameworks in the 1990s that preserved the improvement
in the fiscal balance and mitigated consolidation
fatigue.
A third lesson is that fiscal repair and debt reduction take time—with the exception of postwar
episodes, primary deficits have not been quickly
reversed. A corollary is that this increases the vulnerability to significant setbacks when shocks hit. The
sharp increases in public debt since the Great Recession—including in the relatively successful cases of
Belgium and Canada—exemplify such vulnerability.
Furthermore, the external environment has been an
important contributor to outcomes in the past. The
implications for today are sobering—widespread
fiscal consolidation efforts, deleveraging pressures
from the private sector, adverse demographic trends,
and the aftermath of the financial crisis are unlikely
to provide the supportive external environment that
played an important role in a number of previous
episodes of debt reduction. Expectations about what
can be achieved need to be set realistically.
Based on these lessons, we suggest a road map for
successful resolution of the current public debt over126

hangs. First, support for growth is essential to cope
with the contractionary effects of fiscal consolidation.
Policies must emphasize the resolution of underlying
structural problems within the economy, and monetary policy must be as supportive as possible. Such
policy support is particularly important at this point
because all major economies must address public debt
overhangs, which means they cannot rely on favorable
external conditions. Second, because debt reduction
takes time, fiscal consolidation should focus on enduring structural change. In this respect, fiscal institutions can help. Third, while realism is needed when it
comes to expectations about future debt trajectories
and setting debt targets in a relatively weaker global
growth environment, the case of Italy in the 1990s
suggests that debt reduction is still possible even without strong growth.

reSILIeNce IN eMerGING MarKet aND DeVeLOpING ecONOMIeS:
WILL It LaSt?

Many emerging market and developing economies have
done well over the past decade and through the global
financial crisis. Will this last? This chapter documents the
marked improvement in these economies’ resilience over
the past 20 years. These economies did so well during the
past decade that for the first time, emerging market and
developing economies spent more time in expansion and
had smaller downturns than advanced economies. Their
improved performance is explained by both good policies
and a lower incidence of external and domestic shocks:
better policies account for about three-fifths of their
improved performance, and less-frequent shocks account
for the rest. However, should the external environment
worsen, these economies will likely end up “recoupling”
with advanced economies. Homegrown shocks could also
pull down growth. These economies will need to rebuild
their buﬀers to ensure that they are able to respond to
potential shocks on the horizon.
During 2003–07 growth in emerging market
and developing economies accelerated (Figure 4.1,
panel 1), even as growth in advanced economies
remained weak. This stimulated a vigorous debate on
whether emerging market and developing economies
had decoupled from the advanced economies.1 That
debate was silenced temporarily by the global crisis
that emanated from the United States and Europe—
in fact, more than half of emerging market and
developing economies experienced negative growth
in 2009 (Figure 4.1, panel 2). But they quickly
bounced back, and during 2010–11 many of them
grew at or above precrisis rates. As a result, they now
account for virtually all of global growth (Figure 4.1,
panel 3).
The question on policymakers’ minds now is
whether this strong performance will last. Beyond

Figure 4.1. The Strong Performance of Emerging Market and
Developing Economies
(Percent)

Growth in emerging market and developing economies accelerated in the mid-2000s,
leading to talk of their decoupling from advanced economies. Emerging market and
developing economies were not spared during the global downturn; most experienced
negative growth in 2009. But many have recovered and are growing at or above precrisis
rates, despite continued weakness in advanced economies. As a result, they now account for
almost all global growth.

the de facto evidence of their resilience over the
past decade and through the largest global shock in
the past half-century, optimists can point to their
improved policy frameworks and the ample policy
space—room to maneuver without undermining
sustainability—these improvements have created.
These economies have also become more diversified along many dimensions—in their economic
structure, trading patterns, and the composition of
their capital flows. On the other hand, recent growth
in some emerging market and developing economies
has been supported by capital inflows, strong credit
growth, and for those that export commodities, by
the continued strength of commodity prices. These
factors are prone to reversal, which suggests that
these economies’ prospects might not be that robust
(Frankel, 2012). Some of the policy space they built
over the past decade was used during the global crisis and has not yet been fully rebuilt. And there are
now signs that growth in some of these economies is
slowing.
This chapter studies the resilience of these
economies, defined as their ability to sustain longer
and stronger expansions and to experience shorter
and shallower downturns and more rapid recoveries.2 Previous studies have attempted to directly
explain the growth of emerging market and developing economies and have had only modest success,
in part because the behavior of output in these
economies is much more complex and diverse than
in advanced economies (see, for example, Easterly,
2001, and Figure 4.2). Easterly and others (1993)
found very low persistence in their growth rates
across decades, which is hard to reconcile with the
high persistence of “fundamentals”—such as investment rates, education levels, trade, financial development, and institutional quality—that typically enter
growth regressions. Pritchett (2000) characterized
2This is consistent with the general definition of resilience,
which encompasses the same two aspects. The Oxford English
Dictionary, for example, defines resilience as “the quality or fact
of being able to recover quickly or easily from, or resist being
affected by, a misfortune, shock, or illness.” Increased resilience
would result in longer and stronger expansions, but the latter
could also result from fewer shocks—a possibility we explore in
this chapter. Shorter and shallower downturns and more rapid
recoveries are fully consistent with the aforementioned definition
of resilience, since downturns are the result of negative shocks.

their output paths as being composed of “mountains, plateaus, cliffs, and plains” and documented
large and abrupt changes in growth performance
at the country level. Some emerging market and
developing economies grow at reasonable rates for
many years and then, without any obvious change
in fundamentals, stagnate for decades, whereas
others experience long periods of stagnation interrupted periodically by bursts of fast growth. Severe
economic crises are not uncommon and tend to
happen more often in these economies. These crises
have large output costs because they often represent
declines in the trend rather than fluctuations around
a trend (Aguiar and Gopinath, 2007; Cerra and
Saxena, 2008). As a result, expansions and recoveries
in these economies have lasted anywhere from a few
years to several decades.
Analyzing the length of expansions and the
speed of recoveries could be an intermediate step in
investigating the processes underlying growth—shifts
in long-term growth or in the volatility of growth
will show up in changing duration of expansions
and speed of recoveries. Another reason for studying
their duration is to help policymakers identify the
factors that tend to halt or prolong expansions and
hasten recoveries.3
This chapter helps shed light on the past, present,
and prospective resilience of emerging market and
developing economies by addressing the following
questions:
•• How has the resilience of these economies
changed over time? Have expansions become
longer and stronger, and have downturns and
recoveries become shallower and shorter?
•• What factors, both external and domestic, are
associated with the duration of expansions and
the speed of recoveries in these economies?
•• If performance has improved over time, to what
extent has it been due to less frequent or less
3In analyzing the length of expansions and speed of recoveries,
we contribute to a growing literature that tries to shed light on
growth transitions. Examples include Hausmann, Pritchett, and
Rodrik (2005), who investigate growth accelerations; Berg, Ostry,
and Zettelmeyer (2012) and Virmani (2012), who study periods
of sustained growth; and Rodrik (1999); Becker and Mauro
(2006); and Hausmann, Rodriguez, and Wagner (2006), who
focus on growth collapses.

severe shocks, to improved policymaking, and to
structural changes such as shifts in these economies’ trade and financial linkages?
The chapter examines the evolution of output per
capita in more than 100 emerging market and developing economies over the past 60 years.4 It identifies
periods of expansion, downturn, and recovery in
their output paths. Using a variety of tools, including event studies, statistical associations, and duration analysis, it analyzes how these durations have
changed over time and how they relate to various
shocks, policies, and structural characteristics. These
are the chapter’s main findings:
•• The resilience of emerging market and developing economies has increased markedly during the
past two decades. They are spending more time
in expansion, and downturns and recoveries have
become shallower and shorter. The performance
of the past decade was particularly good, with
emerging Europe being a notable exception. In
fact, the past decade was the first time that emerging market and developing economies spent more
time in expansion, and had smaller downturns,
than advanced economies.
•• Various shocks, both external and domestic, are
associated with the end of expansions in these
economies. Among external shocks, sudden stops
in capital flows, advanced economy recessions,
spikes in global uncertainty, and terms-of-trade
busts all increase the likelihood that an expansion
will end. Among domestic shocks, credit booms
double and banking crises triple the probability
that an expansion will shift into a downturn by
the following year.
•• Good policies are associated with increased resilience. Specifically, greater policy space (characterized by low inflation and favorable fiscal and
external positions) and improved policy frameworks (countercyclical policy, inflation targeting,
and flexible exchange rate regimes) are associated
with longer expansions and faster recoveries.
•• It is more difficult to tease out the effects on
resilience of these economies’ structural characteristics—such as trade patterns, financial openness
and the composition of capital flows, and income

distribution. Few of these characteristics are
robustly associated with the duration of expansions and the speed of recoveries.

of policy space in many of these economies
account for the bulk of the increased resilience
since 1990. Some shocks, such as spikes in
global uncertainty, have become more frequent
in the past decade, but other shocks have
become less frequent, such as banking crises and
credit booms. Overall, the fact that there have
been fewer shocks accounts for about two-fifths
of the improved performance in emerging market and developing economies. Greater policy
space and better policy frameworks account for
the remaining three-fifths of the improvement in
their performance.
The rest of the chapter is structured as follows.
The first section documents how resilience has
evolved for various country groupings and regions
over time and relates these changes to deeper shifts
in steady-state growth rates and the variability of
growth. The second section relates the duration of
expansions and the speed of recoveries to external
and domestic shocks, to policy space and policy
frameworks, and to structural characteristics of
these economies. It uses standard tools of duration
analysis, including both bivariate and multivariate
models, to examine these correlates in a comprehensive and integrated manner. It then evaluates
whether the nature of these associations has changed
over time. The final section synthesizes the chapter
with an examination of how these economies’ policies and structure, as well as the shocks that buffet
them, have changed over time. It then quantifies
their relative contributions to the rise in resilience,
and concludes with a few words on the prospective
resilience of these economies.

How Has Resilience Varied across Countries
and over Time?
We begin by establishing some stylized facts about
the depth and duration of downturns, recoveries,
and expansions for various country groups and how
these have changed over the past six decades. For the
purposes of this chapter the economies of the world
132

are split into three groups.5 Following Pritchett
(2000), we define advanced economies primarily
by membership in the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development prior to 1990, with
the exception of Turkey.6 All other economies are
classified as emerging market and developing economies, which we further subdivide into two groups:
low-income countries, which are defined as the 51
economies currently eligible for concessional IMF
loans, and the remaining 69 economies, which we
classify as emerging markets. Appendix 4.1 lists the
countries included in the analysis according to their
classifications.
The primary variable of interest is the evolution of
real output per capita. We focus on this variable for
consistency with most of the literature on development, because it is the relevant measure of output
for welfare analysis, and since it accounts for differences in population growth rates across countries.
Most of the chapter’s findings continue to hold if
one uses real output instead (see Appendix 4.4).
To identify expansions, downturns, and recoveries
in output per capita, we use the statistical algorithm of Harding and Pagan (2002), which detects
turning points in the log level of a time series. The
algorithm searches for local maximums (peaks) and
minimums (troughs) that meet specified conditions
for the length of cycles and phases. Because we are
using annual data and some downturns and expansions can be as short as one year, the only condition
imposed is on the minimum length of the cycle
(a contiguous expansion and downturn), which is
specified to be five years.7 Expansions are defined as
5Throughout, we restrict our analysis to economies that have
had an average population of at least 1 million inhabitants over
the sample period.
6This implies that some economies currently classified as
advanced by the World Economic Outlook are classified as emerging markets in this chapter. We do this because over the past
60 years they were more like emerging markets than advanced
economies and because their experience—especially their ability
to grow sufficiently to attain advanced economy status—provides
valuable lessons.
7This is not too restrictive a constraint. In advanced economies,
cycles have averaged 8½ years (see Chapter 3 of the April 2002
World Economic Outlook). As noted, expansions and downturns in
emerging market and developing economies can often be much
more protracted. The imposition of a five-year minimum cycle
length serves mainly to filter out high-frequency fluctuations in

chapter 4 Resilience in Emerging Market and Developing Economies: Will It Last?

the period from the year after a trough to the year
of the peak, inclusive, and downturns are defined as
the period from the year after a peak to the year of
the trough, inclusive. Recoveries are defined as the
period from the year after a trough to the year when
output per capita reaches or exceeds the previous
peak’s level. When output is well behaved, as is the
case for most advanced economies, recoveries are
a subset of expansions. For emerging market and
developing economies, however, an expansion following a deep downturn may not reach the previous peak’s output per capita until several cycles are
completed, in which case a recovery can span several
cycles. Application of the Harding-Pagan methodology identifies 117 expansions and 105 downturns
in advanced economies and 576 expansions and
496 downturns in emerging market and developing
economies.8
How has resilience changed over time? Figures
4.3 and 4.4 plot the dynamics of output per capita
during the 10 years following a peak, with peaks
grouped by the decades during which they occurred.
We begin by looking at output dynamics following
peaks in the 1950s and 1960s—the dark blue lines
in the figures. These were golden decades for the
advanced economies and good decades for emerging market and developing economies—the median
downturn for the latter during these decades was
shallow, less than 3 percent, and it took four years
for median output per capita to regain or surpass its
previous peak (Figure 4.3, panel 2).
Emerging market and developing economies took
a sharp turn for the worse in the 1970s and 1980s
(Figure 4.3, panels 2 to 4, red lines). The median
downturn was much deeper and more protracted—
even 10 years later median output per capita failed
to recover its losses relative to the previous peak.
There were substantial variations across regions,
however (see Figure 4.4). Emerging and developing
Asia was relatively resilient in these decades, with
the median downturn and recovery lasting only four
years. This was in sharp contrast to Latin America,

Figure 4.3. Dynamics of Output per Capita following Peaks
(Median output per capita; peak = 100; years on x-axis)

The 1950s and 1960s were good decades for emerging market economies—less so for
low-income countries. But the 1970s and 1980s were cruel to both—median output per
capita remained below predownturn levels 10 years after the peak. The 1990s saw
shallower downturns and faster recoveries in emerging market economies, while the
improvement in low-income countries was most evident during 2000–06. Both groups did
comparatively well during the Great Recession.

There were differences in performance across emerging market and developing

regions (especially sub-Saharan Africa), but emerging and developing Asia fared better.
The 1990s were tough for emerging and developing Asia, but the performance of other
regions improved. All regions did better in the 2000s, except emerging Europe during

where many economies went through wrenching
debt crises in the 1980s, and to sub-Saharan Africa
and the Middle East and North Africa. In all three
of the latter regions, median output per capita
10 years later remained below (in some cases well
below) the previous peak.
Things began improving for emerging market and
developing economies in the 1990s (Figure 4.3, light
blue lines). Median output per capita followed a
path closer to that observed in the 1950s and 1960s,
although again with some variation across regions
(see Figure 4.4). The 1990s were not a great decade
for emerging and developing Asia: many economies
experienced sharp downturns during the 1997–98
Asian financial crisis. By contrast, many countries
in emerging Europe grew rapidly following their
transition-related declines in output.
But the strong performance of emerging market
and developing economies in the early 2000s and
throughout the Great Recession was unprecedented
(Figure 4.3, yellow and black lines).9 The decline in
median output per capita during downturns between
2000 and 2006 was smaller than in previous decades,
and it only took two years to recover—this was
true for both the emerging market and low-income
country subgroups. Even through the Great Recession—arguably the largest external shock in the past
half-century—both these subgroups performed well,
with median output per capita recovering to its pre­
crisis peak by the third year. The strong performance
in the aftermath of the global crisis is evident in most
regions, with the exception of emerging Europe,
where median output per capita has yet to recover to
its precrisis level (Figure 4.4, black lines). Employment in many emerging market and developing
economies has also performed well: unemployment
fell below precrisis levels by 2011 (see Box 4.1 for an
analysis of the relationship between employment and
growth in these economies).
9The

improved performance of these economies is not driven
by a subset of well-performing countries. If emerging market and
developing economies are split into commodity exporters—which
have benefited greatly in recent years from high commodity
prices—and non–commodity exporters, the same pattern of
improvement is evident in both groups. Similarly, isolating the
largest emerging markets from the rest does not alter the picture
materially. These splits are reported in Figure 4.15 in Appendix
4.4.

chapter 4 Resilience in Emerging Market and Developing Economies: Will It Last?

These economies did so well in the past decade
that for the first time, they spent more time in
expansion and had smaller downturns than advanced
economies (Figure 4.5, panel 1). In the 1970s and
1980s, emerging market and developing economies
spent more than a third of their time in downturns.
In the 2000s, however, they spent more than 80
percent of their time in expansion. In contrast, the
advanced economies have spent less time in expansion over the decades, and in the 2000s they were in
downturns more than a fifth of the time. Although
emerging market and developing economies have
been spending more time in expansion, the median
growth rate during expansions has not shown a clear
trend over the past decades—median growth during
recent expansions is not much different than during
the expansions of the 1970s and 1980s (Figure 4.5,
panel 2). But their downturns have become much
less severe and are now shallower than downturns in
the advanced economies (Figure 4.5, panel 3).

Why Has Resilience Changed? Taking a Look at
Steady-State Growth and Variability
Longer expansions and shorter downturns are, in
the end, simply manifestations of deeper changes.
One possible underlying change is that steady-state
or trend growth of emerging market and developing economies has been increasing—a higher rate
of trend growth would mean that shocks that
would have previously caused a downturn now
cause only a slowdown. A second possibility is
that the variability of growth has lessened, so that
the longer expansions and faster recoveries are the
result of fewer large, negative fluctuations.10 Or
both changes could be at work.

Figure 4.5. Along Which Dimensions Has Emerging Market and
Developing Economy Growth Improved?
(Percent)

Emerging market and low-income economies have spent more time in expansion during
the past two decades relative to the 1970s and 1980s. The 2000s was the ﬁrst decade
during which both groups spent more time than advanced economies in expansion. Median
growth in output per capita during expansions has not risen much, but downturns have
become shallower.

third possibility is that the propagation mechanism has
changed—that is, the effect of shocks has become more (or less)
persistent over time. But such a change would have ambiguous
effects on resilience as defined in this chapter. Greater persistence
would mean longer-lasting effects for positive shocks, which
would prolong expansion, but it would also mean more protracted effects for negative shocks, which would result in slower
recoveries. As it turns out, the estimated autoregressive coefficient
(from an AR(1) growth model) for emerging market and developing economies has not changed significantly over the past 40
years. See Appendix 4.2.

= low-income country. Growth in output per capita is modeled as an AR(1) process, and
the model is estimated for all countries over three subperiods—1950–69, 1970–89, and
1990–2007. See Appendix 4.2 for further details. The results are nearly identical for
1990–2011 and 1990–2007.

Although estimating potential growth is difficult, including for advanced economies, one way
to shed light on which of these various possibilities is at work is to follow Blanchard and Simon
(2001) by modeling output growth as a simple
autoregressive process—that is, by letting the
growth rate of output per capita be a function of
its lagged value and a constant, plus an innovation term. With such a model, we can calculate
measures of steady-state growth and the variability of growth. We estimate such a model for all
countries over three subperiods—the 1950s and
1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and 1990s and 2000s—
and extract the median estimates for steady-state
growth and the variability of growth for each of
these periods (see Appendix 4.2).
As Figure 4.6 shows, longer expansions, shallower downturns, and faster recoveries are the
result of both higher steady-state growth and
lower variability in growth. For emerging markets, median steady-state growth fell from 2½
percent in the 1950s and 1960s to 1½ percent in
the 1970s and 1980s; but it more than doubled,
to 3½ percent, in the 1990s and 2000s. At the
same time, the standard deviation of growth fell
to 3¼ percent, from 4¼ percent in the 1970s and
1980s.11 The same pattern holds true for lowincome countries, for which steady-state growth
markedly improved since the stagnation of the
1970s and 1980s and growth variability fell. The
improvements in emerging market and developing economies along both dimensions differ from
what is observed in the advanced economies,
where the variability of growth has been falling
over time (a phenomenon often referred to as the
Great Moderation). On its own, this would be
expected to improve resilience, but it has been
offset by lower trend growth—median steady-state
growth is less than 2 percent, about half of what
it was in the 1950s and 1960s.

11The

changes in steady-state growth and growth variability are
both statistically significant for the emerging market and developing economies.

What Factors Are Associated with Resilience?
Having established the stylized facts regarding the
changing duration of expansions and speed of recoveries in emerging market and developing economies,
we now ask which factors are associated with these
durations.12 Specifically, we explore the following, in
turn:
•• What kinds of shocks, both external and domestic, tend to derail expansions?
•• Do good policies help lengthen expansions and/or
hasten recoveries?
•• What structural characteristics help strengthen
resilience?

What Shocks Tend to End Expansions?
A large number of shocks could potentially derail
expansions in emerging market and developing
economies. We focus on a subset of economic and
financial disturbances, both domestic and external,
the risks of which are now heightened in a number
of countries:13
•• External shocks: We consider increases in global
uncertainty and world interest rates, recessions in
advanced economies, sharp declines in an economy’s terms of trade, and sudden stops in capital
inflows. Sharp increases in world interest rates,
which we proxy with the U.S. real interest rate,
have triggered crises in the past, as have spikes
in global uncertainty and recessions in advanced
economies. Similarly, adverse movements in a
country’s terms of trade or capital flows can be
destabilizing.

12It

is important to emphasize that it is very difficult to
establish causality from factors such as policies and structural
characteristics on the one hand to the duration of expansions and
recoveries on the other. Many of the variables we explore, including measures of policy space such as low inflation or stronger
fiscal balances, are endogenous to the growth process in general.
In particular, they could be a function of how long the economy
has been in expansion.
13For a related analysis of output drops and shocks, see Becker
and Mauro (2006). Adler and Tovar (2012) look specifically at
the resilience of emerging markets to global financial shocks.
Other shocks, such as political turmoil and civil unrest, have
also been important, particularly in low-income countries; see
Hausmann, Rodriguez, and Wagner (2006) and Berg, Ostry, and
Zettelmeyer (2012).

•• Domestic shocks: We consider credit booms and
banking crises. Although strong credit growth
tends to be associated with strong output growth,
excessively high credit tends to generate domestic vulnerabilities such as asset price bubbles or
consumption and investment booms, and there
is often a downturn when they burst. Similarly,
banking crises frequently have very negative macroeconomic consequences.14
The shocks under consideration differ in one
important dimension. Many external shocks, such
as a rise in global uncertainty or global interest rates
or recession in advanced economies, are clearly exogenous to emerging market and developing economies. Therefore, we examine the contemporaneous
effect of these external shocks on the probability that
the expansion ends.15 But domestic shocks, such as
a banking crisis, might be triggered by developments
in output—for example, financial sector distress may
be the result of a downturn rather than its cause. To
gauge whether banking crises tend to derail expansions—while minimizing potential reverse causality
issues—we examine the likelihood of an expansion
ending in the period immediately following a banking crisis. For credit booms, the deleterious effects of
which may take time to materialize, we examine the
likelihood of an expansion ending in the subsequent
period if there has been a credit boom during the
previous three years.
The domestic and external shocks under consideration are strongly associated with expansions
coming to an end. Figure 4.7 compares the probability of an expansion ending when these shocks
occur with the probability of an expansion ending
in the absence of such a shock. Among external
shocks, spikes in global uncertainty, recessions in
advanced economies, sudden stops in capital flows,
14See

Chapter 4 of the October 2009 World Economic Outlook.
case of sudden stops in capital flows is less clear-cut,
because a reversal in net capital flows could be driven by changes
in domestic conditions. The findings reported here for sudden stops are not sensitive to whether the contemporaneous or
lagged values of the sudden stop indicators are used. In addition,
Appendix 4.4 reports a robustness test intended to minimize
potential endogeneity, in which we focus on the subset of sudden
stop episodes referred to in the literature as “systemic sudden
stops,” which are those that coincide with a sharp rise in global
uncertainty. The results hold in this case as well.

Figure 4.7. Emerging Market and Developing Economies: Effects
of Various Shocks on the Likelihood that an Expansion Will End
(Percent)

Various shocks, both external and domestic, are associated with expansions coming to an
end. Among external shocks, sudden stops in capital ﬂows, spikes in global uncertainty,
recessions in advanced economies, and terms-of-trade busts all signiﬁcantly increase the
likelihood that an expansion will end. Among domestic shocks, credit booms double and
banking crises triple the likelihood that an expansion will shift to a downturn by the following
year.

Note: AE = advanced economy. The bars show the average probability of exiting an
expansion in the absence or presence of various types of external and domestic shocks. For
external shocks, which are more likely to be exogenous, the red bars present the
contemporaneous effect, that is, the probability that the expansion will end and the
downturn will begin in the same year as the shock. For domestic shocks, for which
endogeneity is more of a concern, the red bars are the lagged effect, that is, the probability
that the expansion will end and the downturn will begin in the year after the shock. The
probability of exit conditional on a shock also depends on the length of the expansion at the
time the shock occurs; the average probability is used as a summary measure of the
distribution of conditional probabilities. Statistically signiﬁcant differences at the 10 percent
level between the underlying distributions are denoted by starred and bolded labels.

and terms-of-trade busts all significantly increase the
likelihood that an expansion will end. Sudden stops
and advanced economy recessions have the most
pronounced effects; they raise the likelihood that an
expansion will end by a factor of two. The effect of
domestic shocks is just as strong if not stronger—
credit booms double the likelihood that an expansion will shift into a downturn by the following year,
and banking crises triple the likelihood.

How Are Policies Associated with Resilience?
We now turn to the role of monetary, fiscal, and
exchange rate policies. One of the arguments put
forward in the literature to explain higher resilience
among emerging market and developing economies
is these economies’ improved policy frameworks and
increased policy space (see, for example, Kose and
Prasad, 2010). For example, many have adopted
inflation targeting and have reduced inflation since
the early 1990s (Schmidt-Hebbel, 2009). Similarly, some have graduated from procyclical fiscal
policy and now have a greater ability to implement
countercyclical fiscal policy than in the late 1990s
(Frankel, Végh, and Vuletin, 2011) or have reduced
their fiscal deficits and public debt.16 Finally, many
have moved away from hard exchange rate pegs,
and their more flexible exchange rates act as a shock
absorber and reduce the vulnerability of the public
and financial sectors to the sudden and severe currency depreciations characteristic of currency crises
(Chang and Velasco, 2004).
We analyze both improved policy frameworks
and enhanced policy space for fiscal, monetary, and
exchange rate policies as follows:
•• Monetary policy: We consider whether the central
bank has adopted inflation targeting. To measure
policy space, we consider whether the economy
had an inflation rate above or below 10 percent.17

16Végh

and Vuletin (2012) also find that monetary policy in
many emerging market and developing economies has graduated
from being procyclical to being more countercyclical.
17Our results are robust to choosing a more stringent threshold
for low inflation. See Appendix 4.4 for details.

138

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

chapter 4 Resilience in Emerging Market and Developing Economies: Will It Last?

•• Fiscal policy: We consider whether fiscal policy was
countercyclical or procyclical.18 We also measure
policy space—the scope for further increases in
public debt without undermining sustainability (Ostry and others, 2010, p. 4). We use two
measures: whether the government was running
a fiscal surplus or deficit, and whether it had a
low or high ratio of public debt to GDP, with the
threshold for “high” public debt at 50 percent of
GDP.19
•• Exchange rate policy: We consider whether the
economy had a pegged exchange rate or not. For
policy space, we look at whether the economy had
a current account surplus or deficit, a high or low
ratio of external debt to GDP (above or below 40
percent), and a high or low ratio of international
reserves to GDP (above or below the sample
median).20
To assess the role of policies, we relate the duration of expansions and the speed of recoveries to the
various policy measures using nonparametric duration analysis methods—that is, without imposing
any structure or model on the data.21 Specifically,
we use the standard Kaplan-Meier survivor function estimator to gauge whether policy frameworks
and the availability of policy space help lengthen
18The cyclicality of fiscal policy is measured by the correlation
between the cyclical component of real government expenditure
and the cyclical component of real GDP (Kaminsky, Reinhart,
and Végh, 2004) measured over the previous 10 years. A negative
correlation reflects a countercyclical fiscal policy; a positive correlation reflects a procyclical fiscal policy.
19Mendoza and Ostry (2008) find that fiscal solvency in emerging markets diminishes beyond a public debt threshold of 50
percent of GDP, with fiscal solvency measured by the responsiveness of the primary balance to changes in the debt level. Due to
the poor coverage of data on fiscal balances across economies and
over time, we proxy the fiscal balance by the change in the ratio
of public debt to GDP adjusted by nominal GDP growth. See
Appendix 4.1 for details.
20Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003, p. 10) find that
“default in emerging markets can and does occur at ratios of
external debt to GDP that would not be considered ‘excessive’ for
the typical advanced economy.” About one-fifth of defaults they
study in these countries occurred when external debt was less than
40 percent of GDP, and one-third occurred when external debt
was between 40 and 60 percent of GDP.
21Duration analysis goes by many names, including “survival”
or “event history” analysis. Historically, such methods arose in
medical research on the determinants of human mortality (the
origin of the term “survival analysis”). See Appendix 4.3 for
details.

expansions and hasten recoveries. As with domestic
shocks, we use lagged values of the policy variables
to minimize reverse causality, so that policy characteristics in the current year are related to the likelihood that an expansion or recovery will end in the
next year.
We find that good policy frameworks have helped
emerging market and developing economies prolong
their expansions and hasten their recoveries. Figure
4.8 illustrates how their average duration is associated with the various measures of policy frameworks
and policy space.22 With regard to policy frameworks, inflation targeting and a countercyclical fiscal
policy significantly increase the length of expansions
and hasten recoveries.23 In addition, not having
a pegged exchange rate tends to lengthen expansions, but has no significant effect on the speed of
recoveries.
Adequate policy space also appears to provide a
cushion. Figure 4.8 shows that having a low inflation rate significantly lengthens expansions and
hastens recoveries. Having a fiscal surplus in the
previous year leads to significantly longer expansions,
but there is no significant impact of this variable on
the speed of recoveries. Economies with low levels of
public debt tend to recover much faster from downturns, but this variable has no significant effect on
the length of expansions. Finally, a strong external
position (characterized by current account surpluses,
low external debt, and high international reserves)
significantly lengthens expansions and hastens
recoveries.24
22The

average recovery duration shown in Figure 4.8 may be
somewhat surprising to those used to the much shorter recoveries in advanced economies, but recall from Figure 4.3 that the
median path of output per capita following peaks in the 1970s
and 1980s did not recover to the previous peak’s level even 10
years later.
23This result is in line with de Carvalho Filho (2011), who
documents that inflation-targeting economies fared better during
the Great Recession.
24Several studies find that the strength of the countries’ external
position (low levels of foreign-currency-denominated debt, low
current account deficits) was an important factor in explaining the
cross-country incidence of the Great Recession. See, for example,
Blanchard, Faruqee, and Das (2010) and Lane and Milesi-Ferretti
(2010). Didier, Hevia, and Schmukler (2012) document the
importance of foreign reserves in explaining the speed of recovery
in the aftermath of the global crisis.

In addition to macroeconomic policies, an economy’s structural characteristics shape its performance in
general and its response to shocks in particular. Various
hypotheses have been put forward in recent years that
relate changes in the resilience of emerging market and
developing economies to shifts in their economic structures. Although many potential characteristics could
affect resilience, we focus on the following:
•• Increased trade openness and diversification: There
has been a significant shift in both the trade
openness and trading patterns of emerging market
and developing economies. Trade openness has
increased substantially over time as trade regimes
have been liberalized and the costs of transportation and communication have fallen. Greater trade
openness helps reduce dependence on domestic
demand and vulnerability to domestic shocks, but
it may also make economies more vulnerable to
slowdowns in external demand. Greater diversification across trading partners would help reduce
these economies’ vulnerability to slowdowns in specific trading partners. In this regard, the dramatic
increase in trade among these economies is thought
to have helped them weather the recent advanced
economy crisis, although prospectively it may
increase their vulnerability to a slowdown in large
emerging markets like China (Box 4.2).
•• Increased financial openness and changes in the
composition of capital flows: As with trade, there
has been a steady move toward greater financial openness in many regions. Increased capital
account openness can facilitate risk sharing, but it
can also leave countries more vulnerable to financial shocks or sudden stops in capital flows. For
some emerging market and developing economies,
susceptibility to the volatility of capital flows has
been mitigated by a change in their composition—toward foreign direct investment (FDI),
which is thought to be more stable.
•• Income equality: Rodrik (1999) posits that when
social divisions run deep, the effects of external
shocks are magnified by the distributional conflicts they trigger. Adjustment to external shocks
often has distributional consequences, and in

chapter 4 Resilience in Emerging Market and Developing Economies: Will It Last?

economies where “latent social conflict” is high—
as measured by proxies such as income inequality,
ethnic and linguistic fractionalization, and social
mistrust—adjustment tends to be inadequate,
prolonging the negative effects of the shock. More
recent papers such as Berg and Ostry (2011) find
that greater income equality enables countries to
sustain periods of rapid growth.
Although the effects of shocks and policies on
the duration of expansions are apparent and almost
always significant, the effects of structural characteristics are less clear-cut (Figure 4.9, panel 1).
We use the same techniques as in previous subsections to examine their effects on the duration
of expansions and the speed of recoveries, again
using lagged values to mitigate reverse causality, so
that structural characteristics in the current year
are related to the likelihood that an expansion or
recovery will end in the following year. Greater
trade openness and trade liberalization are not
significantly associated with the duration of expansions. Nor are the extent of trade among emerging
market and developing economies or greater financial integration. In contrast, greater FDI flows are
associated with a small but statistically significant
increase in the average duration of expansions. The
strongest structural correlate of expansion duration,
at least in this bivariate exercise, is income inequality—countries with below-median income inequality have expansions that last about five years longer
than those with above-median income inequality.
The effects of structural factors on the speed of
recovery are more distinct (Figure 4.9, panel 2).
Greater trade openness and diversification, lower
financial integration, higher capital account openness,
and higher FDI are all significantly associated with
faster recoveries. But greater income equality does not
have a significant effect on the speed of recovery.

Figure 4.9. Emerging Market and Developing Economies: Effects
of Structural Characteristics on Expansion Duration and Speed
of Recovery
(Years)

It is more difﬁcult to tease out the effects of economies’ structural characteristics—such as
trade patterns, composition of capital ﬂows, and the degree of ﬁnancial integration—on
resilience. Among these characteristics, only FDI ﬂows and low income inequality were
signiﬁcantly associated with longer expansion. The effects of structural factors on the speed
of recovery are more distinct: greater trade openness and diversiﬁcation, lower ﬁnancial
integration, higher capital account openness, and higher FDI are all signiﬁcantly associated
with faster recoveries. Income inequality does not have a signiﬁcant effect on the speed of
recovery.

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

each variable’s influence requires controlling for movements in the other variables. To do this, we undertake
a multivariate analysis of resilience. We do this using
the tools of parametric duration analysis, which allow
the duration of an expansion or the speed of recovery to be modeled as a function of several variables
simultaneously. This analysis provides a sense of how
each variable is related to the chances that the episode
under study will last—that is, whether the variable
tends to increase or decrease the expected length of an
episode at a given time. Appendix 4.3 contains details
on the duration model used here.
The large number of potential correlates and the
poor data availability for some of these necessitate a
parsimonious approach to the multivariate analysis.
As noted, a wide array of factors have been identified as possible factors in the improved resilience of
emerging market and developing economies, but
there is only limited historical experience on which
to draw to test the simultaneous impact of these
various factors. For example, the data are extremely
sparse for our measure of the cyclicality of fiscal
policy prior to the 1990s. As a result, we focus on a
selected subset of the variables explored in the previous section:
•• External shocks: global uncertainty, the U.S. real
interest rate, indicators of terms-of-trade busts,
sudden stops in capital inflows, and advanced
economy recessions;
•• Domestic shocks: indicators of credit booms and
systemic banking crises;
•• Domestic policies: indicators of single-digit inflation and public debt levels below 50 percent of
GDP, and a measure of international reserves to
GDP; and
•• Structural characteristics: trade openness, financial
openness, and income equality.
Apart from the external shocks, the explanatory
variables are lagged as in the previous section to
mitigate potential endogeneity.

What Ends Expansions?
The first column of Table 4.1 shows how the
expected duration of an expansion is associated
with these variables. The estimates are based on an
accelerated failure time model, which breaks the
142

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

determinants of duration into two components:
a baseline expected duration, which captures how
long an episode is likely to last at a particular time,
independent of other variables, and a “shifter” that
scales this baseline and is a function of a set of
explanatory variables. The Weibull shape parameter for the model indicates that an expansion
has a greater chance of ending the longer it lasts
(the parameter is greater than 1). The effects of
the explanatory variables on the baseline are given
by the time ratios, which are the numbers shown
in the table for each variable. The magnitude of
these time ratios denotes the factor by which the
expected duration of the expansion is increased
relative to the baseline. If the time ratio is greater
than 1, the variable tends to lengthen the expansion or slow the recovery relative to the baseline; if
it is less than 1, it tends to shorten the expansion
or hasten the recovery.
The multivariate duration analysis for expansions
mostly confirms the bivariate relationships reported
above. External and domestic shocks tend to reduce
the length of expansions. For example, a 1 point
rise in global uncertainty reduces the expected
duration of an expansion by about 5 percent
(because the baseline expected duration is multiplied by 0.951). A 1 percentage point rise in the
U.S. real interest rate has a similar effect. Sudden
stops, advanced economy recessions, credit booms,
and banking crises reduce the expected duration of an expansion by about 40 percent. These
shocks have statistically significant effects, with the
exception of terms-of-trade busts and the U.S. real
interest rate.
The policy-related variables tend to increase the
length of expansions, although the statistical significance of these effects varies. Low inflation lengthens
the expansion by about 47 percent, whereas a 10
percent of GDP increase in international reserves
lengthens it by about 9 percent. In the multivariate
model, a low public debt level does not have a statistically significant effect on expansion duration.
The structural characteristics tend to have little to
no effect. Only higher income inequality and greater
financial integration reduce the expected expansion
duration in a statistically significant manner, but
even then, the magnitudes are small.

As seen in the second and third columns of Table
4.1, there is also some evidence that the effects of
some variables on the length of expansions have
changed over time. To investigate whether the
greater resilience observed after 1989 results from
changes in the sensitivity of expansions to shocks
and policies, we estimate a model in which the
effects are allowed to be different before and after
1989.
The sensitivity of expansion duration to shocks
has not changed over time. Although the effects of
some external shocks is slightly weaker after 1989,

only global uncertainty and U.S. real interest rates
have statistically significant effects that differ across
these subperiods, and both tend to shorten expansions more after 1989. Domestic shocks also tend to
have a weaker effect after 1989, but the difference is
not statistically significant.
The effects of policy-related variables and structural characteristics are generally similar across the
two subperiods, with a couple of notable exceptions.
Income inequality and financial openness shorten
expansion only before 1989; after 1989, they have
no statistically significant effect.

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

What Hastens Recoveries?
The three right-hand columns of Table 4.1 show
how the various factors affect the speed of recovery.
Unfortunately, data limitations require that we drop
two of the variables—banking crises and income
inequality.
The multivariate results broadly confirm the
directional effects from the bivariate analyses, but
statistical significance is much weaker. Only a few
statistically significant variables are associated with
the speed of recoveries.
In general, recoveries accompanied by the large
shocks considered in this chapter tend to be slower
(the time ratio is larger than 1), but only global
uncertainty is statistically significant. Greater policy
space helps hasten recoveries, but again with less
statistical significance than in the bivariate analyses.
Low inflation, low public debt, and high reserves
tend to hasten recoveries, but only low public debt
has a statistically significant effect. Among the structural characteristics, trade openness significantly hastens recoveries and financial openness significantly
slows them, but both effects are comparatively small.
The fifth and sixth columns of Table 4.1 show the
estimated effects on the speed of recoveries before
and after 1989. Among the external shocks, only the
effect of global uncertainty is consistently significant,
but it does not appear to have changed over time.
Terms-of-trade busts slow recoveries, but are statistically significant only after 1989. Low public debt
dramatically hastens recoveries after 1989 (roughly
halving the expected duration), but it had no significant effect before 1989. Greater trade openness tends
to hasten recoveries more before than after 1989.
The estimated effects of the other policy-related variables and structural characteristics were not statistically different between the two subperiods.

Wrapping Up: What Has Contributed to
Increased Resilience?
What are the key drivers of the increasing resilience that emerging market and developing economies have demonstrated in recent years? There are
a number of potential explanations. One is that the
shocks that afflicted them in past decades—credit
boom-bust cycles, sudden stops, and financial crises,
144

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

to name just a few—have become less frequent,
less severe, or both.25 A second is that although the
shocks themselves have not changed, their effects
have decreased over time. But, as shown in the
previous section, the effects of shocks on the duration of expansions and the speed of recoveries have
not lessened since 1989. A third is that emerging
market and developing economies have built bigger
cushions—in the form of better policy frameworks
and enhanced policy space or more diversified
production or trade patterns—that help them better
weather shocks. We explore each of these possible
explanations.
Homegrown shocks seem to have become less
frequent in recent years (Figure 4.10, panels 1 and
2). The share of emerging market and developing
economies that had a banking crisis, for example,
rose during the 1990s but fell during the 2000s.
Even with substantial financial spillovers and a
much weaker economic environment as a result of
the Great Recession, only four of these economies
(Latvia, Mongolia, Nigeria, Ukraine) had a systemic banking crisis during 2008–09, and none had
one in the past two years. Similarly, the incidence
of credit booms fell between the 1990s and the
2000s.26 Although the number of credit booms was
high during 2008–09, it fell back during 2010–11
as economic and credit conditions worsened and as
some of these economies tightened macroeconomic
and credit policies to rein in rapid credit growth. In
addition, the deviation from trend of real credit per
capita during recent credit booms has been lower on
average than during booms in previous decades (see
Figure 4.10, panel 2, red line).
Some external shocks have become more frequent,
others less frequent (Figure 4.10, panels 3 through
7). Sudden stops and spikes in global uncertainty
have been more common in the past decade. But
terms-of-trade busts and advanced economy reces25While

it may be tempting to attribute fewer or less severe
shocks to good luck, it should be kept in mind that many of these
so-called shocks are endogenous to policymaking. For example,
less frequent credit boom-bust cycles and banking crises can result
from tighter regulation and supervision.
26Emerging Europe is a notable exception here—the credit
boom-bust cycle that several emerging European countries have
gone through is one of the causes of the region’s weaker performance in the past decade.

Figure 4.10. Frequency of Various Types of Domestic and
External Shocks to Emerging Market and Developing
Economies
(Percent unless noted otherwise)

There is no clear downward trend in the frequency of shocks to these economies. Although
domestic shocks (banking crises and credit booms) were less frequent in the 2000–07 period
compared with the 1980s, the frequency of external shocks has varied. The frequency of global
uncertainty spikes and sudden stops in capital inﬂows increased between the 1980s and
2000–07, while the frequency of terms-of-trade shocks and advanced economy recessions
declined over the same period. Many of these shocks reemerged in 2008–09 but have become
less common in the past two years.

sions declined in frequency between the 1980s
and 2000–07. External shocks reemerged with a
vengeance amid the 2008–09 global crisis but have
receded in the past two years. The continued volatility of capital flows and commodity prices and the
weak activity in advanced economies suggest taking
a cautious view on the likelihood of such shocks in
the future—a point discussed further below.
There has been a broad improvement in policy
frameworks and policy space over time, and this
has increased the resilience of emerging market and
developing economies (Figure 4.11). Inflation has
fallen in many of these economies: although half of
them had double-digit inflation in the 1970s and
1980s, more than 80 percent now have inflation in
the single digits. This may partly reflect the fact that
more central banks have adopted inflation targeting. Exchange rate regimes have also become more
flexible—there are fewer hard pegs than in the 1970s
and 1980s.
The external positions of many of these economies are much improved. More are running current
account surpluses, and the median external debt
level has fallen from close to 60 percent of GDP in
the 1990s to less than 35 percent of GDP today.
Most of these economies now have external debt
levels below 40 percent of GDP, a threshold that
Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003) flag as a
level beyond which “debt intolerance” increases.
And increasing reserves have not been limited to the
high-profile Asian emerging markets—the median
emerging market and developing economy saw its
reserves rise from less than 8 percent of GDP on
average in the 1990s to 18 percent of GDP during
2010–11. It should be noted, however, that current
account surpluses come at the cost of potentially
raising global imbalances, and high reserve holdings
can entail a substantial opportunity cost.
Fiscal positions and frameworks have also
improved, although fiscal balances have not fully
recovered from the effects of the Great Recession.
Median public debt has fallen from over 65 percent
of GDP in the 1990s to less than 40 percent of
GDP in the past two years. The number of countries implementing countercyclical fiscal policies
is also on the rise. The share of emerging market
and developing economies with fiscal surpluses rose

Figure 4.12. Structural Characteristics of Emerging Market and
Developing Economies
(Percent unless noted otherwise)

Emerging market and developing economies’ structural characteristics have improved in
the 2000s. There has been a signiﬁcant increase in trade openness and diversiﬁcation
across trading partners, with a marked increase in intra-EMDE trade. Financial integration
has also increased, with a larger share of cross-border ﬂows taking the form of FDI.
Income inequality has also fallen, and fewer economies have a high Gini coefﬁcient.

The multivariate model from the previous section (see Table 4.1, column 1) can be used to shed
light on the relative contributions of these possible
explanations to resilience. Such an exercise can only
be indicative, because the results will be sensitive to
the specific variables that enter the model. Moreover,
these contributions should not be given a causal
interpretation, because we do not identify the exogenous component of policies (a Herculean task for
these economies). Nevertheless, this decomposition
can help provide a feel for the importance of the
various changes for these economies’ performance.
The model suggests that improved policies account
for about three-fifths of their increased resilience
between the 1980s and 2000–07, and fewer shocks
account for the remaining two-fifths; structural characteristics have made a negligible contribution (Figure
4.13, panel 1). As noted above and in Figure 4.10,

steadily from the 1970s to the 1990s. By the early
2000s more than one-quarter had budget surpluses,
although that number fell during 2008–09 as many
of these economies used this fiscal space to support
their economies.
Structural factors—trade openness, financial
openness, and income equality—have also mostly
moved in the correct direction. The slight downward trend in income inequality—the median Gini
coefficient among emerging market and developing
economies fell from 42 in the 1990s to less than 40
in 2008–09—may have helped increase expansion
duration (Figure 4.12).27 There has also been a trend
toward increased trade among emerging market and
developing economies, a greater share of FDI flows,
and higher trade and financial integration. But the
small and often statistically insignificant effects of
these structural characteristics suggest that they are
likely not a major factor in explaining these economies’ increased resilience.

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

Figure 4.13. Contribution of Shocks, Policies, and Structure to
the Length of Expansions in Emerging Market and Developing
Economies
The expected mean duration of expansion rose steadily from the 1980s to the early 2000s.
This increase reﬂected mostly greater policy space, with more economies achieving lower
inﬂation and building up their international reserve buffers. But fewer and less intense
external and domestic shocks also played a part. The expected mean duration of expansions
dropped precipitously over 2008–09, with the spike in external shocks coming from
advanced economies during the Great Recession. The lack of external shocks over the past
two years has helped raise the expected expansion length. However, a sharp rise in
advanced economy stresses could largely wipe out these expected gains, reducing the
expected expansion length to the level seen during the Great Recession.

Note: Expected mean durations for expansions and the contributions of variables are

declined between 1980 and 2000–07. This reduction in frequency and the estimated impact from the
duration model imply that the decline in domestic
shocks has improved the expected mean duration of
expansions by about 5 percent relative to the 1980s.
Similarly, the decline in terms-of-trade busts and
advanced economy recessions during 2000–07 relative
to the 1980s has more than offset the more frequent
spikes in global uncertainty and sudden stops in
capital inflows. On the whole, the reduced number
of external shocks has improved the expected mean
duration of expansions by about 10 percent relative
to the 1980s. The largest improvement has been in
policies, however, as documented in Figure 4.11; the
changes in the policy variables between the 1980s
and 2000–07, along with the estimated coefficients,
suggest that improved policies have increased the
expected mean duration of expansions by about 20
percent during the past two decades.28
The relative contributions of shocks, improved
policies, and structural characteristics to the increase
in resilience are similar across geographic regions and
across commodity and noncommodity exporters.
Resilience has increased even for heavily indebted poor
countries (HIPCs), partly thanks to debt relief they
are receiving under the HIPC Initiative but also as a
result of the reforms and policy improvements that are
a precondition for debt relief (see Box 4.3, and Figure
4.16 in Appendix 4.4).
The past two years (2010–11) were even better
than 2000–07 with regard to expected mean duration of expansions (Figure 4.13, panel 2), particularly for external shocks. Despite weak growth in
many advanced economies, this was not a period of
advanced economy recession. World interest rates
were low, which supported global growth and credit
conditions and fueled capital flows to emerging
market and developing economies. And global uncertainty remained elevated but was actually at the same
level on average during 2010–11 as during 2000–07.
There have also been no banking crises in emerging
market and developing economies in the past two
28The

contribution of policies could be underestimated if
the endogenous nature of some of the shocks considered here
are taken into account: improved policymaking could lengthen
expansions by reducing the incidence of shocks, such as banking
crises, credit booms, and sudden stops in capital flows.

years, and policy space has improved. Although fiscal
balances declined in the aftermath of the Great Recession, median public debt fell from about 45 percent
of GDP during 2000–07 to about 35 percent of
GDP during 2010–11, and more of these economies
now have low inflation and low public debt. Taken
together, these factors have increased the estimated
expected mean duration of expansions.

Conclusion
The results of this chapter confirm that emerging
market and developing economies are now more
resilient than in previous decades. This is not a
recent phenomenon—their performance was already
noticeably better in the 1990s than during the previous two decades, even with severe downturns such as
the Tequila, Asian, and Russian crises. But the recent
decade has really been exceptional—for the first
time, emerging market and developing economies
have performed better than advanced economies as
measured by time spent in expansion. The chapter’s findings on the explanations for these gains in
resilience lend support to an optimistic view that
they are not temporary. These economies are doing
better now both because the frequency of shocks
has fallen and because policymaking has improved.
This improvement is evident not only in emerging
markets, but also in low-income countries, including countries that are benefiting from the HIPC
Initiative.
The caveat, of course, is that the relative calm of the
past two years could well be temporary. As highlighted
in Chapter 1, there is a significant risk that advanced
economies could experience another downturn, as
continuing sovereign and banking tensions in Europe
and the so-called fiscal cliff in the United States
threaten to put the brakes on growth. Terms-of-trade
busts in emerging market and develop­ing economies
could rise if commodity prices drop. Further spikes
in global uncertainty are possible, and sudden stops
could emerge once again if greater risk aversion leads
to capital outflows. Domestic vulnerabilities could also
emerge—as noted in Chapter 1, strong credit growth
in some emerging market and developing economies,
which likely supported domestic demand, may raise
concerns about financial stability.

Should the external environment worsen again,
emerging market and developing economies will
likely end up recoupling with advanced economies,
much as they did during the Great Recession (see
Figure 4.13, panel 2, red bar). And even in the
absence of an external shock, homegrown shocks
could pull down growth further in some key emerging economies, as highlighted in Chapter 1. To
guard against such risks, these economies will need
to rebuild their buffers to ensure that they have
adequate policy space. In response to the global
downturn, policy space was rightly used to support
activity. These economies will be more resilient to
new shocks if recent improvements in their policy
frameworks—including greater exchange rate flexibility and more countercycli­cal macroeconomic
policies—are maintained, while policy buffers are
being rebuilt.

Appendix 4.1. Data Sources
The primary data sources for this chapter are the
IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) and International Financial Statistics (IFS) databases and the
World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI)
database. All the data sources used in the analysis
are listed in Table 4.2. The analytical and regional
groupings of economies are presented in Table 4.3.
Data on output per capita at the annual frequency
are from the WEO and are extended with series
from the WDI and the Penn World Tables 7.0.

External Shocks
Global uncertainty is measured by Bloom’s (2009)
index of volatility spliced with the Chicago Board
Options Exchange S&P 100 volatility index (VXO).
Spikes in global uncertainty are periods in which the
VXO is above its 75th percentile. Advanced economy
recessions are defined as in Chapter 1 of the October
2010 issue of the World Economic Outlook, with five
such recessions during our sample period: 1974–75,
1980–83, 1991–93, 2001, and 2008–09. The U.S.
ex ante real interest rate is defined as the interest
rate on three-month Treasury bills minus projected
inflation, which is the percent change in the forecast GDP deflator from the Survey of Professional

Data on net private capital flows are from the IMF

private capital flows correspond to the sum of net

portfolio flows (line 4600), net derivative flows (line
4910), and net other investment flows (line 4700),
excluding other investment flows to the general
government and monetary authorities. A sudden stop
in capital flows occurs when the ratio of net private
capital flows to GDP falls by at least 5 percentage
points from the previous year, and when the level of
net private flows is more than 1 standard deviation
below its economy-specific mean. The BPS database is
also used to obtain the net foreign direct investment
flows as a share of GDP.

from the WEO and WDI databases. In particular,
the terms-of-trade series is calculated as the percent
change in the export price deflator times the share
of exports in GDP in the previous period minus the
percent change in the import price deflator times
the share of imports in GDP in the previous period.
Terms-of-trade busts are defined as a worsening in the
terms of trade of at least 3 percent of GDP.

Domestic Shocks
The banking crisis indicator is from Laeven and
Valencia (2012). Bank credit to the private nonfinancial sector is taken from the IFS database. Breaks
in these data are identified using the IFS Country
Notes publications, and data are growth-spliced
at these points. We follow Mendoza and Terrones
(2008) and define credit booms as periods in which
the cyclical component of log real private credit per
capita is at least 1.65 times its standard deviation
above its mean.

sample period of 1 million inhabitants or more. Some economies currently classified as advanced by the WEO are classified as emerging markets in this chapter, because
over the past 60 years these economies were more like emerging markets than advanced economies and because their experience—especially their ability to grow sufficiently to attain advanced economy status—provides valuable lessons.

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

Policy Frameworks and Policy Space
The dates when countries adopted inflation targeting are from Roger (2010), and de facto exchange rate
regime data are from Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) and
Ilzetzki, Reinhart, and Rogoff (2008). We measure the
cyclicality of fiscal policy as the correlation between the
cyclical component of real government expenditure
from the WEO database and the cyclical component
of real GDP (similar to Kaminsky, Reinhart, and
Végh, 2004). A negative correlation corresponds to a
countercyclical fiscal policy, while a positive correlation corresponds to a procyclical fiscal policy. The
fiscal balance is calculated as the change in the ratio
of public debt to GDP, corrected for nominal GDP
growth. Fiscal surplus is an indicator equal to 1 if
the fiscal balance is positive. Data on public debt are
from Abbas and others (2010). The low public debt
indicator equals 1 if public debt is less than 50 percent of GDP, the level at which Mendoza and Ostry
(2008) find that fiscal solvency in emerging markets
diminishes.
The External Wealth of Nations Mark II Database (see Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2007) is used to
construct the ratios of external debt to GDP, reserves
to GDP, and financial integration, which is defined as
the sum of foreign assets and foreign liabilities divided
by GDP. The low external debt indicator equals 1 if
external debt is less than 40 percent of GDP, a threshold that Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003) flag
as a level beyond which “debt intolerance” increases.
The current account balance and consumer price
inflation are both taken from the WEO database. The
low-inflation indicator equals 1 if inflation is below
10 percent.

Structural Characteristics
Trade openness is measured as the sum of imports
and exports of goods and services over GDP. The
trade liberalization index is from Wacziarg and Welch
(2008), and capital account openness is from Chinn
and Ito (2006). Data on bilateral merchandise
imports and exports are from the Direction of Trade
Statistics database and are used to construct the share
of exports to emerging market and developing economies.
Finally, inequality, as captured in the Gini coefficient
of household disposable income, is from Solt (2009).

Appendix 4.2. Characterizing Resilience Using
an Autoregressive Process on Growth
To assess the potential drivers of resilience, this
appendix characterizes expansions and recoveries
for advanced economies and emerging market and
developing economies using a first-order autoregressive—AR(1)—process for growth in real GDP
per capita, similar to the one used by Blanchard
and Simon (2001). In particular, it explores
whether an AR(1) model with time-varying coefficients can reproduce the time spent in expansion,
median real GDP per capita growth in expansions,
and the median amplitude of downturns observed
in the data. For that purpose, the following AR(1)
process is estimated:
gt = a + bgt–1 + et

with et ~ N(0, s2),

(4.1)

in which gt is growth in real GDP per capita at
time t, a is a constant, b is the first-order autoregressive coefficient, and et is a mean-zero shock at
time t. This equation is estimated for each economy
over three subperiods: 1950–69, 1970–89, and
1990–2007. Table 4.4 presents the median estimated
coefficients, and interquartile ranges, by economy
group and subperiod.
The results for the advanced economies show
that steady-state growth and growth variability
have fallen. In particular, a and s have both
fallen over time, and b has risen. As a result,
steady-state growth, given by a /(1 – b), and

growth variability, given by s/√ 1 – b2, have
fallen. These have countervailing effects on expansion duration: lower steady-state growth implies
shorter expansions, whereas lower growth variability implies longer expansions.
The results for emerging market and developing
economies show that steady-state growth increased
and growth variability fell in 1990–2007 relative
to the previous 40 years. In particular, a fell from
1950–69 to 1970–89, but it rose in 1990–2007,
while b rose markedly from 1950–69 to 1970–89,
remaining constant thereafter. The growth shock’s
standard deviation s rose slightly from 1950–69
to 1970–89, but declined during 1990–2007
to levels below that of 1950–69. As a result,
steady-state growth rose and growth variability

fell, resulting in both longer expansions and faster
recoveries.29
With these estimations in hand, this appendix
explores whether the characteristics of expansions and
recoveries seen in the data for emerging market and
developing economies can be replicated with simulated data based on the median estimated coefficients
in Table 4.4 for 1970–89 and 1990–2007. In particular, we use the median coefficients for the emerging
market and developing economies in each subperiod
to run 1,000 simulations of the growth processes for
50 years each. The Harding-Pagan algorithm is then
applied to identify peaks and troughs in the level of
simulated GDP per capita. In addition, each coefficient is changed one at a time to assess its impact on
resilience. Figure 4.14 presents the results.
The AR(1) model for real GDP growth per capita
suggests that the improvement in resilience observed

in emerging market and developing economies during the past 20 years has been mostly a result of an
increase in steady-state growth and to a lesser extent
of lower output variability. However, as discussed
below, these results must be viewed with caution
because a linear AR(1) model cannot replicate some
of the stylized facts presented in this chapter.
The AR(1) model underestimates the time spent in
expansion during 1970–89 and overestimates it during
1990–2007, resulting in a larger rise across periods
than in the data (Figure 4.14, panel 1). The increase
in time spent in expansion is mostly due to a rise in a.
The coefficients b and s have no impact on the change
in time spent in expansion (Figure 4.14, panel 2).
The AR(1) model overestimates growth during
expansions during 1970–89 and underestimates
growth during 1990–2007, resulting in no change
between subperiods, even though the data indicate
that there was an increase in the growth rate during this period (Figure 4.14, panel 3). In short, the
rise in growth during expansions due to a higher a
is fully offset by the fall in growth due to a lower s

Figure 4.14. Emerging Market and Developing Economies:
Effects of Changing the Autoregressive Model Coefﬁcients
Simulated data from a calibrated AR(1) model with time-varying coefﬁcients broadly
replicate the stylized facts of resilience in emerging market and developing economies.
However, comparing 1970–89 and 1990–2007 shows that the simulated data overestimate
the increase in the time spent in expansion, and underestimate the median real GDP growth
during expansions and the amplitude of downturns. Most of the gains in resilience between
1970–89 and 1990–2007 result from an increase in the constant (α) and to a lesser extent
from a lower standard deviation of growth innovations (σ).

Appendix 4.3. Duration Analysis
As a first step in the analysis of the duration of
each episode (expansion or recovery) we map the
data from calendar time into analysis time (denoted
by t), which counts the time elapsed since the
start of an episode (t = 0). Duration analysis then
involves modeling how the evolution of the episode
(as influenced by various explanatory variables)
affects the likelihood that the episode will end at a
point during the analysis time.

(Figure 4.14, panel 4). In addition, the AR(1) model
underestimates the amplitude of downturns during
both subperiods (Figure 4.14, panel 5). The decline in
the downturns’ estimated amplitude from 1970–89 to
1990–2007 is mostly due to an increase in a and to a
lesser extent to a decline in s (Figure 4.14, panel 6).

Note: Peaks and troughs in output per capita are identiﬁed using the Harding-Pagan
algorithm (Harding and Pagan, 2002). The simulated data are constructed using the median
estimated coefﬁcients from Table 4.4 for each period. These coefﬁcients are plugged into an
AR(1) equation for GDP growth per capita, and the growth innovations are drawn from a
normal distribution with mean zero and variance of σ2, to run 1,000 simulations of growth
processes for 50 years each for each period. The generated series of GDP growth per capita
are then used to construct indices of GDP per capita in levels.

Figure 4.7 shows the average probability that an
episode will end, conditional on whether or not
a shock has occurred. The mean is taken over the
sample probabilities that an ongoing episode will
end at each point in the analysis time. Statistical
significance is calculated from a test of the difference
between the set of estimated probabilities in which
the shock occurs and the set in which it does not.
Figures 4.8 and 4.9 show the average duration of
an episode conditional on whether or not the characteristic of interest was present during the episode.
These average durations are calculated from the
Kaplan-Meier estimated survival curves conditional on
the characteristic. Sometimes known as the “product
limit estimators of the survival curve,” the KaplanMeier curve estimation involves (1) calculating the
probability that an episode will continue beyond a
point in the analysis time, given that it has lasted
until that point; and (2) taking the rolling product
of these probabilities at each point in analysis time
(Kaplan and Meier, 1958). The result is a mapping of
analysis time to the probability of continuation, given
that an episode has lasted until that point:

in which j indexes the set of observed episode lengths,
S‒ represents the estimated survival curve, nj is the
number of episodes at risk of ending at time tj , given
that they have lasted until that time, and dj is the
number of episodes at time tj that actually ended.
From this curve (using the sample with or without the characteristic of interest), we calculate the
expected duration of the episode. Statistical significance is given by a log-rank test of the difference
between the two estimated survival curves. The
methods used in the bivariate analysis are fundamentally nonparametric, since no specific probability distribution is assumed to govern the data.

Multivariate Analysis
The duration model used in the multivariate
analysis is an accelerated-failure-time model, based
on the Weibull distribution. The model assumes
that the length of episode j, here denoted tj, can be
expressed as the product of a Weibull-distributed
random variable tj and a scaling proportion that
depends on the weighted sum of a set of explanatory
variables (denoted by the vector xtj):
tj = exp(xtj'b)tj



k



= exp ∑ bk xk,tj tj ,
k=1

(4.3)

in which tj has a Weibull distribution with shape
parameter g. The estimated coefficients bk are the
weights applied to each of the explanatory variables
in the scaling proportion. As described in the text,
we show the exponentiated coefficients in Table 4.1,
which may be interpreted as time ratios, indicating how much the baseline expected duration E(tj)
would be shortened or lengthened by a one-unit
change in a variable. See Cleves and others (2010)
for an in-depth description of the approach.

Appendix 4.4. Robustness and Additional
Results
We undertook six robustness checks of our
baseline model, including (1) accounting for
unobserved heterogeneity in episodes across countries by random effects (also known as “frailties”

in the duration analysis literature); (2) an alternative definition of the sudden stop indicator,
in which it is interacted with an indicator for
spikes in global uncertainty, to capture “systemic”
sudden stops; (3) a more stringent cutoff for the
low-inflation indicator, in which we consider
whether an economy had an inflation rate below 5
percent; (4) accounting for common decade fixed
effects; (5) an alternative distributional assumption (the generalized gamma); and (6) using real
GDP instead of real GDP per capita to define
periods of expansion. The results of these robustness checks are shown in Table 4.5.
It is readily apparent that the point estimates for
the time ratios are typically quite similar across the
columns (with the baseline specification repeated in
column 1 for convenience). The statistical significance of the estimates is also similar across specifications, although it tends to be marginally reduced
when frailties are used to account for unobserved
heterogeneity.
We also looked at whether our findings for expansions hold for expansions characterized by rapid
and sustained growth. To identify these episodes,
we removed a 4 percent linear growth trend from
real GDP per capita for each economy and applied
the Harding-Pagan algorithm to find the turning
points in the detrended series. We then undertook
our baseline duration analysis for the growth expansions (periods from trough to peak in the detrended
series). The results of this analysis are shown in
column 8 of Table 4.5. The results are broadly
aligned with the findings for the level expansions
(column 1)—external and domestic shocks tend to
shorten growth expansions, whereas policy space
tends to lengthen them. The statistical significance
of the estimated results is sometimes reduced, but
this appears to be largely a function of the much
smaller sample size, given that the point estimates
themselves are quite similar to the baseline for level
expansions. Thus, the variables associated with longer level expansions are also associated with longer
growth expansions.
We investigated whether the stylized facts for
emerging market and developing economies’
expansions over the past decades were driven by
the experience of commodity exporters or by

the largest economies. Figure 4.15 shows that
neither of these groups appears to be driving the
changes in resilience seen from the 1980s to the
2000s. Commodity exporters and noncommodity exporters follow the same patterns, although
at a somewhat different pace. The median commodity exporter was more adversely impacted in
the 1980s, whereas the median noncommodity
exporter tended to have even stronger growth in
the 2000s after a peak. The largest 30 economies
also show similar patterns of resilience when
compared with the other, smaller economies. The
most marked difference is probably the somewhat
poorer performance after a peak of smaller economies during the 1980s.
Finally, we examine whether the relative contributions of shocks, policies, and structural characteristics differ across regions, commodity and
non–commodity exporters, and for heavily indebted
poor countries eligible for debt relief under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative. We use
the same method for decomposing the change in
expected duration of expansions as in Figure 4.13.
As mentioned in the main text, this decomposition is an accounting exercise, and care should be
taken that these contributions not be given a causal
interpretation.
As shown in Figure 4.16, our finding that
improved policies account for the bulk of the
increase in expected duration of expansions from the
1980s to the 2000s holds across all emerging market
and developing economy regions and subsamples.
Less frequent domestic and external shocks also contributed to improved performance. Structural characteristics had a negligible contribution in almost
all subsamples, with the exception of emerging and
developing Asia—in that region, financial openness almost doubled between the 1980s and 2000s,
resulting in a negative contribution to expected
duration of expansions.

chapter 4 Resilience in Emerging Market and Developing Economies: Will It Last?

Box 4.1. Jobs and Growth: Can’t Have One without the Other?
Emerging market and developing economies
have enjoyed robust growth during the past
decade and bounced back quickly from the Great
Recession, in marked contrast to the more tepid
recovery in advanced economies. These divergent
growth trajectories were reflected in their labor
markets. For instance, unemployment—both numbers of people unemployed and rates—remained
substantially higher in 2011 in advanced economies compared with 2007. In contrast, although
unemployment in emerging market and developing
economies did go up during the Great Recession,
by 2011 it was essentially back to precrisis levels
(Figure 4.1.1).
Is the observed correspondence between jobs and
growth a surprise, or does it represent a systemic
feature of emerging market and developing economies? This box shows that the short-term relationship between labor market developments and output
growth has been fairly strong in many of these economies for the past 30 years. Hence, although the
emphasis on structural policies to lower long-term
unemployment and raise labor force participation
remains appropriate, cyclical developments deserve
adequate consideration as well. The short-term
relationship between jobs and growth suggests that
macroeconomic policies to maintain aggregate
demand also likely play an important role in labor
market outcomes in many of these economies.

Does One Law Fit All?
The short-term relationship between U.S. output
and unemployment documented by Okun (1962)
has since become famous as “Okun’s law.” Ball,
Leigh, and Loungani (forthcoming) investigate how
well Okun’s law explains short-term changes in the
unemployment rate for the United States since 1960
and for a sample of 20 advanced economies since
1980.
Ball and others (forthcoming) conclude that
Okun’s law is a strong and stable relationship in
most advanced economies. That is, they confirm
the view that short-term changes in unemployment

are driven by changes in output. On average, a 1
percent deviation of output from potential leads to
a reduction in cyclical unemployment of about ½
percentage point. Deviations from Okun’s law occur,
but they are usually modest in size and short lived.
However, although Okun’s law fits the data for
most countries, the coefficient in the relationship—
the effect of a 1 percent change in output on the
unemployment rate—varies across countries, ranging from –0.16 in Japan to –0.85 in Spain.
How well does Okun’s law hold in emerging
market and developing economies? As in Ball and
others (forthcoming), we interpret Okun’s law as
a relationship between the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate and the deviation of
output from its potential:

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

159

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

Box 4.1. (continued)
ut – ut* = a( yt – yt*) + errort ,

(4.1.1)

in which u is the unemployment rate, y is log
output, and * indicates a long-term (natural rate or
potential) level. The assumption behind equation
(4.1.1) is that shifts in aggregate demand cause
fluctuations in output, which in turn cause firms
to hire and fire workers. The error term captures
factors that shift the unemployment-output relationship, such as unusual changes in productivity
or in labor force participation. To measure u*, the
natural rate of unemployment, and y*, potential
output, we smooth the series for u and y with the
Hodrick-Prescott filter.
We also estimate a version of Okun’s law in first
differences:
ut – ut–1 = c + a( yt – yt–1) + errort .

(4.1.2)

Here, the change in unemployment depends on
the change in output and a constant. This follows
from equation (4.1.1) if the natural rate u* is constant and potential output grows at a constant rate
c/a. For many of these economies, these assumptions
may not be reasonable because of time variation
in u* and growth accelerations and slowdowns.
As noted in the main text of this chapter, output
in these economies is often characterized not by
“smooth hills” but by “mountains, cliffs, plateaus,
and plains.” Nevertheless, both the levels and the
first-differences specifications show some evidence
of the robustness of the results to alternate assumptions about the long-term levels of output and
unemployment.1
The usefulness of unemployment rates as an
indicator of labor market slack in emerging market
and developing economies is often questioned.
1We carried out other robustness checks as well. In the
levels specification—equation (4.1.1)—we tried smoothing
parameters for the Hodrick-Prescott filter of 100 and 12
(the latter suggested by Rand and Tarp, 2002, for developing
economies). The results are quite similar, so only the ones for
the smoothing parameter of 100 are discussed here. In the
first-differences specification—equation (4.1.2)—we also tried
a version including a time trend and the lag of the change
in unemployment. The results of these specifications were
very similar to the baseline specification and therefore not
reported.

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

One argument is that in low-income countries
people cannot afford to be unemployed; everyone
is in some kind of job, either in the rural sector or in self-employment. Another argument is
that many of these economies have large informal
sectors, so that neither the unemployment nor
the employment statistics have much relevance
(Agénor and Montiel, 2008; Singh, Jain-Chandra,
and Mohommad, 2012).
To address the first of these issues, we also estimate a version of Okun’s law using employment as
the dependent variable:
et – et–1 = c + a( yt – yt–1) + errort ,

(4.1.3)

in which e is log employment. The second issue is
addressed later when we look at the relationship
between Okun coefficients and the level of informality.

Okun’s Law in Emerging Market and Developing
Economies: The Evidence2
We use data on employment, unemployment,
and real GDP for 80 economies between 1980 and
2011, but the length of the time series varies across
countries. We also present results for a subset of
countries that have at least 30 years of data.
The results confirm the validity of Okun’s law
for most countries, though the strength of the
relationship varies. Figure 4.1.2, panel 1, shows
the distribution of Okun coefficients using equation (4.1.2). As shown, the estimates range from
small positive values to –0.8, with the majority
of the estimates between –0.2 and –0.4. For the
group of countries with longer time series, the
distribution is quite similar. Estimating the specification in levels (equation 4.1.1 above) yields
qualitatively similar results; the rank correlation
between the two sets of Okun coefficients is 0.6.
Using employment as the dependent variable, the
estimates range from small negative values to 0.8
(Figure 4.1.2, panel 2). The rank correlation with
the estimates using unemployment as the dependent variable is –0.6.

2This section draws on ongoing work by Ball and others
(forthcoming).

To summarize, regardless of the choice of the
three specifications discussed above, there is a
significant short-term relationship between output
fluctuations and developments in the labor market.
Table 4.1.1 compares the average value of the
Okun coefficient and the employment responsiveness in advanced economies with that in emerging
market and developing economies. It is evident
that on average the short-term relationship between
labor market outcomes and output is weaker in
emerging market and developing economies than in
advanced economies.

Accounting for Cross-Country Differences3
We also carry out an investigation of some of the
factors that account for the cross-country variation
in Okun coefficients. As discussed, many emerging
market and developing economies are characterized
by large informal sectors. Intuitively, countries with
larger informal sectors should have a smaller Okun
coefficient—that is, unemployment should respond
less to a given change in output (see Figure 4.1.3,
panel 1). Ball and others (forthcoming) document
a positive relationship for advanced economies
between the estimated Okun coefficient and the
average level of unemployment: in countries in
which unemployment is higher on average, it also
fluctuates more in response to output movements.
Although the reason for this association is not
apparent, we find that a similar correlation holds for
emerging market and developing economies as well
(Figure 4.1.3, panel 2).
Some recent studies have probed the responsiveness of employment to output (Crivelli, Furceri, and
Toujas-Bernaté, forthcoming; Ahmed, Guillaume,
and Furceri, 2012). These studies suggest that the
responsiveness could depend on features such as
labor and product market flexibility. For instance,
in discussing hiring and firing regulations in Middle
Eastern and North African countries, Ahmed,
Guillaume, and Furceri (2012) argue that such
regulations can discourage “firms from expanding
employment in response to favorable changes in
the economic climate.” That is, greater employment
protection can dampen hiring and firing as output
fluctuates, reducing the employment responsiveness.
3The data on informality used in this box are from
Schneider (2004) and Schneider, Buehn, and Montenegro
(2010). The indicators of labor and product market flexibility are described in Crivelli, Furceri, and Toujas-Bernaté
(forthcoming).

Figure 4.1.3, panels 3 and 4, suggests that greater

correlated with higher employment responsiveness.

estimates of these determinants of Okun coefficients

4Because our dependent variables are based on estimates,
the dependent variable is measured with different degrees of
precision across countries; hence, we use a WLS estimator.
Specifically, the WLS estimator assumes that the errors et are
distributed as ei ~ N(0, s2 ÷ si), in which si is the estimated
standard deviation of the residual of the Okun coefficients
(or employment responsiveness) for each country i, and s2 is

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

in the first two columns confirm that Okun coefficients do depend on the size of the informal sector
and the average unemployment rate, as suggested by
Figure 4.1.3, panels 1 and 2. The other four regressions
in the table examine the determinants of employment
responsiveness. Informality influences the responsiveness, but the average unemployment rate does not have
a significant impact. Greater labor and product market
flexibility each individually raise employment responsiveness. However, when the two are entered in the
regression together, only the effects of product market
flexibility are statistically significant.5

Policy Implications
The structural challenges facing labor markets
in emerging market and developing economies
deservedly receive a lot of attention. In many of
these economies, unemployment rates, particularly
youth unemployment rates, remain alarmingly high.
Other economies face the challenge of raising labor
force participation, particularly among women. The
results of this box lend support to a focus on policies to address these structural challenges: the cyclical relationship between jobs and growth is weaker,
on average, in emerging market and developing
economies than in advanced economies.
At the same time, the finding of a significant relationship in many countries suggests that cyclical considerations should not be ignored. Aggregate demand
policies that support output growth in the short
term can also help labor markets recover. The results
also point to an interaction of cyclical and structural
considerations. The strength of the short-term relationship between jobs and growth depends on structural
features of the economy such as informality and the
degree of product market flexibility. The evidence
suggests that as informality is reduced and product
markets become more flexible, the short-term relationship between labor market outcomes and growth will
become stronger.
an unknown parameter that is estimated in the second-stage
regression.
5We do not find evidence of a significant relationship
between labor and product market flexibility and the Okun
coefficients, which is similar to the findings of Ball and others
(forthcoming) for advanced economies.

This box explores the potential impact of an
investment slowdown in China on growth in
other emerging market and developing economies.
China’s growth model has become increasingly
dependent on investment during the past decade.
Investment contributed about one-half of China’s
GDP growth in the first decade of the 2000s, with
particularly large contributions toward the end of
the decade (Figure 4.2.1, panel 1). In part, this
reflects the steep increase in infrastructure investment during the 2008–10 stimulus response to the
Great Recession. But it appears that other forces
are increasingly contributing to investment growth,
including the ongoing urbanization process, the
more recent emphasis on social housing construction, and capacity building in high-end manufacturing and services.
Associated with these changes are important
shifts in China’s import basket. As more manufacturing takes place onshore, the share of machinery
imports has been gradually declining, whereas mineral and metal imports have grown steadily (Figure
4.2.1, panel 2).
These developments have had a noticeable
impact on global trade flows over the past decade
as trading partners sent an increasing fraction of
their exports to China (Figure 4.2.2, panel 1). The
importance of exports to China, when assessed
relative to trading partner GDP, shows even sharper
increases for several economies. This ratio has, on
average, quadrupled during 2001–11 (Figure 4.2.2,
panel 2).
The trends suggest that China’s rapidly expanding investment may have had a large positive
impact on its trading partners’ growth. But with
investment already close to 50 percent of output
and China’s continued reliance on investment to
drive growth, it is unclear whether the new capacity
will be profitable. An abrupt and disorderly end to
the investment boom, albeit a tail risk, could have

This spillover measure varies across countries
based on their export exposure to China and over
time based on fluctuations in China’s fixed investment growth. By construction, it measures only the
influence of Chinese activity on other economies
through the direct trade channel; indirect exposure
through vertically integrated intermediate economies or through lower commodity prices is not
captured.
The effect of the spillover on China’s trading
partners’ growth is estimated by regressing emerging market and developing economies’ growth
rates on this spillover measure and a number of
other controls, including these economies’ lagged
growth, terms of trade, and output volatility. The

sample covers the period of China’s membership
in the World Trade Organization (2002–11) and
includes the set of emerging market and developing economies classified under the MSCI AC
World Index and key commodity producers. The
regression is also estimated using different measures of fixed investment growth in China: overall,
manufacturing, and nontradables (calculated by
applying shares in fixed asset investment data, available beginning in 2003). This breakdown allows
for a comparison of spillovers from a slowdown
in manufacturing investment with a deceleration
concentrated in nontradables.2
In line with China’s widening footprint on
global imports, the effect of China’s investment
on its trading partners’ growth has increased over
time. The most heavily exposed emerging market
economies are those within the Asian regional
supply chain, such as Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan
Province of China. The results suggest that GDP
growth in Taiwan Province of China decreases by
slightly over nine-tenths percentage point for every
1 percentage point deceleration in investment
growth in China (Figure 4.2.3, panel 1).
Among commodity exporters, the impact is
largest on mineral ore exporters with relatively less
diversified economic structures and higher concentrations of exports to China. In response to a 1 percentage point slowdown in investment growth in
China, the estimated effect on Chile’s growth is a
decrease of close to two-fifths of a percentage point.
By contrast, larger commodity exporters with more
diversified economies, such as Brazil and Indonesia,
experience smaller declines in growth (Figure 4.2.3,
panel 2).3
2The

nontradables sector is defined to include utilities, construction, transportation and storage, information
technology, wholesale and retail trade, catering, banking
and insurance, real estate, leasing and commercial services,
education, health care, sports and entertainment, and public
administration.
3Related to this analysis, a factor-augmented vector
autoregression model relating G20 macroeconomic, financial,
trade, and global commodity price variables finds that a
1 percent decline in China’s fixed asset investment from
baseline would, on average, lead to drops of 0.8, 1.0, 1.6,
1.8, 1.8, and 2.2 percent for prices of iron ore, aluminum,
copper, lead, nickel, and zinc, respectively, within one year

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

A decomposition of investment into manufacturing and nontradables shows that spillover effects
from China’s manufacturing investment reflect the
influence of global demand. Once global demand is
included as an additional control in the regression,
the spillover from manufacturing fixed investment
in China no longer has a statistically significant
impact on its trading partners’ growth (whereas
global demand does). By contrast, nontradables
investment in China has a significant spillover
impact on its trading partners’ growth above and
beyond the effects of global demand.
The analysis also shows that direct spillover
effects from consumption growth on trading partners’ growth have been negligible in recent years.
China’s share in global consumer goods imports has
increased at a slower pace than its share in global
consumption over the past 15 years. China currently plays a small role as an importer of consumer
goods, accounting for only 2 percent of global
consumer goods imports.4 The low import intensity
of final consumption in China suggests that if a
transition to consumption-based growth takes place
in response to the structural reforms envisaged in
the 12th Five-Year Plan, the direct benefits to consumer goods exporters are likely to be small. Nevertheless, China’s trading partners may still benefit
from indirect access to Chinese consumers by
selling intermediate goods, parts, and components
to Chinese firms that then assemble and customize
final products for the local market.

Resilience in Emerging Market and Developing Economies: Will It Last?

Box 4.3. Resilient Growth in Low-Income Countries: Kenya and Tanzania
Kenya and Tanzania are among the group of
emerging market and developing economies that
showed marked resilience during the Great Recession. Both outpaced earlier advanced economy
growth, experienced only a modest growth
slowdown during 2008–09, and have charted a
subsequent rapid and robust recovery (Figure 4.3.1,
panel 1).1
A decade of improved macroeconomic stability
has helped underpin this resilience. In Tanzania,
reforms since the late 1990s liberalized foreign
exchange and financial markets and foreign trade,
and diminished the role of parastatals. Inflation fell
from 20 to 30 percent in the 1990s to 5 percent
in the mid-2000s, fiscal revenues increased from
10 to 15 percent of GDP, and gross reserve cover
broadly doubled. With the help of the IMF’s
Heavily Indebted Poor Country/Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative, the debt burden was also halved in
relation to GDP. In Kenya, reforms started earlier,
with a major program to liberalize price controls,
import licensing, and exchange restrictions, as well
as steps to privatize parastatals and reduce civil
service numbers. As a result of prudent fiscal policy,
Kenya’s public debt fell from 54 percent of GDP in
2001 to 38 percent in 2008.
Macroeconomic stability and market-friendly
policies helped provide a durable growth impetus.
As in much of Africa, growth in Kenya and Tanzania has been driven by strong domestic markets,
led by a growing middle class. For both countries,
an improved investment outlook contributed to
a sustained expansion in private sector construction spending. At the same time, the adoption of
new technologies has contributed to rapid growth
in communications and finance. This engine of
growth helped shield both economies from the
global downturn, with spending on construction,
communications, and finance continuing to grow

at a 9 to 10 percent real rate throughout the Great
Recession.
Strengthened macroeconomic buffers also provided
space for a countercyclical policy response to the
global downturn. With modest fiscal deficits and sustainable levels of public debt, both countries allowed
government spending to rise between 2006/07 and
2008/09—by 4½ percentage points of GDP in
Tanzania and by 2 percentage points in Kenya.2 This
fiscal stimulus helped offset growth spillovers from a
less favorable external environment. Monetary policy
was also supportive. Tanzania halved its short-term
interest rates between 2007 and 2009. And in Kenya,
a recent IMF study shows that supportive monetary
conditions were successful in offsetting most of the
contractionary impact of the Great Recession, which
would otherwise have resulted in output falling well
below its potential (Figure 4.3.1, panel 2).3 Under
floating exchange rate regimes, both currencies appreciated in real terms against the dollar through 2009,
though this did not offset the overall impact of fiscal
and monetary easing. Both countries saw quick, albeit
temporary, deterioration in their overall balance of
payments in 2008, but weathered it readily using their
healthy gross reserve buffer (of about four months of
imports) and by resorting to new IMF financing.
Diversification of production and export activity may also have helped their resilience. At the
product level, Kenya has increased its exports of
intermediate nonmanufactured goods while diversifying its tourism market. In Tanzania, a significant
decline in traditional agricultural exports was offset
by growth in exports of minerals and manufactured
goods. At the market level, Kenya’s trade with other
emerging market and developing economies has

remained broadly stable at slightly more than half
of total exports; in Tanzania, sales to these economies doubled to represent two-thirds of exports,
helping the country decouple from the advanced
economy growth cycle (Figure 4.3.1, panel 3).
Both countries are projected to sustain a robust
pace of growth through 2012. The rate of expansion is likely to remain somewhat below the peak
rates seen during 2006–07 given steps to gradually
reverse the 2008–09 fiscal stimulus and because of the
monetary tightening adopted since mid-2011 to bring
down food-price-related inflation. Credit growth has
decelerated in both countries but remains sufficient to
support steady growth. More generally, unlike in some
other emerging market and developing economies,
growth has been supported by direct investment and
capital repatriation, which are less likely to experience
sudden stops, and the financial sector remains robust,
with low levels of nonperforming loans.
The resilience of Kenya and Tanzania could
be tested, however, in the event of an intensified downturn in the global economy. Sustained
growth in exports has supported their external
performance so far, but a new global downturn,
including emerging market and developing economies, would bring new balance of payments pressures. Both countries also have more constrained
policy space than at the start of the Great Recession, with higher fiscal deficits and debt levels,
higher inflation, and somewhat lower gross reserve
cover. Accordingly, both countries are rebuilding
macroeconomic buffers under programs supported
by the IMF: Kenya’s economic program has been
supported by a three-year Extended Credit Facility
since 2011, and Tanzania recently accessed an
18-month precautionary Standby Credit Facility to complement its preexisting Policy Support
Instrument arrangement.

Annex

IMF Executive Board Discussion of the Outlook,
September 2012

The following remarks were made by the Acting Chair at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the
World Economic Outlook, Global Financial Stability Report, and Fiscal Monitor on September 14, 2012.

E

xecutive Directors noted that the global
economic recovery remains fragile and
risks to the global financial system have
increased. Growth has slowed recently
both in advanced and in emerging market and
developing economies, and the outlook remains
subdued, largely because policies in major advanced
economies have failed to instill lasting confidence.
Directors emphasized that clear and credible poli‑
cies in advanced economies, with improved policy
coordination and communication, are of paramount
importance to address immediate downside risks.
In this regard, ongoing efforts at fiscal consolida‑
tion and structural reform, as well as recent policy
initiatives in key advanced economies, should help
improve financial stability, lower public debt over
the medium term, spur growth, and contribute to
strengthen market confidence.
Directors agreed that downside risks to the
outlook remain considerable. Principal sources of
near‑term risk are the protracted crisis in the euro
area and the “fiscal cliff” and impending “debt
ceiling” in the United States. Geopolitical risks that
could lead to a disruption of oil supply also remain
a concern. Over the medium term, the elevated,
though gradually declining, public debt in advanced
economies could dampen investor confidence and
destabilize global bond markets. Furthermore,
stress in key regions could have large spillover
effects given cross‑border macro‑financial and trade
linkages.
Directors concurred that resolving the euro area
crisis remains the most important policy priority.
They welcomed the recent decisions by the Euro‑
pean Central Bank to increase liquidity support
and safeguard an appropriate monetary policy
transmission, particularly through the Outright

Monetary Transactions program. They urged timely
and accelerated implementation of these and
other measures to strengthen the currency union
and reduce financial fragmentation. In particular,
Directors supported the establishment of a banking
union with a unified financial stability framework,
as well as further fiscal integration, recapitalization
or restructuring of viable banks, and resolution of
nonviable banks. It is also imperative to make the
euro area firewall sufficiently flexible to help break
the adverse feedback loop between sovereigns and
banks.
Directors observed that most countries have
made progress in reducing fiscal deficits, improv‑
ing fiscal policy frameworks, and strengthening
fiscal governance. Nevertheless, they noted that
debt levels remain high and underscored the need
for sustained medium‑term fiscal consolidation to
achieve debt sustainability. The United States and
Japan, in particular, urgently need to adopt credible
medium‑term fiscal adjustment plans to reduce
their debt to sustainable levels. Fiscal tightening
should be executed in a manner that makes public
finances growth friendly and efficient. Most Direc‑
tors considered that in countries with fiscal space,
near‑term fiscal adjustment plans should be imple‑
mented flexibly, and automatic stabilizers should
be allowed to operate fully, as economic conditions
warrant. A few Directors, however, stressed the need
to preserve the credibility of fiscal policy frame‑
works by strictly adhering to fiscal targets.
Directors reiterated that fiscal consolidation
should be combined with accommodative monetary
policies, while respecting the mandate of respective
central banks, and with structural reforms to main‑
tain growth and limit the negative social impact of
deficit reduction. Most Directors supported further

easing of monetary policy to sustain growth, includ‑
ing through unconventional measures if necessary.
In that regard, they underscored the importance
of the recent announcements by the European
Central Bank and the Federal Reserve. A number of
Directors noted, however, that prolonged monetary
easing could introduce economic and financial
distortions, discourage fiscal consolidation, and spur
destabilizing capital flows to other regions, while its
effectiveness may be limited.
Directors called for faster progress with structural
reform. The priorities are to strengthen the finan‑
cial regulatory framework, improve bank balance
sheets and financial health more generally, and
reduce household debt. Many countries also need to
improve their external competitiveness, which will
require reforms to enhance labor and product mar‑
ket flexibility and efficiency. Social safety nets and
reforms to reduce long‑term unemployment should
be strengthened in parallel with fiscal adjustment.
Directors welcomed the steady improvement in
the economic performance of emerging market and
developing economies, which reflected both good
policies and fewer shocks. However, the recent
slowdown of growth calls for determined action

174

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

to mitigate internal and external vulnerabilities,
including the use of macroprudential policies as
needed. Those countries with stable and low infla‑
tion could pause or reverse the monetary policy
tightening of the past year to sustain growth. Those
with relatively strong fiscal and external posi‑
tions could also use their fiscal space prudently for
this purpose. Others would have to continue to
rebuild policy space needed to tackle shocks, with
due regard for social and development needs in
low‑income countries.
Directors agreed that global imbalances and
associated risks have diminished, mainly because of
weaker demand in external‑deficit advanced econo‑
mies. Lasting resolution of these imbalances is in the
self-interest of both deficit and surplus economies.
For surplus economies, this will require structural
reforms to boost investment and consumption, more
market‑determined exchange rates, and discontinua‑
tion of large‑scale official reserve accumulation where
appropriate. A few Directors nevertheless emphasized
the importance of maintaining adequate reserve buf‑
fers against external shocks. Deficit economies will
require stronger fiscal positions, higher saving rates,
and lower consumption demand.

Statistical Appendix

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical
data as well as projections. It comprises
five sections: Assumptions, What’s New,
Data and Conventions, Classification of
Countries, and Statistical Tables.
The assumptions underlying the estimates and
projections for 2012–13 and the medium-term
scenario for 2014–17 are summarized in the first
section. The second section presents a brief description of the changes to the database and statistical
tables since the April 2012 issue of the World Economic Outlook. The third section provides a general
description of the data and the conventions used for
calculating country group composites. The classification of countries in the various groups presented in
the World Economic Outlook is summarized in the
fourth section.
The last, and main, section comprises the statistical tables. (Statistical Appendix A is included here;
Statistical Appendix B is available online.) Data
in these tables have been compiled on the basis of
information available through mid-September 2012.
The figures for 2012 and beyond are shown with
the same degree of precision as the historical figures
solely for convenience; because they are projections,
the same degree of accuracy is not to be inferred.

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced
economies are assumed to remain constant at their
average levels during the period July 30–August 27,
2012. For 2012 and 2013, these assumptions imply
average U.S. dollar/SDR conversion rates of 1.523
and 1.512, U.S. dollar/euro conversion rates of 1.266
and 1.239, and yen/U.S. dollar conversion rates of
79.3 and 79.3, respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average
$106.18 a barrel in 2012 and $105.10 a barrel in
2013.
Established policies of national authorities are
assumed to be maintained. The more specific policy

assumptions underlying the projections for selected
economies are described in Box A1.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that the
London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on sixmonth U.S. dollar deposits will average 0.7 percent
in 2012 and 0.6 percent in 2013, that three-month
euro deposits will average 0.6 percent in 2012 and
0.2 percent in 2013, and that six-month yen deposits
will average 0.4 percent in 2012 and 0.3 percent in
2013.
With respect to introduction of the euro, on
December 31, 1998, the Council of the European
Union decided that, effective January 1, 1999, the
irrevocably fixed conversion rates between the euro
and currencies of the member countries adopting the
euro are as follows:

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: COPING WITH HIGH DEBT AND SLUGGISH GROWTH

What’s New
• For Cyprus, data reflect a passive scenario based on
implementation of approved policies only. It is also
assumed that the government will be able to roll over
its debt and finance its deficit at a reasonable cost
over the medium term and that banks will achieve
adequate capitalization without government assistance.
• Data for South Sudan are now included in the subSaharan Africa aggregates and classified under those
for a country with fuel as the main source of export
earnings. Sudan, which remains in the Middle East
and North Africa region, is now classified as a country
with nonfuel primary products as the main source of
export earnings.
• Data for San Marino are now included in the
advanced economy classification.
• As in the April 2012 World Economic Outlook,
data for Syria are excluded for 2011 and later due
to the uncertain political situation.
• Starting with the October 2012 World Economic
Outlook, the label for the Emerging and Developing Economies group is Emerging Market and
Developing Economies. The member countries
remain unchanged with the exception of South
Sudan as a new member of the group.

Data and Conventions
Data and projections for 186 economies form the
statistical basis of the World Economic Outlook (the
WEO database). The data are maintained jointly by
the IMF’s Research Department and regional departments, with the latter regularly updating country
projections based on consistent global assumptions.
Although national statistical agencies are the
ultimate providers of historical data and definitions,
international organizations are also involved in statistical issues, with the objective of harmonizing methodologies for the compilation of national statistics,
including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions,
classifications, and valuation procedures used in the
production of economic statistics. The WEO database
reflects information from both national source agencies and international organizations.
Most countries’ macroeconomic data presented in the
World Economic Outlook conform broadly to the 1993

176

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

version of the System of National Accounts (SNA). The
IMF’s sector statistical standards—the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth
Edition (BPM6), the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual (MFSM 2000), and the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001)—have been or
are being aligned with the 2008 SNA.1 These standards
reflect the IMF’s special interest in countries’ external
positions, financial sector stability, and public sector fiscal
positions. The process of adapting country data to the
new standards begins in earnest when the manuals are
released. However, full concordance with the manuals is
ultimately dependent on the provision by national statistical compilers of revised country data; hence, the World
Economic Outlook estimates are only partially adapted
to these manuals. Nonetheless, for many countries the
impact of conversion to the updated standards will be
small on major balances and aggregates. Many other
countries have partially adopted the latest standards and
will continue implementation over a period of years.
Consistent with the recommendations of the
1993 SNA, several countries have phased out their
traditional fixed-base-year method of calculating
real macroeconomic variable levels and growth by
switching to a chain-weighted method of computing aggregate growth. The chain-weighted method
frequently updates the weights of price and volume
indicators. It allows countries to measure GDP
growth more accurately by reducing or eliminating
the downward biases in volume series built on index
numbers that average volume components using
weights from a year in the moderately distant past.
Composite data for country groups in the World
Economic Outlook are either sums or weighted averages of data for individual countries. Unless noted
otherwise, multiyear averages of growth rates are
expressed as compound annual rates of change.2
Arithmetically weighted averages are used for all data
1Many other countries are implementing the 2008 SNA and will
release national accounts data based on the new standard in 2014.
A few countries use versions of the SNA older than 1993. A similar
adoption pattern is expected for BPM6. While the conceptual
standards use the BPM6, the WEO is still using the BPM5 presentation until such a time when a representative number of countries
have moved their BOP accounts into the BPM6 framework.
2Averages for real GDP and its components, employment, per
capita GDP, inflation, factor productivity, trade, and commodity prices, are calculated based on the compound annual rate of

Statistical Appendix

for the emerging market and developing economies
group except inflation and money growth, for which
geometric averages are used. The following conventions apply.
• Country group composites for exchange rates,
interest rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates are weighted by GDP converted to U.S.
dollars at market exchange rates (averaged over the
preceding three years) as a share of group GDP.
• Composites for other data relating to the domestic economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are
weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power
parity (PPP) as a share of total world or group
GDP.3
• Composites for data relating to the domestic
economy for the euro area (17 member countries
throughout the entire period unless noted otherwise) are aggregates of national source data using
GDP weights. Annual data are not adjusted for
calendar-day effects. For data prior to 1999, data
aggregations apply 1995 European currency unit
exchange rates.
• Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual
country data after conversion to U.S. dollars at
the average market exchange rates in the years
indicated.
• Composite unemployment rates and employment
growth are weighted by labor force as a share of
group labor force.
• Composites relating to external sector statistics are
sums of individual country data after conversion
to U.S. dollars at the average market exchange
rates in the years indicated for balance of payments data and at end-of-year market exchange
rates for debt denominated in currencies other
than U.S. dollars.
• Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes and prices, however, are arithmetic aver-

ages of percent changes for individual countries
weighted by the U.S. dollar value of exports or
imports as a share of total world or group exports
or imports (in the preceding year).
• Unless noted otherwise, group composites are
computed if 90 percent or more of the share of
group weights is represented.

Classification of Countries
Summary of the Country Classification
The country classification in the World Economic
Outlook divides the world into two major groups:
advanced economies and emerging market and
developing economies.4 This classification is not
based on strict criteria, economic or otherwise, and
it has evolved over time. The objective is to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably meaningful
method of organizing data. Table A provides an
overview of the country classification, showing the
number of countries in each group by region and
summarizing some key indicators of their relative
size (GDP valued by PPP, total exports of goods and
services, and population).
Some countries remain outside the country
classification and therefore are not included in the
analysis. Anguilla, Cuba, the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea, and Montserrat are examples
of countries that are not IMF members, and their
economies therefore are not monitored by the
IMF. The Marshall Islands, the Federated States of
Micronesia, Palau, and Somalia are omitted from the
emerging market and developing economies group
composites because of data limitations.

change, except for the unemployment rate, which is based on the
simple arithmetic average.

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United
Kingdom, and Canada—constitute the subgroup
of major advanced economies often referred to as the
Group of Seven (G7). The members of the euro area
and the newly industrialized Asian economies are also
distinguished as subgroups. Composite data shown
in the tables for the euro area cover the current
members for all years, even though the membership
has increased over time.
Table C lists the member countries of the
European Union, not all of which are classified as
advanced economies in the World Economic Outlook.

Emerging Market and Developing Economies
The group of emerging market and developing
economies (151) includes all those that are not classified as advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging market and
developing economies are central and eastern Europe
(CEE), Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),
developing Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean
(LAC), Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Emerging market and developing economies are
also classified according to analytical criteria. The
analytical criteria reflect the composition of export
earnings and other income from abroad; a distinction
between net creditor and net debtor economies; and,
for the net debtors, financial criteria based on external
financing sources and experience with external debt
servicing. The detailed composition of emerging
market and developing economies in the regional and
analytical groups is shown in Tables D and E.
The analytical criterion by source of export earnings distinguishes between categories: fuel (Standard
International Trade Classification—SITC 3) and

178

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

nonfuel and then focuses on nonfuel primary products
(SITCs 0, 1, 2, 4, and 68). Economies are categorized into one of these groups when their main
source of export earnings exceeds 50 percent of total
exports on average between 2006 and 2010.
The financial criteria focus on net creditor economies, net debtor economies, and heavily indebted poor
countries (HIPCs). Economies are categorized as net
debtors when their current account balance accumulations from 1972 (or earliest data available) to
2010 are negative. Net debtor economies are further
differentiated on the basis of two additional financial
criteria: official external financing and experience with
debt servicing.5 Net debtors are placed in the official
external financing category when 66 percent or more
of their total debt, on average between 2006 and
2010, was financed by official creditors.
The HIPC group comprises the countries that are
or have been considered by the IMF and the World
Bank for participation in their debt initiative known as
the HIPC Initiative, which aims to reduce the external
debt burdens of all the eligible HIPCs to a “sustainable” level in a reasonably short period of time.6 Many
of these countries have already benefited from debt
relief and have graduated from the initiative.

5 During 2006–10, 40 economies incurred external payments
arrears or entered into official or commercial bank debt-rescheduling agreements. This group is referred to as economies with arrears
and/or rescheduling during 2006–10.
6See David Andrews, Anthony R. Boote, Syed S. Rizavi, and
Sukwinder Singh, Debt Relief for Low-Income Countries: The
Enhanced HIPC Initiative, IMF Pamphlet Series No. 51 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, November 1999).

world economic outlook: Coping with High Debt and Sluggish Growth

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions Underlying the Projections for Selected Economies
Fiscal Policy Assumptions
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in
the World Economic Outlook (WEO) are based on
officially announced budgets, adjusted for differences
between the national authorities and the IMF staff
regarding macroeconomic assumptions and projected
fiscal outturns. The medium-term fiscal projections
incorporate policy measures that are judged likely
to be implemented. In cases where the IMF staff
has insufficient information to assess the authorities’
budget intentions and prospects for policy
implementation, an unchanged structural primary
balance is assumed unless indicated otherwise.
Specific assumptions used in some of the advanced
economies follow. (See also Tables B5 to B9 in the
online section of the Statistical Appendix for data
on fiscal net lending/borrowing and structural
balances.1)
Argentina: The 2012 forecasts are based on the
2011 outturn and IMF staff assumptions. For the
outer years, the assumed improvement in fiscal
balance is predicated on an assumed growth of
revenues in the context of a pickup in economic
recovery combined with a decline in the growth of
expenditures.
Australia: Fiscal projections are based on IMF
staff projections and the 2012–13 budget and the
Australian Bureau of Statistics.

1 The output gap is actual minus potential output, as a
percent of potential output. Structural balances are expressed
as a percent of potential output. The structural balance is
the actual net lending/borrowing minus the effects of cyclical output from potential output, corrected for one-time
and other factors, such as asset and commodity prices and
output composition effects. Changes in the structural balance
consequently include effects of temporary fiscal measures, the
impact of fluctuations in interest rates and debt-service costs,
and other noncyclical fluctuations in net lending/borrowing.
The computations of structural balances are based on IMF
staff estimates of potential GDP and revenue and expenditure
elasticities. (See the October 1993 World Economic Outlook,
Annex I.) Net debt is defined as gross debt minus financial
assets of the general government, which include assets held by
the social security insurance system. Estimates of the output
gap and of the structural balance are subject to significant
margins of uncertainty.

184

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

Austria: Projections take the 2013–16 federal
financial framework as well as associated further
implementation needs and risks into account.
Belgium: IMF staff projections for 2012 and
beyond are based on unchanged policies, as some
reform measures remain under discussion.
Brazil: For 2012, the projection is based on the
budget, subsequent updates to plans announced
by the authorities and the fiscal outturn up to July
2012. In this and outer years, the IMF staff assumes
adherence to the announced primary surplus target
and further increases in public investment in line
with the authorities’ intentions.
Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts
in the Economic Action Plan 2012, Jobs, Growth,
and Long-Term Prosperity, March 29, 2012 (the
fiscal year 2012/13 budget). The IMF staff makes
some adjustments to this forecast for differences in
macroeconomic projections. The IMF staff forecast
also incorporates the most recent data releases from
Statistics Canada’s Canadian System of National
Economic Accounts, including federal, provincial,
and territorial budgetary outturns through the end
of the second quarter of 2012.
China: For 2012, the government is assumed
to slow the pace of fiscal consolidation; the fiscal
impulse is assumed to be neutral.
Denmark: Projections for 2012–13 are aligned
with the latest official budget estimates and the
underlying economic projections, adjusted where
appropriate for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic
assumptions. For 2014–17, the projections incorporate key features of the medium-term fiscal plan
as embodied in the authorities’ 2011 Convergence
Program submitted to the European Union.
France: Estimates for the general government
in 2011 reflect the actual outturn. Projections for
2012 and beyond reflect the authorities’ 2011–14
multiyear budget, adjusted for fiscal packages and
differences in assumptions on macro and financial
variables and revenue projections.
Germany: The estimates for 2011 are preliminary estimates from the Federal Statistical Office of
Germany. The IMF staff’s projections for 2012 and
beyond reflect the authorities’ adopted core federal
government budget plan adjusted for the differences

Statistical Appendix

Box A1. (continued)
in the IMF staff’s macroeconomic framework and
staff assumptions about fiscal developments in state
and local governments, the social insurance system,
and special funds. The projections also incorporate
the authorities’ plans for a 2013–14 tax reduction.
The estimate of gross debt includes portfolios of
impaired assets and noncore business transferred
to institutions that are winding up as well as other
financial sector and EU support operations.
Greece: Macroeconomic, monetary, and fiscal
projections for 2012 and the medium term are
consistent with the policies discussed between the
IMF staff and the authorities in the context of the
Extended Fund Facility.
Hong Kong SAR: Projections are based on the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal projections.
Hungary: Fiscal projections include IMF staff projections of the macroeconomic framework and of the
impact of recent legislative measures as well as fiscal
policy plans announced at the end of July 2012.
India: Historical data are based on budgetary execution data. Projections are based on available information on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments
for IMF staff assumptions. Subnational data are
incorporated with a lag of up to two years; general
government data are thus finalized well after central
government data. IMF and Indian presentations differ,
particularly regarding divestment and license auction
proceeds, net versus gross recording of revenues in certain minor categories, and some public sector lending.
Indonesia: The 2011 central government deficit was
lower than expected (1.1 percent of GDP), reflecting
underspending, particularly on public investment.
The central government 2012 deficit is estimated at
2.0 percent of GDP, lower than the revised budget
estimate of 2.2 percent of GDP. It is assumed that
subsidized fuel prices will not be adjusted in 2012.
The low projected budget deficit also reflects ongoing
budget execution problems. Fiscal projections for
2013–17 are built around key policy reforms needed
to support economic growth—namely, enhancing budget implementation to ensure fiscal policy
effectiveness, reducing energy subsidies through
gradual administrative price increases, and continuous revenue mobilization efforts to increase space for
infrastructure development.

Ireland: Fiscal projections are based on the 2012
budget and the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement
(published in November 2011), which commits to a
€12.4 billion consolidation over 2012–15. The fiscal
projections are adjusted for differences between the
macroeconomic projections of the IMF staff and
those of the Irish authorities.
Italy: Fiscal projections incorporate the impact of
the government’s announced fiscal adjustment package, as outlined in its April 2012 Documento di
Economia e Finanza, modified based on the recent
announcement of the government’s spending review.
The estimates for the 2011 outturn are preliminary.
The IMF staff projections are based on the authorities’ estimates of the policy scenario and are adjusted
mainly for differences in macroeconomic assumptions. After 2015, a zero overall fiscal balance in
cyclically adjusted terms is projected, in line with
the authorities’ fiscal rule.
Japan: The projections include fiscal measures
already announced by the government, including
consumption tax increases and earthquake reconstruction spending. The medium-term projections
assume that expenditure and revenue of the general
government are adjusted in line with current underlying demographic and economic trends.
Korea: Fiscal projections assume that fiscal policies
will be implemented in 2012 as announced by the
government. Projections of expenditure for 2012 are
in line with the budget. Revenue projections reflect
the IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions, adjusted
for discretionary revenue-raising measures already
announced by the government. The medium-term
projections assume that the government will continue
with its consolidation plans and balance the budget
(excluding social security funds) by 2013, consistent
with the government’s medium-term goal.
Mexico: Fiscal projections for 2012 are broadly
in line with the approved budget; projections for
2013 onward assume compliance with the balanced
budget rule.
Netherlands: Fiscal projections for the period
2012–17 are based on the authorities’ Bureau
for Economic Policy Analysis budget projections,
after adjusting for differences in macroeconomic
assumptions.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: COPING WITH HIGH DEBT AND SLUGGISH GROWTH

Box A1. (continued)
New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on the
authorities’ 2012 budget and IMF staff estimates.
The New Zealand fiscal accounts switched to New
Zealand International Financial Reporting Standards in Budget 2007/08. Backdated data have been
released back to 1997.
Portugal: Projections reflect the authorities’
commitments under the EU- and IMF-supported
program for 2012–13 and IMF staff projections
thereafter.
Russia: Projections for 2012–14 are based on the
non-oil deficit in percent of GDP implied by the
2012–14 medium-term budget, the 2012 supplemental budget, and the IMF staff’s revenue projections. The IMF staff assumes an unchanged non-oil
federal government balance in percent of GDP
during 2015–17.
Saudi Arabia: The authorities base their budget
on a conservative assumption for oil prices with
adjustments to expenditure allocations considered in
the event that revenues exceed budgeted amounts.
IMF staff projections of oil revenues are based
on WEO baseline oil prices. On the expenditure
side, wages are assumed to rise at a natural rate of
increase in the medium term with adjustments for
recently announced changes in the wage structure.
In 2013 and 2016, 13th-month pay is awarded
based on the lunar calendar. Capital spending is in
line with the priorities established in the authorities’
Ninth Development Plan, and recently announced
capital spending on housing is assumed to start in
2012 and continue over the medium term.
Singapore: For fiscal year 2012/13, projections are
based on budget numbers. For the remainder of the
projection period, the IMF staff assumes unchanged
policies.
South Africa: Fiscal projections are based on the
authorities’ 2012 budget and policy intentions
stated in the Budget Review, published February 22,
2012.
Spain: For 2012 and beyond, fiscal projections
are based on the measures specified in the Stability Program Update 2012–15, the revised fiscal
recommendations by the European Council and
the subsequent July fiscal package, and the bian-

186

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

nual budget plan for 2013–14 announced in August
2012. While the Eurogroup’s commitment of up to
€100 billion (9.4 percent of GDP) includes an additional safety margin, IMF staff, to be prudent and
pending further details on implementation, assumed
disbursement of this full amount for its 2012 debt
projections. Under the unchanged policies scenario,
no additional structural improvement is assumed
for the outer years, after the fiscal deficit reaches 3
percent of GDP.
Sweden: Fiscal projections for 2012 are broadly in
line with the authorities’ projections. The impact of
cyclical developments on the fiscal accounts is calculated using the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s latest semi-elasticity.
Switzerland: Projections for 2011–17 are based on
IMF staff calculations, which incorporate measures to restore balance in the federal accounts and
strengthen social security finances.
Turkey: Fiscal projections assume that current
expenditures will be in line with the authorities’
2012–14 Medium-Term Program but that capital
expenditures will be exceeded given projects initiated in 2011.
United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based on
the authorities’ 2012 budget announced in March
2012 and the Economic and Fiscal Outlook by the
Office for Budget Responsibility published along
with the budget. These projections incorporate
the announced medium-term consolidation plans
from 2012 onward. The authorities’ projections are
adjusted for differences between the IMF staff’s forecasts of macroeconomic and financial variables (such
as GDP growth) and the forecasts of these variables
assumed in the authorities’ fiscal projections. IMF
staff projections also exclude the temporary effects
of financial sector interventions and the effect on
public sector net investment in 2012–13 of transferring assets from the Royal Mail Pension Plan to the
public sector.
United States: Fiscal projections are based on the
March 2012 Congressional Budget Office baseline,
adjusted for the IMF staff’s policy and macroeconomic assumptions. The key near-term policy
assumptions include an extension of all the Bush

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1. (continued)
tax cuts and emergency unemployment benefits
into 2013 and replacement of automatic spending
cuts (“sequestration”) with back-loaded consolidation measures. Over the medium term, the IMF
staff assumes that Congress will continue to make
regular adjustments to the Alternative Minimum
Tax parameters and Medicare payments (“Doc Fix”)
and will extend certain traditional programs (such
as the research and development tax credit). It is
assumed that the Bush tax cuts for the middle class
will be extended permanently, but those for highincome taxpayers will be allowed to expire in 2014
(one year later than planned by the administration).
The fiscal projections are adjusted to reflect the IMF
staff’s forecasts of key macroeconomic and financial
variables and different accounting treatment of the
financial sector support and are converted to the
general government basis.

Monetary Policy Assumptions
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the
established policy framework in each country. In
most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative
stance over the business cycle: official interest rates
will increase when economic indicators suggest
that inflation will rise above its acceptable rate or
range; they will decrease when indicators suggest that prospective inflation will not exceed the
acceptable rate or range, that prospective output
growth is below its potential rate, and that the
margin of slack in the economy is significant. On
this basis, the LIBOR on six-month U.S. dollar deposits is assumed to average 0.7 percent
in 2012 and 0.6 percent in 2013 (see Table 1.1).
The rate on three-month euro deposits is assumed
to average 0.6 percent in 2012 and 0.2 percent in
2013. The interest rate on six-month Japanese yen
deposits is assumed to average 0.4 percent in 2012
and 0.3 percent in 2013.
Australia: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with market expectations.
Brazil: Monetary policy assumptions are based on
current policy and are consistent with the gradual
convergence of inflation toward the middle of the
target range by the end of 2012.

Canada: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with market expectations.
China: Monetary tightening built into the
baseline is consistent with authorities’ forecast of 14
percent year-over-year growth for M2 in 2012.
Denmark: The monetary policy is to maintain the
peg to the euro.
Euro area: Monetary policy assumptions for euro
area member countries are in line with market
expectations.
Hong Kong SAR: The IMF staff assumes that the
Currency Board system remains intact and projects
broad money growth based on the past relationship
with nominal GDP.
India: The policy (interest) rate assumption is
based on the average of market forecasts.
Indonesia: Bank Indonesia is expected to use a
combination of macroprudential measures and
policy rate increases.
Japan: The current monetary policy conditions are
maintained for the projection period, and no further
tightening or loosening is assumed.
Korea: Monetary policy assumptions incorporate
resumption of rate normalization over the course of
2013.
Mexico: Monetary assumptions are consistent with
attaining the inflation target.
Russia: Monetary projections assume unchanged
policies, as indicated in recent statements by the
Central Bank of Russia. Specifically, policy rates are
assumed to remain at the current levels, with limited
interventions in the foreign exchange markets.
Saudi Arabia: Monetary policy projections are
based on the continuation of the exchange rate peg
to the U.S. dollar.
Singapore: Broad money is projected to grow in
line with the projected growth in nominal GDP.
South Africa: Monetary projections are consistent
with South Africa’s 3 to 6 percent inflation target
range.
Sweden: Monetary projections are in line with
Riksbank projections.
Switzerland: Monetary policy variables reflect
historical data from the national authorities and the
market.

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

187

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: COPING WITH HIGH DEBT AND SLUGGISH GROWTH

Box A1. (concluded)
Turkey: Broad money and the long-term bond
yield are based on IMF staff projections. The
short-term deposit rate is projected to evolve with a
constant spread against the interest rate of a similar
U.S. instrument.
United Kingdom: On monetary policy, the projections assume no changes to the policy rate or the
level of asset purchases through 2014.

188

International Monetary Fund | October 2012

United States: Given the outlook for sluggish growth
and inflation, the IMF staff expects the federal funds
target to remain near zero until late 2014. This
assumption is consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee’s statement following its January meeting (and reaffirmed in subsequent meetings) that economic conditions are likely to warrant an exceptionally
low federal funds rate at least through late 2014.

Projections
2013

2017

For many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. Data for some countries are for fiscal years.
Data for some countries refer to real net material product (NMP) or are estimates based on NMP. For many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. The
figures should be interpreted only as indicative of broad orders of magnitude because reliable, comparable data are not generally available. In particular, the growth of output
of new private enterprises of the informal economy is not fully reflected in the recent figures.
3
Georgia and Mongolia, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic
structure.
4
Figures are based on Argentina’s official GDP data. The IMF has called on Argentina to adopt remedial measures to address the quality of these data. The IMF
staff is also using alternative measures of GDP growth for macroeconomic surveillance, including data produced by private analysts, which have shown significantly
lower real GDP growth than the official data since 2008.
5
Data for 2011 exclude South Sudan after July 9. Data for 2012 and onward pertain to the current Sudan.
6
Data for Syria are excluded for 2011 onward due to the uncertain political situation.
7
The percent changes in 2002 are calculated over a period of 18 months, reflecting a change in the fiscal year cycle (from July–June to January–December).
8
The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on IMF staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars. IMF staff estimates of
U.S. dollar values may differ from authorities’ estimates. Real GDP is in constant 2009 prices.

In accordance with standard practice in the World Economic Outlook, movements in consumer prices are indicated as annual averages rather than as
December–December changes during the year, as is the practice in some countries. For many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. Data for some
countries are for fiscal years.
2
December–December changes. Several countries report Q4–Q4 changes.
3
For many countries, inflation for the earlier years is measured on the basis of a retail price index. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation data with broader and more
up-to-date coverage are typically used for more recent years.
4
Georgia and Mongolia, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in
economic structure.
5
Figures are based on Argentina’s official consumer price index (CPI-GBA) data. The IMF has called on Argentina to adopt remedial measures to address the quality of
these data. The IMF staff is also using alternative measures of inflation for macroeconomic surveillance, including data produced by provincial statistical offices and private
analysts, which have shown considerably higher inflation figures than the official data since 2007.
6
Data for 2011 exclude South Sudan after July 9. Data for 2012 and onward pertain to the current Sudan.
7
Data for Syria are excluded for 2011 onward due to the uncertain political situation.
8
The percent changes in 2002 are calculated over a period of 18 months, reflecting a change in the fiscal year cycle (from July–June to January–December).
9
The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on IMF staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars. IMF staff estimates
of U.S. dollar values may differ from authorities' estimates.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries' national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum
of the U.S. dollar values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook, where the
composites were weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. For many countries, the estimates of national savings are built up from
national accounts data on gross domestic investment and from balance-of-payments-based data on net foreign investment. The latter, which is equivalent to the current
account balance, comprises three components: current transfers, net factor income, and the resource balance. The mixing of data sources, which is dictated by availability,
implies that the estimates for national savings that are derived incorporate the statistical discrepancies. Furthermore, errors, omissions, and asymmetries in balance of
payments statistics affect the estimates for net lending; at the global level, net lending, which in theory would be zero, equals the world current account discrepancy. Despite
these statistical shortcomings, flow of funds estimates, such as those presented in these tables, provide a useful framework for analyzing development in savings and
investment, both over time and across regions and countries.

Calculated from the data of individual Euro Area countries.

Georgia and Mongolia, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic
structure.

Stability Report

tearing down Walls: the international
Monetary Fund 1990 –1999

The Global Financial Stability
Report provides expert
and up-to-date analysis of
global capital ﬂows that
play a critical role in world
economic growth and
ﬁnancial stability.

This volume—the ﬁfth in a series
of histories of the International
Monetary Fund—examines
the 1990s, a tumultuous decade
in which the IMF faced diﬃcult
challenges and took on new and
expanded roles. The IMF’s successes
and setbacks in facing these
challenges provide valuable lessons
for an uncertain future.

Fiscal Monitor
The Fiscal Monitor, published twice a year, surveys
and analyzes developments in public
ﬁnance, updates medium-term ﬁscal
projections, and assesses policies to
put public ﬁnances on a sustainable
footing. The Monitor’s projections are
based on the same database used for
the World Economic Outlook.

oil Wealth in central Africa:
policies for inclusive Growth
Despite its vast oil wealth, central
Africa still struggles to sustain strong,
inclusive economic growth. Oil
Wealth in Central Africa lays out the
macroeconomic and growth challenges
facing the region; examines oil wealth
management and its implications
for poverty reduction; and includes four case
studies that exemplify lessons learned.
