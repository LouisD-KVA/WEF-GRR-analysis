Foreword
In 1993 the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) launched its annual “WMO Statement
on the Status of the Global Climate” series, in
the wake of climate awareness generated by
the Second World Climate Conference, which
WMO organized with its scientific partners
in 1990. The report has continued to gain in
popularity and is today a recognized authoritative source of information for the scientific
community, the media and the public at large.
The present WMO Statement on the Status of
the Global Climate in 2010 is the latest member
of this successful sequence.
The year 2010 was especially notable in that
global surface temperatures reached record
values at the same level as in 1998 and 2005,
consistent with the acceleration of the warming experienced over the last 50 years. The
year also signalled the closure of the warmest
decade on record. Over this decade, warming was markedly more pronounced in some
regions, notably so in North Africa and the
Arabian Peninsula, South Asia and the Arctic.
Moreover, large and ex tended climate
extremes were recorded in several parts of
the world, causing significant socio-economic
impacts. In particular, the flooding in Pakistan
and Australia as well as the summer heatwave
in the Russian Federation were among the
most remarkable climate extremes of the year.
Furthermore, 2010 was also special as the year
in which a High-level Taskforce developed
recommendations for the structure, priorities
and governance of a Global Framework for

Climate Services, in response to the unanimous
decision of the World Climate Conference-3,
which WMO convened in 2009 in partnership
with the United Nations system. Through the
development of the Framework, WMO is committed to further improve its climate products,
information and service delivery to serve all
climate-sensitive socioeconomic sectors.
The year 2010 was WMO’s Diamond Jubilee,
since on 23 March 1950 the new Organization
took over the global responsibilities of the
International Meteorological Organization,
established in 1873 as an outcome of the
First International Meteorological Congress
held in Vienna.
I wish to express the appreciation of WMO to
all the Centres and the National Meteorological
and Hydrological Services of its 189 Members
that collaborated with WMO and contributed
to this key publication. As with the previous
editions, I would like to underscore the importance of your feedback. WMO looks forward
to your comments on the WMO Statement on
the Status of the Global Climate in 2010 and
to your welcome suggestions for its further
improvement.

Temperature difference (°C)
from 1961–1990 average

The decade 2001–2010 was also the
warmest on record. Temperatures over
the decade averaged 0.46°C above the
1961–1990 mean, 0.21°C warmer than
the previous record decade 1991–2000.
In turn, 1991–2000 was warmer than
previous decades, consistent with a
long-term warming trend.

The eastern tropical Indian Ocean was also
significantly warmer than average during the
second half of 2010 (negative Indian Ocean
Dipole), in contrast with the previous La Niña
event in 2007/2008 when it was generally
cooler than average. The Arctic Oscillation (AO)
and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) were in a
negative phase for most of the year, exceptionally so in the 2009/2010 northern hemisphere
winter, which on most indicators had the most
strongly negative seasonal AO/NAO on record.
They returned to a strongly negative phase
in late 2010 with December 2010 values only

broke down quickly in the early months of the
year. A rapid transition took place and La Niña
conditions were in place by August. By some
measures the La Niña event in progress at the
end of 2010 is the strongest since at least the
mid-1970s, and among the five strongest of
the last century. The atmospheric response
has been especially strong, with the Southern
Oscillation Index reaching its highest monthly
values since 1973 in September and December,
and its highest six-month mean since 1917.
The El Niño-to-La Niña transition is similar
to that which occurred in 1998, another very
warm year, although in 2010 the El Niño was
weaker, and the La Niña stronger, than was
the case in 1998.

known as the Southern Annular Mode, was in
positive mode for most of the year, reaching
its highest monthly values since 1989 in July
and August.

Regional temperatures
For both the northern hemisphere and Africa,
2010 was the warmest year on record. It was
also the warmest year on record for six subregions: West Africa, the Saharan/Arabian
region, the Mediterranean, South Asia, Central/

phenomenon is referred to by the following name depending on the region:
•

Hurricane: Western North Atlantic, central and eastern
North Pacific, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico;

Africa and the Arabian Peninsula
The year was exceptionally warm in most of
Africa and southern Asia, as far east as the
Indian subcontinent. Temperatures averaged
over Africa were 1.29°C above the long-term
average, breaking the previous record by
0.35°C. Continental monthly anomalies
exceeded +1.5°C in each of the five months
from December 2009 to April 2010, peaking

at +2.12°C in February; the previous largest
monthly anomaly on record was +1.44°C in
April 1998. All twelve months of 2010 were
at least 0.7°C above normal. While temperatures were well above average throughout
Africa, they were especially exceptional in
the northern half of the continent (extending into the Arabian Peninsula), where the
Saharan/Arabian region was 2.22°C above

normal, 0.89°C above the previous record
and the largest annual anomaly ever recorded
for any subregion outside the Arctic. The
Mediterranean region also had its warmest
year on record with Tunisia equalling its previous warmest year.

Most parts of northern and eastern Asia were
warmer than average in 2010, except for parts
of western and central Siberia. Annual temperatures were mostly unexceptional, with a
very hot summer being partially offset by nearaverage conditions early and late in the year.

Recent warming has been especially strong
in Africa. Temperatures for the 2001–2010
decade averaged 0.85°C above normal, 0.49°C
warmer than any previous decade, and the five
hottest years on record for the continent have
all occurred since 2003. East Africa, which
had never had a year as much as 1°C above
normal prior to 2003, has now reached this
threshold in eight successive years.

Summer 2010 was Asia’s hottest on record,
narrowly breaking the previous mark set in
1998. China, Japan and the Russian Federation
all had their hottest summers on record, with
the Russian Far East being especially warm.

Asia and the Pacific
The very warm conditions in Africa and the
Arabian Peninsula extended northwards and
eastwards into aouthern and central Asia as
far east as the Indian subcontinent. India and
Turkey had their hottest years on record, as
did the broader south and south-west/central
Asian regions.
Further south, South-East Asia had its second hottest year on record, behind 1998.
Temperatures in that region were more than
a degree above normal in the first half of the
year but returned closer to average later in the
year as El Niño conditions, strongly associated with high temperatures in the region,
transitioned to a strong La Niña.

Australia, influenced by wet conditions through
much of the year, had its coolest year since
2001, with temperatures below average
through much of the central and eastern interior, although they were well above average
near the tropical coast with some northern
locations having their hottest year on record.
New Zealand had its fifth-warmest year on
record and records were set locally in the
South Island and around Auckland.
Europe
The year saw a wide range of conditions in
Europe. Temperatures were below average in
many parts of northern and western Europe,
where it was widely the coldest year since at
least 1996. Norway had its coldest year since
1985 and the United Kingdom and Ireland
their coldest since 1986, while other countries
with annual mean temperatures below the
long-term average (most of them for the first

time since 1996) included Sweden, Finland,
the Netherlands, Germany, France, Denmark
and Latvia. At the other end of the scale, many
parts of south-eastern Europe had annual
mean temperatures 1–3°C above normal, with
Turkey having its warmest year on record and
Athens its warmest year since at least 1897. It
was also a warm year in the high latitudes of
the North Atlantic, with Svalbard in Norway
2.5°C above normal and Reykjavik 1.6°C above
normal, its second-warmest year on record.
Europe from the Alps northwards was cold
both early and late in the year, with the lack
of the normal winter westerlies (associated
with the extreme negative phase of the North
Atlantic Oscillation) allowing cold continental air to become established as far as the
continent’s western periphery. The most unusual conditions in the 2009/2010 winter were
in the westernmost parts of Europe, where
Ireland and Scotland both experienced their
coldest winter since 1962/1963. Many other
parts of northern and central Europe had their
coldest winter since 1978/1979, 1986/1987 or
1995/1996, although conditions still fell well
short of those experienced in numerous winters in the 1960s and earlier. Many of the same
regions then saw even stronger temperature
anomalies in December.
The summer was unusually hot over most
of Europe and was the hottest on record
averaged over the continent, breaking the

previous record set in 2003 by 0.62°C. The
most extreme conditions were in the western
Russian Federation, but summer temperatures
were above average virtually throughout the
continent. July was especially hot and broke
the previous continental record by nearly a
degree, with temperatures at least 1°C above
normal almost everywhere except the United
Kingdom, Ireland and parts of Bulgaria.
North America and Greenland
It was an exceptionally warm year in northern
North America, especially the Arctic. It was
Canada’s warmest year on record with temperatures averaging 3.0°C above the 1961–1990
mean, with both winter and spring also being
the country’s warmest on record. Annual
anomalies reached +5°C around the north of
Hudson Bay; the annual mean temperature of
−4.3°C at Iqaluit, on Baffin Island, was 2.3°C
above the previous record. It was also the
warmest year on record at most Greenland
stations, except in the north-east, with annual
anomalies of +4.9°C at Ilulissat and +4.0°C
at Nuuk. For the Greenland/Arctic Canada
region as a whole, temperatures were 2.99°C
above normal, 0.75°C above the previous
record. The decade 2001–2010 has also been
extremely warm with decadal temperatures
1.39°C above normal, and 0.92°C warmer than
the next warmest decade.
Further south, temperatures were relatively
close to average through most parts of the

United States, except its northern fringe, and
Central America. The south-eastern United
States was colder than average, due mostly
to abnormally cold conditions in winter, with
Florida experiencing its coldest January–March
on record and then its coldest December. The
United States as a whole had its coldest winter
since 1984/1985, and most southern areas from
Texas eastwards had one of their 10 coldest
winters on record. These cold conditions
were accompanied by unusually extensive
snow cover and very heavy seasonal snowfall
amounts in some eastern cities, including a
record seasonal total in Washington, D.C.
However, most of the country had above
average temperatures in summer, which was
the fourth hottest on record.
South America
Temperatures in South America were mostly
above average in the north of the continent
and close to average in the south. In northern
South America, where 2010 temperatures rank
second behind those of 1998, the first half
of the year was very warm before temperatures returned closer to average levels from
July onwards. In the south, warm conditions
early and late in the year were separated by
a rather cold winter and early spring; the
northern half of Argentina was especially
warm in December.

Heatwaves and cold waves
Exceptional heatwaves were recorded in
several parts of Eurasia during the northern hemisphere summer. The most extreme
heat was centred over the western Russian
Federation, with the peak extending from
early July to mid-August, although temperatures were well above average from May
8

onwards. In Moscow, July mean temperatures
were 7.6°C above normal, making it the city’s
hottest month on record by more than 2°C,
and similar anomalies continued until cooler
conditions developed in the last 10 days of
August. A new record high temperature for
the city of 38.2°C was set on 29 July, and it
reached 30°C or above on 33 consecutive days
(in comparison, there was not one day with
temperatures above 30°C in the summer of
2009). About 11 000 excess deaths during the
summer were attributed to the extreme heat in
Moscow alone. Some parts of central European
Russian Federation had average temperatures
more than 5°C above normal for the summer.
The heat was accompanied by destructive
forest fires, while severe drought, especially
in the Volga region, led to widespread crop
failures. Nearby countries were also affected.
The Russian Federation, Belarus and Finland
all had their highest temperatures on record,
and a number of stations in Serbia set records
for the greatest number of nights above 20°C.
Earlier in the year, there was exceptional
pre-monsoon heat in southern Asia, which
included a temperature of 53.5°C at Mohenjo
Daro on 26 May, a national record for Pakistan
and the highest temperature in Asia since at
least 1942. Extreme heat affected northern
Africa, Turkey and the Arabian Peninsula at
times during the summer, with notable readings including 52.0°C at Jeddah (Saudi Arabia),
50.4°C at Doha, 47.7°C at Taroudant (Morocco)
and 46.7°C at Mut (Turkey).
Much of northern and western Europe experienced abnormal cold both early and late
in 2010. The temperature fell to −57.0°C
at Hoseda-Hard (Russian Federation) on
19 February, the second-lowest temperature
on record in Europe. Outside the Russian
Federation, the 2009/2010 European winter
was more exceptional for the persistence of
cold conditions than individual extreme events;
for example, a number of locations in central
Sweden experienced their longest-ever period
of unbroken temperatures below 0°C.
Extreme cold returned to northern and western
Europe in late November and persisted through
most of December. It was the second-coldest
December in more than 350 years of observations in central England. Mean monthly
temperatures were as much as 10°C below

were more than 5°C below normal over large
parts of northern Europe. Snowfalls badly
disrupted transport on a number of occasions,
as did freezing rain in Moscow in the last week
of December. Castlederg set a record low for
Northern Ireland with −18.7°C on 23 December,
while −23.0°C in Holbæk on 22 December was
Denmark’s lowest temperature since 1987.
The unusual atmospheric circulation that
caused extreme cold in northern Europe also
caused unusual warmth in other areas, notably the Canadian Arctic, Greenland and the
south-easternmost parts of Europe. Some stations in northern Canada had December mean
temperatures as much as 14°C above normal,
while in the Russian Federation, Vladikavkaz
reached 27.1°C on 6 December, surpassing
the record for the highest winter temperature
in the country (set at Sochi in February 2010)
by 3.3°C.

Precipitation

on record, 52 mm above the 1961–1990 average of 1 033 mm. The previous highest years,
1956 and 2000, also coincided with strong La
Niña events.
It was a very wet year over much of East
Asia and Australia. Australia had its secondwettest year on record (52 per cent above
the 1961–1990 average), associated with the
strong La Niña event (there was also a strong
La Niña in the record year of 1974), and rainfall
was also well above average over most of
Indonesia, Japan and south-eastern China.
It was also wet in Pakistan, which had its
fourth-highest monsoon season rainfall on
record, and in western India.
It was also a very wet year in large parts of
central and south-east Europe and adjacent
areas of Asia, with parts of the region experiencing rainfall 50 per cent or more above
normal. Hungary had its wettest year since
1901, while it was the wettest year on record
at a number of locations, including Bursa
(Turkey), Novi Sad (Serbia) and several stations in Moldova. In contrast with many recent
years, it was also wet in most of the Iberian
Peninsula. Portugal had its wettest year of
the past decade (20 per cent above normal),

and December, and numerous Colombian
centres having their wettest year on record.
Other significant regions that were wetter than
average included much of the northern and
western United States, the Canadian Prairies
and south-east Brazil.
There were fewer regions that experienced dry
conditions over the year as a whole, although
some suffered from severe drought for parts
of the year. Regions that had annual rainfall
significantly below average in 2010 included
north-western Europe, most of Argentina and
Chile, many islands in the central and eastern
Pacific, and the south-west corner of Australia.

areas, especially in northern and western
Colombia and northern Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela, with Cartagena receiving 2 485 mm

Floods in many parts of the world
Pakistan experienced the worst flooding
in its history as a result of exceptionally
heavy monsoon rains. The event principally
respons­ible for the floods occurred from 26 to
29 July, when four-day rainfall totals exceeded
300 mm over a large area of northern Pakistan
centred on Peshawar. There were additional
heavy rains further south from 2 to 8 August
that reinforced the flooding. More than 1 500 lives
were lost, and over 20 million people were

displaced as large parts of the country’s agricultural land were inundated. In terms of the
number of people affected, the United Nations
rated the flood as the greatest humanitarian
crisis in recent history. The total monsoon
season rainfall for Pakistan was the fourth
highest on record, and the highest since 1994.
Summer rainfall was also well above average
in western India, and China experienced its
most significant monsoon flooding since 1998,
with south-eastern China and parts of the
north-east most severely affected. The latter
floods also extended to the Korean Peninsula.
A number of these floods led to significant loss
of life, directly as well as through landslides
in China, which left more than 1 700 people
dead or missing in Gansu Province. There
was also significant flooding later in the year
that affected parts of Thailand and Viet Nam
in October. However, monsoon season rainfall averaged over India was only 2 per cent
above normal, and it was well below average
in north-eastern India and Bangladesh, which
had its driest monsoon season since 1994.
There were numerous episodes of flooding
in eastern Australia during the second half
of 2010 as a result of regular heavy rains.
The most severe floods occurred in central
and southern Queensland in the last week
of December, extending into early 2011, with
hundreds of buildings inundated and severe
disruption to agriculture, mining and transport.
Rockhampton, Emerald and Bundaberg were
among the worst-affected centres.
Floods occurred on several occasions during the year in central and south-eastern
Europe. Central Europe had major floods in
May, particularly in eastern Germany, Poland
and Slovakia. Flooding occurred in Romania,
the Ukraine and Moldova in late June, and
in Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic
in August. Major flooding then returned to
south-east Europe in early December after
widespread three-day rainfalls of 100–200 mm
in Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina at
the end of November, with the worst impacts
being downstream in Serbia. Record peaks
occurred on the Drina River.
An active wet summer monsoon season in
the West African Sahel was accompanied by
floods from time to time, with Benin and Niger

the countries most severely affected. In Benin,
this caused the worst flooding on record in
terms of impact, causing severe losses to the
agriculture sector and severe disturbances
to public services, including cutting access
to health centres, although rainfall amounts
themselves were mostly not record-breaking.
Significant flooding also occurred in Kenya
during the early months of 2010.
Repeated heavy rains in Colombia resulted in
persistent flooding, most severe in November
and December, which was described as the
most severe natural disaster in the country’s
history, with over 300 deaths and major damage to agriculture, buildings and infrastructure.
The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and
Panama were also affected, with the Panama
Canal closed due to weather conditions on
8–9 December for the first time in its history.
More localized flash floods caused severe
damage and loss of life in numerous other
locations, including Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
(April), Madeira (February), Arkansas, United
States (June), southern France (June) and
Casablanca, Morocco (November).

Drought in the Amazon and elsewhere
Parts of the Amazon basin were badly affected
by drought during the later part of 2010. An
unusually dry July–September period in northwestern Brazil resulted in sharply reduced
streamflow in many parts of the Amazon catchment, with the Rio Negro, a major Amazon
tributary, falling to its lowest level on record.
Earlier in the year, the eastern Caribbean
islands were badly affected by drought, with
rainfall for the period from October 2009 to
March 2010 widely in the driest 10 per cent
of recorded years. The northernmost parts
of mainland South America – many of which
were to experience severe flooding later in the
year – were also very dry, with large parts of
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela experiencing their driest January–March period in
over 100 years; Colombia and Guyana were
also badly affected.
In Asia, parts of south-western China experienced severe drought through late 2009 and
early 2010. Yunnan and Guizhou provinces
both had their lowest rainfalls on record during
11

the period from September 2009 to midMarch 2010 with totals widely 30 to 80 per
cent below normal. The dry conditions were
also accompanied by above-average temperatures and numerous forest fires. Conditions
there eased with good rains during the summer. Pakistan also experienced drought in the
early months of 2010 before the onset of the
monsoon. Summer rains also eliminated developing drought conditions in parts of western
Europe, where the United Kingdom had its
driest January–June period since 1929. The dry
conditions were especially marked in exposed
coastal regions, which normally receive heavy
precipitation in westerly flow, with western
Norway having its driest winter on record.
Some other parts of southern Asia, including
north-eastern India, Bangladesh, and parts of
Thailand and Viet Nam, were relatively dry
during the main monsoon season, although
Thailand and Viet Nam were then hit by floods
in October. While widespread above-average
rains eased long-term drought in many parts
of Australia, the south-west was a marked
exception, experiencing its driest year on
record in 2010.
Dry conditions developed during the later
months of the year in parts of East Africa,
particularly in equatorial regions of Kenya and
the United Republic of Tanzania, with a number
of locations in the region receiving less than
half their usual rainfall for the September–
December period. This had adverse impacts
on agriculture and water supply in the region.
Dry conditions also developed late in the
year in key grain-growing areas of eastern
China, where October–January rainfall over
a six-province region south of Beijing was the
second-lowest since 1961, and in the River
Plate region of Argentina and Uruguay where
October–December rainfall was more than
50 per cent below normal.

Tropical cyclones
Global tropical cyclone activity in 2010 was
the lowest recorded in the modern satellite era (from 1970 to the present). A total of
67 storms occurred, 34 of which reached hurricane/typhoon intensity (sustained winds of
120 km/h or greater). This total surpassed the
68 observed in 1976 and 1977 as the lowest
12

total of the post-1970 period, and is about
20 per cent below the 1970–2009 mean of 85,
while the number of hurricanes/typhoons
was also well short of the long-term average
of 44. The North Atlantic was the only basin
with above-normal activity.
It was an exceptionally quiet season in both
the Nor th-West and Nor th-East Pacific.
The North-West Pacific’s total of 14 storms
(7 typhoons) was the lowest recorded in the
satellite era, while the North-East Pacific
(8 storms, 3 hurricanes) equalled its previous record low. In both cases the number
of storms was only about half the long-term
average. North Indian (4 storms, 2 cyclones)
and South Indian (11 storms, 5 cyclones)
activity was also well below average, while
the South-West Pacific (11 storms, 5 cyclones)
was close to average.
By contrast, the Atlantic had a very active season, with 19 storms, well above the average of
10, equalling the third-highest total on record.
Of these, 12 reached hurricane intensity, ranking only behind the 2005 season, when there
were 28 storms, including 15 hurricanes. There
were, however, no landfalls on the continental
United States during the year.
The four strongest cyclones during the year
were Edzani (January, South Indian), Ului
(March, South-West Pacific), Celia (June,
Nor th-East Pacific) and Megi (October,
North-West Pacific). All four had maximum sustained 10-minute winds of at least
215 km/h. Particularly notable was Megi,
which was the year’s most intense tropical
cyclone with a minimum central pressure of
885 hPa, making it the strongest anywhere in
the world since 2005 and the strongest in the
North-West Pacific since 1983. It was also the
year’s strongest landfall when it struck the
island of Luzon in the Philippines at near-peak
intensity; casualties were relatively modest
for such an intense cyclone with 19 deaths
reported, although agricultural damage was
severe. The year’s most destructive cyclone,
in terms of wind and storm surge damage,
was Giri, which killed at least 150 people in
Myanmar in October. Numerous other tropical
cyclones contributed to destructive floods with
substantial loss of life, notably Agatha, Alex
and Matthew in Central America, Conson in
the Philippines and Fanapi in southern China.

Extent (millions of square kilometres)

Israel experienced the worst forest fire in
recorded history in early December, with
more than 40 lives lost in a blaze in the
Carmel Mountains near Haifa. This followed
an extremely dry and warm period, with the
August–November period being the driest on
record in the Haifa area, and the warmest on
record for Israel as a whole.

Other extreme weather events during the year
A severe ex tratropical storm (Xynthia )
crossed north-western Europe at the end of
February, with widespread wind and storm
surge damage. More than 60 lives were lost,
mostly as a result of storm surges in western
France, which reached 1.5 m at La Rochelle.
Insured losses in France and Germany
exceeded US$ 4 billion, and there was also
substantial damage in Spain, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria. A
wind gust of 238 km /h was recorded at
Pic du Midi in the French Pyrenees, and
120–140 km/h gusts were common on low
ground in France and Switzerland.

The largest hailstone recorded in the United
States, 20 cm in diameter, came from a storm
at Vivian, South Dakota, on 23 July. There
were also two very damaging hailstorms
in Australia in March, with hailstones up to
10 cm in diameter in Melbourne on 6 March
and 6 cm in Perth on 22 March. Both were
the most significant hailstorms on record in
their respective cities in terms of both hail
size and impact, with damage exceeding
US $ 1 billion in both cities. Canada also
experienced its most damaging hailstorm,
with over US $ 400 million in damage in
Calgary on 12 July.

seasonal minimum in the satellite record after
2007 and 2008, and more than 2 million km2
below the long-term average of 6.74 million km2.
The Canadian sector had its lowest summer
ice extent on record. The largest ice breakup
in the Arctic since 1962 occurred on 5 August
when an ice mass of 251 km2 broke off the
Petermann Glacier in north-west Greenland.
The autumn 2010 freeze-up was also abnormally slow, and the mean December 2010
ice cover (12 million km2) was the lowest on
record, 0.27 million km2 below the previous
record set in 2006. The conditions were particularly exceptional in the Canadian sector,
with Hudson Bay not freezing over totally until
mid-January 2011, more than a month after
the usual date.
The Arctic low ice cover was consistent
with well-above-average temperatures over
most of the Arctic, with numerous stations in
Greenland, as well as the Greenland/Arctic
Canada region as a whole, having their
warmest year on record with annual mean
temperatures 3–5°C above normal.
By contrast, Antarctic sea-ice extent was
generally slightly above average for most of
2010, with the lowest monthly average being
3.16 million km 2 in February, 0.22 million

14

km2 above the long-term average. It fell to
near-average levels by the end of the year.
Temperatures averaged over the Antarctic
region were also slightly above average.

Antarctic ozone
The peak Antarctic ozone hole in 2010, while
larger and more intense than the long-term
average, was less significant than in most
recent years.
The daily maximum ozone hole for 2010 was
22.2 million km2 on 25 September. This is
3.6 million km2 more than the 1979–2000
average but about 8 million km2 less than the
record of almost 30 million km2 set in 2000.
Averaged over the full period of peak ozone
hole extent (7 September–13 October), the
ozone hole in 2010 was the twelfth smallest
since satellite records began in 1979, and
the second-smallest since 1989.
The minimum daily average ozone during 2010
was reached on 1 October with 118.0 Dobson
Units (DU). This is below the 1979–2000 average of 125.4 DU, but ranks as the eleventh
highest value since 1979, and the second highest since 1988. The record low was observed
in 1994 with 73.0 DU.

The use of reanalysis data for monitoring the
state of the climate
Dick Dee and Adrian Simmons, European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
Reanalysis provides a coherent multivariate
reconstruction of the global atmosphere over
an extended period of time, based on information from a wide range of observations. The
reconstructions are created with model-based
data assimilation methods similar to those
employed for numerical weather prediction.
Reanalyses rely on a forecast model to propagate information in space and time, and to
impose physically meaningful constraints on
the estimates produced. In this way it is possible, for example, to extract useful information
about rainfall from satellite observations of
temperature and humidity, or to infer largescale features of the global circulation in the
early twentieth century from surface pressure
observations available at the time.
Since first produced in the 1980s, reanalysis
data have been widely used for research in the
atmospheric sciences. Reanalysis is a rapidly
evolving field; successive generations of products have improved in quality and diversity,
reflecting major advances in modelling and
data assimilation achieved in recent decades.
New reanalysis products additionally benefit
from improvements in the observations and
other required input datasets, such as specifications of sea surface temperature and sea-ice
concentration. These are the result of ongoing
efforts in data reprocessing and recalibration
by satellite agencies and other data providers,
as well as recovery and digitization of early
instrumental data that have not previously been
used. The value and appeal of reanalyses arises
from the accumulation of these benefits and
their expression in a comprehensive dataset
conveniently provided on global grids.
Evaluation of the quality of reanalysis products is often provided by users, based on

many different measures depending on the
application. Producers of reanalyses closely
monitor the quality of fit to observations used,
the ability of the assimilating model to predict
those observations, and the adjustments
made to the predictions by the data assimilation procedure. These so-called analysis
increments represent the net impact of the
observations on the reanalysed atmospheric
fields. Systematic increments may be due to
residual biases in observations, in the forecast
model, or both. They can introduce artificial
sources and sinks of heat, energy and water
in the reanalysis, and hence affect the global
budgets for these quantities. Changes in the
mean increments, for example, associated
with changes in the observing system, can
affect trend estimates for basic climate variables derived from reanalysis data.
Several centres now routinely extend their
latest reanalyses close to real time and provide
product updates to users at a short delay.
Timely, comprehensive estimates of global
climate variables, consistently produced with
an unchanged data assimilation system, can be
very useful for climate monitoring. It is clearly
necessary, however, to evaluate uncertainties
before presenting assessments of year-toyear changes in climate based on reanalysis
data. The accuracy of estimated trends and
variability for any given variable depends on
the strength of the observational constraint,
on the variation of this constraint in time and
space and, ultimately, on the uncertainties in
the models and observations used. Where
possible, estimates from reanalysis data must
be compared with independent estimates
based on observations alone. This is especially
important for variables (such as precipitation)
that are only indirectly constrained by the
assimilated observations, and hence depend
crucially on the quality of the assimilating
forecast model.
