Annual Economic Report 2020: Editorial

A global sudden stop
The past year has felt like an eternity. It is probably too early to tell, but future
economic historians might consider the Covid-19 pandemic a defining moment of
the 21st century. When, just over a decade ago, the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) hit
the global economy, it was rightly considered such a moment. The pandemic’s
legacy could be even deeper and longer-lasting.
The economic impact of the coronavirus has been variously described as
suspended animation, a hibernation or an induced coma for much of the global
economy. These metaphors bring to mind two key features.
First, this sudden stop has been extraordinarily abrupt. Economic activity has
collapsed even more steeply than in the Great Depression, to even greater depths
than those of the GFC. Many economies shrank by an annualised 25–40% in a
single quarter, and some saw unemployment rates soar into the teens within a
couple of months. Moreover, and unlike the GFC, the crisis has been truly global,
sparing no country in the world. The collapse has elicited a monetary, a fiscal and,
for the first time, a prudential response that exceeds in scale and scope the one to
contain the GFC. And, again, central banks have acted as the first line of defence,
pulling out all the stops in order to stabilise financial markets and the financial
system more generally and to preserve the flow of credit to firms and households.
Second – and this is what makes the crisis so unique – it is a policy-induced
recession generated by repressing economic activity. It results from efforts to tackle
a health emergency and to save lives through containment measures and social
distancing – previously obscure terms that have thrust their way into our day-today vocabulary. This unprecedented configuration greatly heightens uncertainty
about the economy’s future evolution.
But, before turning to policy in detail, how has the economic crisis unfolded so
far? In particular, what role have financial factors played?

A real crisis turns financial
The current economic crisis differs starkly from the GFC and previous financial
crises. On this occasion, it was not the financial sector that toppled the real
economy, but rather the real economy that has threatened to topple the financial
sector, with potentially devastating knock-on effects as financial sector problems
spill back onto the real economy. Non-financial firms were the first to take a hit,
absorbing the full brunt of the blow as activity came to a halt.
The real economy has sustained immense damage. Locking people down has
crippled the supply side. It is impossible to produce goods and many services
remotely, without a physical presence at the workplace. Technology facilitates
working from home, but factories still need workers. Moreover, the impact has been
even greater on the demand side. Consumption shrivels when people stay at home
all day. Online shopping helps, but the range of goods one might want to buy is
limited and that of feasible services minimal. Tourism cannot take place without
travel. The widespread loss of jobs and reduced income naturally depress spending.

In addition, investment has taken a hit from heightened uncertainly and supply
disruptions, including those to global supply chains. It is as if, from one day to the
next, once affluent societies dropped to the subsistence level.
Of course, the lockdowns did not affect all countries and sectors to the same
extent.
The timing and stringency of the measures differ. At one end of the spectrum,
China was the first to implement tough containment measures. At the other end, as
the virus spread around the world, countries such as Sweden and, more hesitantly,
the United States took a milder approach, at least initially. That said, the high
degree of openness of economies nowadays has reduced, through trade, any local
differences in the impact of the lockdowns – a reminder of how integrated the
global economy has become.
The structure of production differs. For instance, as demand in China and
worldwide ground to a halt, commodity exporters suffered the most. Oil producers
were hit hardest, as the collapse of demand coincided with that of the oil cartel,
leading to an unprecedented oil glut. Despite a renewed, albeit fragile, agreement
among suppliers, by mid-April the oil price measured in nominal terms had reached
its lowest level since 1986; in inflation-adjusted terms, it had fallen by around half.
Indeed, at one point, the imbalance between supply and demand was so large that
the price of WTI futures for near-term delivery turned negative. Countries
specialising in sectors such as tourism saw larger drops in output. And so did
countries at the heart of global supply chains.
Finally, countries also differ in terms of their exposure to financial factors and
structural weaknesses. In this respect, emerging market economies (EMEs) stand to
lose more. They have already faced huge pressure, with more no doubt to come.
EMEs have experienced a triple sudden stop: in domestic economic activity, in
capital flows and, for many, in commodity exports and remittances. Above all, they
have faced this storm with much more limited fiscal space than most of their
advanced economy peers. For many of them, poorer health systems and large
informal sectors have further complicated the policy trade-offs.
Regardless of financial conditions, the shock would have been enormous. But,
while not at the origin of the shock, the financial sector has played an important
dual role. It has acted as a key transmission channel for the shock back onto the
real economy, although central banks have been quick to neutralise this impact
(see below). And, less appreciated, it has also helped shape initial conditions,
heightening the economy’s sensitivity to the shock. Consider each aspect in turn.
Given their forward-looking nature, global financial markets reacted faster than
the real economy. True, when problems appeared to be confined to East Asia,
markets hardly moved: in fact, by end-January, equity prices had reached a
historical peak. But when news about the surprisingly rapid spread of the virus in
Europe hit the wires in late February, equity markets buckled, volatilities spiked and
bond yields bottomed. While, at the outset, markets functioned rather well, they
continued to dance to the tune of the virus and became increasingly disorderly.
Spreads soared on corporate and EME debt securities, which had largely been
spared in the first phase. In March, a flight to safety turned into a scramble for cash,
in which even gold and US Treasury securities were dumped to meet margin calls. It
was precisely at this point that markets threatened to freeze entirely. While the
US dollar markets, both on- and offshore, stood at the epicentre, other markets too
were roiled to varying degrees.
Just like a virus, the crisis has been evolving. In some respects, the success of
central banks in calming markets and shoring up confidence has even helped spark
some market exuberance: at the time of writing, equity prices and corporate
spreads in particular seem to have decoupled from the weaker real economy. Even

x

so, underlying financial fragilities remain: this feels more like a truce than a peace
settlement. And more fundamentally, what first appeared to be a liquidity problem,
more amenable to central bank remedies, is morphing into a threat to solvency. A
wave of downgrades has started, alongside concerns that losses might cause
widespread defaults.
Equally important has been the role of financial factors in shaping initial
conditions. After slowly building up, partly on the back of unusually low and
persistent interest rates post-GFC, financial vulnerabilities have exacerbated the
impact of the shock on economic activity – and may continue to do so as the crisis
unfolds. These vulnerabilities can be summed up as overstretched financial markets
and high non-bank leverage.
First, aggressive risk-taking prevailed in financial markets before the pandemic.
Valuations were frothy. Credit risk showed clear signs of underpricing in both
advanced and emerging market economies. For instance, credit spreads were on
the narrow side in the United States and even more so in the euro area. Moreover,
as is typical in such cases, market liquidity was fragile. This was reflected in the
popularity of illiquid investments financed through short-term funding, investment
funds and other such vehicles; or in widespread relative value “arbitrage” trades by
hedge funds that ended up causing turmoil in the US Treasuries market.
Second, and closely related, non-bank leverage was high. Corporate debt was
elevated in many advanced and emerging market economies. Examples are
leveraged loans, collateralised loan obligations and, much underappreciated, private
credit – a form of financing for smaller and typically riskier firms that is a locus for
highly illiquid investments, almost as large as the leveraged loan market and just as
overstretched. Corporate debt levels burgeoned while credit quality deteriorated, as
reflected in the rising share of debt rated BBB, just one notch above non-investment
grade (“junk”). Household debt was high in several countries less affected by the
GFC, typically “small” open advanced economies such as Canada, Australia and the
Nordics as well as a number of EMEs, including Korea. Moreover, sovereign debt
loomed large in several advanced economies and, above all, in EMEs, partly as a
result of the policy response to the GFC. Finally, there was a strong increase in
offshore US dollar borrowing, both on- and off-balance sheet, notably via FX swaps.
So far, these vulnerabilities have manifested themselves in various ways. These
include the outsize initial market reaction to the first concerns about the virus; the
liquidity squeeze on firms and the broad swathe of rating downgrades; the
aggravated tensions in US dollar funding markets; and the sudden stop in capital
flows to EMEs. But should the crisis not let up, we could see broader strains
emerging among households and sovereigns too. Indeed, rating agencies have
already started to downgrade some sovereigns or put them on a negative outlook.
A silver lining in this sobering picture is the state of the banking system. In
contrast to the GFC, the pandemic found banks much better capitalised and more
liquid, thanks largely to the post-crisis financial reforms coupled with a more subdued
expansion. Indeed, as discussed further below, policymakers have looked at banks as
part of the solution rather than as part of the problem. Huge drawdowns on credit
lines have stretched banks’ balance sheets, but not by enough to force them into
sharply cutting other lending. Banks have so far absorbed shocks rather than amplified
them. In fact, the strains have shown most in the non-bank financial sector, which has
grown in leaps and bounds post-GFC and was at the centre of the financial storm.
Nevertheless, banks face challenges. This real-life stress test is more severe
than the scenarios supervisors adopted in their pre-crisis solvency exercises. One
challenge is chronically weak profitability in a number of banking systems, most
notably in the euro area and Japan. Profits are important: they form the first line of
defence against losses and determine how fast banks can bounce back when they

struggle to obtain external equity and find themselves under pressure to keep
paying out dividends, especially where price-to-book ratios languish below one.
Both markets and rating agencies have taken notice: bank share prices have
underperformed overall indices, credit spreads have widened and rating agencies
have put banks on negative watch.

The policy response so far
What have policymakers done so far? The simple answer is that they have gone “all
in” to cushion the blow. The response has generally been swifter, bigger and
broader-based than it was for the GFC. The authorities have deployed monetary,
prudential and fiscal policies in a concerted way that probably has no historical
precedent. Consider each of the policies in turn.

Monetary policy
Central banks once again reacted swiftly and forcefully to stabilise the financial
system and support credit flows to firms and households. The initial interest rate cuts,
while called for, were limited in their soothing effect. The impact was much larger
once central banks started to act in their time-honoured role of lenders of last resort,
supplying badly needed liquidity and addressing dysfunctional markets. By stabilising
the financial system and restoring confidence, these measures also prevented the
transmission of monetary impulses to the economy from breaking down.
In so doing, central banks tailored their measures to the specific characteristics
of both the shock and the financial system.
The size of the shock called for a response on an unprecedented scale. And
because no country was spared, the response was truly global.
The nature of the shock required central banks to push harder than in the past.
While some central banks could simply extend previously applied measures, others
broke new ground. In addition to purchasing government debt on a massive scale,
many central banks also bought private sector securities or relaxed their criteria for
collateral, venturing further down the creditworthiness scale than ever before.
Some extended support to local authorities or bought equities. Outright purchases
went hand in hand with backup facilities for bank lending or for commercial paper
programmes. Importantly, the funding support reached all the way to small and
medium-sized enterprises. In the process, some central banks crossed former “red
lines”, resorting to measures that would once have been seen as off-limits.
The rapid growth of market finance since the GFC meant that central banks
once again broadened their historical role of lenders of last resort to that of buyers
or dealers of last resort. Hence the greater incidence of outright purchases of
securities, or commitments to do so, sometimes even open-ended ones. Indirectly,
this relieved the pressure on banks, given their symbiotic relationship with markets,
not just as dealers but also as suppliers of backup credit facilities. For instance, the
Federal Reserve’s purchase of US Treasuries helped clear dealers’ crowded
inventories, and its backup facility for commercial paper helped ease the pressure
on bank credit lines. Furthermore, a larger number of central banks, in EMEs too,
moved to stabilise a dangerous run on money market mutual funds.
The dominance of the US dollar in global finance again required the Federal
Reserve to act as the international lender of last resort. Indeed, the Fed granted
foreign currency swap lines to as many as 14 central banks, from both advanced
and emerging market economies, reactivating many lines that had expired since
the GFC. Moreover, it put in place a repo facility, open to all central banks, so that

xii

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

they could use their Treasury securities to obtain dollar funding off-market. The
huge scale of the Fed’s actions, when contrasted with the much smaller firepower
of international organisations such as the IMF, points to an unresolved vulnerability
in the international monetary and financial system.
In addition, the crisis has shown that the development of domestic currency
bond markets in EMEs – a priority ever since the Asian crisis of the 1990s – does not
fully overcome the external constraints typically associated with foreign currency
borrowing. In fact, it has largely shifted currency mismatches from borrowers to
lenders, typically foreign investors. The outsize reaction of investors to losses on
their domestic currency positions and exchange rate exposures elicited a forceful
central bank response. As foreign investors unwound their carry trades, several EME
central banks not only intervened in the FX market but also acted as buyers of last
resort in their domestic currency markets, very much like their advanced economy
peers. In addition, the much improved policy frameworks of EMEs allowed many to
cut, rather than raise, policy rates in response to the output drop, as inflation
expectations remained stable.

Prudential policy
In a remarkable development, prudential policy has played a key role in helping
sustain credit to the economy and preventing banks from deleveraging. This is yet
another illustration of the ground gained since the GFC by the macroprudential or
systemic-oriented perspective on regulation and supervision. The banks would not
have been able to support lending without the major international efforts to
strengthen their balance sheets.
The authorities – many of which are central banks – adopted a wide array of
measures. In particular, they encouraged banks to make free use of the buffers they
had accumulated after the GFC. They released, where previously activated, the
countercyclical capital buffer; they temporarily eased other capital and liquidity
requirements; and they allowed a more flexible interpretation of the newly
implemented expected loan provisioning standards or extended the corresponding
transitional arrangements. Many also introduced restrictions on distributions,
notably dividends, to further bolster banks’ lending capacity.

Fiscal policy
The bulk of the response has rightly consisted of fiscal measures. Some, especially
at the outset, were aimed at shoring up liquidity by, for example, postponing taxes
or allowing debt moratoriums. But the vast majority transferred real resources to
households and firms, either outright or conditionally.
Conditional transfers have taken the form mainly of credit guarantees, which
are activated only in the event of default. Their key role has been to back up risktaking so as to keep credit flowing. In some cases, the beneficiaries have been
banks: it is one thing to have the resources to lend, quite another to deploy them
without a clear incentive to do so when prospects are deteriorating and uncertainty
looms large. In other cases, the recipient has been the central bank itself. Governments
have provided full or partial indemnities to insulate central banks from losses,
sometimes by taking equity stakes in special purpose vehicles funded by central
banks. In a similar vein, some beneficiaries have been the creditors of non-financial
firms, such as in rescue operations for airlines or other large businesses.
Outright transfers have focused on jobs, the unemployed and households
more generally. Furlough schemes have been quite popular, taking over a certain
share of the wage bill to keep people employed. Given the prevalence of safety

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

xiii

nets, many jurisdictions have also chosen to strengthen their unemployment
insurance schemes; the need for discretionary measures in this area has naturally
depended on the size of automatic stabilisers. Some governments have also made
direct cash transfers to households. But many EMEs have faced serious challenges
in reaching beneficiaries working in the large informal sector.
Institutional factors aside, the initial room for manoeuvre has strongly
influenced the size and shape of fiscal packages. They have tended to be smaller in
countries with less fiscal headroom. Here again, EMEs have generally been at a
disadvantage.

Looking ahead
What are the policy challenges ahead? How do they depend on the evolution of
the crisis?
To help frame the issues, it is useful to consider the phases that tend to
characterise economic crises with strong financial elements, like the current one.
There are three possible phases: illiquidity, insolvency and recovery. Importantly,
the dividing line between phases is fuzzy and they overlap. In the economy at large,
just as it is possible to see insolvencies when illiquidity is still widespread, so
insolvencies may well occur as the economy recovers. And since, in the current
crisis, the shock has initially hurt the business sector, it is there that the risk of
insolvencies is greatest. Relatedly, unless banks run into trouble, it is easier to
imagine a recovery even in the presence of bankruptcies. The general configuration
and timing of the phases will naturally also depend on the initial financial
vulnerabilities, notably the high debt levels, on the evolution of the pandemic and
hence on the need for containment measures.
The immediate objectives of policy vary with the phase. When illiquidity is
widespread, the objective in a standard financial sector-induced crisis is to stabilise
the financial system, to ensure that intermediaries continue to function and to
support the economy. In the current crisis, which started in the non-financial sector,
the authorities may need to fund households and firms directly, especially if the
financial sector is overburdened. If and when insolvencies emerge, policy has two
aims. First, to restructure balance sheets – the size as well as the debt and equity
mix – so as to deal with a debt overhang. Second, to promote the underlying real
adjustment, by reducing excess capacity and helping shift resources from less viable
sectors and firms to the more promising ones. If these measures succeed, they can
pave the way for a healthy recovery. In that phase, the aim is to support the
economy so that it can grow sustainably.
The role of monetary, prudential and fiscal policy differs according to the
problem addressed. Monetary policy is critical in addressing illiquidity but is badly
suited to dealing with insolvency: central banks lend but cannot spend. The
comparative advantage of fiscal policy is to address insolvency, by temporarily
transferring real resources to prevent it and by supporting balance sheet
restructuring, as needed, once it occurs. Prudential policy’s role falls somewhere in
between: its primary function is to ensure that banks remain solvent and functional
but, subject to that overriding objective, it can also help sustain lending. All three
policies, in their own way, can support the recovery. The special feature of this crisis
is that standard macroeconomic stimulus can have relatively little impact during
the illiquidity and insolvency phases because of the containment measures and the
shock to supply.
The current crisis is evolving rapidly. It is generally on its way out of the
illiquidity phase: now the risk of insolvencies is looming while the timing of the

xiv

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

recovery is uncertain. And so is the shape of the possible recovery. It could be
relatively swift if the containment measures are relaxed quickly and successfully,
and if only limited sectoral adjustments are needed. It could falter, or stutter, if
renewed lockdowns are implemented to deal with new waves of infection. It will be
weaker if the shock is prolonged, scarring both corporate productivity and the
consumer psyche, thus weighing on both demand and supply for a long time. In a
slow or faltering recovery, debt overhangs could act as a major drag unless they are
promptly dealt with. As time passes, it is likely that the authorities will be able to
better calibrate their containment measures, thereby improving the near-term
trade-off between saving lives and supporting the economy. Even so, policy choices
are greatly complicated by the non-economic nature of the underlying forces,
which are both unfamiliar and impervious to economic remedies.
The impact of uncertainty on policy is already clear. Two effects stand out: on
the policies designed to help reallocate resources, and on the utilisation of policy
buffers.
The post-crisis pattern of demand could be quite different from the pre-crisis
one, with significant implications for resource reallocation. Some of the hardest-hit
sectors and firms may have no viable future; others could thrive. Heightened
uncertainty makes it harder to distinguish between insolvent but viable firms, which
require restructuring, and insolvent, unviable ones, which should be liquidated.
Complicating matters further are the initial vulnerabilities in the non-financial
sector and the size of the shock. In the fog of battle, unviable firms may ask for
protection and get it. Meanwhile, bankruptcy proceedings and the other
mechanisms usually used for reallocating resources may prove ill-suited to dealing
with large-scale problems. Governments could play a useful but delicate role. This
could range from setting some broad directions for restructuring to introducing
some abbreviated, less granular, processes, or possibly taking equity stakes in firms.
Of course, this would raise governance issues of its own. The worst outcome would
be failing to address the debt overhang altogether and allowing a persistent
misallocation of capital, which, aggravated by low-for-long interest rates, would sap
aggregate productivity.
Uncertainty as to how the pandemic will evolve raises especially tricky
challenges for the use of policy buffers. After all, the buffers are limited in size. At
some point, if credit quality continues to deteriorate, banks will need to replenish
their buffers, not draw them down further. At some point, central banks may face
the unpalatable choice of nudging even deeper into negative interest rates, and
increasing their already outsize ownership of financial assets in the economy. And
at some point, fiscal policy will need to change tack in order to prevent fiscal
positions from becoming unsustainable. For some countries, the limits of
sustainability are already in sight, particularly but not only for EMEs. All this puts a
premium on taking a measured and targeted approach – just as with the policies
designed to contain the pandemic. This would also make it easier to exit policies
when needed – an absolute must. All this is a further reminder that precautionary
cushions in all policies, far from being a luxury, are absolutely essential, regardless
of how unlikely any adverse outcomes may appear. On this occasion, the exogenous
shock started out in the form of a pandemic – which was very much on the radar
screen of epidemiologists, albeit far less expected by others. Future shocks could
come from climate change or less foreseeable hazards.
As the future unfolds, monetary policy will face serious challenges. This is so
whether it is disinflationary or inflationary pressures that come to the fore. In either
case, exit difficulties combined with limited policy space are likely to play a role.
While the future course of inflation is uncertain, disinflationary pressures are
likely to prevail for some time. To be sure, the pandemic shock has tended to reduce

xv

productivity. Unable to accommodate the usual number of customers because of
social distancing rules, airlines, restaurants and hotels will face cost pressures.
Global value chains are likely to sustain long-lasting damage, which may be partly
irreversible. Even so, precautionary saving and the limited pricing power of firms
and labour will probably persist, limiting any second-round effects. Indeed, the
experience with previous pandemics is consistent with this picture. This scenario
would rather closely resemble the pre-pandemic shape of things. It is a world in
which central banks test the limits of their expansionary policies and struggle to
push inflation up.
But as we peer further into the future, a quite different picture could emerge.
In this case, we would be speaking not of inflation evolving within the current
policy regime, but of a more fundamental change. Here the economic landscape
would, in some respects, look like the one that materialised immediately after the
Second World War. This scenario could come into being if a lengthy pandemic were
to leave a much larger imprint on the economy and the political sphere. In this
world, public sector debt would be much higher and the public sector’s grip on the
economy much greater, while globalisation would be forced into a major retreat. As
a result, labour and firms would gain much more pricing power. And governments
could be tempted to keep financing costs artificially low, allowing the inflation tax
to reduce the real value of their debt, possibly supported by forms of financial
repression. At that point, it would be critical that central banks should be able to
operate independently to pursue their mandate in order to resist any possible
pressures not to increase interest rates.
So far, the objectives of central banks and governments have coincided.
Cooperation has come naturally. Central banks have not deviated from the pursuit
of price and financial stability. But should inflationary pressures emerge at some
point, tensions could arise. Then, the main institutional safeguard against such
pressure would be central bank independence – a safeguard that raises the bar for
successful government intervention. In this context, growing calls for “monetary
financing”, regardless of their motivation, raise the risk of inching economies down
that path. If taken far enough, this process could over time dent confidence in a
country’s monetary institutions, exacting a high price in the pursuit of ephemeral
short-run output gains. After all, the hard-won anti-inflation credibility of central
banks has been instrumental during the recent crisis in allowing them to cross a
number of previous “red lines” to stabilise the financial system and the economy.
This analysis underlines once more the importance of striving to raise growth
sustainably, while maintaining price and financial stability. The policy mix has been
discussed in more detail in previous Annual Economic Reports. Today, more than
ever, a premium needs to be put on keeping fiscal policy on a sustainable path
through timely consolidation. The limits of monetary policy need to be recognised,
as well as the importance of preserving and extending the post-GFC gains in
strengthening the financial system’s resilience. Finally, renewed efforts are needed to
implement the necessary structural economic reforms, a path that has proved quite
elusive both before and after the GFC. This calls, above all, for taking a longer-term
view than hitherto. It means avoiding shortcuts and not being tempted by policies
that, while beneficial in the short term, may raise significant costs in the long term.
After all, however distant it may appear, the future eventually becomes today.

Central banks and payments in the digital era
That banks were in better shape than during the GFC was not the only silver lining
in this crisis. Less appreciated perhaps, but no less important, financial market

xvi

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

infrastructures and payment systems withstood the shock remarkably well. They
rode out episodes of market dysfunction and provided critical support for the
smooth functioning of the financial system.
This puts the spotlight on a central bank function often taken for granted. This
function does not make headlines as the central bank’s role in crisis management
or macroeconomic stabilisation does. Nevertheless, it is essential for any economy:
serving as the foundation of payment and settlement systems.
At their heart, payment systems are a partnership between the private sector
and central banks. The private sector plays the more visible role. It provides most of
the payment instruments used by the public and it spearheads innovation, applying
its ingenuity and creativity to serve customers better. The central bank supplies only
one visible, if invaluable, means of payment to the public (cash), but it supplies the
ultimate medium in which banks settle claims against each other (bank reserves).
Moreover, and more fundamentally, the central bank ensures trust in the value of
money and the payment system more generally – a core public good. And it is a
discrete actor that, typically behind the scenes, promotes the efficiency of payments
by encouraging competition and innovation.
This role has become more important than ever at a time when technology is
transforming payments. New payment methods and consumer interfaces, including
web- and mobile-phone-based payments, are flourishing. The Covid-19 crisis has
accelerated the trend towards contactless payments. Large non-bank providers,
such as big tech firms, have started to enter payment services, both improving
them but also threatening to become monopolies themselves. There is little doubt
that the digital revolution has helped reduce costs, improve convenience and
broaden access to payments. That said, there is still considerable room for
improvement, both for domestic and, above all, for cross-border payments. And
many of these improvements will not just arise spontaneously; they require wise
interventions that steer powerful private sector forces towards the public interest.
In this context, central banks play a key triple role as catalysts, operators and
overseers. While most of the building blocks and policy imperatives for these roles
have not changed, the new developments have changed their relative significance.
In their role as operators and catalysts, central banks play a key part in fostering
interoperability. This can help level the playing field, fostering competition and
innovation. As operators, they can also pursue similar goals by directly providing
public infrastructure, as in an increasing number of fast retail payment systems in
recent years. In their role as overseers, central banks can safeguard the payment
system’s soundness and integrity, as well as boost its efficiency by directly altering
private sector incentives and influencing market structure, not least by helping to
shape laws and regulations that tackle anti-competitive practices.
Central banks can and should stand at the cutting edge of innovation
themselves, not least when directly providing services to the public. Central bank
digital currencies (CBDCs) are a prime example. CBDCs could represent a new, safe,
trusted and widely accessible means of payment. They could also spur continued
innovation in payments, finance and commerce. For CBDCs to fulfil their potential
and promise as a new means of payment, their design and implications deserve
close consideration, especially as they could have far-reaching consequences for
the structure of financial intermediation and the central bank’s footprint in the
system.
Technology opens up exciting future opportunities for payment systems. It is
up to central banks to harness those forces for the common good.

I. A global sudden stop

Key takeaways
•

This is not a normal recession but a sudden stop in order to prevent a public health disaster. The
policy response therefore had to be different too. Monetary and fiscal policies cushioned the blow
mainly by providing financial assistance to companies and workers. The purpose is to limit social
distress and avert unnecessary bankruptcies that could hold back the recovery.

•

Financial amplification threatened to turn a deep but hopefully short-lived contraction into a
calamity as investors ran for safety. A massive and unprecedented response by central banks and
other authorities prevented a financial collapse from compounding the drop in output.

•

Emerging market economies faced a perfect storm. In addition to the health toll, they had to deal
with the losses in activity from domestic containment measures, plummeting foreign demand,
collapsing commodity prices and a sudden stop in capital flows.

•

The strength of the recovery will depend on how the outbreak evolves and how much economic
damage it leaves in its wake. Debt restructuring will be required as resources shift from shrinking to
growing sectors.

The Covid-19 pandemic is the most devastating shock to hit the global economy
since the Second World War (Graph I.1). Policies to contain the virus have deeply
undercut economic activity. The recession’s unique character poses unfamiliar
policy challenges. On the demand side, lockdowns and social distancing measures
have not only triggered a sudden stop in spending but have also made it highly
insensitive to policy stimulus. On the supply side, containment measures have
directly hindered production, with the repercussions spreading through local and
global supply chains. The overall damage could leave permanent scars if persistent
unemployment and bankruptcies follow.
Financial markets were profoundly shaken by the pandemic. Heavy sell-offs
across a wide range of assets and an abrupt tightening of financial conditions
threatened to derail the economy further. Key funding markets seized up as market
participants became unwilling or unable to take on risk. Financial amplification and
disorderly global market dynamics returned with a vengeance, as in 2007–09. It
took a global swift and broad-based central bank response on an unprecedented
scale to stabilise the situation.
There is no parallel for this cocktail of economic forces. The economic damage
is much greater than in previous epidemics. Except for the “Spanish flu” of 1918–19,
these were locally confined, and even then containment measures were nowhere as
comprehensive as the current ones. Past financial crises, disruptive as they were,
yielded to known remedies. By contrast, tackling the 2020 recession has involved a
balance between averting a healthcare disaster and maintaining a functional
economy (Box I.A).
This chapter reviews the economic disruptions wrought by the pandemic. It
begins by discussing the various mechanisms through which the outbreak caused a
collapse in economic activity. It then looks at the financial system’s ability to provide

The Covid-19 pandemic and the policy trade-offs

A key question policymakers face in the midst of the pandemic is how to balance public health and economic
considerations. Epidemiological research suggests that, without a vaccine or effective treatment, restrictions
on social interactions are necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from overwhelming public health
systems and to save lives. But shutting down large parts of the economy has major costs as well.
Economists have sought to evaluate this trade-off in two ways. One is to convert health and economic
outcomes into a common unit of analysis so that costs and benefits can be compared. One such study
estimates that three to four months of moderate social distancing measures could save about 1.7 million lives
in the United States, mostly the elderly, who are at greatest risk from the virus. Using the government’s agespecific Value of Statistical Life (VSL) estimates (ie how much people are willing to pay for small reductions in
their risks of dying from adverse health conditions), the study values the lives saved at over one third of US
annual GDP. That said, VSL estimates can be much lower in other countries, tilting the balance in favour of less
stringent measures.
The second approach to quantifying the benefits and costs of containment policy is to take account of
epidemic and macroeconomic interactions using structural models. This approach combines a classic
mathematical model of epidemics, the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model, with a standard
macroeconomic model that takes into account the death-associated probability (SIR-macro). A key insight is
that, even in the absence of containment measures, households have an incentive to cut back social
interactions and economic activities to avoid being infected. But these actions tend to be too minor because
households do not internalise the effect of their behaviour on the overall epidemic and the health of others.
This creates an externality and provides a rationale for containment policy.
Calibrated SIR-macro models typically favour a containment policy that substantially restricts economic
activity over milder voluntary social distancing – Graph I.A illustrates the simulations and welfare calculations
of a simple calibrated SIR-macro model. The left-hand and centre panels show, respectively, the evolution of
GDP per capita and mortality rates during a hypothetical pandemic. The “myopic” case (red lines) is where
households do not change behaviour to avoid becoming infected. A relatively small decline in economic
activity occurs largely because some of those infected are too sick to work. But the infection spreads
unchecked and stretches the healthcare system so that eventually more than 3% of the population die. The
“precautionary” case (blue lines) is where households consciously avoid being infected through voluntary
social distancing, by working and consuming less around the peak of the epidemic. This lowers GDP, but also
the number of infections and the death toll. The “benevolent” case (yellow lines) shows a socially optimal

policy response, which takes all externalities into account. This involves a larger and earlier suppression of
economic activity, slowing the spread of the virus and reducing the number of deaths even further. Household
welfare is highest because the gains from less illness and mortality outweigh the short-term costs of lower
consumption (right-hand panel).
The high degree of externalities differentiates the present pandemic from public health challenges such
as limiting the costs of smoking or car accidents. There is little middle ground between effectively containing
the virus and experiencing an uncontrolled outbreak. The benefits of stringent containment may be highly
non-linear – they are substantial only when containment is implemented decisively enough. Without public
coordination, individual actions are likely to be suboptimally small and to last too long.
At the same time, the macroeconomic costs of containment are likely grow with time and become more
persistent the longer a lockdown remains in place, a possibility assumed away in most SIR-macro models. The
destruction of organisational and human capital, from bankruptcies and layoffs, may inflict long-lasting
damage on the economy and society. Keeping corporate bankruptcies to a minimum and averting a
protracted slump is thus a key element in the overall evaluation. In countries with weaker social safety nets,
the costs of prolonged lockdowns in terms of people’s lives and livelihoods are likely to be much higher. These
considerations, which highlight the complexity of the decisions facing policymakers, have yet to be
incorporated into a coherent economic framework to inform the potential trade-offs between public health
and economic activity.

analysis of Greenstone and Nigram (2020), op cit.

Economic activity plunged
Global economic activity contracted sharply in March and April as policymakers
forced an economic sudden stop. To contain the spread of the virus, authorities
around the globe shut down some activities, mostly services that involve either
large crowds or close human contact, such as entertainment, tourism, restaurants,
retailing (other than necessities) and personal care (Graph I.2, left-hand panel). In
addition, social distancing measures disrupted production in other sectors that
require a high degree of collective activity on-site, such as manufacturing and
construction. In manufacturing, disruptions also percolated along the (local and
global) supply chain. Output may also have suffered if working from home reduced
productivity.
Economic activity indicators plummeted. Purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs)
recorded new lows. The decline was steeper for the indices covering services, which
are directly affected by social distancing (Graph I.2, centre panel).
In many countries, the ensuing contraction was the largest swing in economic
activity in living memory. Global GDP contracted by more than 10% in the first
quarter of 2020, even though most countries imposed containment measures only
towards the end of the quarter; forecasters expect a much larger drop in almost all
economies during the second. The April 2020 IMF forecasts saw the global economy
shrinking by 3% for the year as a whole, a downward revision of 6.4 percentage
points from assessments made at the beginning of the year (Graph I.3) and far

right-hand panel). Emerging market economies (EMEs) were particularly hard hit,
given their typically less well resourced health systems and the constellation of
economic forces (see below).1
Consumption collapsed as the range of expenditure opportunities narrowed
and economic prospects darkened. Many households saved more in response to
high uncertainty about future income. Layoffs and wage cuts took their toll, with
the blow amplified by the labour-intensive character of many of the services most
affected. In the United States, for instance, over 40 million workers claimed
unemployment benefits between March and June (Graph I.4, left-hand panel). In
Europe, unemployment increased much less, although it would have been higher
had it not been for special government schemes subsidising workers in employment.
In many EMEs, the large informal economy hid the true extent of the rise in
unemployment. The moderate rise in the official unemployment rate in many EMEs
since end-2019 (Graph I.4, centre panel) does not cover the informal sector, which
accounts for a significant share of employment in many economies, especially in
Latin America and South Asia (right-hand panel). These informal workers are
vulnerable to losing their jobs, as they tend to concentrate in small firms or in some
of the hardest-hit services. The International Labour Organization estimates that, in
the absence of income support measures, the earnings of informal workers in the
first month of the crisis would have declined by up to 81% in Latin America and
69% in Europe and Central Asia.2 In India, a local think tank estimates that some
90 million Indian workers, most of them employed in the informal sector as small
traders and wage labourers, lost their jobs in just one month during the lockdown
that began in late March.3
Depressed demand and high uncertainty also curtailed investment. Many firms
cut capital expenditure and dividend payments to preserve cash holdings. Even so,
simulations using firm-level data show that many firms have insufficient buffers to
survive an extended shortfall in revenues without external support (Box I.B).

Covid-19 and the quest for lost revenues

The sudden stop in economic activity has sharply undercut corporate revenues, placing firms at the epicentre
of the pandemic’s economic fallout. Many firms face revenue reductions far beyond those typically
experienced in recessions. Revenues have all but evaporated for some firms in the most shutdown-affected
sectors – for example, air travel, restaurants, hotels and entertainment. Firms may not survive even if they use
all possible levers to offset the drop, including drawing down liquid assets, rolling over debts coming due,
borrowing new funds and cutting costs, particularly if the lockdowns persist for an extended period or activity
recovers only very slowly.
The evidence suggests that the funding shortfalls – the additional funding needed to cover operating
costs and interest expense – can be sizeable, up to about half a year’s worth of revenues. This is the result
based on simulations on firm-level balance sheets and financial statements for 33,150 firms from 19 major
advanced and emerging market economies. Rolling over maturing debt and new borrowing can provide some
relief. But even so, funding gaps remain. In many countries, government support equivalent to about two
months of revenues would be needed to close the gap.
Gauging firms’ funding gaps requires information about revenues and operating costs. The simulations
are based on the assumption that firms’ 2020 revenues either remain unchanged from 2019 or decline by
25% or fall by 50%, depending on how strongly the outbreak affects the sector. Revenues in the entertainment
sector, for example, are assumed to fall by 50% and those in the utilities sector to remain constant. The cost
impact is estimated for each industry based on the average relationship between changes in revenues and
costs using data for firms over 2016–19. Unsurprisingly, these elasticities tend to be significantly below one,
implying that lower revenues cause profit margins to shrink.

Based on these inputs, simulations show that a large number of firms are likely to face operating losses in
2020 (Graph I.B, left-hand panel). In all countries, the median firm would swing from comfortable profits
(above 5% of revenues) in 2019 to losses well in excess of 20% of its 2019 revenues. Unsurprisingly, firms in
countries with larger 2019 profit margins would face lower losses. But in some cases, this result could flip
because of the sectoral composition of output. For instance, a severe revenue shock could drive Brazilian or
Canadian firms deeply into the red, despite strong 2019 profits, mainly reflecting deep contractions in
commodity sectors and, in Canada, transport equipment manufacturing. In Russia, oil looms large. In spite of
strong profits in 2019, Russian firms could face losses in 2020 in excess of 40% of their 2019 revenues,
reflecting the Russian economy’s large exposure to oil.
Firms also need to continue serving their financial liabilities in addition to covering operational expenses.
Given the extent of projected losses, liquid asset holdings could fall short of operating losses and debt service
costs (Graph I.B, centre panel). Simulations suggest that the funding shortfall for the median firm could
amount to 20% of the sum of operating expenses and debt service costs. In some countries, it could even
reach 40%.
Large funding shortfalls suggest that firms will need financial support. This could take several forms. First,
firms could ask for maturing debt to be rolled over. Second, they could borrow against their assets, even if
these are temporarily illiquid. Lastly, they could benefit from grants, loan guarantees, direct loans or schemes
such as furlough programmes, which reduce operating costs by covering part of the wage bill.
Such measures could make a big difference. For instance, in a scenario where firms cannot borrow and
have to repay their maturing debt, the median firm in many countries would need public support equivalent
to about six months of revenues (Graph I.B, right-hand panel). This would fall to an average across countries
of two months of revenues if firms could roll over half the debt coming due in 2020 and borrow to the tune of
80% of their short-term assets.
These averages hide a large variation across countries. In some, such as China and France, rolling over
debt and borrowing against short-term assets would allow the median firm to close the funding gap entirely.
In others, such as Canada or India, where many firms belong to hard-hit sectors or where profitability in 2019
was low, firms would need significant additional fund injections – equivalent to four months of revenues –
even if they rolled over debt and obtained new loans.
 Trade credits/payables are assumed to be broadly balanced in the simulations.

International spillovers from the various supply and demand disruptions
worsened the blow. Global trade volumes fell sharply in early 2020 (Graph I.5, lefthand panel).4 The automotive industry was hit especially hard, given the large
number of suppliers in production networks spanning several countries. As early as
February, shortages of parts produced in China forced car manufacturers in Japan
and Korea to temporarily shut down plants. And just when production of Chinese
auto parts resumed in early March, containment measures in Europe and the
United States forced many manufacturers to halt production and cancel orders
placed with EMEs. Mexican parts manufacturers felt the full force of plant
shutdowns in the United States, as over 85% of Mexican parts exports were USbound in 2019.
Restrictions on international cargo and passenger transport were another
source of disruption. Port closures and revised customs clearance procedures
created bottlenecks in international sea freight. Major port terminals in China
reported a 24% year-on-year decline in containerised sea freight in February 2020
(Graph I.5, centre panel). Bans on international travel depressed air passenger
traffic. By mid-May, scheduled flights had seen a year-on-year decline of more than
60% globally (right-hand panel), with many routes completely shut down. This
crippled air freight capacity.
The fear of contagion and travel bans depressed tourism. Popular new-year
destinations for Chinese tourists, such as Thailand, were hit first, but within a couple
of months global tourism came to a halt. Inbound tourism accounts for over 10% of
GDP in Greece, Iceland and Thailand. Its share in employment is even larger. The

Commodity prices, especially the oil price, were another transmission channel.
Lockdowns in China triggered a sharp drop in metals and energy prices in early
2020. A price war between two of the largest oil producers exacerbated the fall in
early March, driving prices to a 20-year trough. An agreement in early April brought
some respite. Limited storage capacity at a key petroleum hub in the United States
even temporarily pushed the prices of some near-term futures contracts into deeply
negative territory as investors refused to take physical delivery. Lower oil prices
crippled economic activity, export and fiscal revenues in a number of oil-exporting
advanced economies (AEs) and EMEs. For each 10% reduction in oil sector
production, GDP growth can slow by up to 1.2 percentage points. The decline in oil
prices will also lead to a sharp drop in the export revenues of oil producers and, in
some cases, their fiscal revenues too (Graph I.6).6
Many low- and middle-income economies are also likely to be hit by a drop in
remittances. The World Bank expects remittances to decline by around 20% in
2020. This can cause large economic and social costs.7 In addition, many migrant
workers who lose their job may return home, adding pressure to local labour
markets.

A financial sudden stop
The economic contraction conspired with the darkening outlook and high
uncertainty to sharply tighten global financial conditions, threatening to further
depress output. An early lockdown in China barely moved global markets. But as a
new infection cluster emerged in Italy in late February, financial markets were
rudely awakened. A tumultuous March followed as the virus spread rapidly around
the world. Equity prices dived and spreads soared (Graph I.7, left-hand panel).

Implied volatilities, already elevated, surged even higher, in some cases to all-time
peaks.
These market strains soon turned into a scramble for cash. Anticipating capital
losses or the suspension of withdrawals, investors in US prime money market funds
accelerated redemptions (Graph I.7, centre panel). By end-March, these funds,
which invest in short-term bank and corporate paper, saw a wave of withdrawals
to the tune of $160 billion, or roughly 15% of assets under management. At the
same time, leveraged investors such as hedge funds were forced to liquidate
positions to meet margin calls. This “dash for cash” intensified selling pressure on
all asset classes, including US Treasuries. Long-term US Treasury and bund yields
soared in mid-March, after having fallen to historical lows only a week before
(right-hand panel).
Corporate funding markets froze during the first half of March. From late
February to March, the high-yield bond market effectively shut down (Graph I.8,
left-hand panel). Conditions also deteriorated markedly in the leveraged loan and
private credit markets. Weekly issuance of leveraged loans dropped well below the
2019 average, and collateralised loan obligation (CLO) issuance ground to a halt.
The freeze affected even the investment grade corporate bond and commercial
paper markets.
Retrenchment by global investors hit EMEs particularly hard. With threats to
globalisation, commodity exports and global value chains – all fundamental to
EMEs’ great leap forward during the past 30 years – investors headed for the exit.
In March alone, international investors withdrew more than $80 billion from EMEs
(Graph I.8, centre panel), the largest single-month capital outflow on record. Some
countries, eg Brazil and Poland, also saw net foreign direct investment (FDI)
outflows. These outflows went hand in hand with a sharp depreciation of EME

currencies, often despite significant FX intervention in the spot or, less often, the
derivatives market (eg in Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico). In the first quarter, major
EME currencies such as the Brazilian real, the South African rand, the Russian rouble
and the Mexican peso lost more than 20% of their value against the dollar.8 The
countries with the sharpest depreciation also saw large increases in domestic
government bond yields as foreign investors, in particular, demanded a high premium
to compensate for the lower dollar value of their investments (right-hand panel).
Market conditions stabilised only after central banks in both AEs and EMEs
announced an unprecedented array of measures, going well beyond those adopted
during the GFC. In addition to stabilising markets, the measures were designed to
maintain the flow of credit to firms, households and even public entities.
Interestingly, in many cases market conditions recovered well before the measures
became operational. For example, the issuance of dollar-denominated corporate
bonds bounced back right after the announcement of the Federal Reserve’s credit
facilities, two months before the central bank started actual purchases. Other
funding markets, including those which were not directly targeted by the measures,
reopened with a slightly longer delay.
By early June, market conditions had improved to the point of raising questions
about whether they had not become disconnected from what was happening in
the real economy. At the same time, many markets remained less liquid and less
stable than at the beginning of the year. Equities in both AEs and EMEs had retraced
about half of their previous declines; credit spreads had also narrowed somewhat.
Capital outflows from EMEs eased in April and May, giving way to inflows in some
economies. Yields on local currency bonds declined, often in response to central

lower level than before the outbreak.

Financial pressure points
The financial market turbulence in February and March highlighted a number of
pre-existing vulnerabilities that could amplify the crisis and complicate the policy
response. At the same time, there were also some silver linings. The post-GFC
regulatory reforms have made the banking system much more resilient, allowing
banks to offset the shutdown of capital markets to some extent. Financial
infrastructure too weathered the storm successfully, including normally invisible but
no less crucial payment and settlement systems as well as central counterparties.

Fragile household and corporate balance sheets
High debt levels have limited the private sector’s ability to make up for lost income
with new borrowing. Credit to the non-financial private sector climbed from just
over 120% of GDP just before the GFC to 144% at end-2019, but this aggregate
hides much larger increases in some countries and sectors. A key factor explaining
this diverse picture has been the long shadow of the GFC. In general, countries and
sectors that were at the heart of that crisis have tended to deleverage, and the
others to leverage up, with varying degrees of intensity.
This is the case for households. Deleveraging after the GFC has left household
balance sheets in the economies most affected by that crisis in better shape than in

12

2008 (Graph I.9, left-hand panel, “high and falling” group). In combination with low
interest rates, this has reduced debt service burdens (centre panel). By contrast,
several other economies have seen rising debt-to-GDP ratios, notably a number of
small AEs (“high and rising” group) and some EMEs, notably China. Debt service
ratios in several of these economies have also gone up substantially, despite low
interest rates.
Selling assets could provide only partial relief for contractions in income. Most
assets are illiquid, particularly housing, and are very unevenly distributed. Even in
high-income economies, the buffers of households at the bottom of the wealth
distribution cover only a few months of subsistence consumption (Graph I.9, righthand panel). This number is even lower once debt service burdens are factored in.10
And while public sector safety nets, such as unemployment insurance schemes or
wage subsidies, are typically well developed in high-income countries, those in lowand middle-income ones leave households more exposed. In low-income countries,
high levels of poverty, informality and financial exclusion are key vulnerabilities.
The condition of the business sector, which was not at the heart of the GFC,
has deteriorated significantly over the past decade. Corporate indebtedness has
tended to increase in many countries (Graph I.10, left-hand panel), even as
unusually low interest rates have helped keep debt service costs in check. Granted,
some firms have built up large cash holdings, in part as they have shied away from
physical investments. But even so, the cash holdings of many firms, even large ones,
are small relative to the scale of the sudden stop they face (centre panel). Except in
China, half of the companies held cash and equivalents of less than two months of
2019 revenues (centre panel). The cash buffers of smaller firms were of similar size.
A recent survey revealed that about 60% of UK small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) held less than 12 weeks’ cash in the bank.11

The Covid-19 shock is likely to be particularly challenging for SMEs. Smaller
firms tend to be more important in sectors particularly affected by lockdowns such
as hotels, restaurants or construction. They also rely more on internal financing and
tend to have fewer external financing options than larger firms. For instance, in the
United Kingdom more than 40% of small businesses have not borrowed at all in the
last five years.12 The lack of banking relationships could therefore compound the
difficulty of accessing external financing. Furthermore, the widespread use of real
estate assets as collateral could prove a major drag on the availability of SME
funding should property prices fall, even temporarily. In the light of these
difficulties, many governments, for instance in Switzerland, have fully guaranteed
SME loans in order to roll out support quickly.
Another corporate vulnerability is that the profits of many firms have not kept
pace with growing indebtedness. While some firms have been exceptionally
profitable, the share of those reporting losses or earnings barely sufficient to meet
interest costs has increased in recent years (Graph I.10, right-hand panel). Consistent
with this picture, credit ratings have tended to decline in many key jurisdictions.
The currency denomination of the debt is a further weak spot. As measured by
the standard on-balance sheet residence-based statistics, the dollar debt of nonbank borrowers outside the United States rose to $12.2 trillion at end-2019. Of this,
$3.8 trillion was owed by EME residents, mostly non-financial corporations
(Graph I.11, left-hand panel). But the amounts are considerably larger once adjusted
for borrowing through offshore entities and, to a lesser extent, through FX
derivatives that require repayment of notional amounts (principal). Offshore
borrowing has been substantial for a number of large EMEs, such as Brazil, China,
India and Russia (right-hand panel).13 Adding to the vulnerability, the debt servicing
capacity of EME corporates has weakened since 2010 due to a broad decline in
earnings.14

There is no comprehensive information on how much of this debt is hedged.
That said, less developed derivatives markets typically limit the scope for financial
hedges. “Natural hedges” through export revenues are more common. However,
these may falter if export prices drop, as happened recently in the oil sector. Since
half of total EME hard currency corporate debt is owed by state-owned enterprises,
often oil firms, this can feed directly into the sovereign’s balance sheet.

Fickle market funding
The growing reliance on market financing by many firms may exacerbate
vulnerabilities. The outstanding amount of corporate bonds reached $16 trillion at
end-2019, the bulk of which was issued by firms in non-investment grades and the
lower buckets of investment grade. In addition, firms took on approximately
$1.5 trillion in leveraged loans (syndicated lending for low-rated and more indebted
companies) during 2019.15 Such loans are often held by investors through different
investment vehicles, including credit funds, and more complex structured instruments
such as CLOs. Banks typically provide funding to these investors and hold the
higher-rated tranches. Last but not least, private credit – loans offered by non-bank
investors with limited bank involvement – has also grown rapidly in recent years
and has been disproportionately directed at firms at the lower end of the credit risk
spectrum.16
The sudden stop in market funding in February and March highlighted a
number of vulnerabilities related to this funding structure.
First, before the outbreak, heightened risk-taking and fierce competition
among lenders had compressed spreads and loosened covenants, despite an
increase in leverage.17 Less restrictive covenants, in particular, can result in much
higher credit losses when the thresholds are finally hit. As a result, weak covenants
increase investors’ incentives to head for the exit.

Second, the toxic combination of declining creditworthiness and investor
retrenchment increased the pressure on fund managers to dump assets. By endMay, the number of downgrades and reductions in the rating outlook made by
one of the major rating agencies had climbed to nearly 1,800, including 200
affecting firms in the energy sector (Graph I.12, left-hand panel). This represented
well over one third of the rated non-financial corporate debt universe. Of
particular concern are the so-called fallen angels – debt that drops out of
investment grade and can no longer be held by most asset managers and
institutional investors. In addition to US prime money market funds, mutual funds
investing in corporate debt experienced sharp outflows (Graph I.12, centre panel),
forcing them to sell. At the height of the sell-off, funds investing in AE and EME
equities and corporate bonds lost approximately 15% of their net asset holdings in
a single week.
Third, the repricing of risk by foreign investors in local currency bond markets
once again resulted in a sharp tightening of domestic financial conditions in EMEs.
EME domestic currency debt markets have grown substantially since the Asian crisis
in the 1990s as a result of deliberate policies designed to reduce “original sin”, the
inability of EMEs to issue debt in their own currency (Graph I.12, right-hand
panel). But while mitigating currency mismatching for the borrower, the shift has
transferred it to foreign lenders, which tend to invest on an unhedged basis –
“original sin redux”. Since domestic yields tend to rise in tandem with currency
depreciation, foreign investors lose on both positions, which amplifies their

16

retrenchment. As the same mechanism operates in reverse during appreciations
and capital inflows, it tends to amplify the boom-bust pattern in capital flows
commonly experienced by EMEs.18

Banks withstand pressure
On the whole, banks were able to meet at least part of the increase in households’
and firms’ funding needs. This is particularly important because banks remain the
main creditors of households and firms, notwithstanding the advance of capital
markets. Bank loans account for the vast majority of household credit in almost all
economies – the United States being a notable exception. Their share in corporate
lending is lower, but still exceeds 60% in most AEs and EMEs. Thus, banks remain
the first port of call for most firms seeking to bridge funding gaps.
The post-GFC increase in banks’ capital buffers (ie in excess of minimum capital
requirements) should give some comfort that banks will continue to meet funding
demands (Graph I.13, left-hand and centre panels).19 At the same time, banks’
chronically low profitability in some economies could crimp their ability to expand
their balance sheets. Over the past decade, the return-on-assets of European banks
has rarely exceeded 0.5%, compared with an average of 1.25% for the world as a
whole (right-hand panel). The share of non-performing loans also remains high in
some countries. In Japan, bank profits have been even lower than in Europe, with a
return-on-assets of only 0.3% in 2019. This is reflected in very low price-to-book

ratios, in some cases languishing below one, which hinders banks from raising new
equity capital.
Another vulnerability is the reliance of many banks on dollar funding. At
$10 trillion, non-US banks’ gross dollar liabilities at end-2019 are as high as before
the GFC in late 2007. In 2008, European banks in particular found it exceedingly
difficult to fund their dollar-denominated assets. The funding squeeze was
ameliorated only after the Federal Reserve and other central banks put in place a
system of swap lines: through these, non-US central banks could obtain US dollars
and onlend to banks. While European banks have shrunk their dollar books and,
consequently, dollar funding, Canadian, Japanese, Chinese and other EME banks
have expanded theirs.20
The Covid-19 shock has put banks under pressure on several fronts. The
deterioration in credit quality has already forced them to significantly step up their
loan loss provisions. Under the newly introduced expected loss provisioning
standards, a rise in the mere probability of losses boosts provisions. In a sample of
internationally active banks, US institutions increased provisions more than
fourfold in the first quarter. European banks have been slower, with provisions
doubling in the same period (Graph I.14, left-hand panel).21 Looking ahead, falling
property prices could amplify losses. Market indicators suggest sizeable declines in
many countries, especially in the prices of commercial properties for the sectors
most affected by the lockdowns (Box I.C). On the other hand, banks’ direct
exposures to large firms in the heavily hit sectors such as airlines and oil firms
appear limited.22
Banks have felt pressure also on the funding side. Spreads on bank bonds and
commercial paper widened significantly in late February and March as rating

Real estate markets in the wake of the Covid-19 shock

In contrast to the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007–09, real estate markets have not been at the epicentre
of the recent financial earthquake. Even so, they matter for the eventual depth of the recession and the
subsequent recovery. The construction industry is a major source of employment and demand for a broad
network of suppliers. Real estate also constitutes a large fraction of household wealth, while mortgages and
other commercial real estate-related lending represent a significant part of financial intermediaries’ exposures.
In summary, the health of the real estate market is important for the normal flow of credit through the
economy and for financial stability. Real estate collapses have caused many past banking crises. Despite some
increase in price co-movement across countries, real estate markets are still mainly driven by domestic
factors. Yet the global reach of the Covid-19 shock may suggest greater co‑movements than usual.
Actual real estate price adjustments are notoriously hard to measure and are observed with a lag. This is
because assets are very heterogeneous and liquidity is low. And this makes it harder to gauge their response
to the health emergency. The fact that real estate prices have increased at a brisk pace in recent years in many
countries may represent a vulnerability. But since prices are also quite sluggish, very recent movements may
be poor indicators of their future evolution.
Partly because of this, the prices of commercial real estate (CRE) investment vehicles may provide a more
timely guide. This is the case for the highly liquid real estate investment trusts (REITs). A drawback is that they
exhibit strong equity-like dynamics.
Investors anticipate large CRE price declines. In all the jurisdictions considered, the Covid-19 shock wiped
out REITs’ cumulative valuation gains over the last five years or more (Graph I.C, left-hand panel). As a
comparison, broad-market stock indices at the peak of the crisis in early March had lost only the gains of
2019. Even when benchmarked against the performance of more directly comparable stocks such as cyclicals
and small corporates, the losses between February and March were large. REITs have also lagged behind
overall stock markets in the recovery that followed from April.

Valuation losses have varied widely across types of CRE. Segments such as shopping malls and retail

suffered a deeper plunge in prices and a shallower recovery than broader portfolios of real estate assets
(Graph I.C, centre panel). By contrast, the prices of REITs specialised in telecommunications towers and
warehousing experienced shallower losses. REITs specialised in residential properties moved in lockstep with
broader portfolios such as the VNQ Real Estate ETF.
Other signs of stress in CRE gradually surfaced in the United States and Asian markets during Q1 2020.
Deals were called off, and the ranks of buyers began to thin. Under normal business conditions, CRE deals are
abandoned only rarely. In the United States, cancellations as a fraction of closed deals in a given month had
averaged 0.4% over the last five years, on a declining trend. But in March, that fraction soared to almost 1.5%.
Moreover, delinquencies reportedly increased in April on US commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS),
though from a low level. Not surprisingly, the sharpest increase came from the hotel sector. Some credit rating
agencies expect overall delinquency rates in CMBS to approach GFC levels later in the year, and those of
hotels and retailers may approach 30% and 20%, respectively, much higher than the GFC peaks. In China,
property developers faced increasing difficulties in refinancing deals, in part because of regulatory tightening,
and the fraction of troubled assets soared to 50% of the total market. In fact, in China, distressed deals – sales
made by debtors or trustees that have taken control of the assets – have been high for some time, fluctuating
around 35% from H2 2019 (Graph I.C, right-hand panel). Deal volumes in the Asia-Pacific region suffered a
double-digit contraction in Q1 2020, mostly because of large deals being shelved. One has to go back to the
GFC to find a similar contraction. Smaller deals were still going through, but market intelligence indicates that
the situation has been growing increasingly brittle. Once again, volume drops were sharper in office and retail
space, as well as senior housing and care. Industrial property fared relatively well, as manufacturing may lead
the recovery this time around.

agencies revised the outlook for many banks and US prime money market funds
saw outflows (Graph I.7, centre panel). In their decisions, rating agencies appeared
to attach significant weight to profitability.23 The agencies put almost half of the
banks with profits below the median on negative watch, compared with fewer than
10% for those above (right-hand panel). The pressure was particularly acute for
non-US banks relying on dollar funding.
Last but not least, banks have faced pressure on the operational side too. Bank
staff members were even more likely to be working from home than those in other
industries. Anecdotal evidence suggests that major banks operated with only
10–15% of their staff in the office. This may have helped accelerate the withdrawal
from risk-taking as traders exited risky positions for precautionary reasons.
Despite these pressures, banks were able to expand their lending to the real
economy. In the United States, the volume of commercial and industrial loans
expanded by 10% in March and 14% in April.24 In the euro area, loans to nonfinancial corporations rose by 2.7% in March and 1.6% in April, the fastest rate in
over a decade.

Managing the fallout
Tackling the economic fallout of a pandemic requires a different policy prescription
from dealing with a typical recession or financial crisis. During lockdowns, the
priority is to ensure that households and (viable) firms survive the sudden stop in
economic activity. In this phase, boosting private demand is not a priority, since

20

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

spending tends to be rather insensitive to policy stimulus. Instead, the objective is
to mitigate the impact of the economic standstill on firms’ and households’ cash
flows. This is akin to providing a lifeline to a patient in an induced coma, to keep
vital organs functioning. Moreover, it is important to prevent an abrupt reaction in
financial markets that could undermine financial intermediation, amplifying the
contraction.
The life support measures during the first phase should lay the foundation for
the recovery once lockdown measures are lifted. On the production side, firms that
retain their skilled workers and see a resumption in demand will be better able to
ramp up production while, on the demand side, workers who keep their jobs and
income can resume consumption. But even so, high uncertainty may hold back
aggregate demand and the pace of recovery. Monetary and fiscal policy may thus
need to be expansionary for some time to sustain the recovery.
High uncertainty complicates the policy response. Policymakers need to take
decisions despite substantial uncertainty about the length and severity of the
outbreak and its impact on people’s lives and livelihoods. As a result, it is
exceedingly hard to put together a holistic and robust plan. Policy tends to follow a
step by step approach in which specific problems are identified and solutions put in
place as the situation evolves. Deploying insufficient funds could cause widespread
bankruptcies and layoffs, with large and persistent output losses. It may also
disappoint financial markets and amplify retrenchment. However, policy space is
limited. And firing too many bullets too soon could leave the authorities exposed
should the infection re‑emerge and the crisis be more prolonged than expected.
Against this backdrop, clear exit strategies are essential to gradually phase out the
exceptional measures.
Uncertainty also extends to which firms and which jobs will survive, especially
during the early stages of the pandemic. This would call for immediate and broadbased support that would gradually give way to a more focused approach as
uncertainty recedes. Allowing bankruptcies too early in the process could kill the
drivers of tomorrow’s growth, but delaying them too long and keeping unviable
firms alive could slow the necessary structural adjustment. A related issue is whether
offering firms loans or loan guarantees could give rise to “moral hazard”, where
recipients may act with less financial prudence in the future. This may be less of a
problem at this juncture. However, keeping afloat firms that had taken on excessive
risk prior to the pandemic could hamper economic recovery further down the line.
This puts a premium on due diligence and mechanisms such as imposing suitable
conditionality on state support programmes to lessen moral hazard issues. Yet
another trade-off concerns assistance to large enterprises, which could protect the
livelihoods of the large number of workers they employ. But large firms are not
necessarily those with a brighter future. And focusing on them at the expense of
smaller ones could kill off competition from new entrants and thus slow innovation
and reduce competitiveness.
High debt levels are a further complicating factor. While borrowing helps to
bridge income gaps, the debt burden may become unsustainable for some firms
and households. Insolvencies seem almost inevitable. Experience suggests that
promptly cutting excess capacity and restructuring debts tends to produce faster
recoveries than a more gradual approach.25 But a surge in bankruptcy proceedings
could overwhelm the system’s restructuring capacity, not least if courts become
congested.

Central banks as crisis managers
Monetary policymakers were the first to react. Central banks promptly cut their
policy interest rates once a pandemic became a distinct possibility, to pre-emptively
ease financial conditions and cushion the blow (Graph I.15, left-hand and centre
panels). As the situation deteriorated and financial market turmoil ensued, central
banks introduced a myriad of additional emergency measures to stabilise financial
markets and restore confidence (Table I.1). They stepped up easing measures, in
some cases taking policy rates to the effective lower bound, and introduced openended asset purchase programmes to unclog market-makers’ balance sheets and
restart issuance. And as dislocations in domestic and dollar funding markets
became apparent, central banks injected liquidity via open market operations and
standing facilities, and extended US dollar swap lines.
While most of those measures have by now become standard in crisis
management, the current challenges forced central banks to expand their playbook.
In particular, given the shock’s unprecedented scale and nature, they offered
lifelines to businesses in distress, by either purchasing debt outright (eg bonds and
commercial paper) or providing backstops to banks (eg in the form of funding-forlending schemes), especially in the case of SMEs (Graph I.15, right-hand panel). In
the process, central banks went down the credit rating scale, sometimes below
investment grade. In at least one case – the United States – the central bank
extended support to local authorities. Taken together, these programmes are set to
expand their balance sheets further.26
Naturally, there were differences across countries. In particular, EMEs have had
less room for manoeuvre, given their structural vulnerabilities and the multiple
shocks hitting them. Even then, many could reduce interest rates and reserve

requirements, and, for the first time, implement measures to support firms and
mitigate stress in domestic currency bond markets. This is testimony to the much
improved monetary frameworks in place, complemented by the active use of FX
reserve management and macroprudential measures.27
Prudential measures to enable banks to meet increased funding demand
supported monetary policy actions. The overall strategy was to release the buffers
that banks had been required to accumulate in good times and to ease or adopt
more flexible interpretations of minimum requirements and loan classifications
(Table I.1). In addition, a number of authorities imposed various restrictions on
distributions, notably dividend payments.28
Crucial as they have been, central bank responses have a fundamental
limitation. They provide temporary financing, but cannot transfer real resources. As
such, they all generate additional debt and can only help borrowers survive if the
income loss is not too large. For much the same reason, some borrowers run the
risk of shifting the problems to the banking sector should that income loss become
too large.

Fiscal responses to the coronavirus crisis
This points to the dual importance of fiscal policy. First, it can act as backstop to the
extraordinary measures central banks have taken. Governments can provide partial
or complete indemnities to facilitate central banks’ funding for less creditworthy
firms. This can help to clarify the dividing line between monetary and fiscal policies
as well as free central banks to concentrate on their mandate.29 Second, and more
importantly, fiscal policy can transfer real resources to firms and households, to

ease income shortfalls. This, of course, is in addition to the resources needed to
directly tackle the health emergency in the first place.
As the coronavirus emergency intensified, governments around the world
sprang into action and announced large-scale fiscal packages. The packages
generally consisted of a mixture of outright transfers (eg through income support,
expanded unemployment insurance schemes, wage subsidies and tax rebates/
waivers), bridge financing (eg tax deferrals and loans) and contingent resource
transfers (eg equity injections and loan guarantees). The measures complement
each other in protecting household livelihoods and in helping companies survive
cash flow problems (Table I.2).
Many fiscal measures involve the outright transfer of resources to households
and firms. Reflecting the urgency of the situation, many authorities took a blanket
approach, offering tax waivers or cash grants to all residents, while some targeted
those most affected by the shutdowns. For example, several AEs increased and
extended the coverage and duration of unemployment benefits. But even so, this
left significant groups of the population in dire straits – for instance, young people
about to enter the labour market or many self-employed workers. In many EMEs,
where a large part of the population works in the informal sector and cannot be
easily reached, governments expanded their social assistance programmes to
shelter the most vulnerable (Box I.D). Some governments also provided subsidies to
particular industries considered vital to the economy.30
Governments also used a variety of tools to provide bridge financing. They
deferred business income tax payments and, in some cases, personal ones too. In

Cash transfers to support informal workers in emerging market economies

To support informal workers during the lockdowns, some EME governments have extended existing cash
transfer schemes, increasing or front-loading disbursements. However, existing conditional cash transfer
programmes are unlikely to be sufficient: a significant share of informal workers have incomes above national
poverty lines and are therefore ineligible. For that reason, many governments have introduced new
measures, including one-off unconditional cash transfers to informal workers in Argentina, Peru and Turkey;
two-month transfers in Colombia and the Philippines; three-month transfers in Brazil, Chile and Thailand; and
a six-month transfer in South Africa.
The payouts of the programmes range from 13 to 60% of the monthly minimum wage (Graph I.D, lefthand panel). In many cases, this is less than the average monthly labour income earned by informal workers
as reported in national income surveys (right-hand panel). Countries with less fiscal space tend to offer less
generous benefits (eg Chile, Colombia and South Africa). The estimated cost of these programmes (in
annualised terms) ranges from 0.3% of GDP South Africa to 7.4% in the Philippines.

Organization (ILO); IMF, World Economic Outlook; national data; BIS calculations.

The programmes’ reach is extensive in some countries, but an important challenge is to identify those
who are eligible. To identify the targeted population, some countries are relying on national tax and ID
databases, registries from other existing social assistance programmes, and online platforms for application
by the public. Eligibility criteria vary: in some cases, they exclude workers who are currently benefiting from
existing cash transfer schemes and other social assistance programmes; in other cases, they allow workers to
receive more than one benefit. Caps on income are also part of eligibility criteria. To prevent fraud, some
countries cross-check applications with social security, unemployment insurance and tax authority databases
to verify that beneficiaries have no formal employment. Yet it is unclear to what extent these programmes are
reaching the targeted informal workers.

It is an open question whether current disbursements provide enough relief. A key issue for policymakers
is how large the payout should be and for how long it should be provided. Virus containment measures may
last longer than expected or, even if they are relaxed, they may have to be reimposed. The recovery may also
be shallower and slower than expected. Of course, any additional relief is limited by the available fiscal
resources. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that if income support were to be increased to cover
all informal workers at the announced monthly payout, the expenditure would range (in annualised terms)
from less than 0.5% of GDP in South Africa, where payouts are less generous, to 3.2% of GDP in Brazil and
over 12% in the case of the Philippines, where the payout is relatively generous and the informal sector very
large. Alternatively, if the cash transfers were to be raised to pay all informal workers the current minimum
wage, the expenditure (in annualised terms) would range from 2% of GDP in Russia, a country with a lower
informality rate, to 19% of GDP in Peru and over 25% of GDP in the Philippines, which both have large shares
of informal workers.
 Conditional cash transfers in Latin American and Southeast Asian countries have a long history. The best known include
Bolsa Família in Brazil, Familias en Acción in Colombia, Prospera in Mexico (formerly Progresa-Oportunidades) and the
Keluarga Harapan programme in Indonesia. Cash transfer programmes have not been used as often in emerging
Europe.     According to the International Labour Organization, informal employment includes all jobs in unregistered
and/or small-scale private unincorporated enterprises that produce goods or services meant for sale or barter.     This
computation only takes into account the specific payout to informal workers, and does not include other social assistance
policies that are implemented concurrently and may also benefit the same household, such as increased disbursements
from existent cash transfer programmes, health insurance, in-kind food and vouchers. For a detailed list of social assistance
measures, see U Gentilini, M Almenfi, I Orton, P Dale, J Blomquist, R Palacios, V Desai and V Moreira, “Social protection and
jobs responses to Covid-19: a real-time review of country measures,” World Bank, 15 May 2020.     For example, in Latin
American countries the monthly labour income of informal workers ranges from 85% of the minimum wage in Colombia
and Peru to 125% in Brazil and Chile.     Annualised figures are computed assuming that every scheme lasts 12
months.     Coverage and details about programmes are available from national sources and Gentilini et al (2020), op cit.

addition, several countries enacted standstills on various types of loan, although
these are not necessarily fiscal measures in the strict sense. Some governments also
provided funding directly or through their development banks.
To help restore business confidence and allow companies to raise funds, many
governments also introduced credit guarantees. In particular, these were essential
to induce banks to keep lending. Since the cost of the guarantees is recognised in
the budget only if and when the loans default, such measures are also politically
attractive.31 More importantly, governments could be compensated for the risks
associated with the guarantees through fees and stock warrants.32
The size and scope of the packages announced thus far are unprecedented.
The sum of crisis-related outright transfers, put in place up to early June, amounts
to around 10% of GDP in AEs (Graph I.16, left-hand panel). And the total amount of
bridge financing and contingent resource transfers, if fully utilised, could represent
over 30% of GDP in Germany and Italy (right-hand panel). How much of this will
actually be utilised depends on the duration of the shutdown, the conditions
attached and the pace of recovery.33
The composition of fiscal programmes varies greatly across countries. The size
and shape of the welfare state had an important bearing on the design of fiscal
packages.34 For example, AEs with higher welfare spending and thus stronger
automatic stabilisers relied less on discretionary transfers (Graph I.17, left-hand
panel). Among EMEs, by contrast, countries with higher welfare spending also put
in place larger packages involving immediate transfers. Similarly, countries with
subsidised furlough schemes, eg France, Germany and Switzerland, tended to
expand them rather than providing direct benefits to households, as done, for
instance, in the United States. The structure and stability of the business sector also
explains some of the features of the programmes. For example, countries in which
firms faced larger liquidity shortages or had a larger stock of intra-firm credit put

because of external constraints, as well as their weaker health infrastructure and
inherently greater vulnerability. Accordingly, markets generally have a lower

tolerance for their sovereign debt levels. As a result, the response of EMEs was much
weaker, at 2.6% of GDP, compared with 10% for AEs (Graph I.16, left-hand panel).
Country differences aside, a legacy of the measures and the recession will be
much higher public sector indebtedness. This will exacerbate a previous long-term
trend that the GFC had already intensified. According to early IMF forecasts, the
average primary fiscal deficits in AEs will increase by 8 percentage points of GDP
between 2019 and 2020 (Graph I.19, left-hand panel). All AEs except Japan, Italy
and some large EMEs, including China and Russia, are projected to have 2021
primary deficits of at least 2 percentage points of GDP above the 2016–19 average
(centre panel). Thus, public debt will increase substantially in many AEs (right-hand
panel), and is likely to grow further for all economies into the recovery.

U, V, W? The alphabet soup of the recovery
Besides saving lives, the ultimate test of the policy response to the Covid-19 crisis
will be the strength and durability of the recovery. In the near term, the outlook
hinges on how the pandemic unfolds, which is very hard to predict.
In an optimistic scenario, in which measures to contain the pandemic do not
need to be reimposed, economic activity could gradually improve in the second
half of 2020 and embark on a durable recovery. That said, most observers agree
that a V‑shaped recovery – as after the SARS episode – is out of the question. To be
sure, production could probably resume fairly quickly, with pent-up demand for
some consumer goods providing a boost. But restrictions on physical proximity and
on international mobility would weigh on productivity for some time, lost demand
for most services will not recover and, psychologically, risk aversion may linger. All
this suggests a more gradual, U-shaped rebound.35
While it is still early days, the recent Chinese experience seems to confirm this
conjecture. China, where the virus was first reported, was relatively quick to enter
and exit its first lockdown. There, large firms were able to return to approximately
90% of capacity within two months after the most restrictive measures were lifted,
but smaller firms lagged behind and consumption remained subdued (Box I.E).
Yet even a U-shaped scenario may be out of reach. The lifting of containment
measures could well result in a renewed outbreak and hence in their reimposition,
possibly more than once. Rather than being U-shaped, the recovery would then be
W- or wave-shaped, and of uncertain length. This would put further pressure on
both monetary and fiscal policy.36
The Covid-19 outbreak could also hold back economic activity in the
medium-to-long run, if it damages the economic tissue and leaves long-lasting
scars. Unless quickly restructured, higher debt levels could hold back growth, just as
after the GFC. The restructuring process might not be able to effectively distinguish
viable from non-viable firms, especially if bankruptcy courts or less formal
mechanisms are overwhelmed: valuable capital would then be lost and worthless
firms kept operating. Unemployment could result in a loss of skills or make it
more difficult for young people to gain a foothold in the labour market.37 More
generally, unless policies are sufficiently supportive and well targeted, the
reallocation of resources to meet the new pattern of demand post-crisis may take
time or be undermined.
Questions also arise concerning global value chains and global integration.
Firms may seek to shorten their value chains and rely on multiple suppliers for the
same good to diversify their risks. Parts of the value chains may also be onshored.
There may be more inward investment at the expense of FDI. Economies depending
on trade or FDI may have to reinvent their growth model. The burden could fall

China returns to work

On 23 January, two days before the Chinese new year, the authorities put several major cities under strict
lockdown in an attempt to contain the Covid-19 outbreak. Since then, the virus has gradually been brought
under control and China recorded zero new reported coronavirus deaths for the first time on 7 April. How has
the economy performed so far following the “exit” from containment measures? Data up to 20 May indicated
that some economic activities took about six weeks to get back to near capacity, while others were still falling
short of that benchmark.
The movement of people adjusted sluggishly after containment was eased. Traditionally, the lunar new
year holiday ushers in the busiest travel period in China, with millions of migrant workers journeying between
workplace and home. Data tracking this migration showed that daily average passenger traffic reached only
20 million trips in early May, compared with over 40 million a year earlier (Graph I.E.1, left-hand panel). Public
transport rides in cities resumed faster, with the number of underground trips and traffic congestion rising
quickly once the lockdowns were eased (centre and right-hand panels). Only the congestion index reached
pre-pandemic levels by mid-May.

The sluggish restart of business operations could reflect the more stringent restrictions on long-distance
travel and the two-week self-isolation required of workers returning from other provinces. In addition, many
city dwellers might have worked from home and avoided unnecessary outings via mass transit, or may have
been told to take unpaid leave as many businesses have struggled to pay salaries. A survey by an online jobmatching agent has reported that, at the end of March, around 23% of some 8,200 enterprises stated they
had stopped paying their workers.
Production resumed with significant differences across sectors. Electricity production recovered first, with
daily total coal consumption by the large power generation plants reaching its pre-pandemic level in early
April (Graph I.E.2, first panel). The recovery was slower for firms heavily involved in the production of
intermediate goods. For example, the closures of many city construction sites in early February reduced the
demand for steel rebar – reinforcement steel used in concrete structures – leading to a sharp rise in inventory
levels (second panel). Despite the construction restart, inventories returned to the historical range only in
early June. Meanwhile, large firms appeared to be quicker than small and medium-sized enterprises in
resuming operations. At end-February, most provincial governments announced that large enterprises had
returned to 90% capacity. One possible reason is that many large companies had the financial muscle to

rate of steel blast furnaces, even medium-sized and small plants have picked up rapidly in recent weeks
(third panel).

Consumer demand continued to improve, albeit at a slow pace. Retail sales were about 8% lower than in
April the previous year, an improvement from the 16% drop recorded in March. Growth in sales of basic
necessities such as food and medicine held up well throughout the lockdown and that of office equipment
rebounded in March and April (Graph I.E.2, fourth panel). Sales of large-ticket items such as automobiles
contracted further in March, before rebounding to the previous year’s level in April.
In summary, the return to work in China has been slow. Three months after containment measures were
eased, mass transit was below its pre-crisis level. Production fared better, but inventory in some sectors
remained elevated. Personal consumption was the laggard, perhaps reflecting the fall in income resulting
from layoffs and pay cuts.

disproportionately on poorer economies and EMEs, given their weaker competitive
position and role in global value chains. In addition, lower labour mobility could
reduce remittances, an important source of external income for many middle- and
low-income economies. Positive global technological spillovers may suffer. If that
affects the transfer of digital technology to EMEs, this may leave some segments of
the population behind, worsening inequality and fuelling social discontent.
In a nutshell, the range of outcomes is quite wide. At one extreme, if the
pandemic is short-lived, its imprint will be significant but, with hindsight,
manageable. If the pandemic is prolonged, the post-crisis economic landscape
could look very different from today’s. Debt levels, especially for sovereigns, will be
much higher. The need to reallocate resources will be greater, and the degree of

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

31

globalisation possibly smaller. On the other hand, lockdowns could accelerate the
shift towards digitalisation and thus raise future productivity. In addition, investment
in green technologies could boost economic activity.38 The outlook for inflation is
similarly uncertain. In the near term, high unemployment will push down inflation,
but it is far from clear what will happen to inflation in the medium and long term.39
In all likelihood, as a natural consequence of dealing with insolvency problems and
of central banks’ increased footprint in the economy, the role of the state in the
economy will probably loom considerably larger. And so too might the policy
challenges, as discussed in Chapter II.

This difference could in part be related to the timing of the switch to expected loss provisioning. In
the United States, the switch took place in Q1 2020, while countries using IFRS had already
undertaken the switch in 2018. US banks also have to make provisions for expected losses during
the entire life of a loan right from the time of its origination, while in Europe they have to provision
only against 12-month expected losses. Only if there is a significant deterioration in credit quality
do they have to report lifetime expected losses. In response to the profound uncertainty introduced
by the Covid-19 crisis, the US CARES Act granted US banks temporary optional relief from
compliance with the new standard. The ECB adopted a similar stance.

Euro area banks’ exposures to mining and quarrying, which includes oil, amount to 0.5% of their
total lending. In the United States, the median large bank lent around 3% of its loan book to the
energy or oil sector, although a small number of banks had exposures of the order of 10% or more.

While the strong loan growth in March was driven primarily by the drawdown of credit lines by
non-financial corporations (as evidenced in the expansion in large domestic bank balance sheet

II. A monetary lifeline: central banks’ crisis response

Key takeaways
•

In the face of an unprecedented crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, central banks were again at
the forefront of the policy response. In concert with fiscal authorities, they took swift and forceful
action, tailored to the specific nature of the stress.

•

Central banks’ role as lenders of last resort has seen another important evolution. There has been a
marked shift towards providing funds to the non-bank private sector and, in emerging market
economies, towards interventions in domestic currency asset markets.

•

In the post-crisis period, much higher sovereign debt and heightened uncertainty about the overall
economic environment – particularly the inflation process – could further complicate the trade-offs
central banks face.

Faced with an unprecedented global sudden stop, central banks were again at the
forefront of the policy response. They moved swiftly and forcefully to prevent a
potential financial collapse from exacerbating the damage to the economy. They
stabilised the financial system, cushioned the adjustment for firms and households,
and restored confidence to the extent possible.
In contrast to the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007–09, the Covid-19 turmoil
was fundamentally a real shock generated by measures to address a public health
emergency. Banks and the financial sector more generally were not the source of
the initial disturbance. Rather, they became embroiled in the turmoil triggered by
the precipitous economic contraction. Central banks found themselves facing the
Herculean challenge of reconciling a real economy where the clock had stopped
with a financial sector where it kept ticking. With firms and households bearing the
brunt of the shock, much of the response sought to ease the financial strains they
faced while being tailored to countries’ specific circumstances.
This chapter examines central banks’ responses against the backdrop of an
evolving financial and economic landscape. It first outlines their salient features and
underlying objectives. It then highlights some key considerations that guided the
interventions, with specific reference to the historical role of central banks as
lenders of last resort. Finally, it looks ahead to the medium-term challenges central
banks may face in the post-pandemic world.

Central banks’ crisis management: a shifting state of play
The Covid-19 crisis brought to the fore once again central banks’ core role in crisis
management. As global economic and financial conditions deteriorated rapidly,
central banks formed a critical line of defence. The policy response was broadbased, tailored to the nature of the shock and to country-specific financial system
features. Preventing market dysfunction was critical to preserving the effectiveness
of the monetary transmission mechanism, maintaining financial stability and
supporting the flow of credit to firms and households. In aiming to fulfil this

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

37

objective, central banks deployed their full array of tools and acted in their capacity
as lenders of last resort – a function that has historically been at the core of their
remit. Importantly, the interventions were consistent with their mandates which,
notwithstanding cross-country differences in emphasis, are ultimately to pursue
lasting price and financial stability – necessary conditions for sustainable growth.
Apart from cutting interest rates swiftly and forcefully, down to the effective
lower bound in a number of countries, central banks deployed their balance sheets
extensively and on a very large scale. They injected vast amounts of liquidity into
the financial system and committed even larger sums through various facilities. For
instance, the Federal Reserve purchased over $1 trillion of government bonds in
the span of about four weeks. This was roughly equal to the total amount of
government bonds purchased under the large-scale asset purchase (LSAP)
programmes between November 2008 and June 2011 (Graph II.1, left-hand panel).
Similarly, the ECB launched a facility to buy up to €1.35 trillion of securities, or
around half of the total amount purchased under its Asset Purchase Programme
between 2014 and 2018. In a matter of weeks, the balance sheets of the central
banks of the major economies expanded substantially (centre panel), mostly
exceeding their increase during the GFC (right-hand panel).
Other central banks, in both advanced and emerging market economies
(EMEs), also implemented a broad range of measures targeting various market
segments. These actions went hand in hand with large-scale fiscal packages
designed to cushion the blow to the real economy (Chapter I). They were also
complemented by supervisory measures aimed at supporting banks’ ability and
willingness to lend. In addition, as stress in the offshore dollar markets became
particularly acute, the Federal Reserve extended its network of swap lines to as
many as 14 central banks.
The various measures had different proximate objectives. Some of them, such
as the initial interest rate cuts, had the more traditional aim of supporting demand
and offsetting tighter financial conditions. At the time of the cuts, markets by and

large continued to function well. But as the crisis deepened, the evaporation of
confidence caused major dislocations, forcing central banks to focus on stabilising
the financial sector and supporting credit flows to the private sector.
What does this task involve more precisely? And how has it evolved in the light
of changes in the structure of the financial system and the nature of the stress?
Answering these questions requires examining more closely central banks’ goals,
tools, proximate objectives and strategies in crisis management.

Objectives and crisis toolkit
The overriding goal in crisis management is twofold. First, it seeks to prevent longlasting damage to the economy by ensuring that the financial system continues to
function and that credit to households and firms continues to flow. Second, it aims
to restore confidence and shore up private expenditures. These goals require the
central bank to draw on its three main functions: as the authority responsible for
monetary policy, as lender of last resort and, where charged with such duties, as
bank regulator and supervisor.
The relationship between the monetary policy and lender of last resort
functions is complex and nuanced. The objectives of the two functions differ – the
former is focused on steering aggregate demand, the latter on stabilising the
financial system. At the same time, the instruments increasingly overlap. Pre-GFC,
central banks relied largely on adjustments to short-term interest rates to steer
aggregate demand, but since then they have relied much more on adjustments to
their balance sheet – the typical lender of last resort tool. Operations that offer
funding to banks at favourable rates conditional on their lending to firms and
households, for example, supply central bank liquidity to influence aggregate
demand. Moreover, the two objectives are intertwined. Central bank interventions
to restore market functioning stabilise the financial system, thereby establishing the
confidence needed to ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy. Thus, it
may be hard to draw a clear line between the two functions.
The tools at central banks’ disposal can be divided into four main categories.
The broadest tool and typically the first line of defence is short-term interest
rates. By influencing the cost of funds for the entire financial system, policy rates
have a wide reach. They also send a powerful signal, which can help shore up
confidence in times of stress. Notably, steering expectations of future interest rates
through forward guidance has become an increasingly important part of monetary
policy. While interest rate cuts in crises are common, they are far from universal,
given that shocks and institutions vary. In EMEs, in particular, stabilising the
exchange rate often requires raising interest rates to stem capital flight.
The second set of tools is lending to financial institutions. This includes
repurchase operations, which are the bread and butter of liquidity management
during normal times, as well as traditional standing facilities / discount windows,
which can also act as liquidity backstops for institutions in need. Moreover, targeted
lending operations can be tailored to support funding in specific market segments.
They can also involve foreign currency – for example, through foreign exchange
swaps – to alleviate currency-specific funding pressures.
The third set of tools is outright asset purchases (and sales). These operations
alter relative asset supplies in markets and influence the liquidity of specific market
segments. Thus, their impact on asset valuations can be more direct than that of
other tools.1 They also convey signals about the future course of policy and help
manage expectations, thereby reducing uncertainty. The assets involved range from
government bonds to private sector securities, such as commercial paper, corporate
bonds, equity and foreign exchange.

Finally, as regulatory and supervisory agencies, central banks may adjust
regulations that directly affect financial intermediaries and markets. These include
what are typically regarded as monetary policy tools, such as reserve requirements.
But, depending on central banks’ powers, they may also involve other tools, such as
capital and liquidity requirements and even capital flow management measures.
Whenever the central bank does not have control over these tools, they need to be
deployed in coordination with the relevant authorities.

Lender of last resort and the evolving financial landscape
Given the magnitude of the shock that triggered the current crisis, central banks
deployed their full arsenal of tools, sometimes in unprecedented ways. The specific
type of intervention varied with the nature of the stress and countries’ characteristics,
particularly the structure of the financial system and the conditions of its major
players. Table I.1 in Chapter I illustrates examples of the key measures implemented
in the major advanced economies (AEs) and a sample of EMEs.
The importance of the financial structure merits special attention. The lender
of last resort function has historically evolved in line with financial market
development. Traditionally, central bank emergency lending was synonymous with
credit provision to banks. As capital markets developed and the importance of
market-based finance increased, the reach of emergency lending broadened. In
modern financial systems, markets, like banks, may be subject to “runs” driven by
similar underlying forces. A sudden increase in market participants’ uncertainty
about asset valuations or counterparties’ financial strength can cause them to
disengage from markets. This can trigger a self-reinforcing spiral involving declines
in market and funding liquidity and heightened counterparty credit risk that can
lead to the breakdown of key financial markets.2
The GFC heralded a clear shift in the role of lender of last resort beyond banks.
During the GFC, central banks broke new ground with the scale and breadth of
their measures, particularly in terms of eligible counterparties and collateral. The
current crisis has taken this evolution further. A striking feature this time has been
the prevalence of interventions aimed at non-bank financial institutions, including
entities such as mutual funds. This is in line with the growing role of market-based
financing, particularly for the non-financial corporate sector (Graph II.2, left-hand
panel). As a result, central banks, particularly in AEs, have increasingly been acting
as market-makers or dealers of last resort.
This was evident early in the Covid-19 crisis in response to acute strains on
money market mutual funds. In a dynamic reminiscent of the GFC, a flight to safety
resulted in large-scale redemptions from prime money market funds in the United
States. Some $160 billion or approximately 15% of assets under management were
withdrawn in March alone (Graph II.2, right-hand panel). This had large knock-on
effects on crucial funding markets, particularly on that for commercial paper, where
prime money market funds are key investors. As a result, funding costs in these
markets soared and issuance dropped. The disruptions reverberated globally, given
that non-US firms and banks rely heavily on these markets, contributing to a global
shortage of US dollar liquidity (see below). The Federal Reserve reacted swiftly,
establishing a facility to backstop money market funds. This stemmed redemptions
and averted a wider market breakdown. In response to similar strains, the Bank of
Thailand and the Reserve Bank of India also introduced facilities to provide liquidity
to money market mutual funds through banks. Such backstops have proven
effective in shoring up confidence and easing tensions.
More broadly, central banks targeted a wide range of market segments through
outright asset purchases. Most notably, they undertook large-scale purchases of

government bonds, either by ramping up existing programmes or by establishing
new ones. The Federal Reserve was particularly forceful, committing to purchasing
unlimited amounts of US Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities, and
subsequently breaking new ground by buying municipal debt. The Bank of Japan
also committed to unlimited government bond purchases. The central banks of
several AEs and EMEs, including Australia, Canada, India and Korea, launched
programmes for the first time. The purchases helped stabilise bond markets despite
prospective sharp increases in issuance as governments fought the pandemic. In
the euro area, the announcement of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme
(PEPP) helped narrow sovereign bond spreads, just as the announcement of
Outright Monetary Transactions had back in 2012 (Graph II.3, left-hand panel).
Many central banks also bought private sector assets. All major AE central
banks established or expanded facilities to fund purchases of a wide range of
securities, including commercial paper, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities
and equity. The purchases were aimed at preserving market functioning in the face
of fire sales and at supporting the issuance of new securities. They thus channelled
funds directly to the non-bank private sector.
Strains in corporate bond markets loomed large. Amid a global flight to safety,
liquidity dried up and spreads spiked. Central bank interventions were a key
stabilising force. Cases in point include the announcements of the ECB’s PEPP, which
included purchases of corporate bonds, on 18 March and the Federal Reserve’s
primary and secondary market bond purchase programmes on 23 March. Both
immediately tightened spreads in the respective jurisdictions (Graph II.3, centre
panel), including on high-yield bonds, which were initially excluded. High-yield
spreads tightened further in the United States on 9 April, when some of those
bonds became eligible. Similarly, the Bank of England’s announcement that it had

significantly stepped up its purchases of corporate and government bonds on
19 March was instrumental in alleviating market strains amidst signs of dysfunction
(right-hand panel). Some EME central banks also stepped in to stabilise corporate
bond markets, reflecting their greater importance in local financial systems (see
below).
A striking example of how far a lender of last resort may need to go in more
market-based systems is the dislocation in the US Treasury market in March
(Box II.A). A confluence of two factors caused the turmoil: an abrupt de-risking by
highly leveraged players, who needed to unwind their long Treasury positions in
the face of large margin calls, and dealers’ limited capacity to absorb the securities,
given their already crowded inventories. As a result, the US Treasury market suffered
one of its most severe bouts of volatility ever. Avoiding serious dislocations in this
key market was paramount, given the critical role that government bonds play in
the financial system. The Federal Reserve responded with massive purchases of
Treasuries. The episode highlights how the financial condition of key market players
– in this case dealers with limited balance sheet capacity and highly leveraged
hedge funds – can influence the scope and focus of emergency operations.
This was also evident in the interbank market. One important difference
between this episode and the GFC is banks’ much stronger position, thanks to the
large capital and liquidity buffers built since then (Chapter I, Graph I.13). As a result,
counterparty credit risk among banks has not been a significant source of tension
on this occasion (Graph II.4, left-hand panel). By contrast, during the GFC, doubts
about banks’ creditworthiness generated severe strains in the interbank market and
the resulting interest rate volatility compromised central banks’ ability to maintain

policy rates close to their targets (centre panel). A major thrust of the interventions
during the GFC was thus to alleviate problems related to the distribution of reserves
among banks. Given banks’ stronger positions, as well as the abundance of excess
reserves, this was not an issue this time around (right-hand panel).

Reaching the last mile domestically …
Given the unique nature of the Covid-19 crisis, firms and households directly bore
the brunt of the fallout. Thus, an overarching objective of central banks’ response
was to channel funding to them for the length of the lockdowns, thereby covering
the “last mile”.3 Broadening the reach to encompass the non-financial private sector
represents yet another step in the evolution of the lender of last resort function.
Beyond the purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds mentioned
above, central banks relied heavily on targeted lending operations to banks at low
funding costs. The operations required that banks onlend the funds to firms. Almost
all the countries surveyed in Table I.1 in Chapter I took this step. China, Brazil,
Japan, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom all set up new
facilities, mostly targeted at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The ECB
and the Bank of Korea cut interest rates on pre-existing facilities. In addition, the
Federal Reserve established programmes to purchase loans originated by banks to
a broad spectrum of firms. The extent of this funding support for the non-bank
private sector was unprecedented.
Also prominent and unique to this episode were wide-ranging regulatory and
supervisory measures to avoid bank deleveraging, many taken by central banks
themselves. They took steps and made public statements that effectively eased
capital and other regulatory constraints and/or implied a more flexible supervisory

Dislocations in the US Treasury market

In March 2020, the US Treasury market suffered one of its most severe bouts of volatility. After an initial phase
of investor de-risking that saw the 10-year yield fall to historical lows, the market experienced a snapback in
yields and extreme turbulence. Long-dated Treasuries were hit especially hard, with the spread between
30-year yields and corresponding interest swap rates widening dramatically (Graph II.A, left-hand panel). The
spread between bond yields and interest rate swap rates can be an indicator of financial intermediaries’
balance sheet constraints, because holding bonds entails using up balance sheet space while swaps do not
(off-balance sheet). Hence, the widening of the spread between 30-year yields and corresponding interest
rate swap rates points to dealers’ limited balance sheet capacity and/or unwillingness to take on additional
positions in bonds. At the same time, large differences in yields between on-the-run and off-the-run bonds
signal a breakdown in arbitrage.
The severe dislocation in one of the world’s most liquid and important markets was startling. It reflected
a confluence of factors. A key driver was the rapid unwinding of so-called relative value trades, which involve
buying Treasury securities funded using leverage through repos while at the same time selling the
corresponding futures contract. Investors, typically hedge funds, employ such strategies to profit from
differences in the yield between cash Treasuries and the corresponding futures. Given that these price
discrepancies are typically small, relative value funds amplify the return (and, by extension, losses) using
leverage. One indication of the popularity of such trades was the growing short positions in futures held by
leveraged funds (Graph II.A, centre panel). As volatility picked up and margin calls surged, liquidity in futures
markets evaporated. Futures-implied yields dropped more rapidly than bond yields, causing mark-to-market
losses for relative value investors who had sold futures and bought bonds. To meet the margin calls, positions
were rapidly unwound, notably by selling bonds to cover their short positions in futures. This pushed the
prices of Treasuries lower (their yields higher), resulting in a “margin spiral”. The market turbulence then
spread more widely, including to the large class of hedge funds that follow rules-based investment strategies
(so-called systematic funds).

Under normal circumstances, dealers would be able to alleviate market stress by absorbing sales and
building up an inventory of securities. But dealers’ Treasuries inventories were already stretched, especially
from 2018 onwards, as dealers had to absorb a large amount of issuance as well as accommodate rundowns
of Treasuries holdings by the Federal Reserve as part of its balance sheet normalisation (Graph II.A, right-hand
panel). In addition, banks’ internal capital management practices – which tighten the leverage ratio constraint
on balance sheet-intensive business units – may have also reduced dealers’ demand for Treasuries.
Policy response
As a precursor to this episode, dislocations in the US repo market in September 2019 involved much the same
players, with dealer balance sheet constraints again being a contributing factor. Back then, repo demand
from hedge funds to maintain arbitrage trades between bonds and derivatives contributed to a repo funding
squeeze. With dealer banks holding already large US Treasury positions, reluctance to accommodate the
higher demand for repo funding compounded the shortage and led to a sharp spike in the secured overnight
financing rate (SOFR). The Federal Reserve had to step in to provide ample repo funding and absorb Treasury
collateral from the market.
This time around, to alleviate the severe market impairment, the Fed rapidly scaled up purchases of US
government bonds and agency mortgage-backed securities in mid-March. This was instrumental in freeing up
dealers’ balance sheets, helping to restore market functioning. The spread between Treasury yields and swap
rates narrowed substantially, as did the gap between on-the-run and off-the-run bonds, indicating more
willingness to arbitrage bond mispricing. Interestingly, the spread compression did not immediately follow
the announcement of stepped-up purchases on 15 March (shown as the vertical line in left-hand panel of
Graph II.A), but emerged progressively when Treasuries were actually purchased. This suggests that buying
Treasuries directly from dealers’ inventories was more effective in stabilising the market than seeking to induce
other players to do so, such as by providing liquidity via repo operations, where take-up was relatively subdued.
Subsequent measures were aimed at further alleviating strains in the Treasury market. One was the
temporary relaxation of the regulatory supplementary leverage ratio by excluding Treasuries and bank
deposits at the central bank from calculation of the capital charge. The other was the establishment of a repo
facility for foreign central banks (FIMA Repo Facility) by the Federal Reserve. The facility allows them to obtain
US dollar liquidity by posting their holdings of US Treasuries as collateral. The former relaxes banks’ balance
sheet constraints, while the latter reduces sales of Treasuries in the market, especially by EME central banks,
whose currencies were under pressure.

stance and interpretation of accounting standards.4 Authorities softened capital and
short-term liquidity regulations in most countries and encouraged banks to make
full use of existing buffers above regulatory minima. For instance, where previously
activated, they released the countercyclical capital buffers (Hong Kong SAR,
Switzerland and the United Kingdom). In a major move, the Federal Reserve
exempted bank holdings of Treasury securities and cash reserves from the
supplementary leverage ratio capital charge. Reserve requirements were also cut or
eliminated in many jurisdictions, particularly in EMEs.
A number of authorities complemented these measures with dividend
restrictions so as to bolster further banks’ capital resources. Banks have a natural
incentive to continue paying dividends, especially when price-to-book ratios
languish below one (Graph II.5, left-hand panel). This constellation signals that
investors value dividends more than retained earnings. Indeed, the evidence
indicates that lower price-to-book ratios go hand in hand with a higher probability
of dividend payments (centre panel).

However, these measures were not sufficient to sustain lending effectively. They
provided banks with the means to lend, but not with the corresponding incentive:
the darkening economic prospects naturally acted as a deterrent. That is why a
number of governments issued guarantees, sometimes covering up to 100% of the
loan (such as in Germany, Hong Kong and Switzerland).
Even in such conditions, lending may be hampered by low profitability, which
limits the ability to take risk and constrains capital accumulation. This is especially
so for European banks (Graph II.5, right-hand panel). Indeed, banks in general have
come under pressure on dimming prospects. They have had to raise loan loss
provisions sharply, and their long-term rating outlooks have deteriorated (Chapter I,
Graph I.14). Thus, in encouraging credit extension and the use of capital buffers,
authorities had to strike a balance between supporting bank lending in the short
term and ensuring that banks remained sufficiently well capitalised and liquid to
underpin the eventual economic rebound.
The centrality of banks in this crisis, despite the larger role played by markets,
reflects two financial system features. First, most financial systems are still bankcentric. In this sense, banks remain the main final node connecting finance to firms
and households (Graph II.2, left-hand panel). And they play this key role even in
more market-based financial systems, such as that of the United States, where small
businesses still rely on bank loans rather than corporate bonds. Second (and often
underappreciated), banks and capital markets are not simply different forms of
finance; they are joined at the hip. Banks rely on markets for their funding and as
an income source. Markets rely on banks in their capacity as market-makers and
arrangers of transactions, for funding and, above all, for backup credit facilities. As
such, banks and capital markets complement each other, especially in times of stress.5
Indeed, the current crisis has highlighted just how important recourse to bank
credit lines is. While financing in the form of such lines varies across countries, they

are ubiquitous. Based on a sample of 36,000 listed and large unlisted firms across
16 advanced and emerging market economies, undrawn credit lines amounted to
around 140% of debt service for the median firm at the end of 2019, with firms in
AEs generally having higher credit lines relative to EMEs (Graph II.6, left-hand
panel). As the commercial paper market froze, firms drew heavily on them, as
evidenced by the spike in commercial and industrial loans on US commercial banks’
balance sheets. These increased by nearly $700 billion or 30% during March
through May (right-hand panel). It is fair to say that banks are both the first and the
last mile. And in this crisis, it was banks, not capital markets, that played the role of
“spare tyre” in the financial system.6

… and extending the reach globally
For central banks with an international currency, the role of crisis manager cannot
stop at its country’s borders. The clearest illustration is the Federal Reserve, given
that the US dollar is the world’s dominant currency.
Over the past two decades, the use of the US dollar in global financial
transactions has ballooned. US dollar liabilities of non-US banks outside the United
States grew from about $3.5 trillion in 2000 to around $10.3 trillion by the end of
2019. For non-banks located outside the United States, they have grown even more
rapidly and now stand at roughly $12 trillion, almost double what they were a mere
decade ago (Graph II.7 left-hand panel). There is also a significant amount of offbalance sheet dollar borrowing via FX derivatives, primarily through FX swaps.
Funding pressures therefore tend to show up in these markets.
Against this backdrop, it is not uncommon for offshore US dollar markets to
come under stress in times of market turbulence. Many non-US financial institutions
and firms cannot draw on a US dollar deposit base or raise funds directly in US
money markets, and so are reliant on FX swaps. During the Covid-19 crisis, just as
during the GFC, global investors’ rapid de-risking led to a scramble for dollars,

which appreciated substantially. With bank funding under heavy pressure, possibly
compounded by tighter risk constraints from the dollar appreciation, the supply of
dollar funding dried up in many parts of the world. As a result, cross-currency basis
swaps – a barometer of the imbalance between demand and supply of dollar
funding – widened significantly (Graph II.7, centre panel).
In response, the Federal Reserve acted swiftly (Box II.B). To ease dollar funding
shortages in various jurisdictions, it utilised standing swap lines established during
the GFC with five major AE central banks and reopened them for another nine. The
amounts and maturities were also increased, and the pricing made more favourable.
On announcement, the swap lines had an immediate impact on the cross-currency
basis (Graph II.7, centre panel). The gap narrowed further as the swap lines were
utilised, particularly by the Bank of Japan and the ECB (right-hand panel).
Subsequently, in order to help a broader set of countries liquefy their FX reserves
and relieve selling pressure on US Treasuries, the Fed opened a repo facility. This
allowed central banks to borrow US dollars directly from the Federal Reserve using
their holdings of US Treasuries as collateral rather than having to do so in the
market, possibly in unfavourable market conditions, or to sell them. With the GFC
as precursor, the role of the Federal Reserve as a global lender of last resort has
been further cemented.

Market stress in US dollar funding markets and central bank swap lines

A significant portion of the international use of major reserve currencies, such as the US dollar, takes place
offshore. Dollar liabilities (ie loans and debt securities) on the balance sheets of banks and non-banks outside
the United States amounted to over $22 trillion at end-2019 (Graph II.7, left-hand panel). On top of this, offbalance sheet US dollar obligations incurred via derivatives such as FX swaps were even larger, with estimates
ranging up to $40 trillion. An FX swap allows an agent to obtain US dollars on a hedged basis, which is
functionally equivalent to collateralised borrowing.
A key barometer of US dollar funding conditions is the FX swap basis – the difference between the dollar
interest rate in the money market and the implied rate from the FX swap market. With frictionless arbitrage,
covered interest parity holds and the basis should be close to zero – otherwise almost riskless profits can be
reaped from borrowing in one market and lending in the other. A negative basis means that borrowing dollars
through FX swaps is more expensive than borrowing in the cash money market.
Since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007–09, the basis for key currencies has widened, driven by both
demand and supply factors. On the demand side, institutional investors (eg portfolio managers, insurance
companies and pension funds) outside the United States hold large dollar asset portfolios and use FX swaps
to partially hedge the currency risk. Their portfolios have grown substantially over the past decade, boosting
the demand for dollar borrowing via FX swaps. At the same time, the supply of hedging services from global
banks has fluctuated with the risk capacity of these intermediaries. Tighter risk management and the
associated balance sheet constraints have reduced banks’ ability to arbitrage the basis away. As a result, the
basis has become more variable and sensitive to fluctuations in demand for US dollar funding and banks’ risktaking capacity. The tensions escalate in times of stress, when demand for US dollars via FX swaps typically
increases and banks’ risk-taking capacity declines. As a result, obtaining US dollars through the FX swap
market becomes more expensive and the basis becomes negative.

Market dislocation and the policy response
As the Covid-19 pandemic intensified in March 2020, US dollar funding costs rose sharply, approaching levels
last seen during the GFC. In response, the Federal Reserve activated the standing swap lines established
during the GFC with five major central banks (Table II.B). Besides having no prespecified amount limits, the
interest rate charged was reduced to just 25 basis points over the US dollar overnight index swap (OIS) rate
and the duration extended to 84 days. On 19 March, the Federal Reserve re‑established temporary bilateral
swap lines with nine additional central banks. These swap lines, also set up during the GFC, had expired. The
amount available varied across jurisdictions. In addition, on 31 March the Federal Reserve put in place a
temporary repo facility that allowed central banks, including those without established swap lines, to obtain
dollar liquidity by pledging US Treasury and agency securities as collateral.
These policy measures assuaged market fears, and the basis for most currencies narrowed. Utilisation of
the swap lines was larger for the yen, the euro and sterling, though generally not smaller than during the GFC
(Table II.B). Correspondingly, the basis for these currencies narrowed significantly. This suggests that, in
addition to the announcements, the actual drawdowns helped ease market tensions. Indeed, countries that
did not utilise the swap lines heavily, such as Korea, still saw significant basis spreads.
 While FX swaps and forwards create debt-like obligations, they do not show up on the balance sheet, and are thus not
counted as debt. For an estimate of this “hidden dollar debt”, see C Borio, R McCauley and P McGuire, ”Foreign exchange
swaps: hidden debt, lurking vulnerability”, VoxEU, February 2020.     See C Borio, R McCauley, P McGuire and V Sushko,

with disruptions to global value chains and a collapse in export receipts, exacerbated
by plummeting commodity prices. The retrenchment in capital inflows, which
triggered large exchange rate depreciations and a sharp tightening of financial
conditions, further strengthened the raging winds (Graph II.8, left-hand panel).
Particularly affected were countries with high foreign currency debt, with substantial
participation of foreign institutional investors in local government bond markets
(see below) and exposed to large carry trades. Indeed, capital outflows dwarfed
those during previous stress episodes (centre panel). Spreads on local currency
bonds spiked alongside those on foreign currency bonds (right-hand panel). For
some countries, declines in remittances, reductions in foreign direct investment
inflows and reversals of carry trades compounded the problem (Chapter I).
A number of factors further constrained the policy response in EMEs. The sharp
fall in oil prices hit oil exporters especially hard and substantially reduced fiscal
revenues. Where oil production is concentrated in state-owned enterprises, such as
in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, the firms’ weaker financial condition increased
contingent government liabilities and raised the risk premium on government debt.
This led to a major contraction in fiscal space, precisely at a time when more fiscal
resources were needed to offset the pandemic’s damage. More generally, high
population density, under-funded public health systems and a sizeable informal
sector, mainly in the worst-hit parts of the economy such as small retail businesses,
restaurants and tourism, strained many EMEs’ capacity to cope and exacerbated the
economic hardship.
In this context, the prerogative was to cushion the fallout for the economy.
Central banks responded forcefully by promptly easing policy and taking a number
of extraordinary measures. In many cases, the response went far beyond that in
previous crises. This in part reflected the underlying nature of the shock, which
required alleviating strains on firms and households directly. But it also reflected
fundamental changes in economic and financial structures as well as in broader
policy frameworks over the past decades.

EME central banks’ room for policy manoeuvre during crises has typically been
narrower than that of AEs, due in large part to exchange rate effects. Cutting
interest rates tends to compound the exchange rate depreciation, which can
magnify currency mismatches, thereby reinforcing financial headwinds. Moreover,
for those countries with less anchored inflation expectations, the depreciation risks
raising inflation. Over the years, however, EMEs have implemented policies that
have earned them greater degrees of freedom. They have adopted flexible policy
frameworks combining inflation targeting with judicious exchange rate intervention,
and hence larger FX reserve buffers (Graph II.9, left-hand panel), as well as active
use of macroprudential tools.7 And they have developed local currency bond
markets. This has better anchored inflation expectations and broadened the range
of policy options. It has also bolstered policymakers’ ability to address threats to
financial stability and made it more feasible to cut interest rates swiftly in a crisis.
And yet, new pressure points have also emerged. The development of local
currency bond markets, in particular, went hand in hand with, and in some cases
relied on, higher participation of foreign investors (Graph II.9, centre panel). Partly
as a result, currency mismatches have shifted from the balance sheets of borrowers
to those of investors, who often invest on an unhedged basis. As currencies
depreciate, these investors typically incur exchange rate losses alongside those
caused by rising domestic currency yields, which tend to move in tandem. Given
the size of the exposures relative to domestic markets, stock adjustments in foreign
investors’ portfolios greatly intensify the interplay between yields and exchange
rates. This pattern was again visible during the latest turbulence.8 Countries with
higher shares of foreign ownership in local currency bond markets experienced
significantly larger increases in local currency bond spreads following the outbreak
of Covid-19 (right-hand panel).

Against this backdrop, EME central banks broke new ground in terms of
interventions in domestic currency bond markets in order to ensure their smooth
functioning. Many, including the central banks of India, Korea, the Philippines,
Poland, Turkey and South Africa, implemented government bond purchase
programmes for the first time. Others, such as those of Mexico and Brazil, undertook
Operation Twist-type transactions, absorbing duration from the market by buying
long-term securities and selling short-term ones. Preliminary evidence suggests
that the interventions were helpful: bond yields declined and exchange rates
stabilised (Box II.C). Some central banks also introduced measures to support
corporate bond markets. In Korea and Mexico, for example, they introduced
facilities to lend to financial institutions against corporate bond collateral. Similarly,
the Bank of Thailand established a corporate bond stabilisation fund to help firms
roll over short-term debt.
While this could herald a shift towards greater market-type interventions akin
to those of advanced economies, important limitations exist. Shallower markets
may constrain the scale of interventions. And weaker institutional settings and less
well anchored inflation may give rise to greater concerns about fiscal dominance.
This is all the more so given investors’ more limited tolerance for these economies’
underperformance. At the same time, the need for liquidity support in foreign
currency is still as important as ever, given that foreign currency debt – mostly in
US dollars – has continued to increase, and that the high participation of foreign
investors in domestic securities markets may destabilise exchange rates.
This again highlights the importance of an effective global safety net. There is
a general consensus that self-insurance through the accumulation of foreign
exchange reserves is sub-optimal. Similarly, there is only so much that individual

Central bank bond purchases in emerging market economies

Financial markets in EMEs were hit hard by the Covid-19 turmoil, with large currency depreciation and sharp
increases in local currency yields. In response, several EME central banks launched bond purchase programmes,
signalling their willingness to act as a buyer of last resort. The overriding objective was to maintain market
functioning and support liquidity in local currency bond markets. The design and size of the programmes
differ across countries. Most central banks focused on local currency sovereign bond markets. The central
banks of Hungary and Colombia also purchased mortgage bonds and bank bonds, respectively, while the
Central Bank of Chile bought only bank bonds. Few central banks have explicitly announced the size of their
programmes. Where they have done so, the scale is relatively modest, ranging from below 0.2% of GDP to
2.8%.
Initial market reactions suggest that the measures have been successful in improving bond market
conditions, pushing down yields and shoring up confidence, as reflected in stronger exchange rates. This is
evident in South Africa and India, where high-frequency data are available and the announcements did not
coincide with interest rate decisions (Graph II.C, first two panels). In South Africa, in the hour after the
announcement, 10-year yields fell by more than 150 basis points and exchange rates appreciated 1%. In India,
announcement effects on yields were smaller and exchange rates were largely unchanged. The differences in
market reactions between countries seem to reflect differences in initial conditions as well as the scope, scale
and communication of the bond purchase programmes.

The positive initial market reactions are confirmed by regression analysis using the full sample of
announcements across 13 EMEs (Graph II.C, last two panels). Controlling for domestic central bank interest
rate decisions and time period-specific effects (such as Federal Reserve and ECB policy actions), the analysis
suggests that on the day of the announcement 10-year yields fell by 10 basis points. The effect persists and
further builds in subsequent trading days, reaching a maximum of –25 basis points after six trading days.
Bilateral exchange rates against the US dollar appreciated on impact by 0.3% on average, but the effects are
not statistically significant at conventional levels and dissipate quickly.
These positive initial market reactions suggest that the programmes were successful in restoring investor
confidence and did not lead to higher inflation expectations. This was probably also due to the clearly defined

scope of the programmes, which explicitly aimed at restoring confidence in markets rather than at providing
monetary stimulus. And by serving to contain the rise in bond yields, the measures also provided useful
support to EME economies during the pandemic shock.

countries can do to limit exposures through capital flow management safeguards
without forgoing the benefits of participation in the global financial system.
A more complete and lasting solution calls for some form of international
coordination. One way is to pool reserves – for example, through regional or
bilateral swap lines. Many countries in Asia have progressively implemented such
schemes through the Chiang Mai Initiative. Regional pooling, however, is less
effective in the face of a global shock, when all countries are hit simultaneously.
Another, much discussed, avenue revolves around liquidity provision by
supranational institutions such as the IMF. But apart from the fact that access is
restricted to countries in good standing and potential problems of stigma, the
resources readily available are limited. In this crisis, the IMF has offered $100 billion
in emergency financing to a number of mostly developing countries, and could
potentially mobilise up to $1 trillion in total lending.9 By comparison, IMF estimates
suggest that financing needs of emerging market and developing countries could
reach $2.5 trillion.
Absent such comprehensive arrangements, liquidity backstops under the aegis
of the central bank issuing the international currency will continue to be the prime
safeguard. The Federal Reserve’s FX swap lines are not only critical but also
consistent with domestic interests. As issuer of the global currency, the United
States benefits from lower financing costs. And extending US dollar liquidity helps
forestall spillbacks from distress in foreign markets. That said, the swap lines are
limited in coverage. Until a lasting political and practical solution is found, EMEs
will have to continue to draw on a fragmented combination of mechanisms to meet
their liquidity needs.

The evolving crisis playbook
Central banks’ current crisis management response represents a further stage in the
evolution of a function that was born with the institution itself. The GFC considerably
advanced central banks’ ability to deal with systemic events both domestically and
globally.10 The present crisis has required central banks to go even further. This has
been due in large part to the nature of the shock, which has put the focus squarely
on alleviating strains for firms and households. The extension of the crisis playbook
points to a number of considerations regarding the interventions’ forcefulness,
boundaries and relationship with fiscal policy.

Vigorous, prompt and mandate-consistent interventions
The sheer scale and ferocity of the Covid-19 crisis meant that central banks were
fire-fighting on multiple fronts simultaneously. Experience has shown that in a
systemic crisis one cannot afford to fall behind the curve. Building on the longstanding principle laid down by Walter Bagehot of advancing liquidity “freely and
vigorously”, central banks did so especially forcefully.11

54

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

As this episode has amply confirmed, there is a premium on being prompt.
Early recognition of the nature and size of the problems combined with swift
intervention are critical to short-circuit adverse feedback dynamics and forestall
economic damage. In a highly interconnected financial system, strains in one
market segment can spill over into others, rapidly escalating into system-wide
stress. Moreover, the scale and forcefulness of the measures have an important
bearing on confidence. Gradualism cannot succeed. Central banks have learned
from the GFC that uncertainty about how central banks will respond to market
stress can increase volatility. For example, ambiguity about access to facilities or the
associated problem of stigma can hinder the take-up of liquidity and exacerbate
tensions. Both words and actions need to speak loudly.
A striking feature of this episode was indeed how quickly central banks sprang
into action. Many cut policy rates in emergency meetings and launched numerous
facilities in the space of days (Graph II.10). This was partly due to experience. In
many AEs, facilities set up during the GFC were still operational, so that central
banks could ramp them up quickly. In some cases, previously closed facilities were
reactivated. The premium on speed means that central banks will always be at the
core of crisis management in financial markets.
At the same time, given the financial system’s evolution, the forms of
intervention have evolved. As the system has become more complex, the pipes
through which the needed liquidity has to flow to reach all key market segments
have proliferated. Central banks must stand ready to adjust their operational
frameworks, extending liquidity to non-banks as well as banks, depending on
circumstances. Moreover, beyond acting as lender of last resort, central banks are
increasingly called upon to perform the role of dealer of last resort. They can do so
directly, by standing ready to buy securities to support market liquidity; and they
can do it indirectly, by freeing up financial institutions’ balance sheet capacity
through outright securities purchases, which facilitate re-engagement in the
market. In addition, they may have to supply foreign currency liquidity.

Importantly, maintaining longer-term credibility and legitimacy requires that
central banks take actions that are consistent with their mandates. All the
interventions need to be justifiable under the broad monetary policy or lender of
last resort remit. Staying within the remit also means limiting as far as possible
decisions that may appear to have unjustified distributional consequences, such as
when choosing to grant credit to specific firms or sectors. This was evident in the
broad-based nature of programmes with simple and objective eligibility criteria
based primarily on financial soundness.

Extending boundaries
Confronted with a crisis of unprecedented magnitude, central banks had to reassess
where to draw the boundaries of their assistance and what safeguards to adopt.
Central banks found themselves pushing hard against traditional demarcations of
their remit. In doing so, an important conditioning factor was the political economy
context shaped by the crisis.
The nature of the shock is key. In contrast to the GFC, in the Covid-19 episode
the financial sector was not the source of the problem as the shock was completely
exogenous and generalised. The former meant less recrimination about supporting
financial markets and institutions; the latter created political backing for direct
assistance to a broad range of participants. Backing was important, particularly in
encouraging the fiscal support that enabled central banks to take the necessary
actions. In the process, some previous red lines were crossed.
For many central banks, for example, a key boundary had been direct
interventions in corporate bond markets, which could be perceived as engaging in
credit allocation. Yet many did so in this crisis as part of a concerted policy effort to
cushion the blow to firms which, through no fault of their own, had experienced a
sudden liquidity squeeze. The rationale extended also to SMEs, where credit risk is
higher, as these were hit especially hard. More generally, supporting businesses,
and SMEs in particular, rather than large banks was politically less controversial, if
not positively encouraged. The Federal Reserve’s aptly named Main Street Lending
Program illustrates the importance of placing the interventions in the proper
context.
That said, extending reach entails reputational risks. To mitigate potential
criticisms of overreach and ensure accountability, the interventions went hand in
hand with a high degree of oversight and transparency. The amounts, terms and
governance of the operations were published promptly, and the link between
actions and goals was clearly articulated. Fees and haircuts on higher-risk securities
helped provide a degree of protection against potential losses. And through simple
eligibility criteria, judgmental selection of potential beneficiaries was minimised,
though at the expense of less targeted assistance.12
Once the immediate crisis passes and the dust settles, the balance of
considerations will shift. At that point, exit strategies and reconsideration of
potential moral hazard issues will become more prominent.
A key element of exit is to decouple the unwinding of emergency measures
from the monetary policy stance. This can be challenging given that the tools for
both functions overlap. Clear communication is required. The timeliness of exit is
also important. Liquidity support to markets, in particular, should aim to pass the
baton of system functioning back to market participants as soon as possible. Thus,
central banks have articulated exit strategies to the extent possible and emphasised
the temporary nature of the assistance. Some of the facilities involving short-term
lending or purchases of commercial paper will expire quickly. Many of the liquidity
facilities were also priced in such a way that they would no longer be attractive

56

once normal market functioning resumed. Nevertheless, exiting from the largescale asset purchases will be harder. Indeed, historically, reductions through sales
are rare.13  Economic, rather than purely technical, design considerations are key.
Although moral hazard has been less of an issue in this crisis given its
exogenous character, the current experience will inevitably shape expectations of
how policy will respond to future financial stress. The broad and forceful provision
of liquidity has stemmed market dysfunction, but it has also shored up asset prices
across a wide risk spectrum. This could affect the future market pricing of risk –
hence a premium on complementary policies. A key initiative would be an effective
extension of the regulatory perimeter to the non-bank, capital market segment,
such as asset management.14 Strains in this sector, notably runs on money market
funds, have played a first-order role in this crisis, as they already had during the GFC.

Well coordinated with fiscal authorities
The greater credit risk central banks took as they reached further in this crisis put
the spotlight on the quasi-fiscal nature of emergency liquidity assistance. At the
heart of the matter is the elusive distinction between illiquidity and insolvency
when judged in real time. The quality of the underlying collateral that central banks
acquire in their extension of liquidity can vary significantly and be hard to evaluate.
And sometimes it is precisely the acceptance of lower-quality collateral that enables
central banks to liquefy specific market segments and stem a panic. As collateral
transformation has become an integral part of the lender of last resort function,
exposure to credit risk has increased. Indeed, this is by construction if central banks
directly purchase private securities. Moreover, the longer the duration of the
liquidity support, the greater the risk, not least as illiquidity tends to morph into
insolvency as the crisis persists.
Mitigating credit risk for the central bank helps retain a demarcation between
monetary and fiscal measures. This is so even when the monetary measures are
taken in consultation with, and possibly with the direct support of, the fiscal
authorities.
In this crisis, fiscal backing took two forms. The first was through full or partial
indemnities, which provide central banks with an equity cushion to absorb losses.
For example, the Bank of England’s purchases of commercial paper through its
Covid Corporate Financing Facility benefit from full indemnity. The second
mechanism was through loan guarantees to borrowers. On that basis, for instance,
the Swiss National Bank was able to promptly supply funds to banks that pledged
the corresponding loans.
Insulating central banks from credit risk in a transparent and effective way
supports their operational independence. For one, it mitigates the risk to their
financial independence. In addition, it helps avoid the perception that central banks
are overstepping their mandate while also limiting political influence. In particular,
the arrangements typically specify the eligible assets, the parameters over which
consultation with the government is necessary, and reporting requirements. Even
so, given the enormous scale of the support, central banks are inevitably drawn
closer to credit and fiscal policy. A case in point is the $4 trillion or more in direct
lending to firms that may potentially be channelled through the Federal Reserve
should all the indemnity in the US stimulus package be utilised.15
Just as fiscal backing supports the lender of last resort function, so central bank
interventions can support fiscal policy during crises. In particular, measures to
restore orderly market functioning also facilitate government debt issuance.
Importantly, these measures are also consistent with the overarching monetary
policy objective of maintaining accommodative financial conditions.

Finally, once the acute illiquidity phase of the crisis passes, if more overt
solvency problems emerge, the onus of crisis management necessarily shifts from
central banks to fiscal authorities. Only the fiscal authorities can transfer real
resources outright, as opposed to just providing funding. And only they can,
ultimately, support or implement efficient debt restructuring programmes. This
crisis has already generated huge income losses for firms, while prospective losses
may mount. A surge in corporate defaults is on the cards. This would call for prompt
and orderly debt restructuring. Balance sheet clean-ups are critical in re-establishing
the conditions for a sustainable recovery. Indeed, history indicates that the way
financial crises are managed and resolved can deeply influence the length of the
slump as well as the speed and strength of the subsequent recovery.16

Looking ahead
The Covid-19 pandemic is a generation-defining event. Much like the GFC over a
decade ago, the legacy of this crisis will linger for a long time to come. It is difficult
to look ahead in the midst of a storm, but once the winds subside the task will be
to navigate in waters that are familiar in some respects, but potentially more
treacherous in others. For central banks, as the economy transits from the illiquidity
phase, possibly through the insolvency phase and finally to the recovery phase, the
overarching challenge will be to once again help re-establish the basis for
sustainable growth in the context of price and financial stability. This will be
particularly challenging given the pervasive uncertainty surrounding the path of
economic adjustment to the post-Covid world.
With the containment measures lifted in some locations, economic activity has
gradually resumed. But the climb back from the depths of the recession could be
protracted. Even if contagion waves do not re-emerge, lingering uncertainty may
well hold back expenditures and companies may continue to operate at less than
full capacity under social distancing rules. For many firms, the losses will never be
recouped and pre-existing business models will no longer be viable. To the extent
that liquidity problems morph into solvency ones, debt restructuring will absorb
precious fiscal space. Banks will incur losses. Depending on how large these turn
out to be, banks’ ability to support the recovery could be badly affected (Box II.D).
At some point, the supervisory stance would need to switch from encouraging the
use of buffers to replenishing them.
Against this backdrop, near-term inflation risks are skewed to the downside. In
the short run, deflationary pressures due to the sharp contraction in aggregate
demand will most likely prevail. This is already visible in inflation readings (Graph II.11,
left-hand panel). Given that containment and precautionary measures have affected
sectors unevenly, the dispersion of sectoral inflation has increased (centre panel).
Prices of sectors most severely hit by the lockdown – such as the automotive,
clothing and transportation sectors – have dropped, while those for goods whose
demand has risen – above all, food and beverages – have increased. At the same
time, the near-term inflation outlook has become markedly more uncertain, as
reflected in the much wider dispersion of inflation forecasts for 2021 (right-hand
panel). This probably largely reflects lingering uncertainty regarding the severity and
persistence of the economic contraction, including the risk of further infection waves.
Looking further out, uncertainty over the inflation process is likely to persist
due to both demand and supply factors. On the demand side, higher precautionary
saving to build buffers and repay debt could continue to dampen expenditures. On
the supply side, adjustments to production and work practices under social
distancing rules would push up costs. The impact could be particularly pronounced

How much additional lending could the release of bank capital buffers support?

Box II.D

Banks’ ability and willingness to lend to the real economy has taken centre stage during the Covid-19 crisis.
Whether banks can meet the demand for credit prudently hinges upon the size and usability of their capital
buffers. Before Covid-19, banks globally had around $5 trillion above their Pillar 1 requirements (about 45%
of their total capital). How much of this capital will be available to support new lending depends on the
extent to which banks’ capital is depleted by the crisis, as well as banks’ willingness to use the buffers. Both
are influenced by the degree of policy support.
To estimate the amount of remaining usable buffers, two scenarios are constructed based on historical
episodes of stress: one based on the savings and loan crisis in the United States (“adverse scenario”) and a
graver one similar to the GFC (“severely adverse scenario”). Banks’ average regulatory capital ratio (Common
Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets) would fall from the current 14% to 10.9% and 6.5% in the adverse and
severely adverse scenario, respectively, over three years (Graph II.D, left-hand panel).

Based on a sample of 5,600 banks at end-2019. 2 The horizontal line represents a CET1 capital ratio of 7% (Basel III minimum requirement
and CCoB). 3 The panel depicts the amount of total loans for three scenarios: the starting point (left-hand bar) is equal to the pre-crisis
level of loans (ie at end-2019) to which the projected increase in loans over three years is added (the stress horizon). This projection is based
on the pre-crisis trend growth in loans. The centre and right-hand bars represent the level of total loans that result from the adverse and
severely adverse stress scenario, respectively. In each scenario, credit grows more slowly than in the baseline scenario and banks write off
loans based on the trajectories in Hardy and Schmieder (2013). 4 The graph shows the amount of additional loans under the severely
adverse scenario that banks could issue as a percentage of total loans; results are aggregated at the country level. The graph compares three
cases: banks run down their CET1 ratios to 10% + SIB buffers (case 1); banks use all the capital released under case 1 for lending (case 2);
banks, in addition, receive a public guarantee on 20% of all additional loans (case 3).

Bank loans would fall commensurately (Graph II.D, centre panel). The starting point is loans outstanding
at end-2019 (brown bar) and projected loan growth over three years (green bar) based on pre‑crisis trend
growth in loans. Compared with this starting point, the amount of total loans would be $9.6 trillion (equivalent
to 11% of total loans at end-2019) lower for the adverse scenario (red bar) and $18.3 trillion (22%) lower for
the severely adverse scenario (purple bar).

To what extent could a release of remaining usable bank buffers counterbalance the decline in loans?
Three cases are considered for the severely adverse scenario, which appears more similar to the Covid-19
impact (Graph II.D, right-hand panel). Case 1 assumes that banks employ any remaining usable buffers to
expand their balance sheet until their capital ratio declines to 10%. It also assumes that systemically
important banks (SIBs), on top of that, maintain their SIB buffers. This case also assumes that each bank keeps
the ratio of customer loans to total assets constant, preserving the general structure of its balance sheet. Due
to the lack of usable buffers, additional lending amounts to a mere $1.1 trillion (1.3% of total outstanding
loans at end-2019).
Case 2 considers the same drawdown of usable buffers, but features a more targeted use of funds.
Specifically, all remaining usable buffers are deployed to fund loans rather than to expand other assets. This
case thus implies a stronger expansion in lending than case 1, with additional loans of roughly $2.1 trillion
(2.5% of total outstanding loans at end-2019).
Case 3 assesses the potential for additional lending that public support could initiate. The analysis
assumes that 20% of all additional loans benefit from a public guarantee (a conservative assumption given
that guarantees implemented so far have tended to be much higher), reducing the risk weight on this share of
the loan portfolio to zero. This increases the amount of lending that a given amount of capital can support.
Additional loans rise to $2.6 trillion (3.1% of total outstanding loans at end-2019).
Overall, the analysis suggests that – despite the build-up of capital over the past few years – usable
buffers alone might not be enough to sufficiently support lending in a crisis similar to the GFC; additional
policy support would be needed. In providing support, policy needs to strike a balance: on the one hand, it
needs to maintain the banking sector’s lending capacity; on the other, it needs to preserve the sector’s longterm strength, which often implies accelerating consolidation and balance sheet repair.

ratio is 6.5% in the severely adverse scenario, for many banks the ratio is still above 10%. For those banks, there is room to

in service sectors characterised by dense gatherings of customers, such as air travel,
restaurants and recreation activities. More fundamentally, the pandemic’s legacy
may partially reverse the structural influences that have acted to keep inflation low
over the last few decades. Prominent among these were globalisation and
technology, whose end result was to weaken the bargaining power of labour and
the pricing power of firms. A trend towards deglobalisation and reshoring of supply
chains, possibly reinforced by political developments, would boost prices by
increasing costs and lowering productivity. Above all, it would help restore bargaining
and pricing power, thereby facilitating inflation.
With downward pressures on inflation in all likelihood prevailing in the near
term, monetary policy will need to remain accommodative. And with fiscal space
more limited, pressure may grow for central banks to do more. Echoing the postGFC experience, some of the crisis measures enacted may be hard to reverse even
when the immediate emergency has passed. Central bank balance sheets, already
set to reach record levels in many countries, may expand further (Graph II.12, lefthand panel). For EME central banks, their foray into bond market interventions has
already given rise to discussions of possible implementation of quantitative easing
programmes.
A distinct feature of the new economic landscape will be much higher debt,
especially public sector debt (Chapter I). Apart from the large spike incurred to
fight the pandemic, debt may also rise further during the recovery, extending its
long-term trend. At the same time, central bank holdings of government debt,
already very large in major economies, would quite probably increase and remain
on central bank balance sheets for a long time (Graph II.12, right-hand panel).

In such an environment, central banks would be under pressure and face difficult
trade-offs. They would do well to adhere to the key principles that have guided them
through this crisis so far. Policies need to remain credibly focused on maintaining
macroeconomic stability. Actions should remain in line with policy mandates. The
goals and reasons for policy actions should be clearly articulated, linking all decisions
to the pursuit of the mandates within a coherent framework. Policy flexibility should
be retained, including through clear exit strategies consistent with the economic
environment. Finally, direct and overt deficit financing should be avoided.
Dealing with high public debt, in particular, requires a two-pronged approach.
First and foremost, governments need to safeguard fiscal sustainability. Even as low
interest rates relative to growth presently imply favourable debt dynamics, this
cannot be taken for granted, not least given that market perception of debt
sustainability can change abruptly. Governments must stand ready to take corrective
actions to ensure a path of primary fiscal balances consistent with fiscal
sustainability. Second, lifting and sustaining higher economic growth is paramount.
This puts the onus on growth-friendly fiscal policies as well as structural reforms.
Well chosen and implemented expenditures to facilitate the shift to renewable
energies would be particularly timely. And just as important, the growth-enhancing
effects of globalisation should be preserved.
Absent effective fiscal consolidation and growth-oriented structural reforms,
high debt burdens may generate pressure on monetary policy to keep interest rates
low. After all, higher inflation combined with financial repression has historically
served to reduce debt burdens.17 If so, normalising monetary policy would become
harder even if inflation rose.
A key risk is fiscal dominance. This pertains to situations where the stance of
monetary policy is subordinated to the government’s financing needs. The
underlying tension arises because monetary policy has fiscal consequences.
Monetary policy works by controlling the cost of borrowing in the economy,
invariably also affecting government financing costs. And that impact has grown as
central banks have deployed their balance sheets more extensively and moved

further out the maturity spectrum to control interest rates. As a result, the fine line
between monetary policy and government debt management has become blurred.
Discussions of monetary financing further erode the distinction between monetary
and fiscal policy (Box II.E).
One safeguard against fiscal dominance is strong governance. Over the years,
institutional frameworks have been geared towards keeping fiscal and monetary
policy separate, with central bank operational independence as a key pillar. This has
underpinned central banks’ credibility, allowing them to ease aggressively and de
facto lowering government financing costs without de-anchoring inflation
expectations. To be sure, in most jurisdictions, operational independence does not
imply goal independence. The government or legislature’s preferred balance
between price stability and other macroeconomic objectives may shift over time:
tolerance or even preference for higher inflation cannot be ruled out. But central
bank independence does provide an important safeguard within existing
arrangements, by raising the bar for any given change.
In this context, it will be important to recognise once again the limitations of
central banks’ actions. Monetary policy alone cannot be the engine of sustainable
growth.18 Pushing too hard and too long on the monetary pedal can generate
financial vulnerabilities and imbalances that eventually bite back. Likewise, largescale intervention in government debt markets can be sustained only if it promotes
central banks’ macroeconomic stabilisation objectives and if complemented by a
clear exit strategy. There are limits to how far the boundaries between fiscal and
monetary policies can be pushed without running the risk of undermining the
central bank’s credibility. Trust and confidence in central banks are arguably their
most important assets. It is precisely because of this hard-won trust and confidence
that central banks have been able to cross a number of previous red lines to restore
stability during this crisis. Preserving that confidence is essential.

Monetary financing: What is it (not)? And is it a step too far?

Box II.E

As central banks have undertaken extraordinary steps in response to the pandemic, and greatly expanded
their balance sheets as a result, discussions of monetary financing (MF) have regained prominence. Despite
the vivid imagery sometimes used to depict it – “helicopter money” – MF is an ambiguous concept. Its typical
characterisation involves a fiscal stimulus financed with central bank money. But what would this entail in
practice?
Powerful imagery aside, one can think of helicopter money or MF as consisting of two simple steps. The
first is crediting individual accounts with funds, just like the government does when paying out unemployment
benefits or tax rebates. The second, less well understood, step is allowing the additional money to swell banks’
deposits with the central bank (technically, boost “excess reserves”), which is where the money ends up.
The two steps are, in fact, quite familiar. Transfers are one of the largest components of government
spending. And many major central banks have operated with excess reserves for quite some time now. The
counterpart of the increase in excess reserves is typically the purchase of government debt, ie a quantitative
easing (QE) operation. Thus, MF can be thought of as the combination of a government transfer (the deficit)
and a QE operation of the same size. Correspondingly, the impact on government yields and economic
activity is similar to it. With respect to the QE component, it is well accepted that such operations can have a
significant impact on yields and financial conditions more generally through a number of channels, including
portfolio balance effects and signalling.
What, then, is special about MF? Relative to the way many central banks have been operating at least
since the Great Financial Crisis, the distinguishing element of MF is the explicit link to fiscal deficits and
governance. In other words, it regards communication, control (ie who decides the size, time and duration
of the operation) and, related to that, the objectives pursued.
On this basis, central banks have certainly not engaged in MF. In this crisis, central banks have
undertaken very large QE-type operations in the context of a huge and rapid ramping-up of government
borrowing needs. These actions have helped to keep sovereign bond markets liquid and functional, and have
supported the smooth financing of emergency fiscal spending. But importantly, the operations have been
fully in line with central banks’ primary objectives of safeguarding economic and financial stability, and have
not been taken with the purpose of financing fiscal deficits as such. It is just that, given the extreme
circumstances, the actions are naturally complementary to those of fiscal authorities. Moreover, central banks
retain full control, so that they can unwind the operations as economic circumstances require.
Through these aggressive measures, central banks have eased financial conditions and contained the
financial turmoil. That said, the measures do blur the traditional boundaries between monetary and fiscal
policies. As such, they need to be supported by strong institutional frameworks and are more feasible for
central banks in advanced economies with their high credibility stemming from a long track record of stabilityoriented policies. MF would push the boundaries between monetary and fiscal policies further, with greater
risks. While some proposals include safeguards in the form of strict activation clauses, clear specification of
operational control and well defined exit points, it is an open question whether these mechanisms, however
carefully designed, would survive the test of time. The underlying risk is that the monetary policy function
could become subordinated to short-term fiscal needs – so-called fiscal dominance. If so, the hard-won
credibility of monetary institutions would be undermined and, with it, central banks’ ability to deliver on their
macroeconomic stabilisation objectives.
 Some MF proposals envision that the financing of government spending takes place through a direct transfer of central
bank capital to the government – for example, by crediting the government’s account with money in return for nothing, or
by purchasing government bonds and immediately writing them off. In this case, the corresponding QE operation shows
up on central banks’ balance sheets as a reduction in capital rather than an increase in holdings of government
bonds.     From a legal perspective, MF is often associated with the manner in which the financing is done. For example,
in many jurisdictions central banks are prohibited from purchasing government bonds on the primary (as opposed to
secondary) market or from direct lending to the government. The reason is that such forms of financing potentially
subordinate central banks to fiscal authorities in specifying the terms and conditions of lending. Academic discussions of
MF have also emphasised the permanence of money creation, although this is unrealistic in practice; see C Borio, P Disyatat
and A Zabai, “Helicopter money: the illusion of a free lunch”, VoxEU, 24 May 2016.     See eg A Bailey, “Bank of England is
not doing ‘monetary financing’”, Financial Times, 5 April 2020; G Vlieghe, “Monetary policy and the Bank of England’s
balance sheet”, Bank of England, 23 April 2020; and C Wilkins, “Bridge to recovery: the Bank’s COVID-19 pandemic

of credits subject to support measures, postponement of the implementation of Basel III, and
flexible implementation of expected credit loss accounting.

advances should be made on all good banking securities, and as largely as the public ask for

For example, a criterion based on a single debt-to-earnings ratio (as applied to the Federal Reserve’s
Main Street Lending Program) may not sufficiently distinguish between firms with low and those
with high exposure since what constitutes reasonable leverage differs across types of businesses.
At the same time, the compensation, stock repurchase and capital distribution restrictions that
come with the assistance may discourage firms that are in relatively good shape from taking up
assistance, leaving the potential pool of borrowers skewed towards riskier businesses.

The CARES Act of 2020 earmarked $454 billion for the US Treasury to use for investments in

the Fed could potentially extend loans up to 10 times the amount of loss absorption granted. For
example, the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) and the Secondary Market Corporate
Credit Facility (SMCCF) together received Treasury backing of $75 billion, allowing purchases of up
to $750 billion. The Main Street Lending Program, on the other hand, utilises a slightly lower

III. Central banks and payments in the digital era

Key takeaways
•

Central banks play a pivotal role in maintaining the safety and integrity of the payment system. They
provide the solid foundation by acting as guardians of the stability of money and payments. The
pandemic and resulting strain on economic activity around the world have confirmed the importance
of central banks in payments.

•

Digital innovation is radically reshaping the provision of payment services. Central banks are
embracing this innovation. They promote interoperability, support competition and innovation, and
operate public infrastructures – all essential for easily accessible, low-cost and high-quality payment
services.

•

Central banks, as critical as ever in the digital era, can themselves innovate. In particular, central
bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can foster competition among private sector intermediaries, set high
standards for safety and risk management, and serve as a basis for sound innovation in payments.

Introduction
A vital function of the ﬁnancial sector is to provide efficient ways for households and
businesses to make and receive payments. A sound and well functioning payment
system facilitates economic activity and supports long-run economic growth.1
Payment systems today build upon a two-tier structure provided by the central
bank together with commercial banks. The central bank plays a pivotal role by
ensuring trust in money, a core public good for the economy at large, while the
private sector leads on innovation in serving the public. The central bank supplies
the ultimate safe medium to settle both wholesale and retail transactions, while
commercial banks supply the bulk of retail payment instruments.
Over the past few decades, payment systems have undergone a radical
transformation. New payment methods and interfaces have taken shape, and many
more innovations are under way.2 While these developments raise new challenges,
the core role of the central bank in payment systems remains. The private sector
can provide the innovation, ingenuity and creativity to serve customers better, but
history illustrates that private sector services thrive on a solid central bank
foundation. Whether promoting interoperability, setting standards or levelling the
competitive playing field, there are strong arguments for the public sector to play a
role. In fact, today the central banks’ role is as important as ever, if not more so.
Central banks are actively pursuing a range of policies to tackle existing
shortcomings. The objective is to ensure that households and businesses have
access to safe and efficient payment options. Central banks can choose to stand at
the cutting edge of innovation themselves, not least in their direct provision of
services to the public at large. One option at the frontier of policy opportunities is
the issuance of CBDCs, which could amount to a sea change. CBDCs could offer a
new, safe, trusted and widely accessible digital means of payment. But the impact
could go much further, as they could foster competition among private sector

intermediaries, set high standards for safety, and act as a catalyst for continued
innovation in payments, finance and commerce at large.
This chapter discusses the foundations of money and payment systems, payment
trends and policies. It concludes with a short discussion of the future of payments.

Money and payment systems: the foundation
While we use money every day, its theoretical definition can be elusive.3 Still, we all
recognise it when we see it. Money has taken different forms through the ages, but
one of its defining features has been serving as a medium of exchange, accepted as
payment for goods and services (Box III.A).4 In addition, money serves as a store of
value and a unit of account. This chapter focuses primarily on the medium of
exchange function, also called means of payment, and on the supporting system.5
A payment system is a set of instruments, procedures and rules for the transfer
of funds among participants.6 Payment systems are generally classified as either
retail or wholesale. A retail payment system handles a large volume of relatively
low-value payments, in such forms as credit transfers, direct debits, cheques, card
payments and e-money transactions. A wholesale payment system executes
transactions between financial institutions. These payments are typically large-value
and need to settle on a particular day and sometimes by a particular time.
As money has evolved through the centuries, so have the means of payment.
The pace of change is especially rapid today. Indeed, payments continue to be the
financial service most affected by shifts in demand, technology and new entrants.7
Despite improvements, households and businesses demand safer and ever faster
payments. They increasingly expect payments to be mobile-first, fully digital and
near instant, whether online or at the point of sale. Moreover, the current pandemic
could accelerate the shift to digital payments.
At the same time, some new entrants have tried to capitalise on the existing
shortcomings. Three such attempts stand out: the rise (and fall) of Bitcoin and its
cryptocurrency cousins;8 Facebook’s proposal to develop Libra – a private global
stablecoin arrangement;9 and the foray of big tech and fintech firms into financial
services.10 Some of these have failed to gain much traction; others are perceived as
a threat to jurisdictions’ monetary sovereignty; while many have yet to address a
host of regulatory and competition issues. Nevertheless, all have propelled payment
issues to the top of the policy agenda.
The foundation of a safe and efficient payment system is trust in money.11 In a
fiat money system, where money is not backed by a physical asset, such as gold,
trust ultimately depends on the general acceptance of pieces of paper that cannot
be redeemed in anything but themselves. General acceptance is what ultimately
makes them valuable, alongside confidence that payments made with them can
irrevocably extinguish obligations (“finality”). In countries around the world, central
banks have become the designated institution to pursue this public interest.12
In pursuit of this objective, the central bank issues two types of liabilities. One
is physical cash (banknotes and coins) for use by the general public, the most
common form of money over the centuries and across countries. Physical cash is
accepted (ie exchanged for goods and services) by virtue of a combination of its
legal tender status (which makes payments with physical cash final) and central
banks upholding their commitment to safeguard its value. The other type of liability
– commercial banks’ deposits with the central bank (ie reserves) – is for use in
wholesale transactions. Like cash, central bank money is safe and, with legal
support, underpins payment finality. Payments are further supported by central
bank credit – essential to oil the payments machine. What makes both forms of

68

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

money special is not just that they have no (or very low) credit risk but also that
they represent, by construction, the most liquid asset in the system.
History indicates that the most effective and efficient payment system is a twotier one. In it, banks compete with each other at the interface with ultimate users
while the central bank provides the foundation. Commercial banks offer accounts
to households and businesses which, in turn, have accounts with the central bank
to settle payments among themselves.13 In a two-tier system, maintaining
confidence in commercial bank money is essential. To do so, several institutional
mechanisms have been put in place, with the central bank playing pivotal roles.
Ultimately, commercial bank money derives its value from the promise of being
convertible into central bank money at par and on demand. In order to buttress
that promise, the central bank also acts as the ultimate source of liquidity (ie as
lender of last resort). Prudential regulation and supervision – often performed by
the central bank – limit the risk of banks’ failure while deposit insurance schemes
can help prevent runs and ensure that holders of transaction deposits are
reimbursed should a failure occur.
Payment systems are complex markets with multiple participant types. They
involve not only banks but also non-bank payment service providers (PSPs) offering
payment services to end users. Generally, banks and other PSPs offer consumerfacing or retail services at the “front end”. This can include providing so-called
“digital wallets” and mobile interfaces that give users access to their bank account
or store credit card details. Some banks and other PSPs play key roles in clearing,
settlement and processing at the “back end” (Box III.B).
This complexity has some similarity to a town market that brings together
different types of buyers and sellers. It may appear complex, but it can be an
efficient form of exchange once strong institutional backing is in place. Central
banks help organise the payments marketplace by playing the three key roles of
operator, catalyst and overseer (Box III.A).14 They can provide the critical institutional
infrastructure, set and oversee implementation of standards, and encourage the
provision of a high-quality range of services, thereby promoting innovation and
competition.
Central banks can also improve the services they supply directly to ultimate
users by staying at the technological frontier. To that end, a number of central
banks are considering issuance of CBDCs. CBDCs can serve both as a complementary
means of payment that addresses specific use cases and as a catalyst for continued
innovation in payments, finance and commerce.
Supporting the payments marketplace also requires preserving its safety and
integrity. Just as a sound and smooth functioning payment system underpins
economic growth, so can disruptions to a payment system cause major economic
damage. Economic activity can grind to a halt if payments do not function. And
compromised integrity can lead to a loss of confidence. Localised distress can
spread across domestic and international financial markets, extending the damage.
To maintain the safety and integrity of payment systems, the central bank must
mitigate various threats. A first threat is systemic risk, which can arise in an
interconnected payment system when the inability of a system participant to
perform as expected causes other participants to be unable to meet their
obligations when due; this can propagate credit or liquidity risks throughout the
system. Central banks have expended considerable effort in recent decades to
mitigate such risks.15 A second threat is fraud; wholesale payments, given that they
are large-value and complex, are a primary target. A third and related threat is
counterfeiting, which applies to cash, and possibly also to CBDCs. A fourth threat is
illicit financing and money laundering – the process of disguising the illegal origin
of criminal proceeds. In this general context, cyber threats have grown in

69

importance. More than ever, there is a broad range of entry points through which
to compromise a payment system. The international community has been actively
engaged in mitigating these and other threats, including through work conducted
in international organisations and standard-setting bodies.

Box III.A

The payment system, trust and central banks

Why do we pay? We pay because we are not trustworthy in the eyes of most. To quote John Moore and Nobu
Kiyotaki: evil is the root of all money. In this world, the payment system can be a force for good.
The payment system started with debt as people traded only with those they knew and trusted. Trade
with strangers required a method to substitute for a public record of reputation. Societies coordinated on
using physical objects, such as shells, gems or precious metals. It was agreed that the transfer of these objects
by one individual to another would forever extinguish the debt claim of that individual held by the other. In
technical terms, the payment was considered final. Finality is defined as the irrevocable and unconditional
transfer of an asset in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract. The exchange occurs at a legally
defined moment and cannot be reversed. Legal rules characterise the circumstances under which a payment
is final. Without it, one cannot trust that a transfer of (bank) funds necessarily constitutes a payment.
Once societies adopted a monetary convention, rulers quickly realised they could gain from controlling
the supply of money. Merchants trading coins knew the issuer, as rulers minted their profile on a side of each
coin. The value of this money was backed by the degree of trustworthiness of its issuer. However, absent
sound governance, rulers could not be trusted, and debasement was not uncommon.
Demands for sound governance and a more efficient payment system were often reasons to establish a
central bank. In many countries the public authority gave special issuing rights to an existing private bank.
The institution then acted as a banker to commercial banks. This two-tier system is the epitome of the current
account-based monetary system.
The central bank underpins the two-tier system in at least three key ways.
First, the central bank provides a medium of exchange (or means of payment) that also serves as the unit
of account. A common unit of account greatly simplifies the measurement of relative prices. As a result,
exchange of goods and services can be done more efficiently.
Second, the central bank provides the infrastructure that, together with a sound legal framework,
facilitates swift and final settlement of debt in central bank money. Central bank money plays a key role in
the final settlement of claims: in the case of cash, for many of the smallest transactions by consumers and
businesses; and in the case of bank reserves, for the settlement of large and time-critical interbank transactions,
which ultimately support all payments in the economy. Central bank money provides “ultimate settlement”
because claims on the central bank are typically free of the credit and liquidity risks associated with other
settlement assets. This is particularly relevant, as the finality of payments made with some digital assets relying
on decentralised validation protocols has been questioned.
Third, the central bank is the ultimate source of trust in the system. It provides trust through its role as an
operator of core infrastructures such as wholesale systems. Moreover, the central bank acts as a catalyst for
change and as an overseer, promoting safe and efficient payment arrangements.

The payment system deconstructed

Box III.B

A payment system is a set of instruments, procedures and rules among participating institutions, including
the operator of the system, used for the purposes of clearing and settling payment transactions. Its
infrastructure usually involves payments flowing through a “front end” that interacts with end users and a
number of “back end” arrangements that process, clear and settle payments (Graph III.B).

Payment infrastructure elements and arrangements

Graph III.B

PSP = payment service provider (ie banks and non-banks).
Source: Adapted from Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, "Cross-border retail payments", February 2018.

The front-end arrangements initiate the payment. They encompass the following elements:
•

Underlying transaction account (eg deposit transaction) represents the source of the funds.

•

Payment instrument (eg cash, cheque, card), which can vary across PSPs and use cases.

•

Service channel (eg bank branch, automated teller machine (ATM), point-of-sale (POS) terminal, payment
application) connects the payer/payee and PSP.
The back-end arrangements generally focus on specific stages of the payment chain:

•

Processing encompasses authentication, authorisation, fraud and compliance monitoring, fee calculation,
etc.

•

Clearing is the process of transmitting, reconciling and, in some cases, confirming transactions prior to
settlement.

•

Settlement is the process of transferring funds to discharge monetary obligations between parties.

Overlay systems provide front-end services by using existing infrastructure to process and settle
payments (eg ApplePay, Google Pay, PayPal). These systems link the front-end application to a user’s credit
card or bank account. Closed-loop systems (eg Alipay, M-Pesa, WeChat Pay) provide front-end to back-end
services, have back-end arrangements largely proprietary to their respective firms, and do not interact with or
depend much on the existing payment infrastructure.

nearly 90% of the total volume of payments (ie number of transactions), yet less
than 1% of the total value.16 Wholesale payment systems have seen frequent but
discrete updates (Box III.C). In retail payments, since 1950, many countries have
adopted electronic payments and seen the rapid growth of credit and debit cards,17
the introduction of automated teller machines (ATMs), the advent of web- and
mobile phone-based payments and, more recently, the entry of large non-bank
providers offering e‑payment services.18 Among retail payments, global values of
card and e-money payments have risen, while those of cash withdrawals and
cheques have declined. On aggregate, roughly 90–95% of cash withdrawals and
retail electronic payments are domestic.19 While all of these developments have
enhanced payment services, certain shortcomings are apparent.
Access to payment services has increased over time, yet is still far from
universal. Access to basic accounts has been rising, particularly in South Asia
(eg India), East Asia (eg China) and sub-Saharan Africa (Graph III.1, left-hand panel).
Yet more remains to be done to provide transaction services to all. Lacking a
transaction account, 1.7 billion adults globally, and hundreds of millions of firms,
are tied to cash as their only means of payment. Low-income individuals, women
and small businesses are still much more likely to lack access to formal payment
services.20 Even in advanced economies, some groups lack access to bank accounts
and the associated payment options; nearly half of Black and Hispanic US
households are unbanked or underbanked (centre panel). In the euro area, 10% of
low-income households are unbanked (right-hand panel). In some emerging market
and developing economies, fewer than half of firms have an account;21 lack of
access to formal payment services, eg to pay suppliers and employees and to
accept funds from customers, hinders firms’ access to other services such as credit.
Costs are relatively high in the retail segment and are influenced by the form
of payments and the degree of competition. Retail payments tend to be more

The evolution of wholesale payment systems

Box III.C

Most countries have multiple payment systems, each catering to distinct market segments. These systems can
be categorised along three key dimensions (Graph III.C, left-hand panel): payment type (wholesale or retail);
operator (central bank or private sector); and settlement mode (instant or deferred). Wholesale payment
systems (WPS) process large-value and time-critical payments. These payments are typically interbank, and
also involve other financial entities. Most WPS are operated by the central bank and settle payments on an
instant (“real-time”) basis. Given their importance, WPS are subject to global standards for financial market
infrastructures. WPS participants generally have accounts at the central bank and are subject to supervision
and oversight. In addition, whether privately or publicly owned/operated, WPS are overseen by central banks
and other agencies. This scrutiny underpins the safety, efficiency and finality of payments in all segments, thus
providing a public good. Compared with retail systems, WPS tend to settle fewer transactions, but much
larger values (Graph III.C, right-hand panel).

Features of retail and wholesale transactions

The grey shaded area in the left-hand panel represents instant wholesale payment systems.
Sources: Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, Red Book statistics, 2018, with input from Gottfried Leibbrandt; BIS elaboration.

WPS have evolved markedly since the start of the millennium. In addition to the move to real-time
settlement, the range of entities allowed to participate has expanded beyond banks to include financial
market infrastructures, payment service providers and, more recently, non-bank PSPs, fintechs and even big
techs. WPS have also lengthened their operating hours in response to user demand and the inception of
fast retail payment systems. In fact, some WPS already operate on (or near) a 24/7/365 basis (eg SPEI in
Mexico) and others are considering moving towards this benchmark.
WPS are likely to continue evolving. Technology will be a big part of both the drivers for change and the
solutions for WPS. For instance, the increased popularity of retail fast payments among consumers may force
WPS to further extend operating hours. Moving to new and more efficient technological solutions can help
WPS reduce their “downtime” for maintenance. The increased prominence of fintechs and big techs in
payments may change participants’ needs and expectations. Application programming interfaces (APIs, or
sets of definitions and protocols that allow different applications to communicate with each other) and cloud
computing services (which allow on-demand scalability) may help address these changing demands.
 Exceptions exist: eg in Canada and Hong Kong SAR, the WPS is not owned/operated by the central bank; and in the
United States, there are two WPS, Fedwire Funds and CHIPS, the latter being privately owned and operated.     See CPMIIOSCO (2012), which applies to systemically important WPS (in practice, a very wide group).     This refers to “direct”
participants of the WPS (CPMI Glossary). Direct participants can act as a gateway for other financial and non-financial
entities to access the services of the WPS.     See eg BIS, “Payment and settlement systems: trend and risk management”,
64th Annual Report, Chapter VIII, June 1994; and Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, “New developments in
large-value payment systems”, May 2005.     See A Carstens (2019b).

expensive for users, in aggregate, where credit cards dominate.22 Moreover, card
payments are a lucrative source of revenue for financial institutions and card
networks. Both features reflect the fact that these institutions use payments as a
competitive moat. Overall, the ratio of domestic payment revenues to GDP (a rough
proxy for costs) is higher where banks’ net interest margins are higher (Graph III.2,
left-hand panel), pointing to lack of competition. In Latin America, for example,
credit card fees amount to over 1% of GDP.23 This indicates the potential for
reducing costs without weighing on economic activity.
Processing costs differ across payment instruments. Cash, debit and credit
cards each involve different front-end costs, ie the costs incurred in processing
payment transactions at the counter.24 Cash also requires back office processing.
For debit and credit cards, nearly all of the processing costs are “merchant service
costs” – fees that the merchant pays to the bank issuing the cards, the bank acquiring
the card payment and the card network operators (Graph III.2, centre panel).
Indeed, card networks typically involve three or four parties to process
transactions, with various and sometimes opaque fees. These include interchange
fees among banks and licence fees to card networks.25 Even across cards, fees
vary considerably; premium cards come with additional perks for users –
particularly higher-income ones – paid for with an annual fee, but also with
higher costs for merchants (nearly double the costs of non-premium cards). Those
costs are not always transparent to end users; and even if they are, misaligned
incentives mean that the choices of payment method do not consider overall
system efficiency. Authorities have taken a range of actions to lower card fees.26

Still, costs tend to be higher for smaller firms (Graph III.2, right-hand panel) and for
lower-income users.
Payments across borders are not only typically slow and opaque, but also
especially costly.27 Lower-value payments, such as remittances, are the prime
example. Cash transfers are the most expensive, reflecting both handling costs and
lack of competition wherever cash is the only option. Costs vary also with the
number and type of firms involved. Most cross-border payments flow through a
network of correspondent banks. Remittances transferred this way are the most
expensive, at 10% of value, while those sent through money transfer operators
(MTOs)28 are nearly half of the cost, at 6% of value. Regions with fewer channels
through which to send remittances, such as Africa, face higher than average costs,
making the poorest regions the hardest hit.29
Finally, there is scope to improve the quality of payment services in terms of
convenience, transparency and speed. Despite greater demand for payments in real
time (or very close to it), methods such as cross-border bank transfers often take
days to clear and settle.30 Granted, domestically, many countries are implementing
new retail systems that offer nearly instant execution and continuous availability,
some even around the clock, but they are not universally available.31 Overall, the
quality of payment services still falls short of evolving customer expectations.
The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted both the progress achieved and the
remaining shortcomings in payments. The ability to use contactless payments in
physical stores and for online purchases has supported economic activity. Yet digital
payments are still not sufficiently convenient or accessible to all. Current efforts to
improve their adoption, including in order to allow government-to-person
payments to vulnerable groups, could enhance financial inclusion (Box III.D).

Industrial organisation: network effects in payments
The key to identifying the most promising policies to address the above
shortcomings and improve payments is to understand their industrial organisation.
Payments are conducted in complex markets that give rise to network effects and
interactions among system participants. These network effects and interactions can
influence the design of policies to encourage competition and innovation and help
shed light on the important role central banks can play.
Network effects arise when the value of using a network increases with the
participation of additional users.32 In the case of payment systems, these effects
arise because the more people use a particular payment network, the more
appealing it is for others to join. Digital platforms exhibit such a characteristic in a
particularly strong way.
Network effects can be a mixed blessing, however. While they naturally give
rise to a virtuous circle of economic gains, they can also heighten the risk of the
emergence of dominant firms, which destroy competition and generate costs to
society. The policy challenge is to secure the gains while avoiding the costs.
Payment systems are networks with participants that fall into two groups –
PSPs and users.33 The PSPs compete with each other, but this competition takes
place in the presence of complex interactions that bring subtle trade-offs. In this
context, the public provision of the core infrastructure can be important in
reconciling competing policy objectives. It can allow network effects to thrive while
promoting a competitive level playing field. The central bank performs such a
function by supplying the accounts on which payments settle. In this sense, the
central bank is instrumental in the provision of a key public good.
The underlying economics is best conveyed through the example of a town
market, like those found in the public squares of many cities (Graph III.3). These

Payments amid the Covid-19 pandemic

The Covid-19 pandemic has led to marked changes in retail payments, for at least four reasons. First, public
concerns about viral transmission from cash have risen. Scientific evidence suggests that risks are low
compared with other frequently touched objects. Yet consumers in many countries have stepped up their use
of contactless cards (Graph III.D, left-hand panel), and the pandemic could drive greater use of digital
payments. Second, as in past periods of uncertainty (eg the expected Y2K glitch in 2000 and the Great
Financial Crisis of 2007–09), precautionary holdings of cash have risen in some economies (centre panel) –
even as its use in daily transactions has fallen. Third, as physical stores temporarily closed, e-commerce activity
surged. Fourth, cross-border transactions have collapsed. As mobility dropped, cross-border credit card
transactions by Visa fell 19% in March 2020 relative to the same month in 2019, and remittances are projected
to fall by about 20% in 2020 as migrants face job loss and uncertainty.

The pandemic has highlighted both progress and shortcomings in payments. Digital payments have
allowed many economic activities (eg purchase of groceries and other essential goods) to continue online
during the pandemic. Yet due to unequal access, low-income and vulnerable groups face difficulties in paying
or receiving funds. Some central banks have warned that refusal by merchants to accept cash could place an
undue burden on those with limited payment options. To reach the unbanked, some government-to-person
(G2P) payments have relied on paper cheques, which take longer to process and may pose higher risks of
fraud than bank transfers. Elsewhere, authorities have used new digital payment options (Graph III.D, righthand panel). The crisis has amplified calls for greater access to digital payments by vulnerable groups and for
more inclusive, lower-cost payment services going forward.

Two-sided markets as an open marketplace

Graph III.3

The diagram illustrates an open marketplace with free entry and competition. The figures below the dashed line represent the buyers. The
stalls above the dashed line represent the sellers. There are strategic complementarities between sellers and buyers, where one side attracts
more of the other side (standard two-sided markets) and also between the sellers of different products and services.
Source: BIS elaboration.

markets offer sellers a public space in which to set up their stalls, and customers the
opportunity to explore and sample the wares of a range of sellers. Such a marketplace
is a network with positive externalities between sellers and buyers. The prospect of
more buyers visiting the market makes it more attractive for sellers, and vice versa.
These markets can generate spillover benefits between participants while at
the same time preserving competition. The stallholders who sell vegetables
compete with each other on the price and quality of produce. However, when there
are stallholders selling different goods, they will all directly benefit from the
induced arrival of new buyers. For instance, cheese merchants will attract buyers of
cheese, but these cheese buyers are also potential customers for the vegetable
sellers. In this way, sellers may actually benefit from the presence of other sellers,
ie there are so-called “strategic complementarities” between sellers. In this way,
when sellers offer differentiated goods, the entry of a seller offering new products
may generate benefits for the other sellers due to the new buyers attracted to the
market as a whole.
Moreover, town markets can benefit from a public infrastructure that helps
level the playing field. The town market in a public square can be seen as a publicly
provided platform where service suppliers and users can interact freely to reap
economic benefits. In order to achieve this, artificial barriers or other impediments
to the interactions of buyers and sellers are eliminated. Nevertheless, sellers will be
subject to minimum standards. Public authorities that operate the market also set
rules for operating hours, organisation of stands, price transparency, and food
quality and safety.
Payment systems are like town markets. The vegetable sellers and the cheese
sellers correspond to the PSPs, while the buyers correspond to the users of
payment services. These PSPs may offer differentiated products to customers by
bundling other digital services, such as e-commerce, ride hailing or messaging and
social media services, with basic payment functionality. In that case, since users
value these services differently, their bundling with payment functionality is
analogous to the contemporaneous presence of cheese and vegetable sellers in
the town market.

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

The network effects between PSPs and users in the payment system is apparent
from this analogy. A large potential user base attracts PSPs that wish to cater to the
users, while a rich selection of PSPs will attract more users. Just like the sellers in the
town market that sell the same good, PSPs that provide similar offerings will
compete on price and quality.
And just like town markets, payment systems may benefit from public
infrastructure. Here, central banks can provide the core foundation of payment
systems in ways to promote economic gains for users. One example is the
development in recent years of fast retail payments that settle on the central bank’s
balance sheet. As with the town market, such a system is a platform operated by the
central bank or a public utility. Like sellers in town markets, PSPs in such systems offer
a range of services to the public. Central banks set technical standards, operating
hours and other rules. They can endorse or require the use of common addressing
standards, open APIs for data sharing and other elements to ensure a competitive
level playing field as well as interoperability between PSPs. This allows the users of
one PSP to benefit from access to other users who are customers of another PSP.
We may contrast the town market with a full-service department store that
offers a similar range of products, but within the confines of the single store. Such a
department store can be compared to PSPs that offer the full range of differentiated
services, but exclude other PSPs’ offerings. When visiting one particular department
store, the buyer cannot purchase products from a rival one. Thus, even if the
department store (the PSP) offers a full range of goods, there is no guaranteed
interoperability with another PSP.
The analogy with full-service department stores in the payment context is firms
that harness the data-network-activities (DNA) loop to exclude competitors.34 In
this case, the nature of competition becomes one between platforms – “platform
competition” for short. Competition between firms with large, established digital
platforms characterised by scalability and a broad user base can tip in favour of a
dominant player or a small number of such dominant players who can achieve market
power in payments very quickly (Graph III.4, left-hand panel). As the platform and its

range of activities grow, the greater attraction of the platform fosters a DNA feedback
loop. As a result, competitors that lack interoperability with that platform will be at
a competitive disadvantage and will shrink. These types of markets are particularly
prone to “tipping”, when a single firm reaches a critical mass of users in its network,
threatening to dominate the market by attracting all (or most) users. And, once
dominant, they can entrench their position. They can do so for instance by using
their competitive advantage in data to cross-subsidise services and retain customers.
Big tech and fintech firms, whose core strategy centres on technological
innovation and personal data, represent a major competitive threat to incumbent
PSPs. Their digital platforms embody the traditional characteristics of networks
(ie network externalities, economies of scale and scope, large fixed costs of building
the network, and low marginal cost of adding new users) alongside additional
features (Graph III.4, right-hand panel). Firms with large digital platforms can
leverage their platform to aggregate large quantities of data to further target their
services; offer great diversity to users thanks to the cross-service nature of their
technology; and develop links between different activities as they exploit data – the
key input to their activities. Payment services become easy add-ons, given a broad
user base, across both services and borders, and no need for a physical presence
(ie bank branch offices). In such instances, and in order to preserve fair competition
and drive further efficiency in payments, central bank interventions may be needed.

Central bank policies to improve efficiency
The combination of traditional and new market failures calls for central bank policy
approaches that combine a number of roles. In their role as operator, many central
banks directly offer and run payment infrastructures. As catalyst, central banks can
support interoperability to foster competition. As overseer, central banks (and other
authorities) may develop and implement new policies and standards. Finally, central
banks could combine these elements to support the development and introduction
of CBDCs. In all cases, central banks need to ensure the safety and integrity of the
payment system.

As operator: providing public infrastructures
Central banks’ direct provision and operation of public infrastructures can promote
competition, reduce rents and support high standards of safety and risk
management. As an example, currently 55 jurisdictions offer fast (or near instant)
retail payments (Graph III.5, left-hand panel). Central banks run or play a key
operational role in many such systems, such as TARGET Instant Payment Settlement
(TIPS) in the euro area, the Faster Payment System (FPS) in Hong Kong SAR, Cobro
Digital (CoDi) in Mexico and PIX in Brazil. In India, the unified payments interface
(UPI) was set up with central bank guidance and support. New initiatives like the
open-source Mojaloop software may allow further progress while avoiding
dominance by a few players.35 The spread of fast retail payment systems is following
a similar trajectory to that of wholesale real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems
two decades ago.
As providers of public infrastructures, central banks leverage new technology
to improve and enhance payment systems. In the United States, the Federal Reserve
has announced FedNow, a proposal for a fast payment system that would deliver
real-time retail interbank services around the clock. The Bank of England is updating
its wholesale payment system with an eye to enabling digital interoperability,
eg with tokens.

These improvements are also designed to mitigate threats – both existing and
emerging – to the safety and security of payment systems. Events over the past
several years highlight how payment fraud is becoming increasingly sophisticated.
The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) has developed a
comprehensive strategy to reduce the risk of wholesale payment fraud related to
endpoint security.36 For retail payments, preventing payment fraud is a critical
element of consumer protection.
An additional component of the public infrastructure, closely related to core
payment systems in some jurisdictions, is digital identity (ID) systems. Such systems
can help improve access, cost and quality in payments, including by enhancing
financial inclusion. Government-provided digital ID systems, such as Aadhaar in
India, MyInfo in Singapore and e-identity in Estonia, have facilitated compliance
with anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
rules and reduced onboarding costs.37 In many instances, the central banks have
promoted the use of digital ID systems; in others, private sector initiatives have also
played a role.38
The combination of publicly provided digital ID and an open API payment
network is especially powerful. In India, such a combination has brought a large
share of the previously unbanked into the formal financial system and lowered the
costs of opening accounts.39 By mandating bank accounts to link to Aadhaar for
authentication, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has facilitated this progress. Account
ownership rose from roughly 10% to 80% over 2008–17 – a level comparable to
that of countries with much higher GDP per capita (Graph III.5, right-hand panel).
Central banks can also enhance competition by expanding participation of
non-bank PSPs in their systems. Historically, participation has primarily been
limited to banks, counterparties to a central bank’s open market operations and
government agencies. Over the past two decades, however, central banks have
significantly increased participation in settlement accounts in terms of both the
type of entity (beyond banks) and domicile (ie beyond domestic entities).40 Initially,

80

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

access was extended to financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and central
counterparties and subsequently, in some countries, to non-bank PSPs. More
recently, prospective providers of digital tokens and new forms of banks have
started to approach some central banks. In the United Kingdom, Switzerland,
Singapore, Hong Kong SAR and China, central banks have also granted access to
non-banks, albeit on a more limited scale than for banks.41 That said, such steps are
not universal. In some jurisdictions, notably the United States and Japan,
participation is still restricted to banks.
Ultimately, whether a jurisdiction decides to expand participation to non-bank
PSPs depends partly on inherited institutional, legal and economic factors that
differ across countries. Even so, with the emergence of new private sector payment
technologies, some jurisdictions may have scope to revisit this policy. The benefits
of enhanced eligibility include boosting competition. Costs include the introduction
of new risks, particularly if new players are subject to less stringent regulation than
banks. Broader access could also have consequences for monetary policy
implementation and lender of last resort policies.

As catalyst: promoting interoperability
Interoperability is the technical and regulatory compatibility that enables one
system to work seamlessly with others. It can help level the competitive playing
field, further enhance efficiency directly, and support entry and innovation. In our
town market analogy, interoperability corresponds to having an open market where
buyers can approach many different stallholders. It includes the adoption of the
food and safety standards that merchants observe when advertising and selling
their wares, and underpins transparent pricing. Similarly, payment system
interoperability allows participants in different systems to execute, clear and settle
payments or financial transactions across those systems.
True interoperability may not always occur without public intervention. Here,
the central bank has a critical catalytic role. By operating the core of the
infrastructure – the foundation – the central bank controls a vital part of the
payment chain and plays an important role in defining the standards for
interoperability. In a two-tier system, commercial banks process and communicate
with the underlying payment infrastructure that the central bank provides so as to
allow settlement on its balance sheet. In the presence of closed-loop, vertically
integrated systems, such as Alipay, the role of the central bank is still essential to
allow settlement between firms on a net basis.
A number of initiatives to improve interoperability in payments are under way.
Open banking is one important initiative, supported and encouraged in a number
of jurisdictions by the central bank. Open banking allows users to authorise financial
service providers to access their financial transaction data held at other providers,
using secure online channels and APIs. Its goal is to promote a level playing field
and reduce or eliminate closed, proprietary networks of individual service providers,
including for payments. While APIs have been around since the 1960s, they have
stepped into the mainstream and are now critical to promoting competition among
digital platforms. To facilitate access, APIs need to have common standards and be
open. In many jurisdictions, central banks and regulators have facilitated these
initiatives, eg by publishing open API standards and technical specifications.42
Making payment options expedient for consumers requires interoperability
between different payment instruments and arrangements. While some forms of
interoperability simply improve the user’s experience, others are essential. For
payment systems, interoperability can be vertical and/or horizontal. Vertical
interoperability, ie along the payment chain, is a technical necessity. By connecting

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

81

the front end to the back end – or core infrastructure – of the system, it allows the
parts of the chains offering different and complementary services to work together.
For person-to-person payments, for example, front-end processors (such as Zelle in
the United States) capture and authorise the payment from users. They then
communicate with the back-end processors, which in turn move the money from
the sender’s bank to the receiver’s bank, by connecting to the clearing and
settlement systems.43
Horizontal interoperability, on the other hand, allows competing PSPs to
interact in a way that is conducive to a competitive level playing field. By analogy
with the town square market, many types of sellers and buyers can all interact in
the common marketplace. Horizontal interoperability may exist at different points
along the payment chain. Front-end mechanisms that enable customers and
merchants to use different payment services are convenient. For example, one
interoperable point-of-sale interface is preferred over separate interfaces for each
brand of credit card. But interoperability across different back-end infrastructures is
necessary to enable smooth interoperation of payments across different platforms
and the seamless transfer of different settlement assets.
If a single platform captures a large market share at the front end, it has no
incentive to become horizontally interoperable. This presents an acute challenge in
the presence of digital platforms. While such platforms may have interoperability
within their system – for example, to offer additional services to their users – they
will tend to limit horizontal interoperability if the market for the specific service has
already tipped in their favour. Such platforms may offer (temporarily) low prices
(even below cost) in one business line to build up market share in another. They
may also seek to acquire competitors directly or partner with banks.44 Adding
payment services helps to retain customers in their “zone”, while bundling services
with payments attracts new customers. The recent spike in merger and acquisition
activity by large digital payment firms (Graph III.6), particularly large horizontal
acquisitions, ie acquiring competitors, suggests this possibility.
Domestically, markets and authorities continuously work to harmonise the
multiplicity of standards and procedures. For example, when ATM networks were
first developed in many countries, customers had to use their particular ATM
network, as other networks would not accept the cards. However, over time, and
due to competition as well as legal and regulatory actions, these networks became
better linked, offering more choice, lower prices and greater convenience.45
Payment systems and, more generally, FMIs around the world are becoming
more standardised. They are implementing a common industry standard (called
ISO 20022) for sending cross-border payment messages. Yet standards alone are
insufficient to achieve full interoperability; they call also for coordinated efforts to
minimise variability in implementation. For example, SWIFT, a global provider of
financial message services, has launched an industry programme to reduce
variability in the deployment of ISO 20022.
Across borders and payment systems, achieving interoperability is more
complex when it requires joining or linking separate infrastructures. While such
interlinking arrangements are not new, they are relatively rare and the volumes and
values processed by existing interoperable systems are often still very low (both in
absolute terms and relative to domestic systems).46
Interoperability initiatives are unlikely to develop spontaneously. The public
sector has a pivotal role as catalyst to support standardisation and open access.
Indeed, central banks (and other public sector authorities) are working to enhance
interoperability in a number of ways. In the United Kingdom and the European
Union, for example, the authorities have focused on developing standards on
uniform address formats and open APIs. These efforts allow consumers to “port”

their data from one provider to another. Globally, ensuring that safety and integrity
standards are common and robust and that measures are consistently implemented
is paramount. For example, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards for
combating money laundering and related threats to the integrity of financial
systems are recognised by and applied in nearly every country in the world.
Even with public sector intervention, making payment systems interoperable
poses considerable difficulties. This is especially the case when changes are required
to legacy IT systems, either in infrastructures or at individual institutions. Differences
in the development and implementation of API standards across borders have also
created complications. As with implementation of new standards, a number of legal
and regulatory issues need to be resolved, including with regard to customer
consent to share data and liability if a consumer is harmed by misuse of data.
Across borders, differences in the development and implementation of APIs are
particularly challenging and could hinder efforts to achieve interoperability.47
The G20 has made enhancing cross-border payments a priority in 2020 and
has asked the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in coordination with the CPMI to lead
the work to address cross-border payment frictions. The identified frictions include
fragmented and truncated data formats, complex processing of compliance checks,
limited operating hours, legacy technology platforms, long transaction chains,
funding costs and weak competition. Potential solutions to alleviate these frictions
focus on areas such as public and private sector commitment; regulatory, supervisory
and oversight frameworks; data and market practices; as well as improvements to
existing and new payment infrastructures and payment arrangements.48

As overseer: guiding and regulating
History shows that legislation and regulation can promote innovation by altering
incentives for the private sector and by influencing market structure. Central banks

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

83

have often played a role in advising on, writing or implementing such rules. That
said, lessons from other network industries indicate that market dominance is
not easily remedied and requires continuous policy interventions. The US
telecommunications industry presents an instructive example.49 In the 1980s, US
anti-trust authorities required the monopoly player (AT&T) to divest its local
subsidiaries. As anti-competitive issues persisted, the public sector passed
legislation to promote competition at all service levels. While the emergence of
new communication channels, such as internet and mobile phone service, boosted
competition, this alone was insufficient to promote robust competition in internet
services. It took additional legislation about a decade later to foster it.
Policy can enhance efficiency and reduce costs. For example, the US Check 21
Act – a federal law effective in 2004, designed by the Federal Reserve – made
cheque images legal tender, enabling banks to process cheques in a manner similar
to debit cards. By doing away with the physical transportation of cheques, it made
processing faster, cheaper and more efficient. Another example is the introduction
of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) for euro credit transfers and direct debits.50
Under EU regulations, formulated with input from the ECB and national central
banks, such payments and transfers between bank accounts in two different SEPA
countries were to be priced equal to a regular, local transfer. As a result, the average
cost of transfers in the zone declined substantially (Graph III.7, left-hand panel). A
third example is use of caps on interchange fees. In the United States, fees on
covered (regulated) debit card transactions fell dramatically after regulations took
effect in 2011, while those on exempt cards remained stubbornly high, even after
nearly 10 years (right-hand panel). More generally, across countries where
authorities have introduced caps on credit and debit card fees, costs are lower than
elsewhere for any given degree of competition (Graph III.8).51

Digital platforms raise challenges for traditional anti-trust or market power
analysis. Today, the price structure of platforms does not conform to textbook
models of monopoly pricing (eg when they offer “free” services in exchange for the
provision of data). Likewise, even where prices for retail customers are declining,
lack of competition may be slowing innovation.52 Thus, there is a need to reassess
regulatory approaches, including by looking across platforms globally and
enhancing cooperation among central banks and other authorities.

Ensuring safety and integrity
Any policy action must take into consideration the safety and integrity of the
payment system. This relies heavily on work conducted by multiple authorities.
Legal, professional and ethical standards are key. Compliance with anti-money
laundering standards is critical for integrity. Digital ID, electronic know-yourcustomer (KYC) systems and a variety of regtech and suptech applications have
reduced the costs of ensuring AML/CFT compliance.53 That said, diligence is needed
to ensure that compliance remains strong.
Cyber security is another priority. As perpetrators become increasingly
sophisticated, the risks that cyber threats pose to financial stability are escalating.54
In this context, the level of cyber resilience, which contributes to payment systems’
operational resilience, can be a decisive factor in the overall resilience of the
financial system and the broader economy. The CPMI and the International
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have published detailed guidance

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

85

on cyber resilience for financial market infrastructures, and the FSB has developed
effective practices for cyber incident response and recovery.55
Innovation is introducing new issues in consumer protection – that is, in
preventing unfair, deceptive and fraudulent business practices. New payment
products may have hidden costs, and faster or more convenient services may also
speed up theft.56 Public authorities regularly cooperate to see that consumers know
their rights and how to respond when they may have been abused.57
Alongside these innovations come calls for adjustment to data privacy regulation.
New technologies make greater use of personal (payments) data. But for good
reason, such data are often well protected with privacy rules, which in turn influence
access, cost and quality.58 The balance between efficiency and privacy goals will vary
across jurisdictions. Some consumers attach a high premium to their data privacy.
Others are more willing to share data if this improves financial services (Graph III.9,
left-hand panel).59 The use of personal data in the current pandemic, including for
contact tracing, may change views towards privacy.60 Regardless, policy interventions
should help safeguard consumers’ desire for privacy without unnecessarily increasing
costs and making institutions less willing to serve financially excluded populations.
At the same time, digital innovation can also support broader policy goals. For
instance, greater use of digital payments goes hand in hand with a smaller informal
economy (Graph III.9, right-hand panel). Creating a digital record of payments can
allow businesses and individuals to build up a transaction data history to access
credit and other financial services. In addition, it can make tax collection, law
enforcement and social protection more effective, as well as expand the coverage
of supervision and regulation of financial services.
To achieve their policy objectives, central banks will need to cooperate with
other bodies. Securities regulators, competition authorities, financial intelligence

units and consumer and data protection authorities also have regulatory interests
in and influence on various aspects of payment services. Addressing the various
policy objectives requires striking a delicate balance, as well as cooperation and
coordination. Arrangements between these agencies to exchange views and
collaborate on relevant issues are key.

CBDC: designing safe and open payments for the digital economy
CBDCs are a prime example of how central banks can stand at the cutting edge of
innovation themselves. Technology – in particular, in the field of digital currency –
opens up opportunities for payment systems. CBDCs combine this innovative
technology with the tried and trusted foundation of the central bank. It is central
banks’ choice to harness these forces for the common good. They can combine
their role as catalyst, overseer and operator, and develop an entirely new set of
payment arrangements that run on digital currencies.
CBDCs have the potential to be the next step in the evolution of money, but a
thoughtful approach is warranted. CBDC issuance is not so much a reaction to
cryptocurrencies and private sector “stablecoin” proposals, but rather a focused
technological effort by central banks to pursue several public policy objectives at
once. These objectives include financial inclusion; guaranteeing safety and integrity
in digital payments; establishing resilient, fast and inexpensive payments; and
encouraging continued innovation in payments.
Wholesale digital money is not new – the financial sector has had direct access
to such central bank money for decades. However, a wholesale CBDC, if well
designed, has the potential to increase efficiency. For example, “programmability”
could enable the automatic and near instant delivery of a traded security once a
payment is received and verified. In this way, a wholesale CBDC can enhance
safety and speed and potentially simplify the post-trade clearing and settlement
cycle.61 A wholesale CBDC could also help mitigate the risk of fraud and cyber
attacks; in particular, its technology could improve the irrevocability of digital
record-keeping.
The implications of a retail CBDC would be more far-reaching. Such an
innovation would provide general users with direct access to central bank money,
and potentially offer a safe, reliable and universally accessible settlement instrument
– just as cash does now. The benefits would have to be carefully weighed against
the implications for the functioning of the financial system, such as the risk of
disintermediation, including accelerating bank runs at times of stress, and a
potentially larger central bank footprint in the financial system.62 The monetary
policy implications would also warrant attention. In contrast to cash, retail CBDCs
could be interest-bearing, influencing monetary policy transmission, including by
reducing the effective lower bound on nominal policy rates.
Over the last several years, central banks and policymakers have become more
favourably disposed towards issuance of wholesale and retail CBDCs.63 They have
featured more positively in central bank communications since late 2019 (Graph
III.10, left-hand panel). The motivations for retail CBDCs are numerous and vary
across jurisdictions. A 2019 survey of 66 central banks revealed that safety and
efficiency of domestic payments are most important, while inclusion is a key motive
among emerging market and developing economies (right-hand panel).64 Recently,
the need to address the declining use of cash has received increasing attention. As
consumers migrate to electronic payments, for online transactions as well as inperson purchases, cash usage is declining precipitously in some jurisdictions.65 The
Covid-19 crisis, and the attendant rise of electronic payments, are likely to boost
CBDC development across the globe (Box III.D).

January 2020.

Technically, a successful retail CBDC would need to provide a resilient and
inclusive digital complement to physical cash. As such, a CBDC must have all the
features and more that make cash so attractive. The basic elements are trust in the
issuing entity, legal tender status, guaranteed real-time finality and wide availability.
But a CBDC must also be equivalent to cash in other dimensions. First, CBDCs need
to be user-friendly. Schoolchildren, seniors, and every age group in between handle
banknotes and coins with ease; some central banks have even designed features to
make banknotes accessible for the blind.66 Second, CBDCs must be highly resilient
to infrastructure outages and cyber attacks. Such events could wreak havoc if there
was a disruption to electronic payments and cash was no longer generally used.
Third, CBDCs need to guarantee the safety and integrity of payments. Just like cash,
they need to be counterfeit-proof. And just like other digital means of payment,
they need to safeguard the user’s privacy while allowing for effective law
enforcement. There are opportunities with CBDCs to improve tracing and
potentially improve anti-money laundering compliance. But societies’ preference
may differ regarding how to balance better tracing with privacy protection.
More generally, CBDCs can coexist with both cash and current electronic
payment options. They could be made fully consistent with the two-tiered payment
system, allowing the public and private sectors to focus on their respective
comparative advantages. Central banks can focus on ensuring trust, stability and
integrity in payments. For their part, the private sector is best placed to undertake
the consumer-facing activity of CBDCs. Designs would need to mitigate the risk of
funds flowing out of banks and into the CBDC, in particular in times of stress. One
possibility that is worth exploring is remunerating CBDC holdings at a lower interest
rate than the rate paid on commercial bank reserves at the central bank.67

88

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

Alternatively, central banks could restrict the amount of CBDC that households and
businesses can hold, eg through caps.68
A substantial role for the private sector raises the need to guarantee compliance
with regulatory standards, ensure open competition and allow innovation to
flourish. The central bank may grant private sector intermediaries the privilege to
distribute CBDC to retail clients, but new entrants and new technologies will be
subject to existing regulatory standards. A level playing field is necessary for the
sake of incumbents, but also for newcomers. And the technical design and
accompanying legal framework should ensure open competition among the various
private sector intermediaries, including by avoiding the creation of closed-loop
payment systems or introducing frictions when consumers want to switch providers.
Guaranteeing open competition also pertains to the collection, use and sharing of
data. In particular, starting with a clean slate, the CBDC design should find a new
balance between allowing for data portability, safeguarding privacy and mitigating
the risks of money laundering and illicit financing.
Ensuring that the retail CBDC allows for ongoing competition requires not only
open competition, but also that the central bank operate an infrastructure that
fosters innovation. This calls for a flexible and adaptable central bank-operated
infrastructure. PSPs must be able to access the CBDC via multiple channels,
including back-end interfaces and APIs. A level playing field in terms of access
combined with adaptability should foster private sector innovation.
If the CBDC design succeeds in taking these various considerations into
account, central banks could harness technological progress in the field of digital
currencies and offer a stable and trusted digital unit of account, with guaranteed
finality of payments. In this way, CBDCs could become a complementary means of
payment that addresses both specific use cases and market failures as well as a
catalyst for continued innovation in payments, finance and commerce at large.
That said, research on CBDCs is still in its early stages, and development efforts
will take some time. Given their transformative nature, central banks are carefully
considering all design options and determining which ones are the best fit for the
specific circumstances of each jurisdiction. As insights advance, the exchange of
information among central banks is critical. Through tight cooperation, central
banks can benefit from peer learning and develop common approaches.
The BIS is closely supporting central banks in their CBDC research and design
efforts (Box III.E). The institution is part of an international group of central banks
assessing the potential case for CBDC issuance. The BIS Innovation Hub is
developing a wholesale CBDC, which will allow for new forms of tokenised trading
and settlements.69 The BIS-based CPMI surveys global CBDC research and
development efforts on an annual basis.70 In its analytical publications, the BIS
continues to shed light on the underlying economic and technological design
challenges.

Conclusion
Central banks provide the solid foundation for payment systems, underpinning
trust in money while supporting private sector innovation. Over centuries, in their
roles as operator, catalyst and overseer, central banks have encouraged the private
sector to provide payments that are safe, efficient and widely accessible. The
innovations in money and payments that central bank have spurred have promoted
increasingly efficient and convenient payments.
While the fundamental roles of central banks in payment systems will endure,
payments will continue to evolve. Today, the digitalisation of the economy and

BIS Annual Economic Report 2020

89

greater access to communication have hastened the replacement of cheques and
cash with card and mobile payments. In many parts of the world, cash will continue
to decline as a means of payment. Many technologies aim to improve payment
access and security, including the use of biometrics. If anything, the demand for
faster, more convenient and safer payments is likely to accelerate with the Covid-19
crisis.
Rapid technological progress presents central banks and other authorities with
both options and challenges regarding how best to enhance efficiency and adapt
payment systems. Across policy options, some general principles apply. First,
competition and innovation, notably supported by interoperability, best encourage
progress on access, cost and quality. When properly channelled, they can also
improve safety. Second, to be successful, private sector innovation should be
guided by the public sector with a view to improving efficiency and ensuring safety,
integrity and trust. Third, cooperation between the public and private sectors,
domestically and internationally, is paramount.
While authorities will foremost need to support competitive private sector
markets that harness new digital technologies, new public payment instruments
may gain traction. Central banks too can naturally play a key role. In particular,
CBDCs, if properly designed, have the potential to give rise to a new payment
mechanism that is interoperable by default, fosters competition among private
sector intermediaries, and sets high standards for safety and risk management.
The current crisis may accelerate changes in payments – yet it also harbours
new risks. Even though the pandemic has underscored the interdependence of
countries, policy responses have been primarily national. As authorities have limited
cross-border movement and implemented social distancing measures, international
economic activity has come to an abrupt halt. Going forward, enhancing
coordination and taking steps to prevent or reduce fragmentation in cross-border
payment systems are public sector priorities. This is particularly important given
that issues of competition policy and data privacy have so far been addressed
primarily at the national level and in the light of the rising tide of economic
nationalism.71
Here, too, central banks can be a force promoting international policy
coordination, supporting not just domestic payment systems but, above all, their
cross-border integration. In international committees such as the FSB and the CPMI,
central banks can benefit from peer learning and develop common approaches. In
international forums like the G20, central banks and governments can agree on
mutually beneficial stances on payment policy. International coordination ensures
that advancements in payments support greater efficiency and cross-border
integration. International collaboration on innovative financial technology within
the central banking community, such as through the newly established BIS
Innovation Hub, is accelerating progress on these policy goals.

Designing retail CBDC: shaping the future of payments

Box III.E

The issue of how to design retail CBDCs was examined in the March 2020 BIS Quarterly Review dedicated to
the future of payments. It shows that the bar for a technical design is high. The foundational design
consideration for a CBDC needs to balance the operational role of the central bank and private intermediaries.
Intermediaries can run into technical difficulties or solvency issues. A CBDC should be safe from such outages.
CBDC payment intermediaries need to offer valuable services that have the same convenience, innovation
and efficiency as in today’s payments. One approach that makes for a safe means of payment while allowing
the private-public partnership to continue is a “hybrid” CBDC. In this architecture, private intermediaries
execute real-time payments and handle all customer-facing aspects, including ongoing customer due
diligence. In addition, the central bank operates a backup infrastructure, enabling it to protect the payment
system during a financial crisis or cyber attack (Graph III.E).

Hybrid CBDC architectures: a public-private partnership for the digital era

Graph III.E

Hybrid CBDC architectures aim to combine the benefits of direct claims on the central bank with the important services of private sector PSPs.
A CBDC is a direct claim on the central bank, but PSPs onboard all retail clients, handle know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering
(AML) and customer due diligence and execute all payments in real time. The central bank acts as a backstop to the payment system. It retains
a copy of all retail CBDC holdings and has the technical capability and legal power to transfer client relationships from one PSP to another in
the event of insolvency or technical failure. For example, in the graph, should CBDC-PSP Y run into any such issues during a cyber attack, the
central bank could switch customer C to CBDC-PSP X to guarantee working payments.
