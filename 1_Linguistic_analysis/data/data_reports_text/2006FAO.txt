Eradicating world hunger–
taking stock ten years after
the World Food Summit

About this report

en years ago, world leaders
met in Rome for the World
Food Summit (WFS) to
discuss ways to end hunger.
They pledged their commitment to
an ongoing effort to eradicate
hunger in all countries and set
themselves the immediate target of
halving the number of
undernourished people by 2015.
To this purpose, they approved
the World Food Summit Plan of
Action. In October 2006, FAO’s
Committee on World Food Security
is undertaking an assessment
of the implementation of the
Plan of Action and a mid-term
review of progress towards
achieving the target.
The State of Food Insecurity in
the World 2006 reviews progress
and setbacks in hunger reduction

T

since 1990–92, the established
baseline period.
The first section of the report,
Undernourishment around
the world, reviews trends in hunger
at the global, regional and
subregional levels. It also presents
FAO’s most recent projections of
undernourishment in 2015.
The second section,
Undernourishment in the regions,
reviews the food security situation in
each of the major developing
regions and the transition countries.
The third section, Towards
the Summit commitments,
summarizes lessons from past
experience in hunger reduction
and presents FAO’s current
thinking on how to accelerate
progress towards meeting the WFS
target.

Two tables (pp. 32–38) provide
detailed information on levels of
undernourishment in developing and
transition countries and other
indicators relevant to food security.
The report also includes maps
(page 31) illustrating the global food
security situation and progress in
hunger reduction.

Foreword
Despite setbacks, the race against hunger can be won

n November 1996, the world
turned its attention to Rome,
where heads of State and
Government of more than 180 nations
attending the World Food Summit
(WFS) pledged to eradicate one of the
worst scourges weighing on society’s
collective conscience: hunger. As an
important step towards this noble and
long overdue objective, world leaders
committed themselves to what was
considered an ambitious but
attainable intermediate target: to
halve by 2015 the number of
undernourished people in the world
from the 1990 level. Ten years later,
we are confronted with the sad reality
that virtually no progress has been
made towards that objective.
Compared with 1990–92, the number
of undernourished people in the
developing countries has declined by
a meagre 3 million – a number within
the bounds of statistical error. This is
the situation facing representatives of
the Committee on World Food
Security, meeting in Rome this year to
take stock of progress and setbacks
experienced since the Summit and to
propose further action.
Not all news is dismal, however.
Despite disappointing performances
in reducing the number of hungry
people, a smaller percentage of the
populations of developing countries
is undernourished today compared
with 1990–92: 17 percent against
20 percent. Furthermore, FAO’s
projections suggest that the
proportion of hungry people in
developing countries in 2015 could
be about half of what it was in
1990–92: a drop from 20 to
10 percent. This means that the
world is on a path towards meeting
the Millennium Development Goal
on hunger reduction. The same
projections, however, also indicate
that the WFS target could be missed:
some 582 million people could still

I

be undernourished in 2015 versus
412 million if the WFS goal were to
be met.
The news cannot come as a
surprise. Time and again, through
The State of Food Insecurity in the
World as well as other channels,
FAO has pointed out that insufficient
progress is being made in alleviating
hunger. This publication has
highlighted the discrepancy between
what could (and should) be done,
and what is actually being done for
the millions of people suffering from
hunger. We have emphasized first
and foremost that reducing hunger
is no longer a question of means in
the hands of the global community.
The world is richer today than it was
ten years ago. There is more food
available and still more could be
produced without excessive upward
pressure on prices. The knowledge
and resources to reduce hunger are
there. What is lacking is sufficient
political will to mobilize those
resources to the benefit of the
hungry. Past issues of this report
have stressed the urgency of
accelerating the pace in what has
literally been termed as “the race
against hunger”. They have
reiterated the need to move from
rhetoric to concrete action.
Hunger reduction:
challenges and priorities
When observing global trends in the
number of undernourished people, it
is almost a natural reaction to dismiss
the period since the WFS as a “lost
decade”. To do so, however, would be
a serious mistake. It would compound
existing scepticism and would risk
detracting from positive action being
taken. It would also obscure the fact
that much has been accomplished in
securing a top place for hunger on the
development agenda.

What also warrants clarification is
that the stagnation in the overall
number of undernourished people
reflects the net outcome of progress
in some countries combined with
setbacks in others. Even within a
single country, it is not uncommon
to find differences among regions.
Experiences documented so far
show that hunger reduction is
possible, even in some of the
poorest countries in the world.
There is much to be learnt from
these successful cases. Countries
experiencing setbacks, on the other
hand, underscore the need for us to
scale up proven models and
strategies while, at the same time,
sharpening the focus on problem
areas where hunger is endemic and
persistent.
Among the developing regions
today, the greatest challenge is the
one facing sub-Saharan Africa. It is
the region with the highest
prevalence of undernourishment,
with one in three people deprived of
access to sufficient food. FAO’s
projections suggest that the
prevalence of hunger in this region
will decline by 2015 but that the

number of hungry people will not fall
below that of 1990–92. By then,
sub-Saharan Africa will be home to
around 30 percent of the
undernourished people in the
developing world, compared with
20 percent in 1990–92.
A number of countries suffering
setbacks in hunger reduction are
experiencing conflict or other forms
of disaster. But, likewise, projections
show a formidable task ahead for
countries which may be free of
conflict, but which rely on a poor
agricultural resource base and
exhibit weak overall economic and
institutional development in the face
of persistently high rates of
population growth.
When assessing progress within
countries, it is generally in the rural
areas that hunger is concentrated.
At present, it is in these areas that
the majority of poor and foodinsecure people live. In turn, urban
poverty tends to be fuelled by people
migrating towards the cities in an
attempt to escape the deprivations
associated with rural livelihoods.
Partly due to the rural decline, the
world is urbanizing at a fast pace

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006

and it will not be long before a
greater part of developing country
populations is living in large cities.
Therefore, urban food security and
its related problems should also be
placed high on the agenda in the
years to come.
Twin track – a tried and effective
approach
The concentration of hunger in rural
areas suggests that no sustained
reduction in hunger is possible
without special emphasis on
agricultural and rural development.
In countries and regions where
hunger remains widespread,
agriculture often holds the key to
achieving both economic progress
and sustained reductions in
undernourishment. History has
taught us that, in general, those
countries that have managed to
reduce hunger have not only
experienced more rapid overall
economic growth but have also
achieved greater gains in
agricultural productivity than those
experiencing setbacks or stagnation.
It follows that investments in
agriculture, and more broadly in the

rural economy, are often a
prerequisite for accelerated hunger
reduction. The agriculture sector
tends to be the engine of growth for
entire rural economies, and
productivity-driven increases in
agricultural output can expand food
supplies and reduce food prices in
local markets, raise farm incomes
and boost the overall local economy
by generating demand for locally
produced goods and services.
By now, it is well understood
that hunger compromises the
health and productivity of
individuals and their efforts to
escape poverty. It acts as a brake on
the potential economic and social
development of whole societies. It is
no coincidence that more rapid
advances have been made in poverty
reduction as opposed to hunger
alleviation. Indeed, escaping poverty
seems to be much more difficult for
hungry people, who are
disadvantaged in their capacity
to earn a livelihood. Accelerating
hunger reduction consequently
requires direct measures to help
people who are both poor and ill-fed
to escape the hunger-poverty trap.

increasing number of countries
illustrates the powerful contribution
that direct and carefully targeted
measures can make to both hunger
and poverty reduction.
A twin-track approach,
emphasizing direct action against
hunger along with a focus on
agricultural and rural development,
is effective in providing the most
vulnerable and food-insecure people
with new livelihood possibilities and
hope for a better life. Efforts to
promote the twin-track approach as
the principal strategic framework for
hunger reduction should therefore be
at the centre of poverty reduction
initiatives at all levels.
Reaching the WFS goal:
it can be done
Conditions are currently ripe for
hastening effective hunger reduction
strategies and moving countries
decisively towards the WFS target
and beyond – towards the total
eradication of world hunger. It is fair
to say that the international
community today pays more
attention to hunger as an intrinsic
and pressing development issue.
Hunger has been raised to a more
prominent position in national antipoverty programmes and similar
initiatives, and there is more
widespread and vocal
acknowledgement of the fact that the
persistence of chronic hunger in the
midst of plenty is an unacceptable
contradiction. On the part of
governments, civil society and other
organizations, there is a greater
awareness of the steps that need to
be taken and, more importantly, the
resolve to instigate and catalyse the
necessary action appears to have
been strengthened.
Today, ten years after the WFS we
can resume the “race against

hunger” with renewed vigour,
seeking to honour the commitments
made ten years ago but, ideally,
aiming well beyond the WFS target.
We must dispel any complacency
that may be engendered by the
abundance of world food supplies, by
the general increase in agricultural
productivity, or by the expansion of
international trade possibilities.
The coexistence of food abundance
or even overnutrition with food
deprivation, even in the same
countries or communities, has been
a reality for decades and, unless
conditions conducive to chronic
hunger are eliminated, the two
extremes will continue to coexist in
the future.
Is the 2015 WFS target still
attainable? The answer should be a
resounding “Yes”, as long as
concrete and concerted action,
following the WFS Plan of Action, is
taken and stepped up immediately.
Already ten years ago, signatories to
the Rome Declaration emphasized
the urgency of the task “for which
the primary responsibility rests with
individual governments”, but for
which cooperation with international
organizations and civil society –
including both public and private
sectors – is vital. Today, we are
confident that the race against
hunger can still be won, but only if
the necessary resources, political
will and correct policies are
forthcoming. We fully agree with the
principal conclusion of the UN
Millennium Project’s Hunger Task
Force: It can be done.

Undernourishment around the world
Counting the hungry: trends in the developing world
and countries in transition1
en years after the 1996 Rome
World Food Summit (WFS), the
number of undernourished
people in the world remains
stubbornly high. In 2001–03, FAO
estimates there were still 854 million
undernourished people worldwide:
820 million in the developing
countries, 25 million in the transition
countries and 9 million in the
industrialized countries.2
Virtually no progress has been
made towards the WFS target of
halving the number of undernourished people by 2015. Since
1990–92, the baseline period for the
WFS target, the undernourished
population in the developing countries
has declined by only 3 million people:
from 823 million to 820 million. This
contrasts starkly with the reduction of
37 million achieved in the 1970s and
of 100 million in the 1980s. Moreover,
the most recent trends are a cause
for concern – a decline of
26 million between 1990–92 and
1995–97 was followed by an increase
of 23 million up to 2001–03.
Because of population growth, the
very small decrease in the number of
hungry people has nevertheless

resulted in a reduction in the
proportion of undernourished people
in the developing countries by
3 percentage points – from
20 percent in 1990–92 to 17 percent
in 2001–03. This means that
progress has continued towards the
first Millennium Development Goal
(MDG 1) of halving the percentage of
undernourished people by 2015.
However, progress over this period

The World Food Summit in 1996 established the target of halving the number of
undernourished people by no later than 2015. FAO uses the average of the period
1990–92 as the baseline for monitoring progress towards this target.
One of the two targets of the first Millennium Development Goal is to halve, between
1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger.
The WFS target is the more ambitious of the two. Indeed, continued population growth
means that the proportion of hungry people in the developing countries will need to be
cut by much more than half if the target is to be met. If the MDG target is achieved in
2015 by the developing countries as a group, current population projections suggest that
we will still be left with around 585 million undernourished, far more (173 million) than
the WFS target of 412 million. On the other hand, reaching the WFS target will require a
reduction in the proportion of undernourished in the developing countries to 7 percent,
which is 10 percentage points lower than the current level of 17 percent.

was slower than over the previous
two decades, when the prevalence of
undernourishment declined by
9 percent (from 37 percent to
28 percent) between 1969–71
and 1979–81 and by a further
8 percentage points (to 20 percent)
between 1979–81 and 1990–92.3
Success in meeting the WFS target
will require a reversal of recent
trends in the number of hungry

people and a sharp acceleration in
the rate of reduction of the proportion
of undernourished. Indeed, even if
the MDG target were to be reached by
2015, the WFS target would still be
far from being met (see box). In order
to attain the WFS target in the
developing countries, the number of
undernourished people must be
reduced by 31 million per year
between 2001–03 and 2015.
Regional trends in
undernourishment4
Global stagnation in hunger
reduction masks significant
disparities among regions: Asia and
the Pacific and Latin America and
the Caribbean have seen an overall
reduction in both the number and
prevalence of undernourished
people since the WFS baseline
period. Nevertheless, in both
regions the average rate of
reduction has fallen short of what
would be required to halve the
undernourished population by 2015.
Furthermore, in the case of Asia and
the Pacific the number of
undernourished has reverted to an
increasing trend over the latter part
of the decade, although the
prevalence has continued to decline.
Underlying this reversal are larger
absolute numbers in China and India
in 2001–03 relative to 1995–97.
On the other hand, both in the Near
East and North Africa and in subSaharan Africa the number of
undernourished people has risen
during the 11-year period following the
WFS baseline. In sub-Saharan Africa,
this represents the continuation of a
trend that has been apparent over at
least the last three decades.
In sub-Saharan Africa, recent
progress in reducing the prevalence
of undernourishment is noteworthy.

significant decline: from 35 percent
in 1990–92 to 32 percent in 2001–03,

1995–97. This is an encouraging
development, but the task facing the
region remains daunting: the
number of undernourished people
increased from 169 million to
206 million while reaching the WFS

since 1990–92, albeit from a
relatively low base. Following the
significant reduction in the numbers
of undernourished achieved during
the 1970s, the trend in subsequent
decades has been consistently
upwards. The decade since the WFS
baseline period constituted no
exception, although the rate of
increase slowed in the later years.
For the transition countries, the
number of undernourished people
has increased slightly, from 23
million to 25 million.5 This rise is
attributed mainly to higher numbers
in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), where the

The WFS and MDG targets:
regional progress and setbacks
The degree of regional progress
towards the WFS and MDG targets is
illustrated by Figure 6, which shows
the ratio of the number and the
prevalence of undernourished,
respectively, in 2001–03 to that of
1990–92. A ratio of 0.5 or lower
implies that the respective target
(WFS target for the number and
MDG target for the prevalence) has
been achieved. A ratio of less than
1.0 indicates progress towards the
target while a ratio of more than 1.0
indicates a setback. Only Asia and
the Pacific and Latin America and
the Caribbean have made progress
towards the WFS target, but neither
region is close to reaching it. The
remaining regions have all moved
away from the target by varying
degrees.
Prospects for achieving the MDG
target look more promising. All
developing country regions except
the Near East and North Africa have
made inroads towards reducing the

prevalence of undernourishment, and
in the cases of Asia and the Pacific
and Latin America and the Caribbean
progress has been quite significant.
Subregional trends in
undernourishment6
Regional trends in undernourishment
since the WFS baseline period
conceal significant differences at the
subregional level, as illustrated by
Figures 7 and 8. Within the subSaharan Africa region, the
subregions of Southern Africa, East
Africa and West Africa all saw a
decline in the prevalence of
undernourishment (although not
necessarily in the number of
undernourished); by contrast,
Central Africa experienced a
dramatic increase in both the
number of hungry people and
prevalence of undernourishment.
In Asia (where China and India are
treated as separate subregions in
view of the size of their populations)
significant progress in reducing the
number of undernourished people
was made in China and the populous
subregion of Southeast Asia.
In India, on the other hand, the

prevalence of hunger declined, but
the outcome in terms of reducing
the number of undernourished was
small, as a reduction in the first part
of the decade (1990–92 to 1995–97)
was subsequently reversed. At the
same time, the number of
undernourished increased in the
rest of East Asia (excluding China)
and, particularly, in the rest of South
Asia (excluding India).
A significant contribution to
progress towards the WFS target in
the Latin American and Caribbean
region was made by South America,
while the number of hungry people
increased in Central America and
Mexico. In the Near East and North
Africa, the absolute number of
undernourished is the smallest of
all the developing country regions,
but it increased both in North Africa
and in the Near East, with the latter
also seeing an increase in the
prevalence of hunger.
Globally, most subregions
experienced a reduction in the
prevalence of undernourishment.
However, any significant progress
towards reducing the global number
of undernourished was concentrated
in very few, but populous,

food security situation in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Apart from the Baltic States, only
China, Southeast Asia, South
America and the Caribbean have
moved decisively towards the WFS
target. The first three, owing to their
large populations, are also the
subregions that have provided the
most substantive contribution
towards a reduction in the number
of undernourished. It is also worth
noting that in all these subregions,
except the Caribbean, prevalence of
undernourishment is lower than the
average of the developing countries.
In addition to Central Africa,
also East Africa and Southern Africa
call for priority attention in view
of their high prevalence of undernourishment. In both subregions,
the number of hungry people has
continued to increase in spite of a
reduction in the prevalence of
hunger. Substantial acceleration of
progress will be needed if the WFS
target is to be met. The same applies
to other regions with somewhat
lower levels of undernourishment
but with limited or no progress in

subregions: China, Southeast Asia
and South America.
The World Food Summit target:
subregional progress and setbacks
Progress and setbacks in hunger
reduction in the subregions are
shown in Figure 9. For each
subregion, the ratio indicating the
distance from the WFS target is
plotted against the prevalence of
undernourishment. A ratio between
1.0 and 0.5 implies progress towards
the target whereas one of 0.5 or less
indicates the target has been
achieved or surpassed. A ratio
greater than 1.0 indicates setback.
The two extremes – the Baltic
States and Central Africa – illustrate
the wide disparity in progress in the
fight against hunger. The Baltic
States, with the lowest prevalence of
undernourishment, have already
reduced the numbers by more than
half; Central Africa, with the highest
prevalence (56 percent of the
population), has been moving rapidly
away from the WFS target as a
result of a dramatically worsening

reducing the absolute numbers:
South Asia (excluding India), West
Africa and India.
Other subregions with lower levels
of undernourishment that show a
worrying increase in both prevalence
and numbers of undernourished are
East Asia (excluding China) – mainly
due to a worsening situation in the
Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea – the Near East and Central
America.
Clearly, progress towards the WFS
target is concentrated in too few
subregions and generally in those
with a prevalence of undernourishment below the average for
the developing countries. Global
progress is largely determined by a
few subregions with large
populations, while too many others
have seen virtually no progress or
have even experienced setbacks. To
accelerate the pace of global hunger
reduction, it is essential to halt and
reverse the rising trend in numbers
where it occurs and to broaden
success in hunger reduction to other
subregions. This will evidently be
critical in those subregions where the

target. Sub-Saharan Africa and the
Near East and North Africa, on the
contrary, are expected to suffer an
increase, reaching higher numbers
in 2015 than in 1990–92.8 Latin
America and the Caribbean and
South Asia, while projected to reach
the MDG target, are not on track for
the WFS target. The recent
increasing trends in the number of
undernourished people in South
Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and the
Near East and North Africa are likely
to be reversed, but, of these three,
only South Asia is foreseen to reach
the MDG target.

Projected progress in hunger
reduction mirrors significant
increases in average per capita food
consumption. Despite the overall
gains in food consumption,
in several countries the increases
will not be sufficient to allow for a
significant reduction in the number of
undernourished people. In particular,
sub-Saharan Africa will still have an
average per capita daily calorie
intake of 2 420 kilocalories (kcal)
(2 285 kcal when Nigeria is excluded)
in 2015 – close to that of South Asia
at the turn of the century. Low initial
levels of calorie intake, coupled with
high population growth, will
contribute to the slow reductions in
the number of undernourished
people.
Reducing hunger will be
particularly difficult for countries
characterized by historically very
high levels of hunger prevalence,
very low food consumption (under
2 200 kcal/person/day in 1999–2001),
low economic growth prospects, high
population growth rates and a
limited agricultural resource base.
Thirty-two countries fall into this
category – with undernourishment

rates ranging from 29 to 72 percent
of the population and an average
prevalence of 42 percent. Their
current population of 580 million is
projected to rise to 1.39 billion by
2050. Their current average food
consumption of 2 000 kcal/person/day
has actually fallen below that of
30 years ago. Despite their poor
historical record, however, several
of these countries could achieve
significant gains by prioritizing the
development of local food
production, as other countries have
done in the past.
Undernourishment
and poverty
Growth in per capita incomes will
contribute to hunger alleviation by
reducing poverty and increasing per
capita food demand.9 Higher growth
rates in per capita GDP relative to
the 1990s are projected for all
regions and country groups, with the
exception of East Asia, which
nevertheless remains the region with
the highest growth rate (over 5.0
percent/year in per capita terms).

Figure 12 presents trends and
projections for poverty and
undernourishment rates, which,
significantly, indicate that the
poverty target of MDG 1 (halving
the proportion of the poor by 2015)
will be reached in the baseline
scenario.

Different methodologies are used
to estimate poverty and undernourishment and the figures are
not directly comparable. However,
a closer look at trends for both
indicators in the developing
countries reveals that poverty has
tended to decline more rapidly than
undernourishment. The World Bank
and FAO projections for these
indicators suggest that this trend
will continue. In fact, the differences
in calculations notwithstanding,
there were 1.5 poor people for every
hungry person in 1990–92; by 2015,
the corresponding figures are
projected to be 1.2 to one.
These past trends and projections
suggest that poverty reduction does
not benefit proportionately those
among the poor who are also
undernourished. Although the
reasons for the slower rate of
hunger reduction are not clear, an
important factor may be that hunger
itself acts as a barrier to escaping
poverty (the hunger trap). Past
editions of The State of Food
Insecurity in the World as well as
the World Food Summit: five years
later have emphasized that hunger
is not only a consequence but also a
cause of poverty, and that it
compromises the productive
potential of individuals, families and
entire nations. In the 2004 edition of
this report, an extensive analysis of
the social and economic costs of
hunger was presented.
An important policy implication of
this relationship would be that, in
the absence of purposeful action,
hunger will compromise efforts to
reduce poverty globally. Income
growth, while necessary, is not
always sufficient for eradicating
hunger. Specific measures targeted
directly at ensuring access to food
are an indispensable component of
effective hunger eradication efforts.

for population growth – only 9 of the
region’s 17 countries reduced the
number of undernourished people.
To reach the WFS target by 2015,
progress must be accelerated.
The decline in the number of
hungry people in Asia and the Pacific
was driven mainly by China, which
saw a reduction from 194 million to
150 million. India has the largest
number of undernourished people in
the world, 212 million – only
marginally below the 215 million
estimated for 1990–92. Bangladesh
and Pakistan, both with high levels
of prevalence, account for 15 percent
of the hungry people in the region,
with Pakistan showing an increase
in both prevalence and in absolute
number.
Individual country progress
towards the WFS target is shown in
Figure 15. No country in the region
has yet met the target. Two
countries, Myanmar and Viet Nam,
have reduced the number of
undernourished people by more
than 25 percent. In addition to these,
the most significant progress in
relative terms has been achieved by
China, Thailand and Indonesia. The
most serious deterioration in food
security has been experienced by
the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea, where the number of
undernourished people more than
doubled: from 3.6 million to
7.9 million.

for reducing undernourishment.

important as they, and rural

Agricultural growth thus generates

Food insecurity in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea

The Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea has seen a sharp increase
in both the prevalence of undernourishment and the number
of hungry people over the period 1990–92
to 2001–03: the prevalence doubled and
the absolute number more than doubled
(to almost 8 million people).
The underlying cause appears to
have been negative trends in economic
growth. Statistics on GDP growth

are not available, making it difficult to
assess the extent of the problem.
However, available data on food
production indicate that this variable,
in per capita terms, declined at a rate of
2.2 percent per year over this period.
In 2003, the vast majority of the country’s
23 million people were dependent on
cereals received through the public
distribution system.

and rural off-farm activities sustain
each other. Such growth can make a
powerful contribution towards
reducing the numbers of
undernourished, especially when
initial income inequality is not too
marked and population growth is
moderate.
China and Viet Nam exemplify this
process. From 1990–92 to 2001–03,
the number of hungry people in
China declined from 194 million to
150 million and the prevalence of
undernourishment from 16 percent
to 12 percent. This was achieved
through strong economic and
agricultural growth – real per capita
GDP increased at an average annual
rate of 8 percent between 1990 and
2003, while per capita agricultural
GDP grew by 2.5 percent and per
capita food production by 5.4 percent
per year. At the same time, the
annual population growth rate was
only 1 percent.

In fact, the rapid reduction of
hunger and poverty in China started
much earlier, originating with
two major agricultural reforms
in 1978, when families were
permitted to lease land from the
collectives and state procurement
prices for foodgrains, oilcrops and
hogs were raised.11 Agricultural
output and incomes rose
dramatically in response, with
rural per capita income increasing
by 90 percent between 1980 and
1985. From 1985 onwards, rural
non-farm enterprises also began to
expand rapidly. By 2000 they had
absorbed about a quarter of the
rural labour force and were
contributing about 30 percent to
national GDP, while farm
households were deriving almost
50 percent of their incomes from
non-farm sources.12 The number of

16

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006

poor people in rural China fell from
about 490 million in 1979 to about
90 million in 2002 in terms of the
World Bank’s US$1-a-day poverty
line.13 The number of undernourished people was reduced from
387 million in 1969–71 to the current
figure of 150 million.
The rate of hunger reduction in
China slowed down during the
second half of the 1990s.14 This, at
least in part, is attributable to the
weak economic performance of
the relatively isolated and
disadvantaged rural areas where the
majority of the remaining
undernourished people are located.
The bulk of agricultural output
comes from about 200 million very
small (0.65 ha or less) farms.15
Recent steps by the Government of
China to revitalize rural areas holds
out the promise that hunger

reduction can accelerate over the
next decade.
Between 1990–92 and 2001–03,
Viet Nam reduced the prevalence of
undernourishment from 31 to
17 percent and the number of
undernourished people from
21 million to 14 million. As in China,
accelerated hunger and poverty
reduction originated with marketoriented economic and agricultural
reforms, which were implemented
in the 1980s. An economic reform
programme gave farmers control
over land, allowed them to increase
sales to the market and reduced
agricultural taxation. Also as in the
case of China, the drivers were
strong per capita growth in GDP
(5.7 percent/year between 1990
and 2003) and agricultural GDP
(2.5 percent/year) as well as
rapid expansion in food production.
A poverty eradication programme
targeting investments in rural
infrastructure also contributed to
boosting agricultural production and
hunger reduction. Viet Nam remains
a low-income country, and keeping
up the momentum in reducing
hunger presents a formidable
challenge.
Cambodia and India saw
virtually no change in the total
number of undernourished people
despite strong growth in per capita
income of 4 percent per year
from 1993 to 2003 in Cambodia
and 3.9 percent per year from 1990
to 2003 in India. However, the good
overall economic performance
was spread unevenly among sectors
and was not underpinned by strong
agricultural growth; per capita
agricultural GDP increased at an
annual rate of only 0.7 percent
between 1993 and 2003 in Cambodia
and by 0.9 percent from 1990 to 2003
in India.16

Latin America and the Caribbean

atin America and the
Caribbean is home to some
6 percent of the developing
world’s undernourished people and
to 11 percent of its total population.
At 10 percent of the region’s
population, the prevalence of undernourishment is the second lowest
among the developing regions.
With a reduction in the number of
undernourished people from
59 million in 1990–92 to 52 million in
2001–03, the region is making
progress towards the WFS target,
although the pace needs to be
accelerated. Progress is uneven
and mostly concentrated in the
subregions of South America and
the Caribbean. Central America, on
the other hand, has witnessed an
upward trend in both numbers and
prevalence. In Mexico,17 prevalence
remained unchanged at a relatively
low level while the number of
undernourished people increased.
Figure 19 reveals the wide
divergence in country progress
towards the WFS target. A few
countries – Cuba, Guyana and Peru
– have already met the target while
Chile and Uruguay are very close.
Ecuador and Jamaica have reduced

Food insecurity deteriorated in Peru
during the 1970s and, especially, 1980s.
The prevalence of undernourishment
doubled from 21 percent in 1969–71 to
42 percent in 1990–92. In the 1990s, the
trend was finally reversed. Between
1990–92 and 2001–03, the number of
undernourished fell from 9.3 million to
3.3 million people and the prevalence of
undernourishment from 42 to 12 percent
of the population.
The improved food security can be
attributed, inter alia, to the reduction
of inflation. Between 1990–92 and
2001–03, real per capita GDP grew

A key factor behind the success was
strong agricultural growth. Peru
introduced reforms in the agriculture
sector, including legislation on land
transactions and entitlements, which led
to improvements in access to credit.
Agricultural value added per worker
increased by 4 percent annually between
1990–92 and 2001–03.
Nevertheless, significant levels of
undernourishment and poverty remain.
The challenge for the future is to
maintain the pace of improvements in
poverty and hunger reduction and
broaden the gains to poorer regions of
the country.

12 to 8 percent of the population. With an
average energy intake of 3 060 kcal per
day (in 2001–03), Brazil has adequate
food supplies to feed its population, but
access to food is hampered by highly
skewed distribution of income and land.
In the early 1990s, Brazil experienced
recession and a debt crisis. Major policy
changes were introduced in an effort to
stabilize the macroeconomic situation;
these were accompanied by increased
government expenditures on social
programmes. Social indicators improved
as a consequence, but the country still
faces pervasive poverty and food insecurity
among the lowest income groups.

35

In 2003, the government launched the
Zero-Hunger Programme (Programa
Fome Zero) with the aim of rapidly
improving food security for 44 million
people. Its main components set out to
improve incomes, increase basic food
supplies, enhance access to food and
urgently alleviate hunger and
malnutrition through targeted
interventions.
A key social programme, launched in
October 2003, is the Bolsa Família
Programme, which provides conditional
income transfers to poor families.
Conditionalities include school
attendance and health visits. The
government plans, during 2006, to reach
all eligible families – an estimated
11.2 million people.

Overall, per capita dietary energy
supplies are higher in the region
than in both Asia and the Pacific and
sub-Saharan Africa, and per capita
GDP is the highest among
developing country regions. A key
factor underlying food insecurity in
the region is high income inequality,
which reflects unequal access to
productive assets.18 Inequality
causes an uneven distribution of the
fruits of economic growth and acts
as a brake on poverty reduction.
The region is more urbanized than
other developing country regions,
but in many countries the share of
the rural population is still high.
Furthermore, in most countries the
incidence of extreme poverty and
food insecurity is higher in rural
areas than in urban ones. Rural and
agricultural development has a

major role to play in alleviating
hunger and extreme poverty,
especially among small-scale
producers and indigenous
communities. Ensuring access by
the poor to productive resources –
land, capital, technology and
education – is of particular
importance.
The food economy is characterized
by deep structural changes – the
diffusion of new forms of food retail,
including supermarkets and
hypermarkets, and the consolidation
of the food industry. Ensuring that
smallholders and poorer farmers
are not marginalized is a challenge
to be faced.
In many countries, export
earnings are critical for ensuring
staple food imports. For countries
with a high degree of export
commodity concentration, export

earnings and the livelihoods of
individuals who depend on
agriculture and related activities are
vulnerable to international price
fluctuations. For instance, the
dramatic decline in coffee prices in
recent years had severe negative
repercussions on food security in
Central American countries.
In several countries in the region,
susceptibility to natural shocks
intensifies the vulnerability of the
poorest sections of the population.
Examples over the last decade
include the El Niño phenomenon,
which caused droughts and flooding
in the Caribbean, Central America
and the Andean countries in 1997
and 1998, and hurricanes Georges
and Mitch, which destroyed lives,
crops and infrastructure in many
Caribbean and Central American
countries in 1998.

Worsening food insecurity in
Guatemala
Between 1990–92 and 2001–03, the
number of undernourished people in
Guatemala doubled to 2.8 million, and the
prevalence of hunger increased from 16
to 23 percent of the population. Thirty-one
percent of the population live in extreme
poverty, almost 80 percent of whom live in
rural areas.1 Most of the rural poor are
indigenous and depend on subsistence
farming or agricultural work.
A longstanding constraint is unequal
access to productive resources. An
estimated 2 percent of the population
own 72 percent of agricultural land while
smallholdings of less than 7 ha in size
(87 percent of all farms) control only
15 percent.2 The productivity of small
farmers is further constrained by poor
infrastructure and low levels of education
and social expenditure in rural areas.
Social expenditures are among the
lowest in the region, although they have
increased since 1990.3
Food insecurity has also been
aggravated by natural disasters. The
effects of El Niño were followed by
hurricane Mitch in 1998, drought in
2001 and hurricane Stan in October
2005. The latter caused losses
corresponding to 3.4 percent of GNP.4
Coffee production in 2000 accounted
for 18 percent of agricultural GDP,
4 percent of total GDP, 19 percent of
export revenues and 30 percent of rural
employment. The decline in
international coffee prices from the late
1990s seriously affected profitability for
both small producers, who predominate
numerically, and large and medium-size
farms, which account for 80 percent of
total production. The reduced demand
for farm labour led to employment
losses equivalent to 78 000 full-time
jobs and declines in rural wages.5

Undernourishment in the regions
Near East and North Africa

ith 9 percent of the
population undernourished,
the Near East and North
Africa is the region with the lowest
prevalence of undernourishment
among the developing regions.
Relatively higher incomes and/or a
tradition of food support and subsidy
policies in some countries account
for a large part of the difference. The
region is home to around 5 percent
of the undernourished and around
8 percent of the population of the
developing world.
Although relatively low, food
insecurity in the region is persistent
and actually rising both in absolute
numbers and in prevalence.
Between 1990–92 and 2001–03, the
prevalence of hunger increased from
8 to 9 percent, which, combined with
high population growth rates, led to
an increase in the number of undernourished people from 25 million to
38 million. Excluding Afghanistan

and Iraq (for which available data
are very tenuous), the number of
undernourished still increased from
15 million to 20 million and
prevalence from 5 to 6 percent.
Among the countries in the region
(excluding Afghanistan and Iraq), only

Yemen has very high levels of food
insecurity; more than one-third of the
population are chronically
undernourished. In the remaining
countries, except Jordan and Morocco,
the prevalence of undernourishment
lies below 5 percent.

Worsening food insecurity in Yemen

In Yemen, the number of hungry people increased from
4.2 million in 1990–92 to 7.1 million in 2001–03, and the
proportion of undernourished people in the population from 34 to
37 percent. The country falls among the low-income grouping and
is highly dependent on food imports. The average daily energy
supply of 2 020 kcal per person (2001–03) has decreased slightly,
from 2 040 kcal, in the decade since 1990–92. Yemen’s population
growth is among the highest in the world, exerting considerable
pressure on poverty and food insecurity levels in the country and
on its natural resource base. Generally, social indicators have
improved since 1990 but still remain poor; Yemen ranked 151 out
of 177 countries in the 2005 UNDP Human Development Index.
About three-quarters of the population and more than
80 percent of the poor live in rural areas, and agriculture
employs close to 50 percent of the labour force. Agricultural
production has been unable to keep pace with the rapidly growing
population, and dependence on agricultural imports has
increased significantly.

20

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006

Rural development is critical for improving food security. The
agriculture sector is faced with low productivity due to the lack of
investment, inadequate water supply and scarce arable land.
Rapid depletion of groundwater resources may be the most
serious problem facing the country as a whole and the
agriculture sector in particular. About 42 percent of the cropped
land is irrigated and over 75 percent of irrigated land uses
groundwater. Ensuring sustainable use of scarce water resources
is crucial for the development of rural areas.
A further contributing factor often referred to regarding
Yemen is the production and use of the stimulant leaf qat, which
competes with food production for resources, including water,
and household food expenditures. The government has begun a
campaign against chewing the leaf, and farmers are being
encouraged to switch to high-value export crops in an effort to
improve water-use efficiency.

level. Egypt and the Syrian Arab
Republic achieved small reductions
in the number of hungry people and
a somewhat more significant
reduction in the prevalence, which in
both countries is below 5 percent.
The remaining countries (especially
Jordan and Yemen) experienced
increases in numbers.

Progress of individual countries
towards the WFS target is shown in
Figure 23. Only Kuwait has reached

impressive record in hunger
reduction must be seen in the
context of the exceptionally high

following the Iraqi occupation and
the first Gulf war. The United Arab

Undernourishment in the regions

Rising undernourishment in Jordan

Between 1990–92 and 2001–03, the
number of hungry people increased from
100 000 to 400 000 and the prevalence of
undernourishment from 4 percent to
7 percent of the population. Limited
resources, especially water, make Jordan
highly dependant on food imports.
Agriculture accounts for only 3 percent of
GDP and employs only 10 percent of the
labour force.
The Jordanian economy is highly
influenced by external factors, and its
performance has closely followed the
fluctuations in oil prices over the past
two decades as well as the conflicts in
the region. After a long period of
economic decline starting in the mid1980s, Jordan is again experiencing

steady economic growth. Despite a large
external debt, the government has
succeeded in mobilizing public
expenditures towards social activities
such as health and education. However,
unemployment is still high and poverty
remains despite progress in reducing it.
While fewer than 2 percent of the
population are below the US$1-a-day
World Bank international poverty line,
7 percent live on less than US$2 a day.
With the labour force growing at
4 percent per year, the lack of job
opportunities is currently considered
the major threat to food security. In the
longer run, serious water scarcity could
constrain the country’s growth and
development prospects.

labour migration. Hence, the decline
in oil prices during the 1990s had a
negative impact on food security in
the region, while their present
rebound since 2002 is a powerful
driving economic force.
The majority of the poor in the
region – about 70 percent – live in
rural areas, while the rural share of
the population is 43 percent.19 For
the rural communities, agriculture
remains the main source of
employment and income and
represents the engine of the rural
economy. The performance of the
sector is subject to volatile climatic
conditions, especially rainfall. With
the exception of Egypt, where most
agricultural land is irrigated,
drought often results in severe
production shortfalls, exerting heavy
pressure on farm incomes and food
import bills. Increasing scarcity of
water in the region limits the scope
for agricultural expansion and
places the livelihoods of agricultural
and rural people under heavy stress.
Improvements in water-use
efficiency and management
practices are critical elements for
improving the performance of
agriculture and the rural economies.
A significant challenge for the
region is that of meeting the growing
food requirements arising from
high population growth. Food
imports are crucial for food security
in this context, and represent a
means of saving scarce water.
However, the region has not yet
been successful in developing
export-oriented industries that
could reduce its dependency on oil
exports. A further challenge for
several countries is that of ensuring
levels of economic growth sufficient
to absorb the rapid expansion in the
labour force.

Sub-Saharan Africa

ub-Saharan Africa accounts
for 13 percent of the
population and 25 percent of
the undernourished people in the
developing world. It is the
developing region with the highest
proportion – one-third – of people
suffering from chronic hunger. In
14 countries in the region, 35 percent
or more of the population were
chronically undernourished in
2001–03.
Hunger in sub-Saharan Africa is
as persistent as it is widespread.
Between 1990–92 and 2001–03, the
number of undernourished people
increased from 169 million to
206 million, and only 15 of the
39 countries for which data are
reported reduced the number of
undernourished. At an annual rate
of about 2.5 percent, the region’s
population has been rising more
quickly than the number of hungry
people, resulting in a reduction in
the prevalence of undernourishment
from 35 to 32 percent: it declined in
29 countries and increased in ten.
Efforts to reduce hunger in the
region have been hampered by
natural and human-induced
disasters, including conflicts
occurring during the 1990s and the
spread of HIV/AIDS. Indeed, the
increase in the number of
undernourished people since the
WFS baseline period was driven
mainly by five war-torn countries:
Burundi, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Eritrea, Liberia and
Sierra Leone. These countries
combined account for 29 million of
the region’s total increase of
37 million. Particularly dramatic is
the worsening of food insecurity in
the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, where the number of undernourished people tripled, from
12 million to 36 million, and the
prevalence rose from 31 to 72 percent

conclusion is that conflict is a major
reason for lack of progress towards
the WFS target in sub-Saharan
Africa.
The persistence of hunger in the
region is underlined by Figure 27,
which shows individual country

progress towards the WFS target. In
addition to Ghana, which has already
reached the target, only Gabon
reduced the number of undernourished by 25 percent or more
(and is thus halfway towards the
target). Other countries that reduced

agricultural or, especially, food
production. The performance of the
three countries is summarized in
the table.
Growth in food production is
indeed key to hunger reduction in
sub-Saharan Africa. Productivitydriven increases in food production
have been shown to have a strong
positive impact on the rural
economy, leading to increased food
availability and a reduction of food
prices in local markets. At the same
time, the enhanced incomes of
smallholders – the main producers
of staples – provide a stimulus to
rural economic activity by generating
increased demand for the products
of other sectors that are either
linked to agriculture (e.g. processing
and agricultural services) or supply
consumption goods to farmers.
In 12 countries of the region, a fall in
the prevalence of undernourishment
has not been sufficient to translate into
a reduction in the number of
undernourished people. These
countries are spread fairly evenly over
the continent. In all but three
exceptions, a common factor seems to
be that per capita food production
either declined or grew only slowly.
The cases of Burkina Faso, Uganda
and Zambia are examples.
In Uganda, the number of undernourished increased from 4.2 million
to 4.6 million between 1990–92 and
2001–03, while the prevalence
declined from 24 to 19 percent. This
took place against a backdrop of
strong per capita GDP growth, at an
average annual rate of 3.8 percent,
and a modest average growth rate of
1 percent in per capita agricultural
GDP. Average dietary energy
consumption also increased from
2 270 to 2 380 kcal/person/day, in
spite of decreasing per capita food
production. The increase in energy
consumption was achieved mainly

through large increases in both
commercial food imports and food
aid. Although overall food supplies
did expand, the increase in rural
incomes that could be generated if
the additional supplies originated in
domestic production did not
materialize.
In Zambia, prevalence remained
virtually unchanged (from 48 to
47 percent), and the number of
undernourished people increased
from 4.0 million to 5.1 million.
Overall economic and agricultural
performance was mixed. Indeed, per
capita GDP declined at an annual
rate of 0.9 percent, while per capita
agricultural GDP grew by 1.0 percent
per year. Per capita food production,
on the other hand, declined at an
annual rate of 0.9 percent.
In Burkina Faso, the reduction in
the prevalence of undernourishment

from 21 percent to 17 percent
between 1990–92 and 2001–03 was
insufficient to prevent an increase in
the number of undernourished
people from 1.9 million to
2.1 million. Food production
increased in per capita terms at the
same average rate as in the more
successful Mozambique (1.6 per
cent per year). On the other hand,
per capita growth of GDP and
agricultural GDP were more modest,
at average annual rates of 1.7 and
1.1 percent, respectively. Food
imports per capita also increased
slightly. As a result, average
dietary energy consumption
increased slightly from 2 350 to
2 460 kcal/person/day during
this period. This was sufficient
to ensure a reduction in the
prevalence, but not in the number,
of undernourished people.

a whole, there has been a slight
increase in both the number of
hungry people and the prevalence of
hunger. While some countries
showed progress to varying degrees,
others have experienced a sharp
deterioration in their food security
situation.
Individual country progress
towards the WFS target is shown in
Figure 31. Of the countries that have
achieved the target, the most
successful are Azerbaijan, Georgia
and Kyrgyzstan, all of which, starting
from a high prevalence of hunger,
have cut the number of
undernourished by at least twothirds. Armenia, which in 1993–95
had the highest prevalence of
undernourishment (52 percent) in
the region, has already halved its
number of hungry people, but at
29 percent of the population the
prevalence remains disturbingly
high. Other countries that have met
the WFS target are Croatia, Estonia,
Lithuania and The former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia. Latvia, the
Russian Federation, Slovenia and
Turkmenistan have made strong
progress, though they have yet to
meet the target.

he transition economies are an
extremely diverse group, a fact
that should be kept in mind
when analysing hunger trends in the
region.21 The region is home to an
estimated 25 million undernourished people, 21 million of
whom live in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS).
In countries that have recently
acceded to the European Union
(EU),22 and in Romania, the level of
undernourishment is generally low –
6 percent at the most. Somewhat
higher levels are found in the
Balkans (Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia and
Montenegro, and The former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Within the CIS countries, the range
of prevalence of undernourishment
varies widely: from about 3 percent
in Belarus, the Russian Federation
and Ukraine to 61 percent in
Tajikistan, which, along with
Armenia and Uzbekistan, is one of
the countries facing the most
serious food insecurity problems.
Progress towards the WFS target
for the countries in transition is
measured using 1993–95 as the
baseline period.23 For the region as

Azerbaijan and Georgia – the two
countries that have been most
successful in reducing hunger from very
high levels – emerged from armed
conflict in the early 1990s. Their
economies started expanding in the
second half of that decade following a
severe contraction in the early years.
Economic growth, in turn, was a major
factor behind the significant reduction
in the numbers of hungry people – in
both countries from about 2.5 million in
1993–95 to 0.7–0.8 million in 2001–03.
Both have made strong progress since
1993 in implementing economy-wide
reforms and those specific to the
agriculture sector, including
privatization of agricultural land and
titling.

A few countries suffered setbacks,
in some cases very severe. The
largest relative increase was in
Kazakhstan, but by far the most
serious situation is in Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan, which have both seen a

Fighting hunger: determinants
of progress and setbacks
Factors influencing progress or
setbacks in hunger reduction are
diverse in the region. In many
instances, food insecurity has been a
direct consequence of humaninduced disasters – war, conflict and
political and economic instability with
ensuing problems of refugees and
displaced persons. Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Republic of
Moldova, the Russian Federation and
many Balkan countries are among
this group. Natural disasters
(prolonged drought in parts of
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and the
Republic of Moldova) have also played
a role.

Beyond WFS target

Armenia

More generally, food insecurity in
the region can be traced to factors
such as weak economic development
resulting from lack of support policies
and infrastructure and the breakdown
of social safety nets following the
dissolution of the pre-1990s
economic and political systems in
Eastern Europe and the CIS.
Between 1990 and 2001, extreme
poverty, measured as the share of
the population living on less than
US$1 a day, increased from 0.4 to
5.3 percent in the CIS countries and
from 0.2 to 2.0 percent in the
transition countries of southeastern
Europe.24 However, the CIS average
masks the existence of countries
with exceptionally high rates of
extreme poverty such as the
Republic of Moldova (22 percent),
Uzbekistan (14 percent), Armenia (13
percent), Turkmenistan (10 percent)
and Tajikistan (7 percent).25

Reversing the food security
setbacks requires focused efforts on
pro-poor development strategies,
targeting rural areas especially,
which are home to more than
50 percent of the population in
countries such as the Republic of
Moldova, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan
and to large shares also in other
countries where hunger is
pervasive. While agriculture is not
the predominant sector in the region
as a whole, it remains important in
the poorer countries, and
agricultural performance will
determine future progress in
reducing poverty and food insecurity.
In the three countries with the
highest levels of undernourishment
– Tajikistan, Armenia and
Uzbekistan – agriculture accounts
for 24, 23 and 31 percent of GDP,
respectively.26

Towards the Summit commitments
The way ahead:
strengthening efforts for eradicating hunger
Furthermore, not all countries
face equal challenges, and many
risk being left behind in the fight
against hunger. Those that face the
most serious difficulties and need to
make the largest efforts are often
those that have the least means to
do so. Without purposeful action by
domestic stakeholders and without
assistance from the world
community, these countries risk
further marginalization, making the
hunger reduction effort even more
difficult in the future.

his report has shown that,
although we are closer to the
MDG target of halving the
proportion of undernourished
people by 2015, we are still very far
from the WFS target of halving their
number. Towards the latter goal no
progress has been made, and the
number of hungry people has
remained virtually unchanged since
1990–92.
Despite the disappointing results
so far, prospects for hunger
reduction appear more promising
today. Improved economic
performance in developing
countries, bolstered by increased
international attention to the dual
problem of extreme poverty and
hunger, promises more rapid
advances in the coming years. Still,
the task in front of us is daunting:
each year until 2015, the world must
be able to count 31 million fewer
hungry people27 – ten times the total
reduction achieved since 1990–92 –
if we are to meet the pledge made
during the WFS and reiterated
during the WFS: five years later.

T

Lessons learnt in hunger
reduction28
In stepping up our efforts to reach
the WFS target and broadening the
areas of progress, past experiences
can provide indispensable guidance
on general policy directions. The
following are some of the policy
lessons emerging from past
successes and failures in hunger
reduction.
• Hunger reduction is necessary
for accelerating development and

poverty reduction. Hunger is, at
the same time, a consequence
and a cause of poverty. Hunger
negatively affects health, labour
productivity and investment
choices, perpetuating poverty.
Therefore targeted interventions
to ensure access to food are
needed.
• Agricultural growth is critical for
hunger reduction. Some 70
percent of the poor in developing
countries live in rural areas and
depend on agriculture for their
livelihoods, either directly or
indirectly. In the poorest of
countries, agricultural growth is
the driving force of the rural
economy. Particularly in the most
food-insecure countries,
agriculture is crucial for income
and employment generation
(Figures 32 and 33). Combating
hunger requires an expanded
commitment to agriculture and
rural development.
• Technology can contribute, but
under the right conditions.

local conditions that favour smallscale farmers, hastens poverty
reduction through increased farm
incomes and lower food prices.
Trade can contribute to hunger
reduction and poverty alleviation.
But gains from trade
liberalization are neither
automatic nor universal. Ensuring
benefits for the poor requires
attention to a range of other
factors, including market
infrastructure, institutions and
domestic policy reforms and
safety nets.
Public investment is essential for
agricultural growth. Public
investment in infrastructure,
agricultural research, education
and extension is indispensable for
promoting agricultural growth.
Actual public expenditures on
agriculture in many poor
countries do not reflect the
importance of the sector,
particularly in those with high
prevalence of undernourishment.
Development assistance does not
target the neediest countries.
External assistance to agriculture
and rural development has
declined compared with the levels
of the 1980s. It also tends not to
target sufficiently the countries
with low levels of undernourishment.
Peace and stability are a sine qua
non for hunger and poverty
reduction. Protracted conflicts
disrupt productive activities and
destroy infrastructure and
livelihoods, seriously
undermining food security.

Towards a policy agenda for
hunger reduction
Policy interventions for effective
hunger reduction must also be
designed in the context of emerging

global, regional and national trends
and challenges. Globalization will
not only open opportunities by
expanding markets for agricultural
commodities, but will also open
domestic markets to foreign
competitors. Rapid urbanization will
increase urban demand for food as
well as for food complying with more
exacting quality and safety
standards. Climate change and
degradation of ecosystems will pose
new challenges for expanding
production and conserving natural
resources. The spread of HIV/AIDS
will add to the burden of longlasting epidemics such as malaria.
Transboundary pests and diseases
risk endangering livelihoods.
Effective hunger reduction
requires coherence among policies.
Priority must be accorded to
financing agricultural and rural

development. The importance of
both overall economic growth and
agricultural growth is illustrated by
Figure 34. However, peace, stability
and “good governance” are crucial.
The specific policy agenda depends
on individual country circumstances,
but the following are some of the
essential elements that could
ensure better performance in
hunger reduction in the remaining
years until 2015.
Focus on hotspots. Programmes
and investments must focus on
poverty and hunger “hotspots” –
those areas around the world and
within a country where a significant
proportion of people are afflicted by
undernourishment and poverty.
Follow a twin-track approach to
hunger reduction. Longer-term

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006

29

Towards the Summit commitments

interventions to enhance productive
potential must be combined with
programmes and policies that
respond to the immediate needs of
the poor and the food-insecure. The
former must especially emphasize
agriculture and rural development
and include a pro-poor focus by
creating employment and ensuring
access by the poor to productive
assets – physical, human and
financial. The latter include social
safety nets, cash transfers, health
interventions and food and nutrition
programmes.
Enhance productivity of smallholder
agriculture. Successful actions to
improve the productivity of
smallholder agriculture must be
scaled up. Policies and programmes
for agriculture should aim at
strengthening the sector’s economic
impact on rural areas through the
generation of off-farm activities,
rural employment and wages.
Create an environment conducive to
private investment. Public
investments must be accompanied
by policies that induce
complementary flows of private
investment. The quality and
transparency of governance and
public administration, political
stability, reliable market institutions
and macroeconomic discipline and
stability are essential for this
purpose.
Combine poverty reduction with
increased provision of global public
goods. The creation of markets for
environmental goods and services
and the resulting price mechanism
will permit a more accurate
valuation of global public goods and
of trade-offs between agricultural
activities and environmental goods
and services. The resulting price

30

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006

mechanism can be used to “buy”
environmental services from
farmers, i.e. create an incentives
framework for farmers to adopt
practices that, for example,
preserve agricultural biological
diversity, conserve wildlife or reduce
carbon emissions in the
atmosphere. Such market
mechanisms (which are already at
work in some countries), can
contribute to both poverty reduction
and environmental and natural
resource sustainability.
Make trade work for the poor.
In view of the continuing
liberalization of world markets, the
developing countries must be
granted “policy space” for
developing their rural areas and
their agriculture. To benefit from
trade reform, developing countries
should be assisted in enhancing
domestic competitiveness through
policy and institutional reform (aid
for trade). Appropriate safety nets
are important in order to protect
vulnerable groups against the
immediate impact of trade reforms.
Coordinate domestic and
international resources for
agricultural and rural development.
Increasing investments in
agriculture and rural development is
essential for improved food security.
Governments of low-income
countries can contribute by directing
a greater portion of budgetary
expenditures towards these two
sectors. Donor countries must keep
their promise of contributing
0.7 percent of gross national income
to official development assistance
(ODA). ODA and public domestic
resources must be well coordinated
and targeted, and efforts must be
made to increase the effectiveness
of ODA.29

In a world that has the means for
feeding its population, the
persistence of hunger is a scandal.
We have learnt from experiences.
We know what needs to be done to
accelerate progress towards a world
free of hunger. There are more than
850 million people waiting for action.
We must step up dramatically our
efforts to reach the WFS hunger
reduction target. If the political will
is there, we can reach it.

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006

37

Tables
Notes for Table 1
World Food Summit goal: halve, between 1990–92 and 2015, the number of
undernourished people.
Millennium Development Goal 1, target 2: halve, between 1990 and 2015,
the proportion of people who suffer from hunger.
Countries revise their official statistics regularly for the past as well as the
present. The same holds for population data of the United Nations.
Whenever this happens, FAO revises its estimates of undernourishment
accordingly. Therefore users are advised to refer to changes of estimates
over time only within the same The State of Food Insecurity in the World
publication and refrain from comparing data published in editions for
different years.
Figures in square brackets following the country names refer to the
prevalence categories (proportion of the population undernourished in
2001–03):
[1] < 5 percent undernourished
[2] 5–9 percent undernourished
[3] 10–19 percent undernourished
[4] 20–34 percent undernourished
[5] ≥ 35 percent undernourished

Developing countries for which there were insufficient data are not listed in
the table.
* Current refers to 2001–03 estimates and baseline refers to 1990–92 for
developing countries and 1993–95 for transition countries.
** Although not listed separately, provisional estimates for Afghanistan,
Iraq, Papua New Guinea and Somalia have been included in the relevant
regional aggregates.
*** Eritrea and Ethiopia were not separate entities in 1990–92, but
estimates of the number and proportion of undernourished in the former
People’s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia are included in regional and
subregional aggregates for that period. Data shown for the two countries
correspond to 1993–95 estimates.
KEY
– Proportion less than 2.5 percent of undernourished.
SOURCES
Total population: United Nations. 2002. World Population Prospects. 2002
revision. New York.
Undernourishment: FAO estimates.

Notes for Table 2
* Data correspond to 1993–95 instead of 1990–92 and to 1994
instead of 1991.
** Figures refer only to Mainland China. Other figures include data for
Mainland China, Hong King Special Administrative Region, Macao Special
Administrative Region and Taiwan Province of China.
DEFINITIONS
Dietary energy supply (DES): Food available for human consumption,
expressed in kilocalories (kcal) per capita per day. At the country level,
it is calculated as the food remaining for human use after the deduction of
all non-food consumption (exports, animal feed, industrial use, seed and
wastage).
Poverty (population below US$1 purchasing power parity [PPP] per day):
The proportion of people below US$1/day is the percentage of the population
with average consumption expenditures less than $1.08/day measured in
1993 prices converted using purchasing power parity (PPP) rates. The
US$1.08/day standard was chosen to be equal to the median of the lowest
ten poverty lines among a set of low-income countries. The PPP conversion
factor used for this series is the number of units of a country’s currency
required to buy the same amount of goods and services in the domestic
market as a US dollar would buy in the United States of America. Data
showing as 2.0 signifies a poverty rate of less than 2.0 percent. Dates of the
survey years vary. For each country, data were included for the year closest
to 1990 (or 1993 for transition countries) from the period 1985–94 (or
1993–96 for transition countries) and for the last year available of the period
1995–2003, with a period of at least five years between the surveys.
Food aid received as a share of DES: Share of DES from food aid received
(cereals and non-cereals) to DES from all commodities. Data on food aid in
tonnes are converted into kilocalories using conversion factors by
commodity. Food aid in tonnes from shipments represents a transfer of food
commodities from donor to recipient countries, on a total-grant basis or on
highly concessional terms. Purchases made in the recipient countries are
excluded. Cereal food aid shipments are reported on a global trade year
basis (July/June), while non-cereal food aid shipments are reported on a
calendar year basis.
Capital stock in agriculture: The estimates of capital stock in agriculture
have been derived indirectly by the FAO Statistics Division using physical

38

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006

data on livestock, tractors, irrigated land and land under permanent crops,
etc. and the average prices for the year 1995.
External assistance to agriculture: This is the concessional and nonconcessional commitments made by bilateral and multilateral donors to
developing countries, transition countries and some developed countries for
the development of agriculture in the broad sense, which includes: land and
water; research, training and extension; inputs; agricultural services; crop
production, livestock, fisheries, forestry, agriculture (others, not elsewhere
specified), environment protection, rural development/infrastructure,
manufacturing of inputs, regional and river development, agro-industries.
Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita: GDP per capita is gross domestic
product divided by midyear population. Data are in constant 2000 US dollars.
Agriculture, value added per worker: Agriculture corresponds to
International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) divisions 1–5 and

not correct to talk about a region achieving

the goal. The same holds true for the
Millennium Development Goal 1.

adopted in March 2005, calls for: ownership
(i.e. aid should reflect recipient rather than

aligned with recipient countries’ budgetary

should be more donor coordination to exploit
complementarities, combined with simplified
procedures for disbursement).

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006

The FIVIMS Initiative and the hunger reduction commitments
As an active member of the food security community, I read this year's State of Food
Insecurity in the World report with a sense of outrage. What makes the report even
more disheartening is that, although in 1996 we made a commitment to halve the
number of hungry people by 2015, in reality we went into reverse after the 1996
World Food Summit, with 23 million people added to the ranks of the hungry between
1995–97 and 2001–03. This dismal performance all but wiped out the progress, which
had removed 26 million hungry people from the ranks of the undernourished during
the first half of the decade. The report rightly points out that we could have achieved
so much more in hunger reduction than we did.
Since 1996, we have seen the Millennium Declaration, the follow-up World Food
Summit: five years later in 2002, and a commitment to realizing the Right to Food
expressed in the Voluntary Guidelines adopted in 2004. If we are committed to putting
our actions where our stated commitments lie, we will need to step up progress
significantly in the fight against hunger and do a far better job than we have done so
far following the World Food Summit. Paradoxically, countries with high population
growth that have managed to prevent an increase in the number of hungry people are
still moving in the right direction towards achieving the Millennium commitment;
many of these countries are not making sufficient progress towards the World Food
Summit target, which requires a reduction in the absolute number of hungry people.
Globally, to reach the Millennium Development Goal on hunger reduction, we still
need to double the rate of current progress. To achieve the World Food Summit target
will require reducing the ranks of the undernourished annually by more than ten
times the total reduction between 1990–92 and 2001–03.
This report should be a wake up call to us all. The findings in this report are all the
more stark and all the more depressing given that, a few months ago, we learned
there are now more obese people in the world than hungry people. There were some
important successes in the 1990s, but overall our performance as food security
practitioners has not been up to the task.
Making a sizeable dent in the numbers of hungry people by 2015, and even
reaching the World Food Summit target, is not beyond us – between 1979–81 and
1990–92 more than 100 million people were removed from the ranks of the
undernourished. Those of us in development organizations have a duty to ensure that
the fight against hunger takes a place as prominent, if not more so, as the fight
against poverty. Freedom from hunger is the very foundation of life. As citizens of our
own countries, with voting rights, we have an obligation to ensure that our own
governments are committed to the fight against hunger both within and outside our
borders.
In this editorial I normally update you on the state of the FIVIMS Initiative. We have
recently completed our business planning process, focused on retooling and
reinvigorating our international partnership in food security activities. We have a draft
business plan, which is under discussion among our members. I look forward to
updating you in the future as to how the new interagency initiative will operate and
what will be its specific mandate in the fight against hunger.

The State of

Food Insecurity in the World
Ten years have elapsed since the World Food Summit (WFS) in Rome
pledged to halve the number of undernourished people in the world by no
later than 2015, and in October 2006 FAO's Committee on World Food
Security is conducting a mid-term review of progress towards this target.
On this occasion, the eighth edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the
World also examines progress towards the WFS target.
The main conclusion is that we have been standing still in terms of hunger
reduction. The number of hungry people in the developing countries has not
fallen relative to that of 1990-92, the established baseline period against
which progress in reducing hunger is measured. Several countries have
advanced towards the target but in many others the number of
undernourished people has risen.
Progress has been made towards the hunger reduction target of
Millennium Development Goal 1, which calls for a halving of the proportion
of undernourished people by 2015, and prospects for reaching the MDG
target are relatively promising. On the other hand, the more ambitious WFS
target will clearly not be met without a very serious intensification of
hunger reduction efforts.
The report presents a review of progress and setbacks in the various
regions and discusses some of the constraints to hunger reduction efforts
and challenges yet to be faced. It emphasizes the urgent need to broaden
the areas of progress if we are to be successful in achieving the WFS target.
The final section of The State of Food Insecurity in the World highlights
some of the main lessons learnt in hunger reduction and lays out a broad
agenda for accelerated progress. It concludes with an appeal for stepping
up action and emphasizes that, if the political will is harnessed, the WFS
target can be met.
