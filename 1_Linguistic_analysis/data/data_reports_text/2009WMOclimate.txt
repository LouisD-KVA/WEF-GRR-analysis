Foreword
Since 1993, the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) has been issuing its
annual “WMO Statement on the Status of
the Global Climate”, which has become an
authoritative regular source of information,
eagerly sought by the scientific community
and the media.
The present Statement is the latest addition to
this successful series, and a key result is that
the period 2000–2009 was the warmest decade on record since the beginning of modern
instrumental measurements around 1850.
A number of extreme weather and climate
events were recorded in 2009, including in
particular heatwaves in China, India and southern Europe, as well as in Australia. Severe
droughts, intense storms and flooding were
also registered in different parts of the world,
and the end of 2009 was notably cold in the
northern hemisphere, with heavy snowfall in
Europe, North America and northern Asia.

and precipitation variations, tropical cyclones,
drought and flooding, snow cover and sea
ice, the ozone layer and many other critical
weather, climate and water parameters monitored across the world over the year which
has concluded.
Equally outstanding were the continuing
efforts of several climate centres to develop
the long-term homogeneous datasets required
to support the authoritative assessments that
contributed to the work of WMO, the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change, the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, the World Climate Research
Programme and other key scientific activities
across the world.
I therefore wish to express the gratitude of
the World Meteorological Organization to all
contributors to the WMO Statement on the
Status of the Global Climate in 2009.

Furthermore, the year concluded with a moderate El Niño event, which is being continuously
monitored.
It is essential to underscore the vital role of
the National Meteorological Services of the
189 Members of WMO and of many WMO
partners for their key efforts to maintain the
necessary observing infrastructure and the
information systems, which permitted the
exchange of data and analyses of temperature

particularly warmer than the
long-term average, especially
during the austral winter and
late spring.

from 1961–1990 average

Global temperature assessment is provided
with an uncertainty margin that affects the
global sur face temperature
figures and consequently their
ranking, mainly as a result of the
existing gaps in data coverage.
The magnitude of the uncertainty
in assessing the global surface
temperature in 2009 is estimated
at 0.10°C. Therefore, the most
likely value of the global surface
temperature anomaly for 2009 is
between +0.34°C and +0.56°C.

The year 2009 is nominally ranked as the fifth
warmest year on record since the beginning
of instrumental climate records around 1850.
On the decadal scale, the analysis shows that
the 2000s decade (2000–2009) was warmer
than the 1990s (1990–1999), which in turn
were warmer than the 1980s (1980–1989) and
earlier decades.

Note: There are three independent datasets used for the
analysis of the global temperature anomaly. Based on two
global datasets maintained independently by the Met Office
Hadley Centre and Climatic Research Unit, University of
East Anglia in the United Kingdom and the National Climatic
Data Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NCDC–NOAA) in the United States, the
analysis of the global surface temperature for the year
2009 shows anomalies of +0.44°C (+0.59°F) and +0.46°C
(+0.63°F) in the two datasets, respectively, with reference
to the 1961–1990 long-term average of 14°C (57.2°F). A third

According to the reports provided by the
National Meteorological and Hydrological
Services, above-normal annual temperatures
were recorded in 2009 in most parts of the
continents. However, parts of the United States
and Canada, and central Siberia experienced
cooler temperatures than average. During the
year, extreme warm episodes were frequently
recorded in southern South America, Australia
and southern Asia. In the southern hemisphere,
August and November set new temperature
records.
Europe
In Europe, warmer-than-average temperatures
were recorded during most of the year. In
some parts of western and central Europe,
colder-than-average conditions were recorded
at the beginning of the year. Spring was very
warm in Europe. April was particularly mild
in Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria

was also warmer than the long-term average,
particularly over southern Europe. Spain had
the third warmest summer after the very hot
summers of 2003 and 2005. However, a very
cold October was reported in Scandinavia, with
mean temperature anomalies ranging from
–2°C to –4°C. Early winter 2009/2010 started
with an extended cold wave of more than a
week in most of Europe. On some days in
December, the minimum temperature dropped

predominance of below-normal temperatures
in Canada and above-normal temperatures
in the rest of the region. In late July, many
cities in Canada recorded their warmest daily
temperatures; for example, Victoria set a
new record of 35°C on 29 July. Conversely,
October was colder than the long-term average across the United States. For the nation

as a whole, it was the third coolest October on
record, with an average temperature anomaly
of –2.2°C (–4°F). Oklahoma recorded the lowest monthly mean temperature for October
(12.3°C); the previous record (12.4°C) was
set in 1925. December was also colder than
normal across most of the United States with
monthly temperature anomalies around –5°C
in the central and western regions.
South America
During 2009, warmer-than-normal conditions predominated across the region, with
the south most affected. Argentina had its
warmest year of the last five decades. The
austral summer was warmer than normal in
Chile, Argentina and eastern Brazil, while the
north-east of the region experienced coolerthan-normal conditions. Autumn (March to
May) was particularly warm in Argentina,
Uruguay, Paraguay and southern Brazil. In
fact, a large part of central Argentina recorded
the warmest autumn since 1961 with seasonal
temperature anomalies ranging between +2°C
and +3°C. August was exceptionally warm
in southern South America and many new
daily maximum temperature records were
set; for example, Buenos Aires set a new
record of 34.4°C on 30 August. However, in
June and July below-normal temperatures
were recorded in Paraguay, Uruguay and
southern Brazil. Abnormally cold conditions also prevailed in the southern part of
Argentina, with several late snowfalls and
frosts in November.

Australia
In Australia, 2009 was the second warmest
year in a temperature series that began in 1910.
The average temperature was 0.9°C above
the 1961–1990 long-term average. Summer
was very warm, except in the north, which
experienced colder-than-normal conditions in
conjunction with an active monsoon. Winter
was exceptionally mild over much of Australia.
In August, maximum temperatures were well
above normal across the entire continent,
recording up to 7°C above the monthly longterm average in some places; the national
mean maximum temperature anomaly of
+3.2°C was the highest ever recorded for
any month. November was also very warm
across the south-eastern region with mean
maximum temperature anomalies between
+4°C and +8ºC.

Heatwaves and cold waves
Italy recorded two heatwaves in the second
half of July with maximum daily temperatures above 40°C; some local temperatures
soared to 45°C. An extreme heatwave also hit
India during May, which caused 150 deaths.
Northern China also experienced a heatwave
during June when daily maximum temperatures rose above 40°C; historical maximum
temperature records were broken for the summer in some locations. Australia was marked
by exceptional heatwaves, which affected
the south-eastern part of the country in

and beginning of November. Unusually high
temperatures of above 40°C were recorded in
many places and for several consecutive days.
Several daily temperature records were broken, often by a wide margin; in some locations
the annual absolute maximum temperature
records were also broken, such as the 47°C
temperature recorded in Catamarca.

January/February heatwave was associated
with disastrous bushfires that caused more
than 173 fatalities. Victoria recorded its highest temperature with 48.8°C at Hopetoun, the
highest temperature ever recorded so far south
anywhere in the world.
Argentina was affected by an exceptional
heatwave affecting the northern and central
part of the country at the end of October

Northern China was affected by very low
temperatures during the first half of November
as part of an early cold wave. Large parts
of the United States, central and northern
Europe and northern Asia were affected by
an extended cold wave during the second
half of December, the intensity varying with
geographical location. For example, Germany
reported daily minimum temperatures ranging
between –10°C and –25°C with several locations setting new daily minimum records in
at least six decades. In Switzerland, Geneva
recorded –12.6°C, the lowest temperature for
December since the temperature dropped to
–14°C in 1968. Some minimum daily temperature records were also tied or broken in the
United States.

Global precipitation
Global precipitation during 2009 was near
the 1961–1990 average. However, regionally,
drier-than-average conditions were recorded
across Alaska’s panhandle, southern Australia,
southern South America, and parts of Western

south-eastern Brazil, Uruguay, parts of eastern
and south-eastern Asia, most of Europe and
the eastern half of the contiguous United
States experienced wetter conditions than
the long-term average.

Severe droughts
China suffered from severe drought during
most of the seasons in 2009. Water levels in
parts of the Gan and Xiangjiang Rivers were
the lowest in 50 years. In India, the poor monsoon season was reported to be one of the
weakest since 1972. It caused severe drought
impacts in 40 per cent of the districts and the
north-western and north-eastern parts of the
country were severely affected.
In East Africa the drought led to massive food
shortages. In Kenya the drought was responsible for severe damage to livestock and a
40 per cent decline in the maize harvest.
In Nor th America, Mexico experienced
severe-to-exceptional drought conditions by
September. In the United States, the western
region was the most affected by a moderateto-exceptional drought by the end of October.


Nevertheless, the total area affected by drought
in the United States during October was the
second smallest value recorded during the
decade.
Drought in central Argentina caused severe
damage to agriculture, livestock and water
resources. The situation was most severe at
the end of October, in combination with the
recorded high temperatures.

Intense storm events and flooding
At the end of January, Spain and France were
severely affected by winter storm Klaus,
the worst extra-tropical storm in a decade,
with wind speeds equivalent to a Category 3
hurricane. During the same month, a wintry storm combined with heavy snowfall
caused severe damage in Western Europe
and resulted in serious disruptions to air and
rail traffic in several countries. In late spring
and summer, a large number of thunderstorms with heavy rain, hail and tornadoes
caused local flooding and significant damage
across Germany. In September, several parts
of the Mediterranean region were affected
by extreme rainfall events. Total rainfall of
more than 300 mm was recorded in less than

48 hours in one location in south-eastern
Spain, where the long-term average of total
annual precipitation does not exceed 450 mm.
During the same month, intense rainfall
caused devastating damage to infrastructure
in several parts of northern Africa, including
Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. In Turkey the
extreme weather events recorded during
2009, including severe storms, tornadoes,
frosts, hail storms, floods and landslides,
marked a record high since 1941. November
brought severe flooding to areas of the northern United Kingdom, with daily rainfall of
more than 200 mm in Seathwaite, totalling 379
mm in 48 hours. It was the wettest November
for the United Kingdom as a whole since 1914.
The year ended with significant snowstorms
and extreme frosts all over Europe, which
resulted in some damage and transport disruptions. A record-breaking 13-month-long
storm-free period in Swedish coastal waters
ended on 25 December when local storm
winds swept the Swedish east coast.
During the beginning of the year heavy rainfall was observed in Colombia, producing
landslides and widespread floods. Northeast Brazil was severely affected by heavy
rainfall and flooding in April and May. In
July, a severe snowstorm – the worst in

15 years – hit the southern part of Argentina.
During the austral spring, particularly in
November, continuous, heavy and intense
rainfall in north-eastern Argentina, southern
Brazil and Uruguay caused flooding in many
places, affecting more than 15 000 people.
Total monthly precipitation records were
broken, with rainfall exceeding 500 mm in
many locations.
In Canada, Ontario experienced a record
number of witnessed tornadoes and a record
number of related fatalities. Canadian avalanches were almost double the yearly average
for the past decade and the worst since
2002/2003. A total of 25 deaths made it one
of the deadliest seasons. The northern plains
region of the United States was affected by
record flooding during March. As a whole, the
United States recorded the wettest October in
115 years. A major snowstorm hit the northeast region of the country in the second half of
December, setting new snowfall records from
Washington to Boston. Travel of every type
was disrupted; airports, interstate highways
and local roads were closed, and rail lines
were shut down.
In Central America, an intense storm in El
Salvador in November, associated in part

with Hurricane Ida, produced deadly floods
and landslides that claimed 192 lives.
In Asia, after the weak 2009 monsoon season,
southern India recorded severe flooding due to
incessant rain in late September and the first
week of October, and around 300 lives were
lost. Northern China was severely affected by
a snowstorm that occurred during the first half
of November as part of a strong cold air mass
outbreak. The snow fell one month earlier than
normal, breaking local weather records.
In western Africa, heavy and intense rainfall
in September caused flooding that affected
more than 100 000 people. The worst flooding
was observed in Burkina Faso, where 263 mm
of rain was recorded in less than 12 hours,
breaking a record set 90 years ago. Further
south on the continent, nearly 1 million people
in Zambia and Namibia were affected by torrential rain that caused rivers to overflow their
banks, flooding homes and cropland.
Australia was also affected by local flooding.
Heavy monsoon rains caused widespread
flooding in north-eastern Australia in January
and early February. Subsequently, coastal
Queensland and New South Wales were the
hardest hit by several heavy rains, with daily
rainfall totals in excess of 300 mm. Conversely,
numerous duststorms af fected eastern
Australia in the second half of September
and early October. The most severe duststorm occurred on 22–23 September and
covered large parts of New South Wales and
Queensland, where the visibility was reduced
to 100–200 m in both Sydney and Brisbane.

End of La Niña and development of El Niño
La Niña-like conditions were present in early
2009, followed by the development of El Niño
patterns starting in June 2009. During June–
September 2009, sea surface temperatures were
generally about 1°C warmer than the long-term
average across the central and eastern equatorial
Pacific. There was a rapid intensification of the
event to moderate levels during October, with
the peak of the mature phase being reached in
late December. Most equatorial regions east of
the Date Line were more than 1°C warmer than
average by that time, with a few regions more
than 2°C above average.

Tropical cyclone season
The 2009 Atlantic hurricane season closed
with the fewest named storms and hurricanes
since 1997, most likely owing to the unfavourable cyclonic conditions caused in part by El
Niño. A total of nine named tropical storms
were formed, including three hurricanes, two
of which were major hurricanes at Category 3
strength or higher, compared with averages
of 11, 6 and 2, respectively.
In the Eastern North Pacific, 20 named tropical storms were recorded, 8 of which evolved
into hurricanes and 5 of which became major
hurricanes, compared with averages of 16, 9
and 4, respectively.
In the western North Pacific, 22 named tropical
storms were recorded, 13 of which reached the
intensity of typhoon, compared with the longterm averages of 27 and 14, respectively. Heavy
precipitation associated with typhoons Ketsana
and Parma was observed across the south of
Luzon Island in the Philippines. The resulting
flood disaster caused more than 900 fatalities. In August, Typhoon Morakot swept across
Taiwan Province of China and caused more than
600 deaths and severe damage to agriculture and
infrastructure. Hundreds of roads and bridges
on the island were destroyed by floods.
The Australian and South Pacific Ocean cyclone
seasons recorded near-average activity. In
the Australian region, there were 10 systems
during the season. Although it did not make
landfall, Hamish was the most significant,
reaching Category 5 intensity. It was the most
intense cyclone observed off the eastern
Queensland coast since 1918.
The South Indian Ocean cyclone season
recorded near-average activity with 16 storms,
7 of which were cyclones. Tropical Cylcone
Fanele made landfall in Madagascar in January
and brought heavy rain and strong winds and
affected nearly 28 000 people.

from the Nimbus-7 Scanning Multichannel
Microwave Radiometer (SSMR) and DMSP
SSM/I Passive Microwave Data datasets are
used to generate the monthly records of seaice extent and sea-ice concentration for the
Arctic and Antarctica from satellite passive
microwave data.
Arctic sea-ice extent during the 2009 melt
season was a minimum extent of 5.10 million km2, ranking third lowest on record after
2007 (4.13 million km2) and 2008 (4.52 million
km2) since satellite measurements began in
1979. Compared with the long-term average

of the reference period 1979–2000, the Arctic
sea ice at the end of the melt season in 2009
was 76 per cent of the long-term average of
6.71 million km2 compared with 67 per cent
in 2008 and 62 per cent in 2007. According to
scientific measurements, Arctic sea ice has
declined dramatically over the past 30 years,
with the most extreme decline seen in the
summer melt season.

5.5 million km2 more than the 1979–2000
long-term average and about 6 million km2
less than the record of almost 30 million km2
in 2000. Compared with the average size over
the 7 September–13 October time period, the
ozone hole in 2009 was the fifteenth largest
on record since satellite records began in
1979. Measured in Dobson Units (DU), the

minimum daily minimum ozone during 2009
was reached on 26 September with 94.0 DU.
This is below the 1979–2000 long-term average
of 125.4 DU. This ranks 2009 (together with
1991) as the seventh lowest daily minimum
ozone on record in the southern hemisphere.
The record low was observed in 1994 with
73.0 DU.

Source and methodology for global surface
temperature assessment
Global average temperature records are
essential to help understand how the climate
is changing. To understand changes and variations in the climate it is essential to know
how the surface temperature changes – from
month to month, up to decade to decade. Global
average temperature records provide this vital
information. From these records it can be seen
how warm specific months, years or decades
are, and trends can be discerned in the climate
system over longer periods of time.
The global surface temperature assessment
is based on the instrumental records of the
air temperature measured at 1.25 to 2 metres
above the surface level on the land. Sea surface temperature measurements are recorded
by various observation platforms, including
ships and buoys. The annual assessment is
based on these measurements after they have
been quality controlled to filter data errors
and homogenized.
There are three centres that maintain global
climate datasets and calculate global average
temperature and related anomalies at monthly
and annual timescales:

12

•

Met Office, UK, in collaboration with the
Climatic Research Unit at the University of
East Anglia (United Kingdom);

•

National Climatic Data Center, which is part
of NOAA (United States);

•

Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which
is part of NASA (United States).

The development of climate datasets is based
on the following:
• Routinely disseminated daily and monthly
weather and climate observations by the
National Meteorological and Hydrological
Services of the 189 WMO Members following the WMO standards for data collection,
quality control and exchange;
•

Historical climate records dating back to
1850, including those available from marine
climate summaries;

•

Recovered old climate records worldwide
as part of continuous data rescue efforts
promoted by WMO and its Members;

•

Peer reviewed scientific methods for quality
control, homogenization and interpolation
to constitute high-quality global climate
datasets.

Temperature anomalies
Absolute temperatures are not used directly
to calculate the global average temperature.
They are first converted into anomalies,
which are the difference in temperature
from the normal level. The normal level is
calculated for each observation location
by taking the long-term average for that
area over a base period. One of the main
reasons for using anomalies is that they
remain fairly constant over large areas. The
anomaly method also helps to avoid biases.
For example, if actual temperatures were

used and information from an Arctic observation station were missing for that month,
the global temperature record therefore
would seem warmer. Thus, when anomalies
are used such missing data will not bias the
temperature record.

Accuracy of the observations
Each observation station follows international
standards for taking observations set out by
WMO. Each National Meteorological Service
provides reports on how its data are collected

and processed to ensure consistency. This
includes recording information about the
local environment around the observation
station and any changes to that environment.
This is important for ensuring the required
data accuracy and performing homogeneity
tests and adjustments. There are additional
uncertainties because temperatures over large
areas of the Earth are not observed as a matter of routine. These elements are taken into
account by factoring the uncertainty into global
average temperature calculations, thereby
producing a temperature range rather than
one uniquely definite figure.
