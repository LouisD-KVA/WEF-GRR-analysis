FOREWORD

I am heartened to see that the world is paying
more attention to the issue of food loss and waste
and is calling for more decisive action to address
it. The growing awareness and increase in calls
for action are rooted in the strong negative
moral connotations associated with food loss
and waste. These are partly based on the fact
that losing food implies unnecessar y pressure
on the environment and the natural resources
that have been used to produce it in the first
place. It essentially means that land and water
resources have been wasted, pollution created
and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted to no
purpose. I also frequently wonder how we can
allow food to be thrown away when more than
820 million people in the world continue to go
hungr y ever y day.

possible – how much food is lost and wasted, as
well as where and why. Secondly, we need to be
clear about our underlying reasons or objectives
for reducing food loss and waste – be they related
to food securit y or the environment. Thirdly, we
need to understand how food loss and waste,
as well as the measures to reduce it, affect the
objectives being pursued. This report sheds light
on these three dimensions in order to help design
more informed and better policies for food loss
and waste reduction.
Concerning the first dimension, the surprising
fact is how little we really know about how much
food is lost or wasted, and where and why this
happens. A broad estimate, prepared for FAO in
2011, suggested that around a third of the world’s
food was lost or wasted every year. This estimate
is still widely cited due to a lack of information
in this field, but it can only be considered as
very rough. It is therefore in the process of being
replaced by two indices, thanks to efforts by FAO
and UN Environment to estimate more carefully
and more precisely how much food is lost in
production or in the supply chain before it reaches
the retail level (through the Food Loss Index) or
is subsequently wasted by consumers or retailers
(through the Food Waste Index). Initial estimates
made by FAO for the Food Loss Index, which I
am pleased to release through this report, tell
us that globally around 14 percent of the world’s
food is lost from production before reaching the
retail level. Estimates for the Food Waste Index
are under preparation by UN Environment and
will complement the Food Loss Index to provide a
better understanding of how much food is lost or
wasted in the world. These indices will allow us
to monitor progress towards SDG Target 12.3 over
time, starting from a more solid baseline.

International attention on the issue of food loss
and waste is firmly ref lected in the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development. Specifically, Target
12.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), which embody this agenda, calls for
the halving by 2030 of per capita global food
waste at the retail and consumer levels and the
reduction of food losses along production and
supply chains, including post-har vest losses.
Many countries are already taking action to
reduce food loss and waste, but the challenges
ahead remain significant and we need to step
up efforts. Furthermore, as this report arg ues,
efforts to meet SDG Target 12.3 could contribute
to meeting other SDG targets, not least that
of achieving Zero Hunger, in line with the
integrated nature of the 2030 Agenda.
However, as we strive to make progress towards
reducing food loss and waste, we can only
be truly effective if our efforts are informed
by a solid understanding of the problem.
Three dimensions need to be considered.
Firstly, we need to know – as accurately as

for private actors to reduce food loss and waste
or remove the barriers that prevent them from
doing so. The broad public objectives that this
report considers are twofold: improving the
food securit y situation of v ulnerable groups
and reducing the environmental footprint
associated with food that is lost or wasted.

waste are concentrated and the reasons why they
occur. Evidence presented in this report shows
that losses and waste tend to be higher for some
specific commodit y groups, although they can
occur at all stages of the food supply chain to
different degrees. However, what really struck
me is the vast range in terms of percentages of
food loss and waste for the same commodities
and the same stages in the supply chain both
within and across countries. This suggests that
there is considerable potential to reduce food loss
and waste where percentage losses are higher
than in other places. However, it also shows that
we cannot generalize about the occurrence of
food loss and waste across food supply chains
but must, on the contrar y, identif y critical loss
points in specific supply chains as a crucial step
in taking appropriate countermeasures.

A key arg ument in this report is that the linkages
between food loss and waste, on the one hand,
and food securit y and environmental impacts, on
the other, are complex and need to be thoroughly
understood. Positive outcomes from reducing
food loss and waste are far from g uaranteed, and
the impacts will differ according to where food
loss and waste is reduced. It is exactly for this
reason that policymakers need to be clear about
the objectives they choose to pursue. Focusing on
one objective will indeed have implications for
where food loss and waste reductions can be
most effective.

Regarding the second dimension, although the
SDGs include the reduction of food loss and
waste as a target in its own right, we need to
be clear about why we are pursuing it – or what
is the underlying objective. Individual actors,
from farmers and fishers right up to consumers,
may have a private interest in reducing
food loss or waste to increase their profits
or income, their personal well-being or
that of their families. However, this private
incentive is not always strong since reducing
food loss and waste may require investing
money or time which, in the perception of
these actors, could outweigh the benefits.
There may also be barriers that prevent private
actors from making these investments, e.g.
credit constraints or a lack of information
about options for reducing food loss and waste.
On the other hand, there may be a stronger
public interest in reducing food loss and waste
because it contributes to other public objectives.
This calls for public inter ventions in the form
of investments or policies that create incentives

For instance, if the objective is to improve food
securit y, reducing on-farm losses – particularly
on small farms in low-income countries with
high levels of food insecurit y – is likely to
have strong positive impacts. It may directly
improve food securit y in the affected farm
households and may also have positive effects
in local areas, and even beyond, if more food
becomes available. Reducing food loss and
waste further along the food supply chain
may improve food securit y for consumers, but
farmers may actually be negatively affected if
demand for their produce declines. On the other
hand, while reducing consumer food waste in
high-income countries with low levels of food
insecurit y may have some impact on v ulnerable
people locally through food collection and
redistribution initiatives, the impact on the
food insecure in distant low-income countries is
likely to be negligible.
| vi |

If the objectives for reducing food loss and
waste are essentially environmental, the
situation changes. In the case of GHGs, these
accumulate throughout the supply chain.
Therefore, cutting waste by consumers will have
the biggest impact because food wasted at this
stage represents a larger amount of embedded
GHG emissions. In the case of land and water,
the environmental footprint is tied mainly to the
primar y production phase. Therefore, reducing
food loss and waste at any stage of the food
supply chain can contribute to reducing
overall land and water use at the global level.
However, if you want to address local land and
water scarcit y, measures to reduce food loss are
likely to be more effective if they occur at the
farm level or at stages in the supply chain close
to the farm level.

I invite you to read this report carefully as it
examines the complex ways in which food loss
and waste – and the measures taken to address
it – affects food securit y and the environment.
The report does not claim to have all the answers,
particularly as it acknowledges the important
information gaps that stand in the way of a
comprehensive analysis. Among other things, the
report attempts to highlight precisely where there
is a need for a more thorough understanding
of the issues, both through more and better
data and improved and expanded analysis. It is
my hope that it can make a contribution to the
debate on how to address the problem of food
loss and waste most effectively and in ways that
actually make a difference in terms of improved
food securit y and environmental sustainabilit y,
following the spirit of the 2030 Agenda.

METHODOLOGY

The preparation of The State of Food and Agriculture 2019 began with an inception workshop, held at FAO
headquarters in Rome on 10 September 2018 and attended by members of a panel of external experts and
FAO specialists. Following the workshop, an advisor y group representing all relevant FAO technical units
and chaired by the Deput y-Director of FAO’s Agricultural Development Economics Division was formed
to assist in the drafting process. At a seminar held on 17 October 2018, the research and writing team and
the advisor y group discussed the report’s outline. The first three draft chapters were presented to the
advisor y group on 18 Januar y 2019. Based on comments received from the advisor y group, the team
revised the draft. The first full draft was then presented to the advisor y group and panel of external
experts on 1 Februar y and discussed at a second workshop held on 14–15 Februar y. With inputs from that
workshop, the report was revised and presented to the management team of FAO’s Economic and Social
Development Department. The revised draft was sent for comments to other FAO departments and to the
FAO regional offices for Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the
Caribbean, and the Near East and North Africa, as well as to external reviewers. Comments were
incorporated in the final draft, which was reviewed by the Assistant Director-General of the Economic
and Social Development Department, and then submitted to the Office of the FAO Director-General on
9 July 2019. In drafting the report, the research and writing team drew on background papers prepared by
FAO and external experts.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
FOOD LOSS AND WASTE – FRAMING THE
ISSUES TO FACILITATE ACTION

Responding to all these questions will require
access to proper information.

Reducing food loss and waste is widely seen as
an important way to reduce production costs
and increase the efficiency of the food system,
improve food securit y and nutrition, and
contribute towards environmental sustainabilit y.
Growing attention to food loss and waste is
ref lected in the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). SDG Target 12.3 calls for halving per
capita global food waste at the retail and consumer
levels and reducing food loss along production
and supply chains (including post-harvest losses)
by 2030. Reducing food loss and waste also
has the potential to contribute to other SDGs,
including the Zero Hunger goal (SDG 2), which
calls for an end to hunger, the achievement
of food securit y and improved nutrition, and
the promotion of sustainable agriculture.
The expected positive environmental impacts
from reducing food loss and waste would
also affect, among others, SDG 6 (sustainable
water management), SDG 13 (climate change),
SDG 14 (marine resources), SDG 15 (terrestrial
ecosystems, forestr y, biodiversit y), and many
other SDGs.

When considering actions and policy options,
the report arg ues that food loss and waste
reduction should be seen as a way to achieve
other objectives, notably improved efficiency
in the food system, improved food securit y
and nutrition, and improved environmental
sustainabilit y. How policymakers prioritize
these different dimensions, and the information
available on how food loss and waste affects
them, will shape the most appropriate mix of
inter ventions and policies to reduce food loss
and waste.

KNOWING WHAT CONSTITUTES FOOD LOSS
AND WASTE AND HOW TO MEASURE IT
PRECEDES TAKING ACTION
The notion of food being lost or wasted is
deceptively simple, but in practice there is no
commonly agreed definition of food loss and
waste. The various definitions often ref lect
the different problems that stakeholders or
analysts focus on or associate with food loss
and waste. Consequently, analysis of food
loss and waste is hampered by this lack of a
common definition. FAO has worked towards
the harmonization of concepts related to food
loss and waste, and the definitions adopted
in this report are the result of a consensus
reached in consultation with experts in this
field. This report understands food loss and
waste as the decrease in quantit y or qualit y of
food along the food supply chain. Empirically it
considers food losses as occurring along the
food supply chain from har vest/slaughter/catch
up to, but not including, the retail level.
Food waste, on the other hand, occurs at the
retail and consumption level. This definition
also aligns with the distinction implicit in
SDG Target 12.3. This report also asserts that,
although there may be an economic loss, food
diverted to other economic uses, such as animal
feed, is not considered as quantitative food

While the reduction of food loss and waste
appears as a clear and desirable objective, actual
implementation is not simple and its complete
elimination may not be realistic. This report
acknowledges the need to reduce food loss
and waste, presents new insights on what is
known and what is not, and provides g uidance
on how to target inter ventions and policies
depending on policymakers’ objectives and the
information available. Deciding on concrete
actions, inter ventions or policies to reduce food
loss and waste requires answers to a number of
questions: In which locations and stages of the
supply chain is food lost or wasted and to what
extent? Why does food loss and waste occur?
How can it be reduced? What are the costs
involved? And, ultimately, who benefits from
reducing food loss and waste, and who loses?

loss or waste. Similarly, inedible parts are not
considered as food loss or waste.

that measure food loss and waste in countries
all over the world. It illustrates how food loss
and waste varies across stages in the food supply
chain, as well as between regions and commodit y
groups. The meta-analysis finds a wide range
of values for percentage losses at each stage in
the food supply chain. This highlights the need
to measure losses carefully for specific value
chains to identif y concretely where significant
losses occur, so as to better understand where to
inter vene. Generally levels of loss are higher for
fruits and vegetables than for cereals and pulses.
However, even for the latter, significant levels
are found in sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern and
South-Eastern Asia, while they are limited in
Central and Southern Asia. Studies on waste at
the consumer stage are confined to high-income
countries; they indicate that waste levels are high
for all t y pes of food, but particularly for highly
perishable foods such as animal products and
fruits and vegetables.

Food loss and waste has t ypically been measured
in physical terms using tonnes as reporting units.
Although useful for estimating environmental
impacts, this measurement fails to account for
the economic value of different commodities
and can risk attributing a higher weight to
low-value products just because they are heavier.
When devising inter ventions and policies to
reduce food loss and waste, it is important to
account for the monetar y costs and benefits of
any reduction. The report acknowledges this
by adopting a measure that accounts for the
economic value of produce.
Agreeing on a consistent approach to monitor
SDG Target 12.3 is an important step in
framing the debate on food loss and waste
and will provide g uidance on where to
inter vene. Efforts are underway by FAO and
the United Nations Environment Programme
(UN Environment) to measure progress towards
SDG Target 12.3 through two separate indices:
the Food Loss Index (FLI) and the Food Waste
Index (FWI). This report releases the first
estimates for the FLI, prepared by FAO, which
indicates that globally – in terms of economic
value – around 14 percent of food produced is
lost from post-har vest up to, but not including,
the retail level. For the F WI, covering retail and
consumption, significant work has been carried
out to prepare the methodological framework,
but the first estimates are yet to be released by
UN Environment.

Causes of food loss and waste differ widely
along the food supply chain. Important causes
of on-farm losses include inadequate har vesting
time, climatic conditions, practices applied
at har vest and handling, and challenges in
marketing produce. Significant losses are caused
by inadequate storage conditions as well as
decisions made at earlier stages of the supply
chain, which predispose products to a shorter
shelf life. Adequate cold storage, in particular,
can be crucial to prevent quantitative and
qualitative food losses. During transportation,
good physical infrastructure and efficient trade
logistics are of key importance to prevent food
losses. Processing and packaging can play a role
in preser ving foods, but losses can be caused
by inadequate facilities as well as technical
malfunction or human error.

VARIATIONS IN LEVELS OF FOOD LOSS
AND WASTE THAT OCCUR ACROSS
REGIONS, COMMODITIES AND SUPPLY
CHAINS CAN PROVIDE PRELIMINARY
GUIDANCE ON WHERE TO INTERVENE …

The causes of food waste at the retail level are
linked to limited shelf life, the need for food
products to meet aesthetic standards in terms of
colour, shape and size, and variabilit y in demand.
Consumer waste is often caused by poor purchase

To gain further insight into the location and
extent of food loss and waste, FAO has also
conducted a meta-analysis of existing studies

and meal planning, excess buying (inf luenced
by over-large portioning and package sizes),
confusion over labels (best before and use by)
and poor in-home storing.

EFFORTS TO MONITOR FOOD LOSS AND
WASTE AT A MORE DISAGGREGATED
SCALE ARE BEING RAMPED UP, BUT
INFORMATION IS STILL LIMITED

… BUT THIS GUIDANCE, WHICH IS BASED
ON AVERAGE LOSSES AND WASTE, MAY
NOT BE ENOUGH SINCE THERE ARE
SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS WITHIN
REGIONS AND COMMODITY GROUPS

Efforts are ongoing to improve data on losses
and waste at a finer scale. These data will be
key, as inter ventions to reduce food loss and
waste require an understanding of where in the
food supply chain, for which products, and in
which regions or countries food loss and waste
occurs. Data should also indicate how large
losses are and what their underlying causes
and drivers are. Starting in 2015, FAO’s Global
Initiative on Food Loss and Waste (Save Food)
has carried out a number of case studies to
identif y critical loss points in the food supply
chain where food losses have the highest
magnitude, the greatest impact on food securit y,
and the largest economic dimensions. This work
covers different commodities in the countries
of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Its results
indicate that har vesting is the most frequently
identified critical loss point for all t y pes of food,
while inadequate storage facilities and poor
handling practices were identified as the main
causes of on-farm storage losses. For fruits, roots
and tubers, packaging and transportation also
appeared critical. These results on critical loss
points and underlying causes are valuable in
providing g uidance when identif ying potential
inter ventions for food loss reduction.

The meta-analysis finds a wide range of values
for percentage losses even within the same
region or commodit y group, or at the same
point on the supply chain. For example, in
sub-Saharan Africa the obser vations on fruits
and vegetables report on-farm losses ranging
from 0 to 50 percent, a ver y broad range.
An inter vention to reduce these losses needs
to target the upper end of this range to have
maximum impact. Another example concerns
losses of cereals and pulses in the processing
and packaging phase in sub-Saharan Africa,
which would appear to be low on average (the
median loss is less than 5 percent), but where
one quarter of the obser vations report between
10 and 20 percent losses. Looking only at
average losses may not give an accurate picture
regarding whether an inter vention for a specific
commodit y would make sense, nor would it
indicate where a potential inter vention should
take place.

EVEN WITH LIMITED INFORMATION,
GETTING THE INCENTIVES RIGHT AND
OVERCOMING CONSTRAINTS WILL
FACILITATE ACTIONS TO REDUCE FOOD
LOSS AND WASTE

The variabilit y of obser vations highlights the
need to measure losses carefully for specific
value chains to identif y concretely where
significant losses occur. Nonetheless, sur veys
into the extent, location and causes of food loss
and waste are complex and costly. As a result,
only 39 countries have officially reported data on
an annual basis between 1990 and 2017 to FAO.

This report aims to provide g uidance on policy
and inter ventions to reduce food loss and waste
even in the face of the limited information
available. This is based on an incremental
arg ument starting from the business case for
reducing food loss and waste, where incentives
and adequate information can encourage the
| xiv |

private sector to reduce food loss and waste
in their own interest. This may also bring
benefits to societ y, and providing information
in these situations is particularly important.
The incremental approach then continues by
making the economic case for food loss and
waste reduction, looking beyond the business
case, and is based on the broader benefits that
can accrue to societ y from reducing food loss and
waste. These may result in improved incomes
for other actors in societ y. Other benefits,
which will not be financial in nature but are
no less important, constitute the final step in
the incremental justification for reducing food
loss and waste. Among these other benefits, the
report focuses on: (i) improved food securit y and
nutrition; and (ii) environmental sustainabilit y.
Thinking through each justification for reducing
food loss and waste can provide some indication
of how and where to inter vene.

managing waste will also affect the incentives for
actors to reduce food loss and waste. For
example, if food prices are kept artificially low
by subsidies, or waste management costs for
individuals are not linked to the amount of waste
generated, then the incentive to reduce food loss
and waste will diminish.
However, a number of factors may prevent
actors from taking fully rational decisions on the
levels of food loss and waste acceptable to them.
In particular, food operators and consumers
may have inadequate information on how much
food they lose or waste, on the options available
for reducing loss and waste, or on the benefits
of doing so. Even the limited data available
can be useful in informing people’s decisions
on food loss and waste. Stakeholders may also
face constraints that prevent or deter them
from implementing actions to reduce food loss
and waste. For example, without financial help
private actors in developing countries (especially
smallholders) may not be able to bear the high
upfront cost associated with implementing such
actions. Thus, lack of access to credit can become
a barrier to taking measures towards food loss
and waste reduction. Improving credit access
could be an option for reducing food loss and
waste even in the absence of detailed information
on where losses occur.

The business case for reducing food loss and
waste rests on the private gains that can be
realized by stakeholders who reduce levels of
food loss and waste. The assumption is that
actors in the food supply chain make rational
decisions that maximize their profits (in the case
of producers or suppliers) or their well-being (in
the case of consumers). Reducing food loss and
waste generally entails costs, and suppliers and
consumers will only undertake the necessar y
efforts if these are outweighed by the benefits.
In the case of producers, the beneficial impact of
reducing food losses by investing in technolog y
or improved practices may be too small in
relation to the investment cost. For consumers,
the value of their time may be too high to
justif y efforts to plan food purchases and meal
preparation better and to manage food stocks.

THERE IS A RATIONALE FOR
PUBLIC-SECTOR INTERVENTION TO
REDUCE FOOD LOSS AND WASTE
The broader case for reducing food loss and waste
looks beyond the business case to include gains
that societ y can reap but which individual actors
may not take into account. There are three main
t y pes of societal gains which justif y inter ventions
to reduce food loss and waste beyond the pure
business case, namely: (i) increased productivit y
and economic growth, referred to in this
report as the economic case; (ii) improved food
securit y and nutrition; and (iii) mitigation of
environmental impacts of losing and wasting

The business case revolves around private
monetar y benefits and costs. Thus, incentivizing
the business case will involve identif ying options
that either increase the net benefits or provide
better information on the existing net benefits.
Any policies that affect food prices or the costs of

of inter ventions.

various t y pes of actions or policies. They can
improve public ser vices and infrastructure,
provide financial incentives through taxes and
subsidies or introduce reg ulations.
When taking action to reduce food loss and
waste, the t y pe of externalit y – food securit y and
nutrition as opposed to environmental impacts –
will determine which t y pe of inter vention is most
appropriate along a value chain and in which
geographical location.

The first t ype of gains can be measured in
monetar y terms – that is to say, these gains are
economic in nature. However, the impact of
efforts to reduce food loss and waste depends
on how their effect on prices is transmitted
throughout the food supply chain; some actors
may benefit, others may lose out. Hence, an
inter vention to reduce food loss and waste should
take account of the distributional consequences.

THE IMPACT OF REDUCTIONS IN FOOD
LOSS AND WASTE ON FOOD SECURITY
AND NUTRITION DEPENDS ON WHERE
THESE OCCUR ALONG THE SUPPLY
CHAIN …
Food loss and waste has potential effects on
food securit y and nutrition through changes
in the four dimensions of food securit y: food
availabilit y, access, utilization and stabilit y.
However, the links between food loss and
waste reduction and food securit y are complex,
and positive outcomes are not always certain.
Reaching acceptable levels of food securit y and
nutrition inevitably implies certain levels of food
loss and waste. Maintaining buffers to ensure
food stabilit y requires a certain amount of food
to be lost or wasted. At the same time, ensuring
food safet y involves discarding unsafe food,
which then gets counted as lost or wasted, while
higher-qualit y diets tend to include more highly
perishable foods.

The rationale for government inter vention aimed
at inf luencing decisions by individual suppliers
and consumers rests on two pillars. First, the
incentive for individual actors to reduce food
loss or waste – the business case – may be
weak and/or these actors may face constraints
in implementing them. Therefore, the business
case for food loss and waste reduction alone
may not lead to a significant reduction in losses
and waste. Second, the decisions of individual
suppliers and consumers concerning levels of
food loss and waste are unlikely to take account
of the negative implications for societ y of food
loss and waste. These negative externalities,
particularly the environmental impacts,
are potentially large and provide a strong
justification for public inter vention.

Location and point in the food supply chain
matter for the food securit y and nutrition impact
of reducing food loss and waste. How the impacts
on the different dimensions of food securit y
play out and affect the food securit y of different
population groups depends on where in the food
supply chain the reduction in losses or waste
takes place as well as on where nutritionally
v ulnerable and food-insecure people are located
geographically. Importantly, not ever ybody
stands to gain.

Governments can inter vene in different ways.
If individual suppliers or consumers are unaware
of the magnitude and consequences of their
losses, governments can raise awareness of the
benefits of reducing food loss and waste and
convince them of the business case for doing so.
Governments can also inf luence the business
case for food loss and waste reduction through
| xvi |

Reducing on-farm losses – particularly for
small-scale farmers in low-income countries
– can allow farmers to improve their diets
due to increased food availabilit y and gain
higher incomes if selling part of their produce.
It can also lead to increased supply and lower
prices further along the food supply chain and
eventually for consumers. On the other hand, if
a processor reduces losses, while this will also
lead to increased supply and lower prices further
down the food supply chain and eventually
for consumers, it may result in farmers seeing
reduced demand for their produce and thus
lower income and worsening food securit y.
Reducing consumers’ food waste may improve
their food availabilit y and access, in addition
to that of possible direct beneficiaries of food
redistribution schemes, but farmers and other
supply chain actors may be worse off as they
are selling less and/or at lower prices. Also in
international food supply chains, reducing food
waste by consumers and retailers in high-income
countries may negatively affect poor farmers
in lower-income countries if they are the
primar y suppliers.

The increased availabilit y of food locally in these
settings does not mean that these surpluses
are available for poor and food-insecure people
in a distant countr y with high levels of
food insecurit y.
The prevalence of food insecurit y can be relevant
for determining food loss and waste reduction
strategies for a given countr y’s food insecurit y
challenges. In lower-income countries, where
food insecurit y is often severe, increasing
access to food is critical; and access itself is
likely to be closely associated with availabilit y.
Preventing food losses at the local level in
smallholder production can both alleviate food
shortages and increase farmers’ incomes, thus
improving access. If reductions in losses are
large enough to affect prices beyond the local
area, the urban food insecure could also benefit.
At the other extreme, in high-income countries,
the problem of access is relevant for a much
smaller share of the population; for many, the
priorit y is nutrition and qualit y of diet. A broad
campaign to reduce food waste is unlikely to
benefit the small proportion of people facing
food insecurit y in high-income countries.
For these countries, more targeted inter ventions,
such as food redistribution, can contribute to
access to food; however, eliminating remaining
levels of food insecurit y will also have to rely on
a broader set of social policies.

… AS WELL AS WHERE THEY OCCUR
GEOGRAPHICALLY, WHICH IS CRUCIAL IN
DESIGNING INTERVENTIONS TO BENEFIT
THE FOOD INSECURE
The impact of a reduction in food loss and
waste will go beyond the immediate location of
the reduction as the effects ripple through the
supply chain – leading to lower prices – and more
broadly through the economy. However, the exact
impact will depend on how closely markets are
integrated and how effectively price changes
are transmitted. A key factor here is distance
or proximit y to the location of the reduction.
Reducing on-farm losses on small farms in
lower-income countries may have a strong
local food securit y impact. On the other hand,
reducing food waste among consumers in
high-income countries is unlikely to have the
positive food securit y effects generally expected.

REDUCING FOOD LOSS AND WASTE
LESSENS THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF
FOOD PRODUCTION FOR A GIVEN LEVEL
OF FOOD CONSUMPTION
From an environmental perspective, food
production is resource-intensive and has
significant environmental impacts. If food is
lost or wasted, this entails poor use of resources
and negative environmental impacts. It is
forecast that a growing population and rising
incomes will lead to an increase in demand for
agricultural products by 35 –50 percent between
2012 and 2050, exerting even more pressure on

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

the world’s natural resources. This emphasizes
the urgency of reducing food loss and waste.
Independently of the environmental objective,
reducing food loss and waste will always
improve resource use efficiency because
more food reaches the consumer for a given
level of resources used (or, conversely, fewer
resources may be used to ensure a given level
of food reaches the consumer). Such reductions
always lower GHG emissions per unit of food
consumed. In the context of a growing, wealthier
population, using resources more efficiently
and reducing GHGs emitted per unit of food
consumed will be paramount in meeting growing
demand sustainably.

in the food supply chain the loss or waste is
incurred; which commodities are involved; which
environmental footprints are affected; and what
the costs are of inter vening to reduce the loss
or waste.
The first consideration for an environmentally
oriented policymaker is choosing which
environmental objective to target and
defining the commodities on which to focus.
Empirical evidence at the global level on the
environmental footprints for major commodit y
groups suggests that, if the aim is to reduce
land use, the primar y focus should be on
meat and animal products, which account for
60 percent of the land footprint associated
with food loss and waste. If the aim is to target
water scarcit y, cereals and pulses make the
largest contribution (more than 70 percent),
followed by fruits and vegetables. In terms of
GHG emissions associated with food loss and
waste, the biggest contribution is again from
cereals and pulses (more than 60 percent),
followed by roots, tubers and oil-bearing crops.
However, the environmental footprint for
different commodities also varies across regions
and countries, due, inter alia, to differences
in crop yields and production techniques (e.g.
rainfed versus irrigated production or grazing for
livestock versus use of animal feed).

However, improved efficiency does not
necessarily reduce the total resources used or
GHGs emitted. The overall environmental impact
will be the result of price changes associated
with the reduction of food loss and waste, which
will determine – indirectly – its effect on natural
resource use and GHG emissions. For example,
if the additional supply arising from fewer
losses has the effect of decreasing prices for a
product, then consumers may demand more of
the product. This will tend to counterbalance the
positive environmental effect of the improved
efficiency of the food system associated with the
reduction in food loss.

WHEN DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING
INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE FOOD LOSS
AND WASTE

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF REDUCING FOOD
LOSS AND WASTE IN GENERATING
DESIRABLE ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES
DEPENDS ON HOW IT AFFECTS PRICES
ACROSS COMMODITIES AND LOCATIONS,
AND ALONG SUPPLY CHAINS

Three major t ypes of environmental footprints
of food loss and waste are generally quantifiable:
GHG emissions (carbon footprint), pressures
on land (land footprint) and pressures on water
resources (water footprint). These can in turn
also affect biodiversit y. Using food loss and
waste reduction as a means of reaching the
environmental objectives enshrined in the
SDGs will require an understanding of where

An inter vention to reduce food loss or waste,
if sufficiently large, will affect prices upstream
and downstream in the supply chain relative
to where the inter vention occurred. The
transmission of prices, combined with the
location of the actual environmental damage
happening along the food supply chain, will
determine the environmental outcome of a

TO BE PLACED IN THE BROADER CONTEXT
OF SUSTAINABILITY, EVALUATING
SYNERGIES AND TRADE-OFFS

potential inter vention to reduce food loss and
waste. For instance, the environmental impact
may occur mostly in primar y production, as is
the case for land use and water. Alternatively,
it may grow throughout the supply chain, as is
the case for GHG emissions. In the first case,
an inter vention any where in the supply chain
will lead to an environmental improvement as
lower prices are transmitted to producers with
an incentive to reduce their production and
consequently their use of natural resources.
On the other hand, if the objective is to reduce
the carbon footprint, inter ventions at the
consumption stage will have the greatest return
per unit of avoided food loss and waste.

Another important question is whether
inter ventions to reduce food loss and
waste are the most effective way to reach
environmental and natural resource objectives.
Although improvements resulting from food loss
and waste reduction are not trivial, empirical
studies show that other t y pes of inter ventions
result in larger reductions in some environmental
impacts, e.g. improved agricultural production
methods and dietar y changes. However, the
same evidence shows that the strongest impact
is obtained by combining different inter ventions,
including food loss and waste reduction.
In addition, possible trade-offs with other
environmental objectives need to be considered.
For example, food loss and waste can be reduced
by increasing the use of cold storage and
packaging; but expanded cold storage may
lead to higher energ y use and increased use of
packaging could generate more plastic waste.
In such cases, enhancing energ y efficiency in
cold storage chains could play a role in reducing
emissions. In terms of packaging, it is important
to look at the entire packaging–product system
in life cycle analyses to assess properly the total
environmental burden of measures adopted.

The transmission of price changes is likely to be
stronger between suppliers who have a direct
link, as opposed to indirect links through other
market agents. If this is the case, an inter vention
at the specific point or close to the point of the
environmental impact is most likely to have a
positive environmental effect. This will ensure
that lower prices are transmitted effectively to
the actors generating the negative impact and
induce them to make adjustments in production
and use of associated natural resources. If
inter ventions occur downstream, price effects
are likely to be diluted and smaller by the time
they reach actors generating the environmental
impact, so the impact on critical areas will be
marginal. For example, reducing consumer
waste may lead to a small change in water use in
many geographically dispersed locations but not
necessarily where it is most needed. For GHG
emissions the situation is different since the
carbon footprint is global in nature and the
geographic location of reduced GHG emissions
is irrelevant.

PUTTING ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER –
SOME GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR
POLICYMAKERS
This report is based on an incremental approach
that builds on the business case for private
investments and efforts to reduce food loss and
waste through private incentives. It expands
the rationale beyond the business case, to
one for public inter ventions to reduce some
of the barriers that prevent producers and
consumers from reducing food loss and waste,
e.g. generating and/or sharing information on
how to reduce food loss and waste. Beyond that,

As a rule of thumb, inter ventions targeted at
critical loss points that come immediately after
most of the environmental damage associated
with a given supply chain have the greatest
impact in terms of environmental sustainabilit y.

| xix |

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

public inter ventions should focus on providing
public goods or reducing negative externalities.
Two fundamental objectives underlie public
policies for reducing food loss and waste:
improved food securit y and nutrition; and
environmental sustainabilit y. At the same time,
it should be recognized that broader policies to
promote overall rural development may allow
producers along the supply chain to make
investments that will also reduce food losses.

insecurit y will likely place the emphasis on
environmental objectives, in particular reducing
GHG emissions. This will call for inter ventions
later in the supply chain, in particular retail and
consumption, where levels of loss or waste are
expected to be the highest.

THE ROAD AHEAD – IMPROVING POLICY
COHERENCE, ENHANCING DATA
COLLECTION AND MEASURING
CAPABILITY, AND MONITORING AND
EVALUATING PROGRESS

Having worked through the different rationales
that can justif y both private and public
inter ventions to reduce food loss and waste, it
is possible to provide some g uiding principles
for inter ventions. Clarit y about the objective(s)
being pursued is essential for identif ying the
most appropriate policies and entr y points for
reducing food loss and waste. If the focus is on
economic efficiency, an attractive option is to
enable the business case for food loss and waste
reduction, wherever it may present itself along
the supply chain or geographically. A focus on
food securit y will tend to favour inter ventions
early in the food supply chain, where positive
food securit y impacts will be felt throughout the
rest of the supply chain. To reach environmental
objectives, food loss and waste reductions need
to take place downstream in the supply chain
relative to where the environmental impact
occurs. Finally, location matters when pursuing
food securit y and nutrition or environmental
objectives, the only exception being a fall in
GHG emissions, which has the same impact on
climate change wherever it occurs.

There may be trade-offs between objectives,
and choices may have to be made about which
objectives to prioritize. A critical issue is that of
policy coherence, which requires that all options
are weighed together for their impact so that
solutions which promote one objective do not
unintentionally harm another. Some policies, for
example those for improving food securit y and
nutrition, may actually lead to increased levels of
food loss and waste because they involve access
to safe and nutritious diets with foods that are
often highly perishable. However, this should
not be seen as a problem; the basic question
is rather whether food loss and waste occurs
because of an inefficient and distorted food
system, and if it is possible to take measures
that reduce food loss and waste without
compromising food securit y and nutrition.
Policy coherence is important also because the
amount of food loss and waste that can feasibly
be reduced will depend on the costs and benefits
relative to the status quo. Public policies affecting
food prices can change incentives for consumers
and producers to avoid loss and waste of food.
If not well designed, agricultural policies or
those with food securit y and nutrition objectives,
e.g. food subsidies, may have unintended
consequences by creating a disincentive to avoid
food loss and waste. Therefore, reducing food
loss and waste can also be furthered through the
reform of policies that unintentionally lead to
greater food loss and waste.

Different countries will have different objectives
to g uide their choices. Low-income countries
will likely focus on improving food securit y
and nutrition, in addition to the sustainable
management of land and water resources.
This calls for a focus on reducing food loss
and waste early in the supply chain, including
at farm level, where impacts will be the
strongest and losses tend to be the largest.
High-income countries with low levels of food

However, first and foremost, it is important to
assess whether, and to what extent, an initiative
achieves its objective. This requires solid
measurement of the magnitude of the problem
and effective monitoring and evaluation of
inter ventions. Today the scarcit y of solid data
on how much food loss and waste occurs, and
where, is an obstacle to effective policymaking.
The lack of data is particularly acute for
food waste at the consumer level because
of both methodological challenges and the
measurement costs involved. Availabilit y of data
on losses varies considerably across countries
and commodities, and along the food supply
chain. However, efforts towards improved

data collection are under way, not least in the
framework of monitoring progress towards
SDG Target 12.3 through the Food Loss and
Food Waste indices being developed by FAO
and UN Environment. A key component of this
is the development of standards and concepts,
as well as g uidelines and capacit y building.
The expectation is that this will allow countries
themselves to improve data collection and
effective measurement of food loss and waste.
Improving statistical knowledge about food loss
and waste is a priorit y area for FAO, and should
be for the international communit y, as well as all
countries interested in monitoring their progress
towards reaching the SDGs.

THE ISSUES

Reducing food loss and waste can
generate economic benefits, but it will
also have a cost. As low-cost options for
reductions are exhausted, the cost will
increase, thus some level of food loss and
waste is inevitable.

To reduce food loss and waste and

and food security, nutrition and

CHAPTER 1

FOOD LOSS AND WASTE –
FRAMING THE ISSUES
FOOD LOSS AND WASTE
AND THE SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT GOALS

Due to expected impacts on household
and business costs, as well as on food
securit y, nutrition, natural resources and
the environment, reducing food loss and
waste could have wider implications for other
SDGs related to the food system, such as
SDG 2, which deals with ending hunger and
achieving food securit y and improved nutrition.
Possible environmental effects fall under SDG 6
(sustainable water management), SDG 11
(sustainable cities and communities), SDG 13
(climate change), SDG 14 (marine resources)
and SDG 15 (terrestrial ecosystems, forests, land
and biodiversit y). There could also conceivably
be knock-on effects on other SDGs: SDG 1
(ending povert y), SDG 8 (sustainable economic
growth and decent employment) and SDG 10
(reducing inequalities).

Losing or wasting food is generally viewed
as undesirable and something to be avoided.
There are probably few issues in the international
policy debate around which there is a stronger
consensus. a
Reducing food loss and waste is seen as a
way to lower production costs, improve food
securit y and nutrition, and contribute towards
environmental sustainabilit y, notably by
easing the pressure on natural resources and
decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
In the context of the challenge of sustainably
feeding a world population projected to reach
almost 10 billion in 2050, minimizing food loss
and waste and making the most of resources
underpinning the food system are considered
particularly important.1

At the same time, progress on other SDGs
could have beneficial impacts in terms of
reducing food loss and waste. These SDGs
include: SDG 5 (gender equalit y), SDG 7
(affordable and clean energ y), SDG 9
(infrastructure, industr y and innovation)
and SDG 17 (partnerships). However, the
importance of these linkages is likely to var y
greatly within and between countries and
depends on the implementation of food loss
and waste reductions. Without considering
their likely magnitude and significance, Figure 1
summarizes the potential linkages between
reducing food loss and waste and various
SDGs. The rounded boxes refer to the expected
impacts on food securit y, nutrition, natural
resources and the environment.

Food loss and waste has become a major global
issue and is enshrined in SDG 12 (responsible
consumption and production), which even sets
a specific target related to the reduction of food
loss and waste:
SDG Target 12.3 calls for halving per capita
global food waste at retail and consumer levels and
reducing food loss along production and supply
chains, including post-harvest loss, by 2030.

Decreasing food loss and waste seems a
simple and reasonable objective. Clearly, it is
objectionable to let food deteriorate because of
negligence or poor handling or to throw away
food that could be consumed by humans.

a There are negative moral and ethical connotations associated with
food loss and waste, implicit in particular in the word “waste”, which is
perceived as something deliberate or easily avoidable, while in some
sense “loss” can be considered a misfortune – something that happens
but is not deliberate.

Therefore, it should be avoided. However, when
turning to implementation and deciding on
concrete actions, inter ventions or policies to
avoid food loss and waste, the matter becomes

more complicated. Indeed, any policy adopted
must take account of the fact that in many cases
reducing food loss and waste has a cost and
may involve trade-offs with other objectives.

CHAPTER 1 FOOD LOSS AND WASTE – FRAMING THE ISSUES

 How is food loss disting uished from food
waste, if at all?c

When deciding what action to take to address
food loss and waste, a number of questions arise,
including:

Most definitions focus on the quantitative loss
and waste along the food supply chain, but others
also consider loss in quality (nutritional, cosmetic,
food safety). d Conceptually it is easier to define
and measure the quantitative dimension than
qualitative loss and waste, even though there
are important measurement issues also for the
former. For example, should the measure taken
be in terms of volume, caloric or other nutritional
content, or economic value? Some definitions even
consider overconsumption, beyond actual dietary
requirements, as a form of food loss and waste.

 Why is food lost or wasted?
 How much food is lost or wasted?
 Why is it important to reduce food loss
and waste?
 How can food loss and waste be reduced?
 Can all food loss and waste be avoided?
 Who benefits (or loses) from food loss and
waste reduction?
 How can food loss and waste reduction
contribute to achieving food securit y and
nutrition or environmental sustainabilit y?

For the purposes of this report, food loss and
waste is understood as the decrease in quantity
or quality of food along the food supply
chain. The report adopts a generally applicable
conceptual framework to define food loss and
waste (see Figure 2) that aims to help improve data
collection, data comparability and evidence-based
regulatory and policy decisions for food loss and
waste prevention and reduction. (For a set of
definitions of terms used in this report, see Box 1.)

These are some of the questions this report
attempts to answer. More broadly, the core
questions are: When is food loss and waste
a problem? And why should it be reduced?
The report argues that food loss and waste
reduction should be seen as a way to achieve other
objectives – most notably, improvements in the
efficiency of the food system, food security and
nutrition, and environmental sustainability. n

WHAT IS FOOD LOSS AND
WASTE? A CONCEPTUAL
FRAMEWORK

The distinction between food loss and food
waste is not only conceptually relevant,
but also useful from a policy point of view.
Conceptually speaking, food loss – the result
of decisions and actions by suppliers − affects
the supply of food: if food losses are reduced,
the supply of food into the food supply chain
increases. 7 Strictly speaking, food loss therefore
concerns all stages of the food supply chain
up to, but excluding, the point where there
is interaction with the final consumer and
thus excludes retail, food ser vice providers e
and consumers. Food waste is the result of
purchasing decisions by consumers, or decisions
by retailers and food ser vice providers that affect
consumer behaviour. From a policy point of view,

What exactly is food loss and waste? How do
we define it? No common definition of food loss
and waste exists, although there are several
definitions in the literature. b These definitions
often ref lect the different problems that
stakeholders or analysts focus on or associate
with food loss and waste. Indeed, definitions
differ across several dimensions, including:
 What is considered food?
 Should only the edible parts of food
be considered?
 Is food diverted to other uses (e.g. animal feed)
considered lost or wasted?
 Which stages of the food supply chain are
included (e.g. also prehar vest loss)?

c For instance, Bellemare et al. only use the term food “waste” and do
not distinguish between food loss and food waste.3
d For a measurement of food loss in qualitative terms see, for
instance, Delgado et al.4
e Food service providers maintain facilities that serve meals and
snacks for immediate consumption on site (food away from home). They
include restaurants, fast food outlets, caterers, cafeterias, and other
places that prepare, serve and sell food to the general public for a
profit.8

b For a survey of different definitions and their characteristics see, for
example, Chaboud and Daviron.2

DEFINITIONS RELATED TO FOOD LOSS AND WASTE
 Food refers to any substance, whether processed,
semi-processed or raw, intended for human
consumption. It includes drink, chewing gum and
any substance used in the manufacture,
preparation or treatment of food but does not
include cosmetics, tobacco or substances used
only as drugs. 5 Food products can be of animal
or plant origin and are considered food from the
moment that: (i) crops are harvest-mature or
suitable for their purpose; (ii) animals are ready
for slaughter; (iii) milk is drawn from the udder;
(iv) eggs are laid by a bird; (v) aquaculture fish
is mature in the pond; and (vi) wild fish are
caught with fishing gear.

the outputs of these activities, including socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. 6
 Food loss is the decrease in the quantity or
quality of food resulting from decisions and
actions by food suppliers in the chain, excluding
retail, food service providers and consumers.
 Food waste is the decrease in the quantity or
quality of food resulting from decisions and
actions by retailers, food services and
consumers.
 Quantitative food loss and waste (also referred
to as physical food loss and waste) is the
decrease in the mass of food destined for human
consumption as it is removed from the food
supply chain. As such, quantitative food loss
refers to the decrease in the mass of food
destined for human consumption from decisions
and actions by food suppliers in the chain.
Quantitative food waste is the physical decrease
in food mass resulting from decisions and actions
by retailers, food services and consumers.

 The food supply chain consists of the following
segments: (i) agricultural production and harvest/
slaughter/catch; (ii) post-harvest/slaughter/catch
operations; (iii) storage; (iv) transportation;
(v) processing; (vi) wholesale and retail; and
(vii) consumption by households and food services.
Agricultural production, harvest and post-harvest/
slaughter/catch operations refer to activities where
produce is still on the farm or the producer’s
premises. Post-harvest/slaughter/catch operations
include cleaning, grading, sorting and treatments
(e.g. for disinfestation on the farm or in a packing
facility). Processing includes primary processing
operations (e.g. drying, dehusking, deshelling),
which often take place on the farm and secondary
processing (product transformation). The moment
food is consumed or removed from the food supply
chain defines the end point of that chain.
  A food system gathers all the elements
(environment, people, inputs, processes,
infrastructures, institutions, etc.) and activities that
relate to the production, processing, distribution,
preparation and consumption of food along with

  Qualitative food loss and waste refers to the
decrease in food attributes that reduces its value in
terms of intended use. It can result in reduced
nutritional value (e.g. smaller amounts of vitamin C
in bruised fruits) and/or the economic value of
food because of non-compliance with quality
standards. A reduction in quality may result in
unsafe food, presenting risks to consumer health.
Qualitative food loss refers to the decrease in food
attributes that reduces the value of food in terms of
its intended use – it results from decisions and
actions by food suppliers in the chain. Qualitative
food waste is the same but results from actions by
retailers, food services and consumers.

the distinction between food loss and food waste
is highly relevant, as the t ypes of inter ventions
that can affect consumer behaviour (food
demand) are different from those that encourage
suppliers to reduce food losses (food supply).

In practice, the distinction may be more difficult
to apply. Indeed, the decisions and actions of
retailers and food ser vice providers, despite
acting as food suppliers, are often so strongly
conditioned by consumer behaviour that the
| 5 |

CHAPTER 1 FOOD LOSS AND WASTE – FRAMING THE ISSUES

distinction between loss and waste becomes
difficult to disentangle. In this sense, the
retail level may constitute a sort of a grey area.
For practical and institutional purposes, this
report will align with the distinction implicit in
the SDG Target 12.3, which refers to “food waste
at the retail and consumer levels” and “food
losses along production and supply chains”.

instead disposed of as waste or used in waste
management activities are not considered as food
loss or waste (shown by the grey arrow).
The destination refers to the actual use of
the amount of edible food destined for human
consumption. It may either be eaten by people,
even if it has suffered qualitative food loss and
waste – e.g. a blemished banana – (shown by
the green arrow and box under “Destination”)
or diverted to a non-food economic use such as
animal feed (the orange boxes). It may suffer
quantitative loss or waste if discarded from the
food supply chain by either suppliers (food loss)
or consumers, retailers and food ser vice providers
(food waste) and sent to landfill. Or it may be
incinerated, composted or anaerobically digested
(represented by the red arrows and boxes).

The conceptual framework in Figure 2 disting uishes
between the intended use of plants and animals
produced (both food and non-food economic
uses); their fragmentation into food, inedible
parts, feed and non-feed parts; and, ultimately,
their destination (as food, productive non-food
use, or food loss and waste).
The intended use of animal or plant products
refers to the original, intended purpose of the
product in the chain: to be eaten by humans
(food), fed to animals (feed), used as seeds,
or for industrial or other purposes (see the
“Intended use” rectangles in Figure 2). The loss
or waste of animal and plant products not
originally intended to be eaten by humans is not
considered food loss or waste even if this may
have implications for food securit y and nutrition
or the environment. Animal and plant products
originally intended for food but then diverted to
a non-food economic use (such as animal feed)
are also not considered loss and waste (orange
arrows and boxes under “Fragments” and
“Destination” in Figure 2).

Note that:
 Food that has suffered a qualitative loss or
waste but is still eaten by humans is not
considered a quantitative loss or waste.
If either consumers or suppliers discard
such food, it is characterized as quantitative
food loss or waste, unless diverted to
productive use.
 The reduction in the mass of food resulting
from food processing operations such as
dr ying, heating or fermentation is not
considered food loss or waste.
 Food that is fit for consumption and
which remains unsold by retailers or food
ser vice providers but is then collected and
redistributed to other consumers is not
considered waste; such redistribution is rather
a way to avoid food waste.
 Food diverted from the food supply chain to a
productive non-food use, for example for feed
or biofuel use, retains part of its value and is
therefore not considered lost or wasted. This is
not to say that such diversion has no costs, as
it may lower the value of the food.
 Even though anaerobic digestion generates
biogas, it is first and foremost a waste
treatment method and no crops are
produced exclusively for biogas production.
Therefore, food that ends up in this waste
management process is considered lost
or wasted.

The amount of plants and animals intended for
human consumption is then fragmented into
different uses (food, inedible parts, or other
economic/productive uses). To illustrate: while
humans consume the interior of a banana, the
peel can ser ve as feed, thereby fragmenting the
entire banana into different uses. The inedible
parts are food components that, in a particular
food supply chain, are not intended for human
consumption (e.g. bones, rind). f The inedible
parts, such as the peel of a banana, that
are not used for feed or for other economic
purposes (shown by the orange arrows) but are

f What is considered inedible varies among users (e.g. chicken feet
are consumed as part of some food supply chains, but not in others). It
also changes over time and is influenced by a range of variables, in
particular, culture.9

HOW MUCH FOOD LOSS
AND WASTE OCCURS?

The disposal of lost or wasted food can take
various forms, with a more or less detrimental
impact on the environment. Composting and
anaerobic digestion have a more limited
environmental impact than dumping food
in a landfill or incineration. The disposal of
lost and wasted food is a waste management
issue and its study goes beyond the scope of
this report. This report clearly focuses on the
avoidance, rather than the disposal, of food
losses and waste. n

What do we actually know about the global
magnitude of food loss and waste? Surprisingly
little, as it turns out, but the SDG monitoring
framework is expected to contribute precisely to
bridging this gap through enhanced efforts to
collect data that enable estimation of total food
loss and waste at the highest possible
disaggregated levels.
SDG Target 12.3 calls for halving per capita
global food waste at retail and consumer levels
by 2030 and reducing food loss (including

the underlying data for the estimates and causes
of food loss and waste through more accurate
surveying across commodity groups, value chains
and countries.

Indicators 12.3.1a and 12.3.1b are under the
custodianship of two United Nations (UN)
agencies, the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations
Environment Programme (UN Environment).
These two agencies are working together to
develop methodologies for the sub-indicators, with
FAO leading on the Food Loss Index (FLI) and
UN Environment on the Food Waste Index (FWI),
given their respective expertise and mandates
in these areas. The work of the agencies aims to
provide the global community with solid estimates

Of the two SDG 12.3.1 sub-indicators – FAO’s
FLI and UN Environment's FWI – the work on
developing the FLI and estimating food loss
percentages is the most advanced. FAO’s FLI has
led to the first global estimate released in 2019 that
13.8 percent of food produced in 2016 was lost from
the farm up to, but excluding, the retail stage.12 At
the regional level, estimates range from 5–6 percent
in Australia and New Zealand to 20–21 percent in
Central and Southern Asia (Figure 3). In terms of food
groups, roots, tubers and oil-bearing crops report
the highest level of loss, followed by fruits and

vegetables (Figure 4). It is not surprising that fruits
and vegetables incur high levels of loss given their
highly perishable nature. Results for roots, tubers
and oil-bearing crops are mainly driven by cassava
and potato losses, given the significant amount
of data reported for these commodities. In fact,
cassava is the most perishable of roots and tubers
and can deteriorate within two or three days after
harvesting; potatoes, on the other hand, require
careful handling and proper storage, especially in
the warm and humid climates of many developing
countries.13, 14

persist. Due to measurabilit y constraints and
data unavailabilit y, among other factors, it
was necessar y for the conceptual framework
(Figure 2) and the operational measurement
framework to differ in order for FAO to monitor
SDG Target 12.3 on food losses (see Box 2).
In the operational framework, prehar vest and
har vest losses are excluded from the global
FLI to ensure consistency with the definition
of agricultural production used by countries
and FAO within the Food Balance Sheet
framework. The inclusion of these losses
would require redefining production and yield
calculations and therefore alter the consistency
and comparabilit y of the dataset over time.
Another major challenge concerns commodities.
Since it is impossible for countries to collect
loss data for all commodities, the FLI focuses
on ten key commodities from five commodit y
groups, ranked by production value, within each »

BOX 2

THE FOOD LOSS INDEX METHODOLOGY IN A NUTSHELL
To monitor SDG Target 12.3, FAO has created the
Food Loss Index (FLI). The focus of the indicator is on
percentages of food removed from the supply chain.
The FLI monitors developments in these percentages
over time, relative to a base period currently set at
2015, in order to track progress against SDG Target
12.3. Since food losses will vary with total food
production, the FLI is based on loss percentages
instead of tonnes of lost food. If the index were based
on losses in tonnes, then an increase in the FLI could
simply be reflecting an increase in production.
For reasons related to measurement, data
unavailability and consistency with other statistical
definitions and with the SDG Target 12.3 formulation,
FAO has adopted the following concepts of food loss
and waste in the operational framework of the FLI:

operationally challenging, the FLI focuses on the top ten
commodities by economic value within five commodity
groups for each country:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

cereals and pulses;
fruits and vegetables;
roots, tubers and oil-bearing crops;
animal products; and
fish and fish products.

Given cost-effectiveness concerns for data collection,
the FLI helps improve the evidence base of losses by
selecting only a few critical products and focusing on
improving the data quality for those.
For each country, the FLI estimates loss in physical
quantities by commodity and aggregates them into an
overall percentage loss at national level using an
economic weight equal to the commodities’ value of
production. The aggregation across commodities is based
on farmgate prices expressed in international dollars, i.e.
using the same prices for all countries. Consequently, loss
of high-value commodities carries a larger weight than
low-value commodities. However, the methodology does
not take account of the different economic value of loss at
various stages in the food supply chain. Indeed, loss
further along the supply chain has a higher economic
value than loss earlier in the supply chain.
Given that many countries still do not report data on
losses, only estimates at the regional and commodity
group level are provided in the report. To fill the data
gaps and produce loss factorsii at the country level, a
transparent and reproducible model-based approach
has been developed. It uses a set of explanatory
variables of causal factors based in the literature and
supplements loss percentages with external information
gathered from publications and reports (for an overview
of the methodology and the estimation model, see the
notes in the Technical Annex). As new and better data
become available, the approach allows old estimates to
be replaced without disrupting the method or the results.
However, while the model-based approach used can
provide loss estimates on a large scale, it may not
perform as well as other modelling approaches in
explaining losses at the micro level or at the farm level.
At the global level, the FLI is then a weighted
average of the national FLI, using weights equal to the
countries’ total value of agricultural production in the
base period.

 Food loss is all the crop, livestock and fish
human-edible commodity quantities that, directly
or indirectly, completely exit the post-harvest/
slaughter/catch supply chain by being discarded,
incinerated or otherwise disposed of, and do not
re-enter in any other utilization (such as animal
feed, industrial use, etc.), up to, and excluding,
the retail level. Losses that occur during storage,
transportation and processing, as well as
imported products, are therefore all included.
Loss includes the commodity as a whole with its
inedible parts.
 Waste occurs from retail to the final consumption/
demand stages. However, waste is not included
in the FLI.
The FLI operational framework differs from the
conceptual framework of food loss (shown in Figure 2)
with respect to the exclusion of qualitative loss, the
inclusion of inedible parts and the limitation of the
concept within set boundaries of the food supply chain
and selected commodities. As shown in the figure,
preharvest and harvest lossi are excluded from the FLI,
but harvest losses can be added for the national FLI.
Regarding the qualitative component of food loss,
efforts to include it in the FLI are currently underway,
for which information on market prices, for instance,
may serve as proxies for food quality (see Delgado
et al. for a similar approach).4
As for selecting commodities, given that estimating
losses for many commodities across all countries is

inedible is operationally demanding and, in
some cases, impossible.
Finally, the operational measurement framework
adopted by FAO accounts only for quantitative
loss. Indeed, the assessment of qualitative
food loss and waste would need to monitor the
actual value for an attribute as it evolves along
the supply chain and compare it to the optimal
“reference” level. For example, nutritional content
requires the nutritional values at maturit y and
how they degrade along the supply chain. This is
operationally challenging.

FAO’s FLI covers only food loss after har vest
and up to, but not including, the retail level, as
explained above (see Box 2). The only attempt
so far at a comprehensive global food loss and
waste estimate throughout the entire food supply
chain was prepared in 2011 for FAO by the
Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnolog y.14, 16
However, this study has limitations, clearly
recognized in the study itself (see Box 3).

FAO’S EARLIER ESTIMATE OF FOOD LOSS AND WASTE – HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM THE FLI?

The Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology
2011 report for FAO estimated that roughly one-third
of edible parts of food produced for human
consumption globally was lost or wasted,
corresponding to about 1.3 billion tonnes of food per
year. The estimate covered all stages from agricultural
production up to consumption, while the FLI focuses on
losses up to, but excluding, the retail level. To date,
this 2011 FAO study is the only one providing global
estimates at all levels of the food supply chain and
covering all food production sectors.14, 16 The estimates
are cited widely in public debate.17 Other subsequent
global studies have relied on this report or the same
underlying data. For example, Kummu et al.,18 using
the same commodity-group specific loss percentages
as the FAO study, estimated that, measured in calories,
around one-quarter of food (614 kcal/cap/day) was
lost in the food supply chain.
The 2011 FAO study was certainly useful in
providing a rough indication of the magnitude of food
loss and waste and in drawing international attention
to the phenomenon. However, the study advises great
caution when interpreting the results, given the number

of caveats. The limitations are largely attributable to
the intrinsic difficulty in gathering all the information
and data for such a comprehensive estimate. Lack of
data forced the authors to make a number of
assumptions on food loss and waste levels, in particular
relating to distribution and consumption. These
limitations make the study difficult to replicate.
The study considered all non-food uses (feed, seed
and industrial use) as loss or waste. It only considered the
edible parts of food while the FLI considers each
commodity as a whole, both edible and inedible parts.
The study further disaggregated the food supply chain in
a different set of stages, relative to the FLI. Also, the study
aimed at estimating losses in physical quantities and
derived total loss percentages at the end of the process,
without taking into account the different economic values
of various commodities. Finally, unlike the FLI, the 2011
FAO study did not attempt to incorporate the causal
factors of loss in its calculations; in this respect, the study
estimates the totality of losses in an almost descriptive
way. All these considerations reduce the comparability
between the study and the FLI estimates being released
through this report (see the figure in this box).

» the new estimates do not cover the whole food

In general, there are diminishing returns to
investments aimed at reducing food loss and
waste. This means that it may be relatively
inexpensive to obtain early reductions of food
loss and waste, but the cost increases for each
subsequent reduction. For example, personnel
training may be affordable and effective at
reducing a share of the losses, but mitigating
the remaining losses may require more costly
investments in new manufacturing technolog y.
 It may also be rational from a profit perspective
to produce more than required and risk having
to discard some food because the cost of a
shortfall or not being able to meet demand is
higher than the cost of producing too much.
In view of climate variability and extremes
or low prices at har vest time, farmers may
also plant more hectares than they har vest.19
Likewise, retailers and food ser vice providers
will typically have more food on hand or ser ve
more than needed to satisf y clients.
 Some level of food waste by consumers may
be the result of rational decisions. If the
opportunity cost h of time for an individual is
high, that individual may choose to go food
shopping only once a week, purchase more food
than necessary and throw away the excess food,
rather than purchasing only what is needed
more or less on a daily basis. 21 Likewise, in
cases where food represents a limited share of
overall household expenditure, consumers may
not be very inclined to avoid food waste.

supply chain. Additionally, relative to the old
estimates, the new ones take into account the
economic value of the amount lost rather than
just quantit y (see Box 4 for different food loss and
waste metrics).
FAO prepared the new food loss estimates to
monitor progress in the context of the SDGs.
Indeed, the inclusion of food loss and waste
reduction among the SDG targets has led to
enhanced efforts to estimate total food loss and
waste. Among the two SDG sub-indicators,
the Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDGs has
approved the FLI and upgraded it to Tier II,
meaning the indicator is conceptually clear and
has an internationally established methodolog y,
and that standards are available. The lack of data
provided by countries is the main underlying
constraint that inf luences all methodological
choices. The estimates are expected to improve
over time as data improve. For the F WI, there
has been significant work towards the
aforementioned methodological framework but a
first estimate of retail and household food waste
is still to be prepared. n

WHY IS FOOD LOST
OR WASTED?
In theor y, actors in the food supply chain make
rational decisions that allow them to maximize
their profit (producers) or their well-being and
that of their families (consumers) – including
decisions as to the level of food loss and waste
they find acceptable. In this view, a certain level
of food loss or waste is unavoidable. Indeed, it
may make economic sense for food operators
or consumers to tolerate levels of food loss or
waste. These levels can be considered as optimal
from the perspective of producers who maximize
their profits or consumers who maximize their
well-being.

The decision by suppliers and consumers to
tolerate more or less food losses or waste –
the direct cause of food loss and waste − is
determined by a number of factors beyond
their control, such as pests, climate, and
available har vest and post-har vest technologies.
These indirect drivers include market prices
(determined, in turn, by how well markets
function), the qualit y of public ser vices
(including, for example, road infrastructure
or informational or other social ser vices), the
legal framework in place, the culture, etc.
They depend on the overall level of economic and

 For instance, a food processor may suffer some
physical loss of food, which could be reduced
by investing in more sophisticated machiner y
or in better operational management, but
the cost of doing so exceeds the value of
the food that might be recovered; therefore
the food processor chooses not to do so.

h Opportunity cost is the cost of something in terms of an opportunity
forgone. It is determined by the benefits that might have been obtained
by choosing the best alternative opportunity. For example, for farmers
the opportunity cost of growing wheat is calculated by estimating what
they would have earned if they had grown barley, assuming barley is
the best alternative.20

BOX 4

MEASURING FOOD LOSS IN PHYSICAL, CALORIC OR ECONOMIC VALUE – DOES IT MATTER?

New estimates by FAO indicate that 13.8 percent of
total food produced in the world is lost between farm
and up to, but excluding, retail.12 These estimates
measure loss in physical quantities for different
commodities and then apply an economic weight to
aggregate them. Commodities that are more valuable
carry a larger weight in loss estimation than low-value
commodities.
Accounting for the economic value of produce is
certainly relevant when devising interventions to reduce
food loss, taking into account the costs and benefits of
reduction. The FAO FLI clearly acknowledges this by
attributing a different economic weight to different
commodities. Unfortunately, since the indicator
aggregates commodities based on respective farmgate
prices, it fails to account for the accumulation of value
along a food supply chain, attached to successive
phases in the delivery of the final product.
However, food loss can be measured in different
metrics based on policy objectives being pursued (see
the figure in this box). From a nutritional point of view,
for instance, it makes sense for food loss percentages
to be reported in caloric units, using the caloric content
of diverse foods. As a result, energy-dense foods will
have a greater weight in calculating food loss. In some
cases, food loss percentages in calories will be
comparatively larger than when measured in tonnes or
with an economic weight, if high caloric foods suffer
higher loss. For instance, in sub-Saharan Africa cereals
such as maize and rice and oil-bearing crops such as

groundnuts are some of the most important commodities
in the region’s agricultural sector and thus account for
a larger share of loss relative to other commodities.
Given that they are highly caloric foods, this could
explain why loss percentages in sub-Saharan Africa
are highest when measured in calories. Conversely, in
Central and Southern Asia there is a higher share of
meat and animal products (26 percent of quantity by
weight in the basket considered for the FLI calculation)
being produced compared to sub-Saharan Africa
(9 percent of quantity by weight), so that losses in these
higher-value supply chains result in proportionately
higher losses when measured in economic value terms
as opposed to calories.
On the other hand, if a policymaker’s focus is on
environmental sustainability with the objective of
reducing the amount of land or water used in
producing watermelons, for example, then looking at
purely physical quantities, or even hectares of land or
cubic metres of water equivalent, can make sense.
Although assessing food loss in mass is useful for
advocacy and for estimating food security and
environmental impacts, it fails to account for the
economic or nutritional value of different commodities
and can risk attributing a higher weight to low-value
products just because they are heavier.
Overall, different food loss metrics have different
purposes. Policymakers, businesses and consumers will
ultimately decide which metric they wish to use,
depending on their objectives.

social development under which specific food
supply chains and actors operate. Suppliers and
consumers may also be inf luenced by the
behaviour of other actors in the food supply
chain. For instance, food may be lost at one
stage in the food supply chain because it was
mishandled at an earlier stage, such as during
transportation. Insistence by processors or
retailers that their suppliers be able to deliver
sufficient amounts of food, even when unforeseen
peaks in demand occur, may induce the latter
to produce excessive amounts that end up being

discarded. Also, a sudden drop in prices can
make it unprofitable to move produce to the next
stage of the food supply chain and perishable
crops can be left unhar vested or dumped on road
sides or in landfill. 22, 23
Thus, among the factors contributing to food loss
and waste, this report disting uishes between
direct causes – associated with actions (or lack
thereof ) of individual actors in the food supply
chain that directly cause food loss and waste –
and indirect drivers, which are more systemic

good, e.g. roads. This may result in excessive
food loss and waste, with negative impacts on
the well-being of suppliers and consumers.19
 Producers and consumers may not have
enough reliable information about choice
options and the impacts of their rational
decisions (“bounded rationalit y”); this may
result in food losses or waste that are greater
than if caused by perfectly rational decisions.19

If we can assume that food loss and waste is
the result of rational behav iour by suppliers
and consumers, then why is it a problem?
One answer is that there are constraints that
inhibit indiv idual suppliers and consumers
from behav  optimally from a social
perspective. Such constraints ref lect market
failures and contribute to the occurrence of
food loss and waste (see Box 5 for definitions
of market failure, externality, public good and
missing market). 21 Some examples will help to
illustrate this point.

Another reason that an individual’s rational
behaviour about food loss and waste can be
a problem is that producers and consumers
seek to maximize their individual well-being
and in doing so may ignore the negative
externalities of their food loss and waste
decisions on societ y at large. For example,
individual food supply chain actors may not
consider the impact of their decisions on the
environment in terms of GHG emissions,
unless there is reg ulation restricting emissions
or an associated carbon market that values
emission reductions.

 Where market failures result in, for example,
poorly functioning credit markets, food
supply chain operators may not have access
to the financial resources needed to invest

BOX 5

DEFINITIONS OF MARKET FAILURE, EXTERNALITY, PUBLIC GOOD AND MISSING MARKET

Market failure is the economic situation where markets
do not allocate resources efficiently.26 This means there
are opportunities to make some people better off
without making other people worse off.

Economists refer to public goods as non-rivalrous and
non-excludable. National defence, public parks, clean
air and other basic societal goods can all be
considered public goods.27

Externality refers to the direct effect on one agent
caused by the actions of another, whether positive or
negative.27 Pollution emitted by a power plant
resulting in acid rain and lakes depleted of fish is an
example of a negative externality.28

Missing market refers to the economic situation in
which there is no market for a certain product because
private actors see no prospect of profit, even though
the exchange of such an item would be beneficial for
society as a whole.29, 30 For example, farmers will not
invest in a technology to reduce loss if the benefits do
not accrue to them but instead to actors further down
the chain.

Public good refers to a product that one individual can
enjoy without reducing the amount available to others.

WHY DO WE NEED TO
REDUCE FOOD LOSS
AND WASTE?

Market failures may cause producers and
consumers to make decisions leading to levels
of food loss or waste that are optimal from
their perspective, but not from that of societ y.
They may also prevent economic actors from
adopting technologies and practices to reduce
food loss and waste which are also to their own
benefit. It is essentially these market failures that
provide the justification for public inter ventions
and policies aimed at reducing food loss and
waste. However, the degree to which some
food supply chain actors hold market power
(e.g. monopoly) also contributes to market
failures and may affect how public decisions are
communicated to and enforced upon stakeholders
in the food system. In Sri Lanka, for example,
the mandator y use of plastic crates enforced by
the government was violently opposed by major
vegetable suppliers. 31

Reducing food loss and waste can be a means to
achieve a societal objective, such as the SDGs
illustrated in Figure 1. This report analyses if and
how food loss and waste reductions positively
impact on economic outcomes, food security
and nutrition, and environmental sustainability.
It distinguishes between the business case and the
economic case for reducing food loss and waste.
The business case focuses on the benefits accruing
to private actors – producers or consumers – in the
food supply chain, while the economic case looks
at the broader benefits to society.
In some circumstances, when individuals
receive additional information or experience
changing economic conditions, they may find it
to their benefit to reduce food loss and waste.
This implies there is a business case where the
private sector has the right set of incentives to
mobilize and achieve reductions in food loss and
waste. This may also provide broader economic,
social and environmental benefits to societ y, even
though the essential motivation behind reduced
food loss and waste is personal.

The notion of optimal levels of food loss
and waste – from a private and a societal
perspective – is important for recognizing that
some level is both unavoidable and tolerable.
However, determining exactly what those optimal
levels are is next to impossible because of the
empirical challenges involved. The rest of this
report, in general, uses the less precise term
acceptable levels of food loss and waste. n
| 17 |

CHAPTER 1 FOOD LOSS AND WASTE – FRAMING THE ISSUES

The economic case for reducing food loss
and waste looks beyond the benefits accruing
to those producers or consumers who reduce
food loss and waste. Where it has a negative
impact on the well-being of societ y at large, as
highlighted in the previous section, there is an
economic case for reducing food loss and waste.
Using the resources available more efficiently,
be they labour, capital or natural resources,
can generate improvements in well-being.
As illustrated by Figure 1, reducing food loss
and waste potentially has indirect effects on
povert y, sustainable income growth, food
securit y and nutrition, natural resources and
ecosystems. In general, an economic case can
be made for reducing food loss and waste – if
there are both winners and losers – when the
benefits to the winners outweigh the costs to
the losers. The benefits from reducing food loss
and waste can take different forms. They may
lead to increased incomes for other actors –
apart from those who actually reduce food loss
and waste – and to benefits for societ y as a
whole. Often these benefits can be monetized,
and in principle measured, even though in
practice this may not be straightforward.
Other potential benefits to societ y cannot
be monetized but are no less important.
With regard to the latter, this report focuses on:
i) improved food security and nutrition; and
ii) environmental sustainability.

provided climate change and pressure on natural
resources do not override this effect. However, in
the short term, farmers may be worse off from a
reduction in food loss and waste further down
the food supply chain. The mechanisms through
which food loss and waste reductions improve
food securit y and nutrition therefore require
careful analysis.
As for the impact of food loss and waste
reduction on environmental sustainability, it
is generally assumed that if food loss and waste
are reduced, then less food needs to be produced,
processed and transported to feed the world’s
population. This means fewer natural resources
are used and GHG emissions and pollution would
be reduced. In addition, if less food ends up in
landfill or incinerators, there would be lower
GHG emissions and other environmental impacts
from waste management practices. This report
arg ues that there is significant potential
for improving environmental sustainabilit y
through the reduction of food loss and waste.
However, the report also shows that the positive
impact of this on the environment is not a given
and that possible second-round effects and
trade-offs should be taken into consideration.
For example, if a reduction in food losses results
in lower production costs, then producers will
produce more with the same amount of resources,
which may help meet growing food demand
caused by population growth. However, an
expansion in food production will have negative
impacts on the environment if it leads to more
natural resource use or more GHGs being
emitted. Meanwhile, if lower production costs
translate into lower prices for consumers, it
may result in increased demand and encourage
wasteful practices, further offsetting the positive
impact of reduced food loss and waste on
environmental sustainabilit y.

In terms of food security and nutrition, it
is generally assumed that reducing food loss
and waste means more food is available for
human consumption and this translates into
improvements in food securit y and nutrition.
However, the actual effects can be complex and
the impacts of food loss and waste reduction
on food securit y and nutrition will depend on
the geographical location of food-insecure or
nutritionally v ulnerable populations, as well as
on where in the food supply chain the reductions
take place. For instance, a poor farmer will be
better off if less food is lost on the farm, which
may increase sales or the supply of food for
on-farm consumption. However, if less food
is lost or wasted further down the food supply
chain, the demand for the farmer’s products may
fall. In the long run, farmers may experience
higher incomes if demand increases as a result
of a growing population and rising incomes,

There are certainly societal gains to be made
by reducing food loss and waste. However, the
precise effects depend on complex interactions
within the food system. There is a need to design
inter ventions aimed at reducing food loss and
waste to take such interactions into account. n

SCOPE AND STRUCTURE
OF THE REPORT

 What are the appropriate inter ventions,
programmes and policies to manage levels of
food loss and waste?

This report contributes new evidence on
the state of food loss and waste and the
potential benefits of reducing it. It explores
where in the food supply chain food is lost or
wasted, and why. Drawing on this evidence,
it considers how targeted inter ventions along
the chain stages may achieve other objectives
also − most notably, improvements in food
securit y and nutrition and environmental
sustainabilit y. The ultimate objective pursued
will determine the choice of the most
appropriate and cost-effective inter ventions
towards food loss and waste reduction.

Throughout the analysis, the report identifies
a number of issues that require further
careful investigation.

The remainder of the report is structured
as follows
Chapter 2 discusses the drivers behind food loss
and waste and presents the variation of food loss
and waste along the food supply chain, as well
as by region and commodit y group. Chapter 3
presents the business and economic case for
reducing food loss and waste. Chapters 4 and 5
look in more detail at the implications of food
loss and waste for food securit y, nutrition and
environmental sustainabilit y. In particular,
they emphasize the importance of defining
measures to reduce food loss and waste on the
basis of the objective being pursued. They also
address the effectiveness of food loss and waste
reduction in reaching food securit y, nutrition and
environmental objectives, assessing the balance
between cost and benefits. Chapter 6 builds on
the analysis of the previous chapters to draw
policy implications and suggest areas for policy
inter ventions and improved data collection. n

This report asserts that if the goals set out
in SDG Target 12.3 are to be met, both
private and public inter ventions towards
reduced food loss and waste will play an
important role. Action by private agents –
producers and consumers – can ameliorate
the problem to the extent that reducing food
loss and waste is profitable for businesses
or saves consumers money. However, public
inter vention is justified where reducing food
loss and waste provides economic benefits
to societ y that exceed the costs, or ensures
progress towards societal objectives such as
improved food securit y and nutrition and
environmental sustainabilit y.
In the analysis of the links between food loss
and waste, on the one hand, and food securit y
and nutrition and environmental sustainabilit y,
on the other, the report addresses inter alia the
following questions:
 Can reducing food loss and waste in a
cost-effective way lead to improved food
securit y and nutrition and increased
environmental sustainabilit y?
 If so, in what circumstances and conditions is
this the case?
 What are the costs of doing this and how do
they compare with the benefits?
 Are there trade-offs between the two
objectives or with other significant
development or environmental objectives?

1

Global estimates of food loss and
waste are important to monitor
progress over time, but additional
information is needed to understand the
variability of food loss and waste
percentages across different contexts and
at critical loss points along the food
supply chain.

2

Information on the location, extent
and underlying causes of food loss
and waste is fundamental in drawing up
strategies aimed at food lost and waste
reduction.

3

The representation of food loss and
waste data is imbalanced: most
studies focus on fruits, vegetables, cereals
and pulses at the farm level, and are from
Central and Southern Asia, sub-Saharan
Africa and Eastern and South-eastern
Asia.

4

Loss and waste percentages are
generally higher for fruits and
vegetables than for cereals and pulses,
especially in situations where cold storage
or processing conditions are inadequate.

5

The wide variability of food loss and
waste across commodity groups and
supply chain stages, particularly in
sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern and
South-eastern Asia, points to the need for
improved data collection to inform
targeted reduction strategies.

CHAPTER 2

MONITORING FOOD
LOSS AND WASTE ALONG
FOOD SUPPLY CHAINS
The inclusion of food loss and waste reduction
in the SDGs has drawn widespread international
attention to this problem and has led to enhanced
efforts towards reduction. It has been prioritized
as a means towards inclusive and sustainable
food systems, especially through improvements
in environmental sustainabilit y and food securit y
and nutrition.

The chapter discusses the need for identifying
critical loss points – defined as points along the
food supply chain where food losses and waste are
most prominent and have the greatest impact on
food security – to formulate concrete proposals for
loss reduction. The identification of critical loss
points requires an analysis of specific food supply
chains to identify the stages where losses occur
and what their impacts are. FAO has developed
and applied a case study methodolog y for food
loss analysis to identify critical loss points in
selected food supply chains. The final section
of this chapter discusses the current challenges
of data collection and acknowledges that they
constitute an important barrier to understanding
the reality of food loss and waste. n

FAO’s Food Loss Index (FLI), the first important
attempt to monitor progress towards SDG
Target 12.3 (see Chapter 1), estimates that
globally, around 14 percent of all food from
post-har vest up to, but excluding, retail is lost.1
However, this estimate, future updates of which
will be important for monitoring purposes, is
not designed to provide information regarding
where in the food supply chain food losses
and waste occur, which products and in which
regions or countries they occur, or how large
they are and what their underlying causes and
drivers are.

MOVING BEYOND THE
GLOBAL ESTIMATE TO A
MORE COMPREHENSIVE
ANALYSIS OF FOOD LOSS
AND WASTE IN FOOD
SUPPLY CHAINS

This chapter opens with a discussion of
the importance of moving beyond a global
estimate to assess food loss and waste in a
context-specific manner and to formulate
insights into its complex and diverse causes
and drivers. It then presents the results of a
comprehensive FAO meta-analysis of currently
available studies on the extent, location and
causes of food losses and waste at various
stages on the food supply chain, spanning
different foods and regions. The meta-analysis
provides important indications towards
targeted policymaking for food loss and waste
reduction that take account of geographical
and product-related specificities. It also sheds
light on the state of the art of food loss and
waste monitoring by identif ying data gaps
behind the estimates for the various stages in
supply chains.

A global estimate of food loss and waste – such
as that for loss released through this report –
can provide a sense of how much food is lost or
wasted worldwide and help identif y the regions
and commodit y groups in which the issue is
particularly prominent. As said, it helps monitor
progress towards SDG Target 12.3. It can also
play a central part in raising awareness of and
promoting advocacy around the issue of food
loss and waste. However, such an estimate
cannot provide precise information on the extent
of losses and waste across different regions,
particularly regarding which commodities

FAO’S META-ANALYSIS OF EXISTING STUDIES INTO FOOD LOSS AND WASTE – METHODOLOGY
FAO’s meta-analysis on food loss and waste includes
more than 460 publications and reports from various
sources (including governments, universities and
international governmental and non-governmental
organizations), containing almost 20 000 data points.i
This chapter analyses about 2 300 of the 20 000
data points. The analysis excludes studies that measure
food loss and waste across entire food supply chains (a
reduction of more than 5 500 observations), rather
than individual stages within those supply chains, since
such studies prevent the analysis of losses or waste
along the food supply chain. It also excludes all 9 107
data points from the African Postharvest Losses
Information System (APHLIS) because, due to lack of
better data and resources, APHLIS allows a single point
estimation to be interpolated across time and different
crops and regions.ii
More than 65 percent of the data points included in
the meta-analysis refer to Central and Southern Asia,
followed by sub-Saharan Africa (17 percent) and

Eastern and South-eastern Asia (9 percent). Cereals
and pulses account for 28 percent of all data points
and fruits and vegetables for 33 percent.iii Note that
India accounts for 85 percent of the observations for
Central and Southern Asia, highlighting the need for
other countries in the region to step up their efforts to
measure losses and waste to formulate context-specific
reduction strategies. Ghana, Nigeria and the United
Republic of Tanzania are the countries in sub-Saharan
Africa for which the meta-analysis includes most data.
The studies included often used different measuring
methods, which hinders data comparison and may
result in a wide range of estimates. Despite these
caveats, however, the meta-analysis provides useful
insights into the extent and causes of food loss and
waste for various regions, commodity groups and
stages of the food supply chain. Such insights are
essential for policymakers and actors in the food supply
chain to formulate and implement strategies to reduce
food loss and waste.

The dataset underlying the meta-analysis is available at www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/flw-data. As new food loss and waste estimates are published, FAO will adjust
estimates of global loss and waste percentages. 2

helped to detect how food loss and waste varies
across stages in the food supply chain and regions
and commodity groups; in other words, how
context-dependent food loss and waste actually is.
FAO’s meta-analysis constitutes the most
comprehensive study of existing data on the extent,
location and causes of food losses and waste
undertaken to date, spanning food supply chains
and regions (see Box 6 for more information on its
methodology). By assessing variability across the
different stages of the food supply chain, commodity
groups and regions, FAO’s meta-analysis provides
essential guidance to countries working towards
reducing food loss and waste.
»

To this effect, FAO has conducted a major
meta-analysis synthesizing the results of a
large number of existing studies that measure
food loss and waste in countries all over the
world. The meta-analysis has served as input for
generating the first estimates of the FLI, given
the scarcity of official information reported by
countries. In addition, the meta-analysis has

BOX 7

HOW TO INTERPRET THE GRAPHS IN FIGURES 6, 7 AND 8
The meta-analysis conducted is meant to generate a
comprehensive snapshot of the information available
on food loss and waste (see Box 6). Packing all
this information in a single concise diagram is
challenging. A choice has been made to use box
plots as these help to graphically represent the
variability of food loss and waste, which is at the core
of the analysis (see Figures 6, 7 and 8). Using box plots
facilitates understanding of the nature of a whole
dataset at a single glance, including the distribution
of observed values and the value lying at the midpoint
of this distribution, also known as the median.
The figure in this box helps illustrate the usefulness
of the box plots in portraying the variability of food
loss and waste. More specifically, it shows a close-up
of the range of loss percentages in Eastern and Southeastern Asia at the farm level. As it is the case of every
box plot, the figure has two parts: a box (blue
rectangle) and the whiskers (lines extending
horizontally from the box). The start of the box, i.e. the
lower quartile moving from the left to the right,
represents 25 percent of the dataset. By looking at the
figure, it is clear that 25 percent of studies report a loss
value lower than 2.25 percent. Similarly, the end of the
box, i.e. the upper quartile, represents 75 percent of
the data. Again, from the graph, one can conclude that
75 percent of the studies in the region report loss at the

farm level under 10.5 percent. The median (i.e. value
lying at the midpoint of the distribution) is a little higher
than 5 percent, meaning that half the observations
have loss levels equal to or greater than this value, and
half have less.
The whiskers indicate variability outside the upper
and lower quartiles. The end of the whiskers represents
the minimum and maximum values of the distribution,
excluding outliers. An outlier is an observation point
that is distant from other observations, and thus falls
outside of the overall trend that is presented in the
data. In box plots, an outlier is a number which is
greater than the upper quartile by more than 1.5 times
the interquartile range, i.e. the distance between the
lower and upper quartile. In this case, it refers to any
number above 23 percent. For this reason, the dot on
the extreme right side of the figure, a loss value of
24 percent, is an outlier. Since outliers correspond to
any value falling beyond the whiskers, they can be
numerous and close to the whisker itself. In Central and
Southern Asia, for example, in Figure 6A, almost all loss
values for cereals and pulses at the level of on-farm
post-harvest operations are below 2.4 percent. In this
case, following the aforementioned “1.5 times the
interquartile range” rule, any percentage above 2.6
will thus be considered an outlier, explaining why there
are so many outliers and so close to the whisker itself.

where loss reduction inter ventions will have the
greatest impact. A comparison of Figures 6A and 6B

waste are higher for fruits and vegetables than
for cereals and pulses at all stages in the food

data on the amount of food wasted by consumers
and retailers. However, measuring food waste
has proved more complex than food losses.
While efforts are underway to define a commonly
accepted method to measure food waste, the
studies are few and hence the data on food waste
included in the meta-analysis are limited. n

This is not surprising as fruits and vegetables are
more perishable. Nevertheless, the levels of loss
and waste of cereals and pulses are still significant,
indicating a need for public or private intervention.
In addition, the wide range of reported percentages,
for example in sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern
and South-eastern Asia, highlights the scope
for reduction in certain cases. In Central and
Southern Asia, by contrast, the range of the loss
and waste percentages for cereals and pulses is
extremely limited for all stages of the supply chain.
This indicates that loss and waste of cereals and
pulses seems to be less frequent in the region.

VARIATION IN FOOD
LOSS AND WASTE ALONG
FOOD SUPPLY CHAINS –
RESULTS OF A
META-ANALYSIS
While the SDG monitoring requires splitting the
food supply chain to cover losses through the FLI
on the one hand, and food waste on the other, the
meta-analysis is an opportunity to observe the food
loss and waste variation along the food supply chain.

Losses for fruits and vegetables var y greatly,
indicating a significant potential for reduction,
especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern and
South-eastern Asia. The median levels of loss or
waste in Central and Southern Asia do not exceed
10 percent at any stage of the supply chain;
however, the considerable range in loss and waste
percentages indicates an important potential for
reduction, particularly during transportation and
at the wholesale and retail stage.

From production to wholesale and retail, Figure 6
provides an over view of the main results of FAO’s
meta-analysis of food loss and waste studies.
It shows the range of percentages of food lost or
wasted at the various stages of the food supply
chain for cereals and pulses (Figure 6A) and fruits
and vegetables (Figure 6B). The fig ure contains
data for Central and Southern Asia, Eastern and
South-eastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa,
while Figure 7 zooms in on the wholesale and
retail stage, supplemented by data from Northern
America and Europe. Only the consumption
stage is excluded from Figure 6, for reasons of data
availabilit y, but it is examined independently
in Figure 8 with data from Northern America and
Europe only. For g uidance on how to interpret
the graphical analysis in the fig ures, see Box 7.

The following sub-sections review the
meta-analysis in more depth by discussing loss
and waste percentages; highlighting where
loss estimates indicate the greatest need for
inter ventions; and providing an over view of the
key underlying causes of loss and waste for each
stage of the food supply chain.

On-farm losses

The wide ranges of values in Figure 6 highlight
the need to measure carefully losses and
waste at each stage in the food supply chain to
identif y where they occur. These points are to
be interpreted as snapshots of estimated losses
for various stages and commodities at different
times. Looking at the ranges in losses – rather
than only at the median – is useful for identif ying

On-farm food losses can occur before,
during or after har vesting; in certain cases,
crops may be left unhar vested in the field.
The causes of on-farm losses are numerous and
context-specific. They are often inf luenced by
prehar vest factors such as weather conditions,
seed qualit y, crop variet y and growing practices,
infestation by pests and infections by diseases. »

 Unsuitable harvest timing – Farmers are
often forced to har vest prematurely to meet an
urgent need for food or cash, or due to
insecurit y and fear of theft; in the case of crop
rotation, however, they may knowingly har vest
too early to plant a more lucrative crop. 5–7
Har vesting highly perishable food products too
early may result in the food lacking f lavour or
failing to ripen, while har vesting too late may
cause it to be fibrous or overripe. 8 Delayed
har vesting can lead to the lignification of
crops, 9, 10 infestation by pests or contamination
with af latoxins (e.g. maize).11, 12
 Unexpected harsh climatic conditions and
environment – Excessive rainfall or a lack of
rain causes significant prehar vest and posthar vest losses.13–15 Insect and pest infestations
are another important cause of losses.14, 16, 17
 Harvest and handling practices – Part of a
crop may be missed during har vest due to the
lack of or inadequate machiner y, insufficient or
excessive dr ying of crops, or damage to grains
during threshing and shelling.13, 18
 Infrastructure and marketing challenges –
Farmers may prefer not to market, or even
har vest, their crops if, for instance, the cost of
reaching markets due to poor transport is too
high relative to the market price. Lack of
storage facilities is another significant
determinant of loss and compounds other
causes of loss.13

and pulses are highest in sub-Saharan Africa
and Eastern and South-eastern Asia. Here, loss
ranges from 0.1 to 18 percent; the bulk of
these obser vations concern maize and rice.
Meanwhile, more than 90 percent of obser vations
in Central and Southern Asia are from India
and report losses of less than 4 percent,
indicating that losses of cereals and pulses are
not problematic in the countr y. It should be
recognized that almost half of these results are
driven by a 2005 –2007 nationwide sur vey to
assess post-har vest losses in India. 3 It is also
interesting to note that over 40 percent of the
obser vations for Central and Southern Asia
concern pulses, ref lecting their high level of
consumption in the region, not least in India,
relative to other regions (where less than
2 percent of obser vations concern pulses). 4
Figure 6B presents loss percentages for fruits
and vegetables at farm level for Central and
Southern Asia, Eastern and South-eastern Asia
and sub-Saharan Africa. Losses are highest in
sub-Saharan Africa, where the upper half of the
obser vations report 15 to 50 percent. i Given this
ver y broad range, an inter vention to reduce these
losses would be best targeted to the upper end of
this range for a greater impact. Losses are lower
in Eastern and South-eastern Asia, with the
median loss amounting to about 5 percent, and
the maximum 12.5 percent (excluding outliers). j
Losses in Central and Southern Asia (the bulk of
them in India) are even lower: the median loss
amounts to 1.3 percent, and losses range between
0 and about 7 percent (excluding outliers).

For fish, highly perishable meat and animal
products, important causes of loss include
improper har vesting, slaughtering, handling or
storing practices. Improper fish har vesting
techniques lead to the capture of unsaleable
(unwanted or inedible) species which are
discarded debilitated or dead.19–21 In the Amazon
River around 15 percent of fish from Colombia
and 33 percent of fish from Peru are lost due to
attacks from predators, discarding fish which are
outside the legal limits, or lack of adequate
storage on fishing vessels. Other fish is caught as
bycatch using inappropriate nets and then
discarded. 22 In the case of milk, deficient milking
equipment, poor sanitation during milking,
inappropriate initial handling (e.g. spillage) and
lack of cooling facilities are among the major
causes of losses. Poor sanitation can result in the
contamination of a whole batch of milk, forcing
farmers to discard it entirely. 21, 23

The variation in on-farm losses across regions
may be partly explained by the range of reasons
in the literature. To summarize all possible
causes would be impossible, as these are highly
context-dependent, based on the crop, commodit y
group and geography. However, the following
categories highlight the key factors at play:

i The results for sub-Saharan Africa should be interpreted with caution
in view of the limited sample size (26 observations) and possible
inconsistencies in the methodologies used to estimate losses.
j As only 20 data points were collected, however, this does not permit
a meaningful interpretation of results.

FARMER-REPORTED CAUSES OF ON-FARM LOSSES OF STAPLE CROPS
The International Food Policy Research Institute
(IFPRI) recently examined the nature and causes of
preharvest, harvest and post-harvest losses for five
staple crops in China, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Guatemala,
Honduras and Peru. Farmers used specially designed
surveys to report on the major causes of losses and
the reasons why they left crops in the fields. The main
causes of preharvest losses (see Figure A in this box)
include infestation by pests and diseases and drought
(especially for teff in Ethiopia). The main reason
crops are left unharvested (see Figure B) is because
of inadequate harvesting techniques; only in Ecuador

are poor quality or small size of produce, shortage
of workers or excessive labour costs more important.
In China, weather conditions are also one of the main
reasons why produce is left in the field.
The main cause of post-harvest losses (see Figure C),
with the exception of China and Ethiopia, is damage to
crops by workers during harvesting or sorting.14 In
China, mechanical damage is most prevalent, followed
by damage caused by labourers during harvesting. In
Ethiopia, most post-harvest losses occur because
produce is blown away or spilled. Other causes
include poor storage and damage by labourers.

Figure 6A shows that the range of losses in cereals
and pulses during storage varies significantly
from one region to another. Losses appear to
be insignificant in Central and Southern Asia,
with more than 90 percent of the obser vations
again referring to India and reporting losses
of less than 2 percent. In the other two
regions, losses during storage are considerable.
In sub-Saharan Africa, the median level of loss
stands at around 7 percent and the maximum
loss reaches 22.5 percent (excluding outliers).
Inter ventions targeting these higher loss

estimates will be most effective, especially
when accounting for lessons learned from the
literature. Many farmers in sub-Saharan Africa
still use traditional grain stores made of grass,
wood and mud, which offer little protection
against pests. 5, 25 In some cases, farmers store
grains inside their own house due to a lack of
storage facilities, or because they are afraid of
theft. 26 In Eastern and South-eastern Asia, losses
range from 0.3 to 15 percent. The variation here
is smaller than for sub-Saharan Africa, which
means that losses are close to the median of

INDIRECT DRIVERS OF ON-FARM LOSSES OF STAPLE CROPS
A study by IFPRI on the indirect drivers of on-farm
post-harvest losses in eight low- and middle-income
countries uses data from the World Bank (Living
Standard Measurement Study, Integrated Surveys on
Agriculture) for Malawi, Nigeria and the United Republic
of Tanzania; and IFPRI survey data for the remaining five
countries – Ecuador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras
and Peru.24 Owing to data limitations on measuring food
losses along the food supply chain, the study examines
on-farm post-harvest losses only.
The study identifies all cases of post-harvest losses at
the extensive margin, that is the share of farm
households that experienced any post-harvest loss; and
at the intensive margin, referring to the average
percentage of production lost among those farmers
reporting losses. Different types of crops are examined
for different countries.i
The study demonstrates that loss percentages vary
greatly between households, from one crop to the other
and across countries. The data for Malawi, Nigeria
and the United Republic of Tanzania allow assessment
of distribution of losses across households. No farm
households report losses exceeding 30 percent and
many report less than 10 percent for several crops.
The study further identifies the determinants of
on-farm post-harvest losses at the household level, using
econometric models. It considers the demographic
characteristics of a household (age, years of education
and sex of the household head, and household size),
factors relating to production (output level, agricultural
assets, equipment owned and inputs used),ii socioeconomic factors (per capita household expenditure,
access to electricity and/or piped water and

possessing a bank account) and geographic and
climatic factors (distance to the nearest road or market,
temperatures, precipitation and agroclimatic zone).
The study finds the determinants of post-harvest
losses vary greatly from one country to another and
between crops (see the table in this box). The likelihood
of post-harvest losses increases with the age of the
household head in Ethiopia (teff) and the United
Republic of Tanzania (maize), but decreases for maize
in Guatemala and beans in Honduras, while age was
not significant in other cases.iii Other factors, including
education, gender, household wealth, ownership of farm
assets or use of modern inputs, had an insignificant or
ambiguous impact on post-harvest losses across different
contexts. One important implication of the heterogeneity
of these results is the need to tailor policies aimed at
reducing losses to the context of each supply chain.
However, for certain determinants, a consistent
pattern emerges from the analysis. First, lack of access
to markets, as measured by the distance to the nearest
road, is found to contribute significantly to losses in
Ecuador (potatoes), Guatemala (maize), Malawi
(maize) and Nigeria (maize). It is easier for farmers
who are better connected to markets to sell their
produce before it spoils. Second, post-harvest losses
are found to decrease as output goes up (except for
beans in Honduras and maize in Malawi). Where
applicable, these common traits are of immediate
relevance for policymaking. Improving infrastructure to
facilitate transportation of produce to markets is likely
to reduce post-harvest losses across contexts, as are
efforts to encourage farmers to collaborate, for
example by sharing storage facilities.

apples, tomatoes and caulif lower are the most
represented foods. 3 Half of the obser vations
for Eastern and South-eastern Asia refer to
cabbage in China and report losses up to
47.5 percent, thereby highlighting the need for
loss inter ventions. Similarly, the 14 obser vations
for sub-Saharan Africa indicate losses of
0.5 –35 percent, and mostly refer to mangoes
and tomatoes. The high level of food losses in
both regions is not surprising given the highly

ii
Studies on the determinants of food losses often include the scale of production as a possible cause, since farmers who are able to produce more tend to deploy better farming
practices, and thus incur lower losses. In this study, this is confirmed for most cases at the intensive margin (i.e. for the degree of post-harvest losses). Exceptions include Malawi,
Nigeria and Honduras. To prevent the independent variable from influencing the econometric results, considering the level of production is also used to calculate the share of food loss,
the data for level of production were transformed into logarithms. Measuring the level of production differently helped to minimize possible estimation bias. In any case, no major
differences were found in the sign or size of other determinants when testing the regression models excluding scale of production.

perishable nature of these fruits and vegetables,
which can spoil, often within hours, in the
absence of adequate storage facilities. 27, 28 The
use of the most adequate t ype of storage can
effectively prevent losses, as seen in Cameroon,
where small and medium forest enterprises
storing eru, a wild vegetable, in jute bags instead
of plastic ones reduced the chance of rotting and
increased shelf life by over a week. 29

Inadequate storage conditions (e.g. insufficient
disinfection) may cause significant losses, and
the earlier qualit y of a product and previous
decisions in the supply chain may lead to a
shorter shelf life even under the best storage
conditions. 5, 30, 31 Certain climatic conditions,
especially heat and moisture, tend to promote
biological deterioration (for example, attacks
from bacteria, fungi or insects), especially
without proper storage and transportation

REFRIGERATED WAREHOUSE CAPACITIES AND NEEDS AROUND THE WORLD
Countries have different needs for refrigerated
warehousing, largely due to variations in population,
per capita income and geographic location.
To facilitate comparisons across countries, the Global
Cold Chain Alliance has created a market development
index that compares the total refrigerated warehouse
capacity of a country to its urban population (a proxy
for potential need). Globally, there is an average
0.2 cubic metres of refrigerated warehousing space
per urban resident.37 The figure in this box shows that
this capacity varies greatly from one country to the
next, depending on consumers’ buying power and food
production and trading patterns.

Generally, higher-income countries have greater
refrigerated warehouse capacity relative to potential
need. The emerging market economies of Brazil,
China, Mexico and Turkey are among the
middle-ranked countries in terms of refrigerated
space per urban resident (see figure) with relatively
high refrigerated warehouse capacity. Meanwhile,
several other middle-ranked countries suffer from a
large unmet need for refrigerated warehouse space.
These generally have low-income households and
limited modern retail infrastructure.37

Therefore, adequate cold storage (including,
for example, freezing fish or meat) is crucial to
prevent food losses and preser ve qualit y at each
step of the food supply chain. 32

Africa; all 33 data points for these regions
present estimates of less than 4 percent, with
the exception of one obser vation. The limited
perishabilit y of cereals and pulses may
explain the low losses; however, the limited
number of obser vations does not lead to any
firm conclusions. Likewise, losses in Eastern
and South-eastern Asia are based on a small
number of obser vations (7); therefore the loss
estimates (a maximum of 15 percent) may not be
ver y reliable.

In lower-income countries, more fresh fruit
and vegetable loss is attributable to poor
infrastructure than in industrialized countries. 33
In fact, many lower-income countries lose
significant amounts of food during storage,
often due to poor storage facilities, including
refrigerated warehouses. 34, 35 Whereas in
most high-income countries adequate storage
facilities, including refrigerated warehouses, are
available and effective throughout the supply
chain. 5, 36 If losses do occur during storage, it
is generally because of a technical breakdown,
poor management of temperature or humidit y, or
overstocking. 5 Box 10 discusses how refrigerated
warehouse capacities and needs var y globally.

Losses of fruits and vegetables (Figure 6B) are
significantly higher than those for cereals and
pulses, hardly surprising given their perishable
and fragile nature. Fruits and vegetables are
often either poorly packed or not packed at all;
transported in open, unrefrigerated trucks;
and subject to mechanical injur y owing to
compression, abrasion and rough handling during
handling operations and transportation, making
them highly v ulnerable to deterioration. 27, 38
The variabilit y in losses ref lects, in part, the
significant variation in transport capacit y in
various supply chains across the world and
highlights where inter ventions may be most
effective in preventing such loss.

Transportation
Transportation introduces a time gap between
various stages of the food supply chain, from
production to consumption. This time gap
increases the risk that food products, particularly
perishable ones, may be damaged or lost; e.g.
due to excessive heat or cold, damage in transit,
contamination, etc. 5

The upper half of the obser vations for Central
and Southern Asia report losses of 8 –25 percent,
indicating transportation is a critical loss point
for fruits and vegetables. Inter ventions targeting
fruit and vegetable loss during transportation
may be particularly effective, especially in
Bangladesh and Nepal, where loss levels are

Processing and packaging

loss is low (around 2 percent), but percentages
var y significantly, with the upper whisker
ending at 28 percent (and an outlier estimating
loss as high as 35 percent), suggesting there
may be room for improvement at this stage
of the supply chain. Most studies measured
loss for mangoes and tomatoes but the limited
number of data points (15) indicates the need
to analyse results carefully. The median loss of
fruits and vegetables in transit in Eastern and
South-eastern Asia stands at around 8 percent
– the highest of all the regions. However, the
range of variation is smallest. Results indicate
that loss is more prominent for lettuce, papayas
and tomatoes in the Philippines, but results need
to be interpreted with caution given the limited
number of estimates (11).

The amount of food lost during processing
depends in large part on the t y pe of raw material
and the nature of the processing operations.
Lower-income countries suffer from generally
inadequate or non-existent processing facilities,
especially for products that are highly perishable
(e.g. milk and fish) or seasonal (e.g. mangoes).
Figure 6A presents loss percentages for the
processing and packaging of cereals and pulses.
All 12 obser vations for Central and Southern
Asia are for India, indicating losses of nearly
0 percent. One explanation may be that a third
of the crops in the analysis are pulses, which
are mostly consumed whole or split, with
minimal processing. Chickpeas are usually
consumed as f lour but only one obser vation in
the meta-analysis concerns them. Meanwhile, all
15 loss estimates for Eastern and South-eastern
Asia, and 90 percent of those for sub-Saharan
Africa, concern cereals, which often undergo
complex processing operations and are therefore
more susceptible to losses. It is not surprising
that the loss percentage for these two regions
is higher than for Central and Southern Asia.
The middle 50 percent of obser vations for Eastern
and South-eastern Asia indicate losses ranging
from 2.5 to 15 percent, with a median value of
8 percent. In rural areas, processing operations
are often manual, resulting in higher losses. 30
In the case of rice, milling causes the highest
post-har vest losses. 46 In sub-Saharan Africa,
the entire range of obser vations is higher than
for Eastern and South-eastern Asia. While the
median loss is low at about 4 percent, the
upper whisker reaches 20 percent (excluding
outliers), suggesting the need for inter vention to
prevent loss.

Fish is a highly perishable food and ver y
susceptible to post-har vest losses resulting from
inadequate handling during transportation,
storage and processing.19 In Brazil, 3 percent
of all fish caught in the Amazon is lost during
transportation, due to bad loading. 22 Meanwhile,
7.5 percent of all fish caught in the Amazon in
Peru is in an advanced state of decomposition
upon landing, and is discarded. 22
During transport, good physical infrastructure
and efficient trade logistics are key to preventing
food losses. Improved access to roads and
railways significantly reduces food losses in
40 countries of various income levels. 39 This
can be particularly important during the rainy
season, when the likelihood of landslides or road
blockage increases. 40 Yet, many lower-income
countries lack the infrastructure (vehicles, roads,
crates, etc.) and organizational resources to
conser ve perishables during transportation. 27
Box 11 presents an example of an innovative
solution for transporting fresh produce in
traditional supply chains for mass markets in
Southern and South-eastern Asia. Delays caused
by inspection of imported products at the point
of entr y frequently hold up shipments and reduce
the shelf life of goods around the world; however,
cumbersome paperwork procedures, which, for
example, have been documented in Latin America
and the Caribbean, exacerbate losses during
trade. 5, 32

Figure 6B represents losses during processing
or packaging for fruits and vegetables.
The obser vations for Central and Southern Asia
are all below 1 percent, with almost all studies
conducted in India. However, the small sample
size (15) does not allow the conclusion at this
stage that there are no fruit and vegetable
losses. In Eastern and South-Eastern Asia,
loss percentages range from 0 to 37.5 percent;
however, there are only three obser vations, so no
reliable conclusions can be drawn. The analysis

REDUCING FRUIT AND VEGETABLE LOSSES DURING TRANSPORTATION

Fruits and vegetables are highly perishable; once
harvested, they need to be handled using appropriate
practices to maintain their quality. Transport is a
critical loss point in the supply chains of fruits and
vegetables, owing largely to inadequate use of bulk
packaging and poor temperature and relative humidity
management. Quality loss resulting from mechanical
damage – evidenced by bruising, distortion in the
shape of produce, cracking and punctures – leads to
discoloration, accelerated ripening, weight loss due to
increased transpiration and accelerated decay; these
factors, in turn, bring about economic losses.
Through its Technical Cooperation Programme,
FAO has introduced improved, sustainable bulk
packaging (in the form of stackable and nestable
plastic crates), along with good post-harvest
management practice, to transport fresh produce in

traditional supply chainsi in a number of Southern and
South-eastern Asian countries. The use of crates during
transport, as shown in the table in this box, has
significantly reduced both quantitative losses (produce
rejected outright at the wholesale market) and
qualitative losses (produce that is damaged but still
saleable). Reduced qualitative losses have allowed
wholesalers to diversify their customer base, for
example by supplying the hospitality and food services
sectors and supermarkets, resulting in economic
benefits, not only for them, but also for farmers. Public
market retailers and their customers have benefited
from better quality produce with a longer shelf life.
Where crates replaced single-use plastic bags, this has
also brought environmental benefits. Another benefit
has been the creation of additional jobs in
transporting and cleaning the crates.

for Eastern and South-eastern Asia, var ying

data points concern processing and packaging of
mangoes – a highly seasonal, perishable fruit – in
Ghana and Kenya. The capacit y of the processing

high losses. 5

technical malfunctions that lead to rejection of

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2019

Fruits and vegetables and other highly
perishable foods, such as animal or baker y
products and cooked foods, generally suffer
higher levels of waste at the retail stage than
staples such as cereals, pulses and canned
foods. 5 This is confirmed for the Asian regions
and sub-Saharan Africa in Figure 7. The deviating
result for cereals and pulses in Northern
America and Europe can be explained by the
limited obser vations.

the final product due to non-compliance with
standards imposed by buyers. However, low
rejection rates are not necessarily an indication
that defects are rare; on the contrar y, low losses
may ref lect poor compliance with food safet y and
qualit y standards or enforcement thereof. 5
Processing and packaging play a role in
preser ving foods. Many tropical crops are
preser ved by dr ying and processing into
shelf-stable products. Packaging preser ves the
qualit y and extends the shelf life of a product,
thus reducing food loss or waste. However, it
can also harm the environment by creating more
plastic waste (see Chapter 5).

Between 0 and 15 percent of fruits and vegetables
are wasted at the retail level in all regions except
sub-Saharan Africa, where waste levels are up
to 35 percent (excluding outliers), indicating
a strong potential for waste reduction in this
region. The possible causes of the wide range
include inadequate packaging and temperature
and humidit y control, especially when produce
is sold under the hot sun in open-air markets,
causing wilting or shrivelling. 5 Among the Asian
regions, the median waste value is the same, but
the percentages for Central and Southern Asia
have a higher variabilit y, suggesting greater
scope for waste reduction.

Wholesale and retail
The causes of food waste in retail are linked
to the limited shelf life of perishable foods, to
private qualit y standards of buyers and variabilit y
of demand, in particular for fresh produce. 47
The actions and decisions by retailers as to the
qualit y and quantit y of food products dictate
those of their suppliers. Storage conditions,
packaging qualit y and handling practices greatly
impact on the qualit y, shelf life and acceptabilit y
of food products.

The median waste percentage for fruits and
vegetables at the retail level is lowest in
Northern America and Europe. However, it is
still significant (3.75 percent) and losses range
over 10 percent, supporting the finding that in
high-income countries, retail waste levels can
be high. It was estimated that 10 percent of all
food in the United States of America is wasted
in-store. 49 In Norway, retail accounted for
17 percent of total food waste in 2015. 50

Figure 7 presents loss and waste levels for cereals
and pulses, and fruits and vegetables in Central
and Southern Asia, Eastern and South-eastern
Asia, Northern America and Europe, and
sub-Saharan Africa. Note that the estimates in
Figure 7 may also capture food lost at the wholesale
level. Indeed, in many countries, particularly
in low-income countries, it is hard to make
a distinction between wholesale and retail
markets. 48

A factor that contributes to food waste at retail
level, especially in high-income countries, is
the tendency to sell homogenous and “perfect”
produce (in terms of colour, shape, size, etc.).
Food that fails to meet these high standards is
discarded. While processing less than perfect
products into ready-made foods may be a way
of using discarded fresh foods, these foods
spoil easily and are often discarded at the end
of the day or sold at a lower price, ref lecting
qualitative waste. 5

Obser vations on losses for cereals and pulses
are most prevalent for Central and Southern
Asia, showing a range of less than 2 percent loss
(excluding outliers). Only three obser vations
are available for Eastern and South-eastern
Asia (with losses ranging from 1 to 4.5 percent).
The range of losses for Northern America
and Europe is the highest among cereals and
pulses, yet there are only four obser vations in
the meta-analysis, which does not allow any
meaningful conclusions to be drawn.

Likewise, highly perishable products such as
fish are more likely to suffer qualit y loss or
even be discarded if not sold quickly. In Brazil,

for example, unsold fish was found to have a

problem. Indeed, the higher the household
wealth, the more food consumers waste.
Growing incomes and demographic and
cultural changes over the past decades have
led to changes in eating habits, which often
favour convenience.

While some causes of food waste at the retail
level apply more to high-income countries, waste
can be significant in lower-income countries too.
Losses may be higher where there is inadequate
protective packaging, temperature and humidit y
control, such as mixing products like fruits,
vegetables, milk and meat in a single cold room
or not displaying products properly. 5

too much food, and a lack of knowledge on how to
use leftovers in other recipes instead of discarding
them. 53–55 An analysis of United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland households
found that even if people are aware of the
problem of food waste, household provisioning
routines, time management, accounting for
family tastes and food safety concerns can drive
day-to-day waste. 56, 57 The analysis shows that
food waste often results from the complex and
contradictory demands of everyday life, including
time constraints. 58, 59 Indeed, where time is
scarce, consumers buy less often and in greater
quantities, resulting in higher levels of waste. 5

foods are also significant; however, there are only
five obser vations for these food groups, which
limits the validit y of the results.
Most consumer food waste studies take place
in high-income countries where the problem is
particularly acute, especially in the United States
of America and Europe. In the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the
non-governmental organization (NGO) Waste
and Resources Action Programme ( W R AP) has
been particularly active. 5 It is estimated that
the average household in the countr y wasted
GBP (pounds sterling) 470 worth of food in
2015. 52 Consumer food waste in the United States
of America was estimated at USD (United States
dollars) 370 per capita in 2010, equal to 9 percent
of average per capita food expenditure, or
1 percent of per capita disposable income. 49

Portion and package size are important
determinants of food waste. A study conducted
in Sweden suggests that about a quarter of food
waste is related to package size. 60 Consumers
may be forced to buy more than they need
because only large packages are available.
W R AP, for example, has found that around
one-third of consumers are unhappy with
package sizes and a large majorit y complain

Consumer waste is often a result of poor purchase
planning, excess and impulse buying, confusion
over labels (“best before” and “use by”), poor

about the amount of packaging. It was also found
that consumers are not necessarily opposed to
paying a little more per unit to avoid having to
buy too much. 61 A FAO study on self-reported
waste in the Philippines found low levels of
consumer waste and the conclusions suggest that
consumers’ abilit y to purchase small quantities of
fruits and vegetables at both public markets and
supermarkets reduces waste. 62

So far, the chapter has focused on the results
of the meta-analysis on the extent of food loss
and waste for various regions, commodit y
groups and stages along the food supply chain.
Despite providing essential input to the FLI
and information useful for targeted reduction
measures, such an analysis is not intended
to identif y critical loss points in specific food
supply chains. This requires a comprehensive
assessment of losses throughout the whole
food supply chain, to identif y the stages where
losses occur and what their impacts are. This is
essential to g uide actors in how to significantly
reduce food losses in key supply chains and
improve food securit y and farmers’ incomes.

Promotions or bulk discounts (e.g. three-for-two
or economic packages) may entice consumers
to buy on impulse, which encourages waste. 5, 63
In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, promotions make up a third of
grocer y expenditure and the trend is increasing. 64
Significant quantities of food are also wasted at
food ser vice outlets, including school canteens
and restaurants. 34, 65–67
The socio-economic and demographic
characteristics of a household also inf luence
the level of food waste it produces. 33 Small
households and high-income households
generally waste more food, because the
amount of food they buy and prepare is usually
larger than the amount they can consume.
Large packaging size may be a driver of higher
food waste levels, as well as the fact that the
higher a household’s income is, the lower the
relative value of food is for that household. 5
Culturally, food may also be used as a symbol
of prosperit y. Households with a higher
socio-economic status may purchase more, and
more varied, food especially if this is visible
to others (for example, at social events); such
behaviour leads to more food waste. 28 However,
these broad tendencies var y considerably between
countries and regions. 54 Food waste studies must
take due account of the role of social and cultural
drivers in food consumption patterns and
attitudes towards food. 5 n

Since 2015, FAO’s Global Initiative on Food Loss
and Waste (Save Food) has carried out a number
of case studies in almost 30 countries k to identify
critical loss points for crops, milk and fish produced
by smallholders, using a common methodology
developed that same year. Due to a common
methodology, a comparison of the various studies
is possible, although the studies should not be
considered as nationally representative. 69 The
objectives of the case studies are to:
 identif y and assess the main causes of food
loss in specific food supply chains;
 analyse the solutions for reducing food loss
with respect to their technical and economic
feasibilit y, food qualit y and safet y

environmental sustainabilit y; and

FAO’S SAVE FOOD CASE STUDIES ON CRITICAL LOSS POINTS FOR CROPS, MILK AND FISH

FAO’s case study methodology for food loss analysis
has been applied by FAO’s Global Initiative on Food
Loss and Waste (Save Food) since 2015 in 88 food
supply chains across 28 countries. The common
methodology foresees the following steps: (i) screening
– initial research into what is known that identifies
priority food supply chains; (ii) field investigation
– interviews, surveys, studies in the field with
stakeholders; (iii) load tracking – loss assessment at
critical loss points; and (iv) synthesis – analysis of
causes of losses and solutions. The ultimate objective is
to outline an intervention programme for reduction in
the food losses identified, at the local, subnational or
national level.
Out of the 88 critical loss point studies in
smallholder production, 56 were reviewed in a
synthesis report.68 Over 70 percent of these studies
were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, followed by
Asia (12.5 percent) and Latin America (16 percent).
Cereals accounted for almost half of the studies (nearly
all of them in sub-Saharan Africa), followed by fruits
(21 percent), legumes (11 percent) and roots and
tubers (11 percent).
Harvesting appears to be a critical loss point for all
types of food in over 70 percent of the case studies. In
Africa in particular, the critical loss points for cereal
grains and legumes are consistently at the harvesting
and on-farm storage stages, regardless of location or
climate. The causes of grain loss at harvesting reported
most frequently by farmers include attacks by pests and

insects and the effects of diseases, adverse climatic
conditions (e.g. rainfall during harvesting),
inappropriate timing of the harvest and lack of labour
or funds. Inadequate storage facilities (e.g. insufficient
ventilation) and poor handling practices are the main
causes of on-farm storage losses.
Likewise, harvesting is identified as the most
common critical loss point for roots, tubers and fruits,
together with packing (handling and treatment
operations) and transportation. For fruits, the most
frequently reported causes of loss during harvest relate
to the stage of maturity, timing and scheduling, poor
sorting, handling and harvesting methods, adverse
climatic conditions, diseases and attacks by insects and
birds. Losses during packing and transportation were
mostly associated with poor handling, inadequate
storage conditions and inappropriate packaging.68
These findings show the need for great attention to
the timing and methods of harvesting, especially since
what happens during the harvest may determine both
quantitative and qualitative losses further along the
chain. To reduce on-farm losses, farmers need training
to help determine the point of maturity of their crops, to
time the harvest accordingly and to protect crops from
adverse weather conditions, diseases and attacks by
pests and insects.68 Although more studies are needed
to confirm the findings of Save Food’s case studies, the
consistent findings (especially for grains and legumes
in sub-Saharan Africa) as to the location, extent and
causes of critical loss points confirm their reliability.

solutions to be identified. It is also designed
to complement national analyses. So far, it
has been effective in directing attention to the
food loss situation in a range of countries and
commodities by several stakeholders. In some
cases, governments, with the support of donors,
have moved on to pilot the implementation of
the recommended inter ventions to generate
evidence about their impact on losses and
economic returns. 68

Box 12 provides a summar y of the main findings
to date. They suggest that har vesting is a
common critical loss point for all commodities
(identified in over 70 percent of case studies).
Indeed, for grains and leg umes, critical loss
points were consistently found during har vesting
and on-farm storage, particularly in Africa,
regardless of location or climate. Likewise, for
fruits, roots and tubers, har vesting appears to be
a critical loss point along with packing (handling

CHAPTER 2 MONITORING FOOD LOSS AND WASTE ALONG FOOD SUPPLY CHAINS

and treatment operations) and transportation.
Most reported causes relate to the stage of
maturit y, timing and scheduling; poor handling
and har vesting methods; adverse climatic
conditions; and attacks by pests, insects and
effects of diseases. These results are useful in
targeting inter ventions to reduce losses as they
suggest the need to provide farmers with training
to identif y the point of maturit y of their crops, to
improve their har vesting and handling methods,
and to protect crops from weather shocks, pests,
insects and diseases.

First, divergent food loss and waste definitions
and measuring methods and metrics make
comparing studies across countries and food
supply chains and over time ver y difficult,
sometimes even impossible. 5, 13 For example,
the terms “food loss” and “food waste” are
often used interchangeably. In addition, various
methods of data collection may result in the
under- or over-reporting of food loss and waste.
Self-reported estimates often under-report the
real amount of food lost or wasted.14, 70 While
in many respects expert opinions are useful for
defining the problems and identif ying hot spots
(especially given the complexit y of collecting
information on determinant factors), they often
do not change or update their opinions over time,
thereby embedding their biases in the underlying
data upon which countries build policies. 48

The FAO case study analysis of critical loss points
contrasts with the meta-analysis presented above.
The meta-analysis is based on a large collection
of existing studies assessing food loss and waste
across the world, which did not necessarily
follow the food supply chains to identify the
stage of greatest loss, as was done in the FAO
case study methodolog y to identify critical
loss points. Nor were stakeholders necessarily
engaged to determine the food supply chains
on which food loss and waste has the greatest
impact – which did happen to be the case in the
identification of critical loss points. While the
meta-analysis provides a more comprehensive
overview into the extent of food loss and waste
across different regions, stages of the food supply
chain and commodities, the analysis of critical
loss points makes it possible to identity losses and
their causes in specific food supply chains with
stakeholder involvement. However, critical loss
points are only available for a selected number of
countries and food supply chains and exclusively
study losses in smallholder supply chains. n

Second, sur veys on the extent, location and
causes of food loss and waste are complex,
time-consuming and costly and may require
collaboration between various specialists
and the carr ying of heav y equipment for field
operations (e.g. weighing and carr ying rice from
remote areas to measure loss during dr ying).
Moreover, food supply chains for different food
products may differ greatly in terms of their
characteristics, processes, stages and agents
involved; sur veys must take due account of these
factors. In addition, data must be collected in a
consistent manner, at a relevant geographical
scale, and a proper sampling strateg y needs to
be implemented at the different nodes of the
food supply chain. However, the technical and
organizational capacities and funds necessar y to
carr y out such complex sur veys are often lacking.
Thus, even where they exist, data points are few
and often show considerable uncertainties. 71

CHALLENGES OF DATA
COLLECTION

Because of these complexities, it is common for
studies to extrapolate loss estimates to other
time periods, or even to neighbouring regions
and other foods from the same product group.
Such studies provide only an approximate
view of realit y, and fail to produce the reliable
and accurate estimates needed for targeted
policymaking. An example of such a study
is the often cited African Posthar vest Losses
Information System (APHLIS) for post-har vest
losses of cereals (expressed in weight) in
sub-Saharan Africa. Due to data gaps and

Many countries around the world recognize the
importance of reducing food loss and waste and
this has been enshrined in the SDGs. Now comes
the next step – as argued earlier in this chapter,
identifying the causes and drivers of food loss and
waste, formulating possible reduction solutions,
prioritizing objectives and monitoring progress
towards these objectives will require more reliable,
comparable and transparent data. As of yet, major
data gaps remain, for various reasons.

resource constraints, APHLIS extrapolates data
points (mostly estimates provided by experts)
to other time periods, crops and regions.
For this reason, the analysis in Figure 6 excludes
APHLIS data.

(waste compositional analysis) has proved to
be highly complex, expensive and sometimes
impossible. Due to these complexities, there is no
general agreement on what constitutes the most
appropriate method to measure consumer food
waste; this (partly) explains the scarcit y of data
on the amount of food wasted at consumption.

The complexit y of collecting food loss data
explains why only 39 countries have officially
reported loss data on an annual basis bet ween
1990 and 2017 through FAO’s Questionnaire on
Crop and Livestock Production and Utilization. 72
Hence, the FLI includes both data prov ided
by governments and data produced by NGOs,
academia and other institutions upon which
the findings of the meta-analysis are based
(e.g. case studies, sur veys, research, etc.). Figure 9
shows a heat map of the availabilit y of food loss
data for various reg ions and product g roups.
Figure 9A shows that governments in Latin A merica
and the Caribbean have reported more data
since 1990 than those in other reg ions (mostly
for fruits and vegetables), followed by Northern
A merica and Europe. Official data from the other
reg ions are scarcer. Figure 9B shows that most
non-governmental studies concern countries
in Central and Southern Asia, in particular for
fruits and vegetables.

FAO has worked towards harmonizing concepts
related to food loss and waste, both internally
and with external partners. There is a consensus
on definitions of food loss and food waste which
will help overcome the existing data gaps (see
Boxes 1 and 2 for a detailed description of concepts
related to food loss and waste). FAO has also
formulated g uidelines for measuring food loss,
to assist countries in their official reporting
(see the measurement g uidelines developed by
the Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and
Rural Statistics). 71 Through a multi-stakeholder
partnership, the Food Loss and Waste Protocol
has published the Food Loss and Waste Accounting
and Reporting Standard to harmonize data
collection. 76 The Food Waste Index (F WI),
currently under development under the auspices
of UN Environment, is an important step towards
the better measurement and understanding of
food waste. 77

Note that all official reports by governments
cover entire food supply chains up to, but
excluding, the retail and consumption stages,
whereas non-governmental studies are often
restricted to a particular stage or activit y within
the food supply chain. As a result, there are
more non-governmental studies. Note that
non-governmental studies often employ different
methodologies to estimate food loss and
waste, even studies within the same countr y;
they cannot therefore be a substitute for the
comprehensive collection of data carried out by
national governments.

Chapter 6 provides a deeper discussion of
efforts to improve data collection and also
offers recommendations for food loss and waste
measurement. n

CONCLUSIONS
A first estimate of overall food loss by FAO
throughout this report concludes that globally
13.8 percent of all food is lost from post-har vest
up to, but excluding, retail. While this estimate
helps to draw attention to the problem and incite
action, effective inter ventions to reduce food
loss and waste must be based on more detailed
information regarding where it occurs in the
food supply chain; for which foods and in which
regions or countries it occurs; and the extent of
the problem and underlying reasons.

Estimating how much food consumers waste is
particularly challenging, for two reasons. First, in
sur veys and studies based on self-reporting,
consumers often underestimate the amount of
food they actually waste. 5, 73 A combination of
a sur vey with a sample analysis produces the
most reliable results, but is much more costly. 74, 75
Second, municipal waste measured in many
countries includes both food and non-food
waste. Estimating how much of that total is food

FAO’s meta-analysis of existing studies of food
loss and waste presented in this chapter provides
further insight into these aspects. However, the

Key messages

1

The business case for food loss and
waste reduction is based on the
assumption that food suppliers can
increase their profits by reducing food
losses and that consumers save money by
wasting less.

2

The limited evidence to date suggests
that the business case can potentially
increase profits and lead to certain
reductions in food loss or waste; however,
focusing on the business case alone is
unlikely to address the full scale of the
problem.

3

Even in those cases where
interventions to reduce food loss and
waste are not profitable, reduction efforts
may result in productivity gains that
represent an economic benefit to society
at large. Such economic cases may justify
public-sector intervention.

4

Policymakers should weigh the
potential benefits of food loss and
waste reduction efforts not only against
their costs, but also considering the
distributional implications for incomes and
the well-being of the different actors in the
food supply chain.

CHAPTER 3

LOSS AND WASTE –
THE BUSINESS
CASE AND BEYOND

5

Public interventions may take the form
of awareness raising campaigns
aimed at convincing individuals of the
benefits they receive from food loss or
waste reduction.

6

Other interventions may aim to
improve the incentives offered to
suppliers and consumers to reduce food
loss or waste, through investments, taxes,
subsidies or regulation.

CHAPTER 3

REDUCING FOOD LOSS
AND WASTE – THE BUSINESS
CASE AND BEYOND
This chapter examines to what extent the
private sector can be relied on to reduce food
loss or waste, and the scope for public-sector
inter vention. Where the benefits of food loss
and waste reductions accrue to stakeholders
other than those implementing the reduction
measures, public inter vention may be justified.
The chapter looks at the net benefits of food
loss and waste reduction for private actors
(the business case) and then discusses the
broad economic benefits of these reductions
for societ y as a whole (the economic case).
The economic case looks beyond the business
case for food loss and waste reduction, to
possible gains for societ y at large that private
actors do not take into account. If these
societ y-wide gains exceed the costs of efforts
towards loss and waste reduction, public
inter vention may be justified. n

For the indirect effects, changes in prices
along the supply chain will depend on where
inter ventions are occurring, and will affect
private stakeholders differently depending
on whether the stakeholders are upstream or
downstream in the supply chain relative to
where the price change occurs. Actors operating
at earlier stages in the food supply chain will
see it as a change in the price of their food
product, while stakeholders at later stages in
the food supply will see it as a change in their
input costs. This indicates that there may be
winners and losers among private stakeholders.
For example, if food waste at the retail level is
reduced, wholesale suppliers may see a decrease
in demand that negatively affects their returns,
but at the same time the reduction in retail
waste may make food cheaper for consumers,
which increases their well-being.

THE PRIVATE AND
SOCIETAL BENEFITS AND
COSTS FROM REDUCING
FOOD LOSS AND WASTE

To examine whether societ y-wide gains exceed
the costs of efforts towards loss and waste
reduction, Figure 10 aggregates the net benefits
for private stakeholders – both direct and
indirect – and then factors in the impacts on
the environment and on food securit y and
nutrition as additional benefits. These three
sets of benefits, assuming they are ultimately
positive, then need to be weighed against the
costs incurred by societ y as a whole to attain the
reductions in food loss and waste. These costs
will be those incurred by the public sector for
enabling the reductions (private benefits and
costs are already considered in the “increase
overall income” box in Figure 10).

Figure 10 lays out the potential benefits and
costs of food loss and waste reduction, and
disting uishes between those costs and benefits
that accrue to private stakeholders (blue boxes)
and broader costs and benefits to societ y (red
boxes). The fig ure also disting uishes between
the benefits and costs of private stakeholders
directly involved in reducing food loss and
waste versus those of private stakeholders
who are affected indirectly through changes in
prices associated with reductions in food loss
and waste. For private stakeholders involved
in inter ventions, costs and benefits are those
associated directly with the inter vention.

In this chapter, the economic benefits considered
for the economic case are limited to those linked
to monetar y transactions. Thus, the economic
benefits of food loss and waste reduction
are seen in terms of the resulting increase in
productivit y, which boosts the well-being of

societ y as a whole. This narrow definition of
economic benefits excludes any positive impact
of food loss and waste reduction on food securit y
and nutrition. It also disregards how reduction
efforts may mitigate the negative impact of food
loss and waste on the environment, in terms of
GHG emissions and pressure on land and water
resources. Indeed, the impact of food loss and
waste reduction on food securit y and nutrition

and environmental sustainabilit y is much
harder to express in monetar y terms. These two
important dimensions are therefore discussed
separately in Chapters 4 and 5.
To sum up, this chapter, in combination with
Chapters 4 and 5, makes an incremental
arg ument for reducing food loss and waste.
It starts by looking at the business case for food

loss and waste reduction (just direct effects,
first column in Figure 10) as justification for
reducing food loss and waste. It then moves
on to the economic case as a justification to
inter vene on food loss and waste, accounting
for direct and indirect net economic benefits
on private stakeholders (represented by the
“increase overall income” box in Figure 10, which
combines the first two columns in the fig ure)
to be balanced with whatever public costs are
incurred to attain the reductions (bottom half of
third column in Figure 10). The economic case, as
covered here, does not take into consideration
the environmental and food securit y and
nutrition benefits of decreasing food loss and
waste. This is done in the following chapters,
which examine the additional benefits of
reduction of food loss and waste in terms of
food securit y and nutrition (Chapter 4) and the
environment (Chapter 5). n

of inputs while costs related to disposing of
lost or wasted food decrease.1, 2 Suppliers who
work to reduce food loss and waste may
improve their reputation for environmental
stewardship and strengthen customer
relations.1
 Consumers who reduce their food waste save
money to spend elsewhere; they may also
benefit from lower food prices if food loss
reductions by suppliers make food cheaper at
wholesale and retail levels. But this depends
on how the price effects of food loss reductions
ripple through the chain, which in turn is
determined by where the reductions occur and
how large they are. l Consumers may fulfill a
moral, rather than financial, objective by
reducing their food waste and thus limiting its
negative environmental and social effects.
However, efforts to reduce food loss and waste
involve costs, which rational individuals will
only be willing to bear as long as the benefits
that accrue to them outweigh such costs.
By this view, a certain level of food loss or
waste is unavoidable, depending inter alia
on the technolog y available to suppliers
and consumers, as well as the perishabilit y,
distribution systems and consumption patterns
for food products.

THE BUSINESS CASE
FOR REDUCING FOOD
LOSS AND WASTE –
OPPORTUNITIES,
COSTS AND BARRIERS

For example, if the opportunit y cost of time
for consumers is high, efforts to plan food
purchases and meal preparation better and to
manage food stocks (an effective strateg y to
reduce food waste) may be too time-consuming
– in other words, costly – to make them
worthwhile. 3

Food loss and waste reduction can benefit
the private sector but there are barriers
to adoption
As arg ued in Chapter 1, in theor y, participants
in the food supply chain make rational decisions
that allow them to maximize their profits
(suppliers) or well-being (consumers) – including
decisions on the level of food loss or waste they
find acceptable. Food loss and waste reductions
can have a positive impact upon suppliers’ and
consumers’ well-being.

Likewise, food suppliers may view the
beneficial impact of reducing food losses by
investing in technolog y or improved practices
as too small in relation to the investment
costs. For example, farmers might reduce
on-farm losses of crops to pests or any natural
hazard by improving storage and handling
(e.g. by using hermetic grain storage bags),
but if the costs exceed the value of the food
that can be saved, they are unlikely to take

 Food suppliers, for example farmers,
processors, transporters, retailers and food
ser vice providers, can increase their
productivit y by reducing food loss and waste.
Indeed, if less food is lost or wasted, suppliers
have more food to sell using the same amount

smaller packages may result in a rise in their food spending, as smaller

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2019

such actions. The limited adoption of food
loss reduction measures by maize producers
in the United Republic of Tanzania (see Box 13)
is a case in point. The same applies to efforts
by food processors (e.g. optimizing the
manufacturing process), retailers or food
ser vice providers (e.g. improving inventor y
management, adjusting packaging and labelling
to discourage consumers wasting food, or
redistributing excess food), as well as efforts
that concern all operators in the chain, such
as systems to track food losses. It follows that
food supply chain operators devote more time
and money to reducing losses and waste of food
products with a high price value. Products that
fetch lower prices may not warrant costly
prevention measures, and operators may decide
to compensate for such losses or waste by
producing or buying in more. m

including, for example, the financial and
physical resources available to them at private
and public levels. Thus, even if they are aware
of the problem of food loss or waste and the
actions that could help mitigate the problem,
various t y pes of constraints may discourage
them from taking such actions. For example,
individuals in developing countries, especially
smallholders, often cannot afford the high
upfront costs associated with food loss and
waste reduction efforts without financial
help. Yet, credit providers already consider
agriculture as a high-risk sector and payback
periods are often challenging for farmers with
immediate cash needs. 6 Thus, access to credit
becomes a barrier to adopting food loss and
waste reduction measures.
A 2011 study by the World Bank shows that
in sub-Saharan Africa there is a variet y
of practices and technologies to reduce
post-har vest losses of food. However, they are
rarely adopted and efforts towards change have
failed for a number of reasons. Some
technolog y packages transferred from Asia
proved financially unsustainable in the context
of Africa. Some inter ventions did not identif y
the key constraints, or assumed wrongly
there were economic incentives for reducing
losses. Some technologies were not culturally
acceptable (e.g. metal silos were a success in
Central America but not so in Africa, inter alia
due to a preference for storing foods inside the
home to prevent theft). Other inter ventions
to facilitate change were hampered by
unrealistic timeframes. 7

However, a number of factors may prevent
stakeholders from taking fully rational
decisions as to the optimal level of food loss
or waste, and thus optimizing their profits or
well-being. First, food operators and consumers
may not have full information on how much
food they lose or waste, on how it affects them,
on all the factors that combine to inf luence food
loss and waste, or on the benefits and costs of
reducing food loss and waste. These aspects
are crucial to rational decision-making but
they are also complex, and operators and
consumers may not fully understand them.
Second, suppliers and consumers may be
ver y uncertain about the benefits of efforts to
reduce food loss or waste, deterring risk-averse
stakeholders from reducing food loss or waste.
This uncertaint y was cited as one of the reasons
for the limited adoption of such measures by
maize producers in the United Republic of
Tanzania (see Box 13). 5

Even so, successful cases do exist. Examples
of such in Asia and Africa often relate to
adopting improved technolog y (such as
small-scale dr yers, threshers and storage bags)
for post-har vest rice handling and storage.
Successful examples are linked to strong
government support, e.g. through financial
incentives to early adopters or creating an
enabling environment for infant industries.
Box 14 provides an example of an alternative
storage method that led to a reduction in
post-har vest losses. 7 The size of operations
matters: larger operations can shoulder costlier
investments. For example, a study in Uganda
found that plastic silos are financially viable
»

The financial cost–benefit analysis of efforts
to reduce food loss and waste by individual
economic players is determined by the private
and social context in which they operate,
m Note that the price value of a food product differs not only from
one type of food to the next, but also between the various stages in
the supply chain, for the same product. The value of a tomato, for
example, is higher at the retail level than at the farm level. By the time
the tomato reaches the supermarket, more resources have been used
to get it there (transport, fuel, energy for storage, the costs of running
the retail outlet, etc.).4

A FINANCIAL COST–BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF POST-HARVEST LOSS REDUCTION FOR MAIZE IN
THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
A 2018 survey of 420 households producing maize
in a rural district in the United Republic of Tanzania
examined to what extent improved post-harvest
handling can reduce food losses.
The survey found that, on average, post-harvest
losses account for 11.7 percent of households’ annual
maize harvests, representing a value of USD 58.9
(1.2 times the median monthly household income).
On average, 2.9 percent of the harvest was lost during
pre-storage stages, 7.8 percent during storage and
1 percent during marketing.

The study confirms that improved post-harvest
handling can significantly reduce losses. A financial
cost–benefit analysis of various post-harvest practices
(see the figure below) shows that not all practices
aimed at reducing losses are beneficial. While the
benefits of timely harvesting, sorting maize and
disinfecting storage facilities outweigh the costs, other
practices such as proper intermediate handling,
protecting stored maize and letting the maize dry for
an extra day are not financially worthwhile.

PROMOTING MUD SILOS TO REDUCE MAIZE LOSSES DURING STORAGE – EVIDENCE FROM
NORTHERN GHANA

Mud silos seal well and are therefore a better option
to store food grains than other, more open types of
storage. In 2000, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture
of Ghana, in collaboration with partners, implemented
a wide-ranging programme to promote the use of
mud silos for maize storage in the Northern Region of
Ghana – the aim was to encourage smallholders to use
these silos over other more traditional types of storage.
Under the programme, funded by the United States
Agency for International Development, artisans from
communities that use mud silos demonstrated their
construction in selected villages in six districts of
northern Ghana. The demonstrations were facilitated
by the fact that communities who traditionally use mud
silos live close to those who do not.

More than 1 000 farmers in the Gushegu and
Karaga Districts in the Northern Region of Ghana started
using sealed mud silos as a result of the programme, and
a survey of 60 farming families evaluated its success. All
60 families owned both mud silos and other types of
storage facilities and most of those surveyed were using
the mud silos at the time. As a result, maize storage losses
dropped from an average 300 kg per family per year to
about 50 kg. Of all maize damaged by insects while in
storage, an average 6.5 percent occurred inside the mud
silos. The remaining 93.5 percent of losses occurred in
other facilities.
With the costs of construction in Ghana estimated
at less than USD 109 and less labour needed to
maintain them than other types of storage, mud silos
were shown to offer a low-cost solution to store and
protect grain.

A 2017 study by the World Resources
Institute ( W RI) and the Waste and Resources
Action Programme ( W R AP) found there
can be a strong financial business case for
companies to pursue efforts to reduce food
loss and waste (Box 15). Note that the study
only looked at the financial impact on the
operator implementing the measures and
not the effects of the measures on other
actors in the food supply chain, whether
upstream, such as farmers, or downstream.
Farmers’ products may fetch lower prices,
for example, if buyers need fewer inputs as
a result of food loss reduction. Farmers may
also be forced to discard more products if
their clients impose stricter qualit y standards
to reduce food losses. Such redistributive
effects are further discussed in this chapter.

smaller farms, such as hermetic bags, were

Quantifying the financial gains of food loss
and waste reduction for suppliers and
consumers
A study of households producing maize in
the United Republic of Tanzania confirms
that improved post-har vest handling can
significantly reduce losses (see Box 13);
however, not all practices aimed at reducing
losses are financially beneficial. The study
shows that identif ying the best entr y points
for post-har vest inter ventions and assessing
their financial feasibilit y for smallholders is
crucial to success.

THE BUSINESS CASE FOR REDUCING FOOD LOSS AND WASTE – A SURVEY BY CHAMPIONS 12.3
Food operators have an incentive to implement
measures to reduce food loss and waste if the
financial benefits of doing so outweigh the costs. A
recent report by the WRI and WRAP on behalf of
Champions 12.3, a coalition of international
leaders dedicated to accelerating progress towards
achieving SDG Target 12.3, studies the financial
case for food loss and waste reduction, analysing
nearly 1 200 business sites in 17 developed and
developing countries. It was found that more than
99 percent of the sites earned a positive return on
investment in food loss reduction; the median site
realized a 14-fold financial return on its investment
(sites closer to the consumption stage of the food
supply chain tended to have higher median ratios
than those closer to the production stage). Such a

high return indicates there can be a strong financial
business case for companies to reduce food loss
and waste.
The report cites the example of a food
manufacturer in Pakistan who pursued a number of
actions to reduce food losses, including improved
cooling and storage, strengthening dairy farmer
training and best practice sharing and implementing
lean management processes. These efforts resulted in
a 25 percent return on investment for the company.
Another example is that of a food services provider
in western Europe whose waste reduction efforts –
such as using more semi-prepared food, improving
meal demand forecasting, training staff and
engaging consumers – had a benefit–cost ratio of
nearly 25:1.

However, the financial incentives (the business

THE BUSINESS CASE FOR REDUCING FOOD LOSS AND WASTE – A STUDY BY REFED

ReFED analysed 27 possible solutions to food loss and
waste in the United States of America, grouped into
three categories: prevention, recovery (redistribution)
and recycling. It estimates that businesses can
potentially increase their profits by USD 1.9 billion
annually by implementing nine prevention and two
recycling solutions. Of this total, USD 1.6 billion would
accrue to food service providers, including restaurants.
Most of the total profit opportunity comes from waste
tracking and analytics, reflecting the operational

inefficiencies that exist today in food purchasing and
preparation. One of the reasons why restaurants fail to
adopt the solutions identified in the report is the gap
in employee training caused by high turnover rates
and competing priorities such as food safety and food
quality. Other promising strategies include smaller
plates in food service outlets, using imperfect produce
in food preparation and marketing imperfect produce
as a new product line.

CHAPTER 3 REDUCING FOOD LOSS AND WASTE – THE BUSINESS CASE AND BEYOND

» The economic case for food loss and waste

was four years before the ban was amended to
include food waste – therefore the results may
be overestimated.

reduction looks beyond the business case to
include gains for societ y at large, which private
stakeholders may not necessarily take into
account. This broader case is built on three
ways in which reductions can boost societal
well-being. First, food loss and waste reduction
may improve productivit y and thus contribute
to economic growth. Such economic growth
benefits not only private actors, but also societ y
as a whole. Second, food loss and waste reduction
may improve the food securit y or nutrition status
of the most food insecure. Third, it may help
mitigate the negative environmental impacts of
food loss and waste in terms of GHG emissions
and pressure on land and water resources.
This chapter focuses on the first pillar of the
economic case and examines how food loss
and waste reductions can generate positive
economic outcomes for societ y. The other two
main arg uments for reduction – improvements in
food securit y and nutrition and environmental
sustainabilit y – are the focus of Chapters 4 and 5.

Quantifying the economic gains of food loss
and waste reduction for society at large
Attempts to quantif y the costs of food loss and
waste (such as the W R AP study) have so far
been mainly based on calculation of the amount
of food lost or wasted in food prices (wholesale
or retail). This can mistakenly deliver the
message that reduced food loss and waste will
automatically translate into gains for societ y
of the same amount.12–14 Although estimates in
price terms do provide useful indications as to
the scale of the food loss and waste problem,
they fail to take due account of the way in which
price signals are transmitted throughout the food
supply chain or the wider national and global
economy, as well as of the distributional effects
thereof. Furthermore, a significant strand of
literature examines the impact of inter ventions
in food loss and waste reduction without
considering their costs. n Economic cost–benefit
analyses should take these costs into account.15 –17
In general, estimating the costs of efforts towards
food loss and waste reduction, which involve
specific, identifiable investments, seems easier
than estimating their benefits. 2

An additional arg ument for the broader economic
case for food loss and waste reduction is the
fact that reduction efforts, such as the adoption
of improved food redistribution practices, can
contribute to indirect job creation. In 2014,
Massachusetts, in the United States of America,
modified its existing waste ban reg ulation,
the Commercial Food Waste Disposal Ban, to
add food to the list of materials banned from
disposal. Under the modified reg ulation, food
companies and institutions are not allowed to
dispose of more than 1 ton of commercial organic
material per week. Any waste over that limit
must be diverted, for example by donating it to
charit y or sending it to be turned into animal
feed, composted or anaerobically digested.
Probably as a result of the new reg ulation,
both food rescue organizations and the organic
waste industr y experienced significant growth
between 2010 and 2016, with a considerable
increase in the number of jobs. The amount of
food received annually by the average food rescue
organization increased from 37 tons in 2010
to 193 tons in 2015. The growth of food rescue
organizations has generated over USD 460 000
in annual state and local tax revenues.11 One
limitation of the ban’s economic impact analysis
worth mentioning is that the baseline year (2010)

The analysis of the economic gains of food loss
and waste reduction should take due account of
the fact that those who bear the costs of such
efforts are not necessarily the ones who enjoy
the benefits. Whether suppliers and consumers
voluntarily implement measures towards lower
food loss and waste, or whether such measures
are imposed through legislation, can provide
an indication of who wins or loses from food
loss and waste reduction. 2 The rationale is that
stakeholders will voluntarily reduce food loss
and waste if the benefits of doing so outweigh
the costs. In the absence of a business case,
implementation may be mandator y through
reg ulation. For example, legislation that obliges
retailers to modif y product labels with a view
to reducing food waste (by better use of terms
such as “best before” or “use by”) may benefit
n

WASTE REDUCTION

consumers by helping them avoid food waste.
However, retailers bear the costs of altering
labels. On the other hand, where measures to
reduce food loss or waste are voluntar y, they
are likely to bring net gains to food operators.
Thus, to reduce waste a retailer may decide to
sell imperfect produce as a new product line
(often marketed as “ugly” fruits and vegetables)
if the benefits, including the revenue from selling
previously unsellable products and acquiring a
higher reputational standing, outweigh the costs
of transporting and distributing the additional
products. Also, suppliers may prevent produce
loss and improve consumer access to safe and
affordable food through efficient trade. This may
also offer opportunities for food providers to sell
products that are not commonly consumed where
they are produced.18

Actions to reduce food loss or waste can depend
on different actors, according to the t y pe of food
loss or waste targeted. Those who bear the costs
of food loss or waste reduction are not necessarily
the ones who enjoy its benefits. Indeed, the
impact of efforts to reduce food loss and waste
on farmers, processors, distributors, retailers and
consumers depends on how the effect on prices
is transmitted throughout the food supply chain.
Some may well benefit while others may lose.
As explained in the beginning of the chapter,
food suppliers who increase their productivit y by
reducing food losses may see their profits grow.
Losing less food means producing more, using
the same amount of resources, while costs related
to disposal decrease. However, the increased
food supply may cause prices to fall, which would
nullif y the positive effect of increased sales.
The net effect on overall profits depends inter alia
on the f lexibilit y of prices, the price elasticit y of
supply and demand, and on how price effects are
transmitted from one stage of the food supply
chain to the next.

An exhaustive study by ReFED for the United
States of America finds that solutions with
considerable economic value and those which
are profitable for businesses can reduce losses
and waste by approximately 2 million tons.
This amount represents 4 percent of the total
amount of food sent to landfill or incinerators
prior to implementation of reduction efforts,
as estimated by ReFED. However, the wider
economic cost–benefit analysis of reduction
efforts by ReFED suggests that up to 20 percent of
food losses and waste can be avoided (see Box 17).

Consumers who reduce their food waste
save money to spend elsewhere. If food loss
reductions by suppliers make food cheaper
for consumers, the latter may benefit from an
increase in their effective income (their income
after food spending), or from the fact they can
now purchase more food for the same amount
of money. However, increased productivit y
resulting from food loss reduction may reduce
the demand for labour and depress wages, which
would work against the positive effect of a fall in
food prices on household income. The combined
net effect of lower food prices versus lower
wages on a household’s income depends inter
alia on the share of labour in overall production
costs, wage f lexibilit y, the sector in which
household members are employed, the share of
food spending in overall household expenditure
and the price elasticit y of supply and demand.
Note that as food becomes cheaper, the incentives
for consumers to avoid food waste may weaken. »

The results of the ReFED study cannot be
generalized across countries, and the analysis
may fail to consider certain solutions.
Nevertheless, the findings of the study suggest
that efforts implemented by private stakeholders
based on pure business considerations alone are
unlikely to resolve the food loss and waste
problem. Even while acknowledg  wider
economic benefits (without taking into account
the effects of loss reduction on job creation, food
securit y or the env ironment, see Box 18), major
reductions seem unlikely. Thus, the public sector
has an important role to play in achiev 
SDG Target 12.3, through investments, taxes,
subsidies or reg ulations. n

QUANTIFYING THE ECONOMIC GAINS OF FOOD LOSS AND WASTE REDUCTION – THE REFED STUDY
A recent study by ReFED (see also Box 16) analysed
not only the financial value to businesses, but also
the economic value to society, of 27 measures aimed
at reducing food loss and waste, whereby economic
value was defined as the aggregate financial benefit
to society (consumers, businesses, governments and
other stakeholders) minus all investments and costs
over ten years.
Note that the definition of economic value as used
by ReFED includes financial benefits enjoyed by all
actors in society and excludes the non-financial impacts
of food loss and waste reduction on society. Specifically,
the non-financial benefits not considered in the study
are those related to food security (meals recovered),
job creation, and environmental gains (GHG reductions
and water conservation).

The figure below displays the marginal abatement
cost curve per ton of reducing food waste in USD. The
width of each bar represents the annual diversion
potential for each solution, measured in tons of
waste reduced.
The study finds that the 27 selected solutions have
the potential to generate USD 100 billion over ten
years, considerably higher than the approximately
USD 19 billion in business profits over the same period
(see Box 16). Prevention solutions account for over
75 percent of this total; 23 percent is generated by
recovery and 2 percent by recycling. Prevention and
recovery solutions generally result in greater economic
value per ton, while recycling solutions have the
potential to divert a significantly larger volume of lost
or wasted food.

(CONTINUED)
The solutions that generate the greatest economic
value per ton are standardized date labelling,
consumer education campaigns and packaging
adjustments, all of which are measures aimed at
prevention, rather than diversion. Meanwhile,
centralized composting and anaerobic digestion have
the largest diversion potential in volume (these three
measures can collectively reduce 9.5 million tons of
waste annually, nearly three-quarters of the total
potential), but their economic value per ton is low.
The generally higher net economic value generated by
prevention solutions reflects the fact that these solutions
typically require relatively low investments, while most
centralized recycling solutions require heavy investment
in transportation and processing infrastructure.

Furthermore, the benefits reflect the value of food and
food waste. Thus, the economic value of prevention
solutions, which captures the value of edible food, with
an average retail value of USD 5 000 per ton, is
higher than that of recycling solutions, which capture
the value of food scraps whose average value is less
than USD 100 per ton.
The ReFED study finds that the solutions that
potentially generate the highest economic value for
society are not necessarily those that bring most
financial benefits to businesses. Likewise the solutions
that appeal most to businesses – waste tracking and
analytics, smaller plates in food service outlets and
using and marketing imperfect produce (see Box 16) –
do not create most value for society.

» In developing countries, a sizeable amount

generally focus on encouraging consumers to
buy and thus waste less food. 23, 24 If the fall
in consumer spending on food implies that
suppliers now sell less, or that their products
fetch lower prices, the gains to societ y that
accrue to consumers may be cancelled out by the
decline in suppliers’ profits. Also, consumers
may decide to spend the money they saved
in wasting less of product a by buying more
of product b, or by buying a higher qualit y of
product a (trading up), in which case there is
a trade-off between the gains for suppliers of
product b or of the higher-qualit y version of
product a on the one hand and the losses for the
suppliers of product a on the other. 25, 26 Indeed,
a study by W R AP found that while growing
consumer awareness of food waste leads to a
reduction in sales volume, sales revenue remains
stable, suggesting that consumers trade up to
higher-priced foods. 22

of food is lost on the supply side of the food
supply chain. A 2013 case study for Northern
Africa and the Near East shows that efforts
to reduce the amount of food lost by primar y
producers lowered unit production costs and
increased food supply. Increased efficiency in
production led to a fall in domestic prices which
allowed households to buy more food for the
same amount of money, resulting in higher food
consumption levels and a lower dependence, and
thus reduced v ulnerabilit y, to changes in world
food markets. However, increased efficiency
in primar y production meant that less labour
was needed to produce the same output, which
caused a fall in employment and nominal wages.
Overall, the combined net effect of these impacts
was improved household food securit y and a
decrease in rural povert y, as the positive effect
of falling food prices on household purchasing
power more than offset the negative impact of
lower nominal wages.15

In conclusion, policymakers should not only
weigh the potential benefits of efforts aimed at
food loss and waste reduction against their costs
in terms of both public and private funds, but
also consider the distributional implications of
such efforts on the profits and well-being of the
various actors in the food supply chain. n

In developed countries, evidence indicates that
food is lost or wasted mostly at the retail and
consumption stages of the food supply chain
and food waste reduction is high on the policy
agenda. Efforts to reduce food loss and waste

REDUCTION

decisions are potentially significant, most notably
in terms of food securit y and environmental
sustainabilit y – they thus provide a strong
justification for public inter vention, dealt with
separately in Chapters 4 and 5.
Where there is a discrepancy between individual
incentives and societal well-being, public
inter ventions are needed to convince individual
actors of the benefits that food loss or waste
reduction can bring them (known as “nudging”),
or to modif y those incentives.

The rationale for public intervention
The rationale for government inter ventions aimed
at inf luencing decisions made by individual
suppliers and consumers on food loss and waste
is twofold.

A further dimension that may warrant public
inter vention is that of gender imbalance, which
can affect food loss and waste. If women face
constraints in accessing and controlling the
resources they need due to gender discrimination,
there may be few incentives and/or possibilities
for them to reduce food loss and waste. This can
negatively affect efficiency throughout the food
supply chain. Indeed, despite their important
role in food supply chains, rural women often
face specific constraints in accessing essential
productive resources, ser vices and information,
and in participating in the decisions that may lead
to food loss and waste reduction. 23 For example,
rural women are often less involved than men
in cooperatives and farmer organizations.
As a result, these women have limited access to
processing facilities, improved technologies and
markets, which leads to greater food losses.

First, the previous section arg ued that the
financial incentives for private stakeholders to
reduce their food losses or waste may be weak.
Even where the business case for food loss or
waste reduction is clear, individual stakeholders
may be unable to implement the necessar y
actions because of financial constraints.
Unless the public sector steps in and modifies the
incentives for individual suppliers and consumers
or helps them overcome these constraints, the
potential for food loss and waste reduction to
increase productivit y or create jobs is lost and
societ y as a whole loses out. o The ReFED study
provides an example of how addressing the full
scale of food loss and waste by relying exclusively
on the business case is unlikely to be successful
in the United States of America.10
Second, the decisions of individual suppliers
or consumers as to food loss and waste have
negative implications on wider societ y that
these individual actors do not take into account
(known as negative externalities, see also
Chapter 1). Indeed, even if losing or wasting a
certain amount of food makes sense to individual
suppliers or consumers in terms of maximizing
their profits or well-being, they may ignore the
fact that their decisions negatively affect the
well-being of societ y at large. In other words,
what is optimal from the perspective of an
individual may be at odds with the best interests
of societ y as a whole. These negative externalities
of individual actors’ food loss and waste

Public interventions in food loss and waste
reduction can also be framed within a wider
development agenda. For example, in developing
countries with a high level of food insecurity or
undernourishment, food loss and waste reduction
is likely to be seen as a means towards improving
food security and nutrition. If food loss and
waste is then caused by a lack of infrastructure
(e.g. poor-quality roads) or public services
(e.g. an erratic electricity supply), government
interventions to reduce food loss and waste
by improving infrastructure or services can be
embedded in a broader development strateg y.
Such a strateg y will contribute to an enabling
environment that encourages private stakeholders
to invest in food loss and waste reduction. 7 Market
failures that result in food loss and waste may also
warrant public intervention. For example, poorly
functioning credit markets may mean that farmers

o Given the high upfront costs involved in the research, development
and implementation of new technologies aimed at reducing food losses
or waste, government support is crucial, especially in the early stages.

THE “LOVE FOOD, HATE WASTE” CAMPAIGN

In 2007, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland launched a nationwide initiative to
reduce household food waste – within five years, it
had achieved a 21 percent reduction. The basis of
the initiative was the “Love Food, Hate Waste” radio,
TV, print and online media campaign run by WRAP.
The campaign raised awareness among consumers
about how much food they waste, how it affects their
household budget and what they can do about it.
This initiative collaborated with food manufacturers
and retailers to stimulate innovation, such as
resealable packaging, shared meal planning and food
storage tips.
The total implementation costs during the five-year
period were estimated to be GBP 26 million incurred

by United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland Government agencies, local authorities, food
manufacturers and retailers. Households derived
the majority of the benefits, thanks to the savings
achieved by preventing food waste, estimated at
GBP 6.5 billion. Local authorities also realized a
substantial GBP 86 million worth of savings in food
waste disposal costs. As for the private sector,
benefits took the form of increased product shelf
life and reduced product loss. While households
started to consume more efficiently and companies
may have experienced a decline in food sales, the
companies affirmed that the non-financial benefits,
such as strengthened consumer relationships, offset
the costs.1

cannot access funds to adopt loss-reducing
production techniques; the abuse of market power
by a buyer who is the only potential purchaser
may depress the price paid to farmers, who then
have fewer incentives to prevent losses.

Nudging stakeholders towards an existing
business case – opportunities and limitations
Individual suppliers or consumers may not
be fully aware of how much food they lose
or waste, what is causing food to be lost or
wasted, how it affects them, or what the
benefits and costs are of reducing food loss
and waste. While the decisions made by one
actor in the food supply chain may affect the
use of resources further up or down the chain,
individual players are often only partially
aware of the decisions taken by others. As a
result, their decisions are based on limited
information and may well fail to maximize
their profits or well-being. Sur veys show that
processors are often unaware of the magnitude
of their food losses and consumers consistently
underestimate how much food they waste. 24
In such cases, providing information to
actors in the food supply chain may convince
them of the business case for food loss and
waste reduction.

Note that food loss and waste solutions that
are appropriate in developed countries are not
necessarily the best solutions in developing
countries. In developed countries, most food
is believed to be wasted at the retail and
consumption stages of the food supply chain,
while in developing countries, it is mainly
lost in the earlier stages of the chain.19, 20
Thus, the solutions identified in the ReFED
study, for example, rightly focus heavily on
the consumer-facing side of the food supply
chain: retailers and food service providers.10 In
developing countries where post-harvest losses
account for an important share of overall food loss
and waste, efforts to promote improved growing
and post-harvest technologies and practices might
prove more effective in reducing food losses.

Building awareness of food loss and waste
may constitute a worthwhile strateg y for the

PROVIDING INFORMATION AND TRAINING – THE CASE OF TOMATOES AND MILK IN RWANDA

FAO conducted a post-harvest loss analysis along
two tomato supply chains and one milk supply chain
in Rwanda using the methodology described in
Box 12. In the tomato supply chains, critical loss points
included sorting, grading, storage and transportation,
with 30.3 percent of produce lost during these
stages. In the milk supply chain, estimated losses of
36.5 percent mostly occurred at the farm, storage and
transportation points.25
Training in post-harvest handling and use of
appropriate equipment can mitigate critical loss in the
supply chains studied and, consequently, reduce the
negative impact on food security and producers’
incomes. While a subsequent cost–benefit analysis
found all the proposed training methods were
profitable for farmers, there were differences in
profitability between them. In both tomato supply
chains, training farmers in proper handling practices
and using appropriate storage facilities had the
highest benefit–cost ratios (from 4.7:1 to 1.9:1). The

most profitable solution for the milk supply chain
involved training traders in proper milk collection,
storage and transportation (a benefit–cost ratio
of 2.1:1).25
Since these are ex ante estimates of the impacts of
any training, several caveats apply to the analysis.
These include the extent to which the analysis
considered all costs incurred by stakeholders and
whether the estimated loss reductions would actually
materialize. Nonetheless, the Rwandan case highlights
how a cost–benefit analysis of interventions can
provide insights into opportunities for the most effective
food loss and waste reduction strategies across
commodities and stages of the supply chain. This case
study also sheds light on the importance and
challenges of carrying out a rigorous cost–benefit
analysis that separates social costs and benefits
incurred by a project vis-à-vis the private benefits and
costs that determine adoption beyond the scope of
the intervention.

public sector to convince food supply chain
stakeholders to reduce their food loss and
waste. In the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, the “Love Food, Hate
Waste” awareness raising campaign by W R AP,
an NGO specializing in resource sustainabilit y,
led to a 21 percent reduction in the amount
of food wasted by households from 2007 to
2012 (see Box 18). Likewise, awareness raising
campaigns in Denmark (spearheaded by the
Stop Wasting Food movement, a private NGO)
resulted in a food waste decrease of 25 percent
from 2010 to 2015 (see also Chapter 6).

farmers could help them to avoid food losses at a
relatively low cost to the public sector. 25
Nudging actors towards an existing business
case for reducing food loss and waste is an
attractive option because results can be obtained
with limited financial resources by leveraging
private stakeholders’ interests. However, the
broader studies reported in this chapter, such
as ReFED (Boxes 16 and 17) and W R AP (Box 18),
indicate that relying on the existing business
case alone provides only part of the solution.
The accomplishments of the W R AP initiative
in reducing food waste by 21 percent over a
specific time period are substantial, but they do
not address nearly 80 percent of the problem.
Moreover, the ReFED study in the United
States of America finds that inter ventions that
fall under the business case scenario would
address only 4 percent of the total amount of
food currently sent to landfill or incinerators.

A reason why public awareness campaigns to
promote food loss and waste reduction can be
appealing to policymakers is that they generally
entail low costs relative to the financial benefits.
This premise is also supported by a recent FAO
study on the supply chains for tomatoes and milk
in Rwanda (Box 19), which shows that training

The findings of these studies suggest that
efforts by private actors based on business
considerations alone are unlikely to resolve the
food loss and waste problem. It follows that there
may be a need to change the economic and legal
landscape within which private actors make
decisions about food loss and waste.

Changing the landscape for food loss and
waste decisions – investment, incentives
and regulation

A s publ ic awa reness of food loss and waste
g rows, gover nments may issue reg ulat ions
to add ress the problem. A s pa r t of an

adopted under the nat iona l st rateg y include
reducing food waste in schools and obl ig 
food companies to include data on food losses
in thei r socia l and env i ronmenta l repor ts. 29

Governments can work towards food loss
and waste reduction by raising suppliers’
and consumers’ awareness of the benefits
(making the business case) of any reduction.
They can play an important role by modif ying
incentives to reduce food loss and waste
(changing the business case). Or they can also
make a significant contribution by addressing
the indirect drivers of food loss and waste in
ways that go beyond the business case. This is
particularly important given how the upfront
costs of investing in food loss and waste
reduction can be significant and may discourage
engagement by some smallholder businesses.

Donors have played a key role in promot 
food loss and waste reduct ion in low-income
count r ies. In sub-Saha ran A f r ica, for example,
inst it ut ions such as the Bi l l & Mel inda Gates

Alternative means of inf luencing decisions on
food loss and waste reduction could include
improving public ser vices and infrastructure (for
example, through public–private partnerships);
issuing reg ulations that affect the decisions
of individual actors regarding food loss and
waste; or providing financial incentives for
reduction through taxes, subsidies or exemptions.
For example, the Government of the United
States of America amended the Tax Reform Act
in 2015 to give enhanced food donation tax
deductions and permanently expanded it to all
businesses, creating a stronger business case for
food recover y.10, 26

PUBLIC–PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR FOOD LOSS AND WASTE REDUCTION IN APEC COUNTRIES

A survey undertaken by the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) countries of public–private
partnerships for food loss and waste reduction in
the framework of a multi-year project (Strengthening
Public–Private Partnership to Reduce Food Losses in
the Supply Chain) found that most APEC countries
have created several types of public–private
partnerships. Two-thirds of all APEC governments
provided public financial support in the form of
loans, insurance or grants to businesses or non-profit
organizations to implement measures aimed at
reducing food loss or waste, making it the most
widely used type of partnership. Other types of
public–private partnerships include joint ventures
involving both public and private equity; consultative
partnerships relating to policy development and
planning; contractual partnerships involving public
procurement of financial and expertise services from
private entities; and multifunctional partnerships,
combining two or more of the above.

The figure in this box shows that most public–private
partnerships focused on food waste recycling, in both
developed and developing economies. Food donation
ranked second, with two-thirds of interventions taking
place in developed economies. Third was agricultural
facility management, implemented predominantly in
developing economies. The smallest number of
public–private partnerships focused on improvements in
cold chain systems.
APEC members identified knowledge sharing and
improved policy and project performance as the most
important advantages of public–private partnerships.
All countries agreed that public–private partnerships
enable resource saving and foster connections between
stakeholders. Several countries stressed that linking
multiple stakeholders improved the quality of data.
APEC’s developing member economies strongly
recommended that future public–private partnerships
focus on agricultural facility management and cold
chain systems.

private stakeholders (for example, improving
road infrastructure or adjusting failures in credit
markets) may have impacts that go beyond the
mere reduction of food losses or waste and
contribute to overall economic development.
Meanwhile, policies that do not aim directly
at reducing food loss and waste, but rather at
broader development objectives, may have the
corollar y effect of improving the business case
for reduction for private actors in the food supply
chain. These issues are discussed in the last

Looking beyond the business case for food loss
and waste reduction, there are gains to be had
from reducing food loss and waste for societ y at
large that private stakeholders do not necessarily
take into account. This broader economic case
provides a justification for public inter ventions
on food loss and waste reduction and is built on
three pillars for boosting societal well-being:
improving productivit y or job creation in
the food supply chain as a whole; improving
the food securit y or nutrition status of the
most v ulnerable; and mitigating the negative
environmental impacts of food loss and waste in
terms of GHG emissions and pressure on land
and water resources.

quantification and comparison of these effects
may prove difficult in practice. For this reason,

Reductions in food losses or waste may
improve the food security and nutrition
status of food-insecure groups, depending
on where these groups are located and
where the reductions are made. But
positive food security impacts are not
guaranteed, and in certain cases impacts
may be negative for some groups, such
as farmers.

A certain level of food loss and waste
is needed as a buffer to ensure steady
availability and access to food, especially
as diets shift towards nutrient-rich, highly
perishable foods.

The largest improvements in food
security are likely to occur by reducing
food losses in the early stages of the

FOOD LOSS AND WASTE AND
THE IMPLICATIONS FOR FOOD
SECURITY AND NUTRITION
FOOD LOSS AND WASTE
AND ITS LINKS TO FOOD
SECURITY AND
NUTRITION

Ending hunger and malnutrition is enshrined
in Targets 2.1 and 2.2 of SDG 2, to “end hunger,
achieve food securit y and improved nutrition and
promote sustainable agriculture”. However, world
hunger has been on the rise in recent years.1–3
It is often assumed that cutting food losses
and waste will automatically help reduce
world hunger and improve food securit y. 4–7
It is also expected to improve the safet y and
nutritional qualit y of foods, especially in
countries where many suffer from hunger and
malnourishment. 4, 8, 2

It is generally recognized that reductions
in food losses or waste may improve food
securit y and nutrition through the dimensions
of food securit y: the availabilit y of food, the
economic and physical accessibilit y of food, food
utilization, and the stabilit y of food supplies
and prices over time (see Box 21 for definitions of
these concepts). 9 Some of these dimensions may
overlap – for example, food cannot be accessed if
it is not first available.

However, the channels through which reductions
in food losses or waste affect food securit y and
nutrition are complex and context-dependent
and need to be analysed carefully. The impact
depends on how and where food losses or waste
are reduced and the location of nutritionally
v ulnerable populations. It is not a given that food
loss or waste reduction will improve food securit y
and nutrition; in certain cases, its impact may
even be negative. Moreover, a certain level of
food loss and waste is needed as a buffer against
price shocks and weather variabilit y, to ensure
that all people have access to adequate food at
all times.

The relationship bet ween food loss and waste
and food securit y and nutrition is more complex
than often assumed. Figure 11 illustrates the
potential interactions bet ween decreases or
increases in food loss and waste levels and
these four dimensions, which may theoretically
improve or worsen. The left side of the fig ure
represents a food loss and waste reduction
scenario (scenario A), while the right side
depicts a situation in which losses or waste
increase (scenario B). The arrows in the extreme
right and left side of the fig ure separate the
theoretically potential positive from the
theoretically potential negative effects of a
reduction (or increase) of food loss and waste
on each of the dimensions of food securit y.
Some of these interactions may be direct
effects of the food loss and waste reduction
(or increase), while others may be secondar y
effects, and the net effect becomes an empirical
question – probably one that can only be tackled
in an economy-w ide framework where both
supply and demand responses to price changes
are properly represented, whereby net effects

This chapter first discusses the relationship
between food loss and waste and the different
dimensions of food securit y. It goes on to
examine to what extent loss or waste reductions
can bring about improvements in food securit y
and nutrition, based on context-specific
cost–benefit analyses of various reduction
measures. Finally it discusses the importance of
the location of inter ventions for food securit y
impacts and the relevance of countries’ levels of
income for determining appropriate inter vention
strategies. n

FOOD SECURITY – KEY DEFINITIONS

Food security – A situation that exists when all people,
at all times, have physical, social and economic
access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets
their dietary needs and food preferences for an active
and healthy life. Based on this definition, it is possible
to identify four food security dimensions:

intake of adequate nutrition and energy. Sufficient
energy and nutrient intake by individuals is the
result of good care and feeding practices, food
preparation, dietary diversity and intra-household
distribution of food. Combined with good
biological utilization of food consumed, this
determines the nutritional status of individuals.
 Stability – If the dimensions of availability,
access and utilization are sufficiently met,
stability is the condition in which the whole
system is stable, thus ensuring that households
are food secure at all times. Stability issues
can refer to short-term instability (which can
lead to acute food insecurity) or medium- to
long-term instability (which can lead to
chronic food insecurity). Climatic, economic,
social and political factors can all be sources
of instability.

 Availability – This addresses whether or not food
is actually or potentially physically present,
including aspects of production, food reserves,
markets and transportation and wild foods.
 Access – If food is actually or potentially present
physically, the next question is whether or not
households and individuals have sufficient access
to that food.
 Utilization – If food is available and households
have adequate access to it, the next issue is
whether or not households are maximizing their

can be estimated. For instance, a reduction in
food loss and waste may result in more food
being immediately available, w ith an ensuing
reduction of food prices. This, in turn, may then
induce producers to reduce supplies – and, in an
economy-w ide setting, consumers may well react
to this change. Figure 11 shows potential effects,
but the actual impacts experienced w ill depend
on the context. In addition, since including all
potential economy-w ide effects of food loss and
waste in a single fig ure would be impossible,
Figure 11 is only able to capture partial effects.
How subsequent effects ultimately play out is an
empirical question.

The following sections review the theoretical
linkages between food loss and waste and
these food securit y dimensions. Each section
focuses on one dimension of food securit y, but
the links to other dimensions are highlighted
where appropriate.

The availability of food
It is often assumed that if less food is lost
or wasted (scenario A of Figure 11), more food
becomes available, which improves food securit y
and nutrition (see the blue box in the top half ).
However, this improvement depends on where
in the supply chain and in which geographical

by allowing them to store food for consumption
during lean months. Meanwhile, a reduction in
losses of food sold commercially improves the
availabilit y of food beyond farming households. 9
For food-secure countries highly dependent on
food imports, food loss and waste reduction is
seen as a strateg y for safeg uarding their food
supply.10

A reduction in the amount of food wasted
by consumers in high-income countries, for
example, does not necessarily mean there is
more food available to poor households in
distant, low-income countries. Subsistence or
semi-subsistence farmers consume all or a
considerable share of their own production.
Thus, a reduction in on-farm losses is likely to
improve their food securit y status, for example

In Figure 11A, the blue box in the bottom quadrant
shows that a food loss and waste reduction can
also affect food availabilit y negatively. Indeed, an
| 70 |

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2019

increase in food availabilit y from a reduction
in losses or waste may depress food prices.
This can have a negative impact on supply and
thus work against the initial improvement in
food availabilit y. The net effect is an empirical
question that depends on a number of factors,
including the price elasticities of supply and
demand, the intensit y of price transmission along
the supply chain and the financial cost–benefit
analysis of the reduction measure.

for example, improves consumers’ access to food,
but may diminish the food securit y status of
commercial farming households, who receive a
lower price for their output (orange box below
axis of Figure 11A). The food securit y status of
semi-subsistence or subsistence farmers, on
the other hand, is improved by a reduction in
on-farm losses, which boosts the amount of food
available to farming households. A reduction in
the losses incurred by an individual acting in
the supply chain boosts the amount of food that
actor, as well as actors further downstream, can
sell; this may increase their income and thus
improve their food securit y status, as shown by
the top orange box. If consumers waste less, they
save money and can spend that money on more
or better food.

While food discarded for safet y reasons lowers
the amount of food available, it also improves
the qualit y of the remaining food supply – thus
preventing diseases which negatively impact
on nutrition – and helps avoid detrimental
trade effects. Therefore, in Figure 11B, food safet y
discards are considered as positive impacts of
food loss and waste, since these improve food
securit y and nutrition. Unsafe foods should
not be consumed and their detection requires
proactive approaches to ensuring food safet y.
(For further discussion on food safet y, see “The
utilization of food” below.) Food safet y discards
could be partly avoided using a system approach
promoting safet y across the supply chain.

Food recover y and redistribution efforts redirect
food that would otherwise be lost or wasted to
people in need, irrespective of their position in
the supply chain.11 Meanwhile, price discounts
for food nearing its “best before” or “use by”
date make that food more affordable, which may
prevent it from being wasted.

The utilization of food

The accessibility of food

Avoiding qualitative food losses and waste (e.g.
nutrient loss or food contamination) throughout
the food supply chain ensures that more
nutritious and healthy foods become available for
consumers (see the purple box in the top half of
Figure 11A).

Improving the availabilit y of food is only a
first step towards improving food securit y
and nutrition. Any additional food resulting
from loss or waste reduction must also be
physically and economically accessible to
v ulnerable populations.

However, safe and healthy diets necessitate a
certain level of food loss and waste. Indeed, to
ensure food safet y, unsafe foods need to be
discarded. A nutritious and diversified diet
includes highly perishable food products such as
fruits, vegetables and animal products, which are
prone to spoilage. Both purple boxes in Figure 11B
illustrate how the utilization of food may improve
as food losses or waste increase.

The orange boxes above the horizontal axis in
Figure 11A suggest that a reduction in food loss
and waste will have a positive impact on the
accessibilit y of food. However, as shown by the
orange box in the bottom quadrant, negative
effects may also arise. Whether the net effect of
loss or waste reductions on food accessibilit y is
positive or negative depends on the price effects
of the reductions, which are in turn determined
by the location of the reductions. How these price
effects inf luence the incomes – and thus food
securit y status – of households depends, in turn,
on their income sources.

As seen by the purple boxes in the bottom
quadrant of Figure 11A, reducing food losses or
waste may also negatively impact on food security
and nutrition. For example, redistributing food
may improve food accessibility but may also lead
to an increase in food safety risks if there is no
g uarantee of the safety of the redistributed food.

hand and food securit y, nutrition and povert y on
the other, may be closely connected, especially
in low-income countries; however, the link has
not been sufficiently researched.19–21 The absence
of reliable and consistent data on the impacts
of food loss and waste impedes comparisons
between regions and countries.

The stability of food supplies
Food production and consumption levels var y
over time, therefore food storage plays an
important role in food stabilit y. For farming
households, improvements in on-farm storage,
such as use of metal silos, can reduce loss and
enable farmers to hold on to their har vest for a
better sale price later in the season or for their
own households’ food consumption throughout
the year (see the top green box in Figure 11A, under
a reducing scenario). At all stages of the supply
chain, a certain level of oversupply is needed
as a buffer to ensure enough food is available
even if production slackens or consumption
expands. 9 Maintaining such buffers inevitably
causes a certain amount of food to be lost or
wasted (shown by the top green box in Figure 11B).
Reducing these losses or waste may jeopardize
the stabilit y of food supplies and prices, with
negative impacts on food securit y (lower half of
Figure 11A). 9

Interest in food loss and waste reduction rose
markedly during the 2007 and 2011 global food
price spikes, which sparked concerns as to the
abilit y of the growing world population to feed
itself in the future. 22, 23 Among the political
commitments to reduce food loss and waste
undertaken in the wake of these food price
spikes is the African Union’s Malabo Declaration
(see Box 22).
It must be borne in mind that, for a number of
reasons, food securit y and nutrition demand
certain levels of food loss and waste. This is
illustrated by the boxes above the horizontal axis
in Figure 11B, when losses or waste are increased.
First, good nutrition requires that unsafe food be
removed from the food supply (blue box at the top
of Figure 11B). Second, stabilit y in food availabilit y
and prices requires an excess of available and
accessible food to ser ve as a buffer, as shown
by the green box in the upper half of Figure 11B.
Little research has so far been done to explore
which characteristics of a food system can ensure
the stabilit y dimension of food securit y in view
of variable food production and dietar y changes
that are altering food consumption. Food loss and
waste should be understood in connection with
the need for appropriate buffering mechanisms
that include some degree of excess in order to
deal with the sometimes ver y high variabilit y
of production and consumption in time and in
space, 9 while maintaining an alternative plan to
market surplus produce.

On the other hand, food loss and waste may
also have a negative impact on food stabilit y.
For example, losses caused by inadequate
storage practices, on-farm or elsewhere (e.g.
government buffer stocks of g rains), may
threaten the stabilit y of food supplies (lower
half of Figure 11B).
The production of food that is lost or wasted
exerts undue pressure on natural resources
(which may, in turn, pose a risk to the stabilit y of
food supplies, see lower half of Figure 11B). n

FOOD LOSS AND WASTE
AND THE IMPACT ON
FOOD SECURITY AND
NUTRITION

Third, as the availabilit y of, and access to,
diverse and nutrient-rich food increases, so too
will food waste, as shown by the top purple box
of Figure 11B. As some of the most nutrient-dense
foods – those foods that are high in nutrients but
relatively low in calories – have a short shelf life,
the utilization dimension of food securit y and
nutrition also requires careful review through a
food loss and waste lens. Good nutrition requires
a diverse diet, including fruits, vegetables and

THE MALABO DECLARATION AND THE PREVENTION OF POST-HARVEST LOSSES

Post-harvest losses erode incomes along the food
supply chain and may exacerbate the vulnerability
of poverty-ridden rural communities. In 2014 the
African Union adopted the Malabo Declaration on
Accelerated Agricultural Growth and Transformation
for Shared Prosperity and Improved Livelihoods,
which, under the commitment to end hunger in
Africa, includes the target to halve current
post-harvest losses by 2025. To this end, the African
Union established the Post-Harvest Loss Management

Strategy, which combines all interventions across
the entire food supply chain that aim to reduce
post-harvest losses of food crops, including grains,
fruits, vegetables and oilseeds, and animal and
fishery products. The Post-Harvest Loss Management
Strategy is expected to result in an increase in the
amount and quality of food supplies and thus
improve the availability, accessibility, utilization and
stability dimensions of food security.24

animal-sourced foods. A study in the United
States of America found that higher-qualit y
diets were associated with greater food waste. 25
However, reducing the qualit y loss of food
products, which may happen, inter alia, as a
result of vitamin or protein decay, can improve
food utilization (nutrition) among consumers.
Some processing methods, such as freezing, can
prevent nutrient loss while preser ving foods. 26–28

equilibrium price. A number of studies confirm
that food loss or waste reduction can improve
availabilit y of and access to food; however,
the effect is determined by the proximit y of
the reductions.
Drawing on FAO’s 2011 food loss and waste
estimates, one study looking at the market
and trade impacts of food loss and waste
reduction estimated that a 20 percent reduction
in crop losses in developing countries over ten
years would boost supplies and reduce prices,
to the benefit of both developing and developed
countries. For example, livestock and dair y
producers in both groups of countries would
see the costs of feed inputs go down. Some
developing countries would increase their feed
exports while others would import more at lower
prices. Global rice production would increase by
5.5 million tonnes, with the international price
decreasing by nearly 10 percent. Trade in rice
between developing countries would increase. 29

This section goes beyond theor y to look at
empirical evidence regarding the theoretical
linkages between food loss and waste and food
securit y and nutrition.

The impacts of food loss and waste reduction
on food availability and access
Loss reduction along the supply chain
The reduction in food losses by suppliers, for
example by adopting loss-reducing technologies,
may lead to lower equilibrium prices for food and
the supply and consumption of larger quantities
of food. Such a scenario may bring welfare gains
for both suppliers and consumers (see upper
half of Figure 11A).19 Reg ulations or taxes that
oblige suppliers to cut losses even where it is
not financially rewarding to do so may have the
opposite effect, i.e. a reduction in the quantit y
of food supplied and consumed and a higher

A study based on an economy-wide modelling
framework assesses the impact of reductions in
food loss and waste in the European Union (EU)
on producers and consumers in sub-Saharan
Africa. The study finds that a reduction in
agricultural losses in the EU means that
producers demand fewer inputs to produce more
| 73 |

CHAPTER 4 FOOD LOSS AND WASTE AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

output. As a result, the supply of food in the
EU increases, while food prices fall. The fall in
food prices is partially transmitted to overseas
markets, including sub-Saharan Africa, where
consumers benefit from more affordable food
imports. Meanwhile, the impact of reduced food
losses in the EU on producers in sub-Saharan
Africa is mixed. They benefit from the fall in
the price of imported food to be used as an
intermediate input, but are negatively affected
by the competition from cheaper imports of final
food products, forcing them to cut sales prices.
Moreover, sub-Saharan Africa’s exports to the
EU have to compete there with lower-priced
domestically produced food. As a result of the
increased competition in both domestic and
foreign markets, farmers in sub-Saharan Africa
produce less than before. 30 A similar study
using the same modelling framework found that
the long-distance impact on food securit y in
sub-Saharan Africa of a reduction in the amount
of food wasted by retailers and households in
the EU is positive, but relatively small. 31

Programme’s Zero Food Loss Initiative, a
project aimed at reducing post-har vest crop
loss in Uganda through the training of farmers
in improved post-har vest handling techniques,
and the introduction of subsidized, hermetic
crop-storage technologies. 34 Farmers’ incomes
increased when employing hermetic crop bags,
plastic silos, medium metal silos or large metal
silos since it allowed them to sell the maize later
in the season at a higher price, in comparison to
traditional storage approaches or no storage at
all. Food securit y likewise improved, reducing
the external purchasing period for maize by
1.5 months and beans by nearly 1 month. Since
adopting households consumed more of the food
they har vested and stored, they also experienced
greater financial f lexibilit y, enabling them to
consider other expenses and investments, such as
children’s education. Although, when sur veyed,
a sizeable portion of both technolog y adopters
and non-adopters expressed willingness to pay
more than the subsidized price but less than
the normal retail price, the study estimated that
strengthening the technolog y supply chains
while phasing out subsidies over five years had
a stronger effect on adoption than a ten-year
subsidy. The success of the project in Uganda
has spurred its expansion to over a dozen other
African countries.

The reduction in food losses through better
on-farm storage can improve the food securit y
status of farming households. Smallholders are
often compelled to sell all their grain soon after
the har vest, because traditional storage facilities
cannot g uarantee protection against pests and
pathogens. This may force them to buy grain
for their own consumption later, at possibly
higher prices. Case studies in Africa, Asia and
Latin America have demonstrated that the use
of metal silos prevents grain storage losses and
enhances household food securit y. 32 One study
found that in Kenya, farmers who used metal
silos to store maize had 1.8 months more in
adequate food provisioning than non-adopters,
which ensured the stabilit y of their food
consumption throughout the year. Metal silos
allowed farmers to limit their immediate sales
to those necessar y to meet urgent cash needs
and to hold on to the bulk of their har vest for
up to five months after production. 33 As seen by
the top green box in Figure 11A, when losses are
reduced, improving storage can therefore help
not only on-farm consumption, but also boost
farmers’ incomes.

In many cases, bringing improved storage
technologies to farmers requires incentivizing
the private sector to start developing, marketing
and selling on-farm storage solutions in locations
accessible to smallholder farmers. In Kenya, an
innovative strateg y by the project AgResults
launched a competition among operators with a
cash sales bonus based on the volume of low-cost
storage capacit y sold. As a result, the improved
storage sold corresponded to approximately
4.6 million 90-kg bags of maize safely stored
from pests, thereby avoiding an estimated
12–20 percent loss. By improving business
linkages, the competition pulled the hermetic
storage devices into the last mile, enabling
farmers to find a device at a nearby agrodealer. 35

Food recovery and redistribution
Food recover y and redistribution – also referred
to as food rescue or donation – and gleaning are
charitable acts that involve distributing food that
would otherwise be lost or wasted to the food

point along the food supply chain.

amount of food to be recovered. Institutional
catering offers the advantage of concentrating
significant volumes of food in a relatively small
number of locations; it was therefore a priorit y
target in the study. 38

Neglected until only a decade ago by
policy makers, recover y and redistribution
prog rammes such as food banks, communit y
shops, social supermarkets, pantr y kitchens or
school food and nutrition prog rammes are now
play  an increasingly important role not only
as food loss or waste solutions, but also as a
means to promote the right to food.11, 36 Indeed,
as shown by the “targeted food redistribution”
box in Figure 11A, there is potential to inf luence
food securit y and nutrition positively through
food recover y and redistribution. However, this
can only ever ser ve as a safet y net and cannot
be a solution to eliminate either food insecurit y
or food loss and waste. As food recover y and
redistribution becomes more important, so does
the need to appraise its impacts critically.11

The Daily Table, a not-for-profit grocer y store in
a low-income neighbourhood in Boston, in the
United States of America, sells healthy meals
priced to compete with fast food alternatives
by recovering food discarded by retailers,
growers and distributors. 39 The prices make it
possible to purchase three balanced, wholesome
meals and one snack a day on a Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program budget, the
government’s food assistance allowance for lowand no-income people. 40 The Daily Table was
founded on the premise that making people pay
for their food, as opposed to giving it to them
for free, avoids them feeling any shame. 41

Food redistribution does not necessarily mean
food is handed out for free. Social supermarkets,
for example, sell food that is rejected for sale in
the mainstream market (e.g. blemished fruits and
vegetables or excess stock) at discounted prices.11
Note that food recover y and redistribution
programmes should be formulated so as to
deliver food in ways that are not considered
demeaning by recipients.11 Redistributed food
must also be culturally acceptable and adapted to
local tastes.

Food recover y and redistribution practices
are expanding rapidly around the world.
In countries where social safet y systems are
underfunded, overburdened or non-existent,
food recover y and redistribution prog rammes
have proved an effective form of food assistance,
as well as a key element of prog ressive social
policy. In Brazil, for example, a national
net work of food banks, Mesa Brasil SESC,
ser ved more than 1.4 million Brazilians through
public–private partnerships in more than 500
municipalities in 2017. 42 The Eg y ptian Food
Bank fed an average 250 000 people monthly
in 2017. The Bank has helped launch 33 food
banks in the Near East, A frica and Southern
Asia since 2011. In 2017 it extended its reach
to Latin A merica, where it participated in
launching 61 food banks. 43 In North Macedonia,
a web platform launched by NGO Ajde
Makedonija connects businesses w ith surplus
food for donating to civ il societ y organizations
that redistribute the food to food-insecure
people. 44 A n Asian example of successful food
redistribution is the No Food Waste initiative
in India, which redistributes large quantities
of leftovers from social events, hotels and
restaurants. Overall, however, food recover y
and redistribution prog rammes in Asia and the
Pacific are rare and mainly concentrated in the
high-income countries of the reg ion.11

The potential for food recover y and redistribution
to make an impact is illustrated by efforts in the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland under the Courtauld Commitment 2020
to reduce food waste. From 2015, when it was
adopted, until 2017, an additional 35 million
meals were redistributed annually. In 2017,
102 million meals were redistributed, at a total
value of almost GBP 130 million. 37
A study into food redistribution in Denver,
New York and Nashv ille in the United States
of America found a realistic potential to
redistribute an additional 24 million meals
annually. This would enable the three cities
to meet an additional 8 –18 percent of their
respective meal gaps. The study found that
g rocer y outlets presented the largest untapped
potential for food recover y in terms of the total

CHAPTER 4 FOOD LOSS AND WASTE AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

Food loss and waste reduction and stability in the
supply and prices of food

60 percent of total micronutrients, w ith the
exception of v itamin B12, are lost as a result
of the loss and waste of highly perishable foods,
including fruits, vegetables and animal-based
products. The study concludes that strateg ies
focusing on improved storage and distribution
management are likely to improve the
availabilit y of micronutrients more than that
of macronutrients. 46

Food production and consumption levels var y
over time. Therefore, a certain level of oversupply
or buffer is needed at all stages of the supply
chain to ensure availabilit y and access to food in
case production drops or consumption expands. 9
Maintaining such buffers necessarily entails a
certain level of food loss and waste. On the other
hand, loss and waste reduction measures, such as
better storage or preser vation methods, may help
counter the seasonalit y of agricultural products
and thus promote the stabilit y of food supplies
which will help improve access. 23 The linkages
between food loss and waste and the stabilit y of
food are depicted in Figure 11.

Another study, also based on FAO’s 2011 food
loss and waste estimates, finds that reducing food
losses and waste by half would considerably boost
nutrient supplies in the food system in 2030.13
In high- and upper-middle-income countries,
the supply of dietar y iron would increase above
recommended levels, while folate deficiencies
would decrease fourfold but remain below
recommended values. In lower-middle-income
countries, the supply of folate would exceed
recommended intake values and ribof lavin (B2)
deficiencies would be halved. In low-income
countries, the supply of calories would allow
all consumers to increase their intake to levels
above minimum recommended values, assuming
universal and equal access to those calories.
The supply of vitamin A, ribof lavin, folate,
calcium and poly unsaturated fats, crucial for
the prevention of non-communicable diseases,
would all increase by one-third to one-half of
current, inadequate levels. By boosting the supply
of nutrients, halving food loss and waste would
also have an effect on risk factors for chronic,
non-communicable diseases among adults, such
as coronar y heart disease and t y pe 2 diabetes,
which are becoming more prevalent in low- and
middle-income countries. The study estimates
that two million deaths could be avoided by
halving food loss and waste, mainly due to
increased consumption of fruits and vegetables.

Any studies into food loss and waste must take
due account of the need for buffers to ensure
food supply stabilit y against a background of
variations in production and consumption in time
and space. 9 Options to market any excess supplies
that go with such buffers need to be explored.
High levels of waste can jeopardize the
continuit y of food assistance programmes and
the food securit y of those ser ved. The Breakfast
in the Classroom programme in the United
States of America, for example, has high levels
of milk waste. It was estimated that the value of
the milk wasted in one urban school district was
16 percent of annual food expenditure under the
programme for that district, excluding the costs
of disposing of the wasted milk in landfill. 45

The impact of food loss and waste reduction
on nutrition
Nutrient loss due to quantitative and qualitative
food loss and waste may represent a missed
opportunit y to reduce malnutrition and
micronutrient deficiencies.12

The study estimates unintended consequences,
too. Deaths due to overweight and obesit y are
set to increase by over half a million in 2020, due
to excess consumption of calories and saturated
fatt y acids. Meanwhile, rises in food losses and
waste cause supply gaps for certain nutrients.
The supply of folate and ribof lavin would
fall short of demand in lower-middle-income
countries, as would that of vitamin A, ribof lavin,
folate, calcium and poly unsaturated fatt y acids in
low-income countries. Importantly, even

A recent study based on FAO’s 2011 food loss
and waste estimates found that while the supply
of all digestible protein, fat, calories, amino acids
and essential vitamins and minerals exceeded
average requirements, the large amounts of food
lost throughout the food supply chain compound
dietary inequalities within and between countries.
The results of the study further indicate that over
| 76 |

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2019

the supply of calories would be insufficient in
low-income countries. The underlying
assumption with these results is that changes in
nutrient availabilit y would result in increased
accessibilit y, therefore the study is only indicative
of possible change. However, these results are
valuable as they demonstrate that food loss and
waste reduction should go hand in hand with
health-sensitive inter ventions aimed at
optimizing the impact of loss and waste
reductions on nutrition.

Up to 55 percent of (t y pically inedible) fish inputs
are lost during processing. However, even fish
parts generally considered inedible may be used
as inputs for processed fish-based food products.
This would boost the incomes of fish product
suppliers and provide more nutritious food for
consumers. 53
Mechanical fish separation involves the use of
non-marketable fish parts to produce processed
food products (e.g. fish burgers). An Italian
study found that the mechanical separation
of non-marketable fish parts and their use for
the production of fish-based products like fish
burgers creates new opportunities for the fish
industr y and increases the availabilit y of highly
nutritious foods for consumers. 53

FAO recently piloted a method to estimate the
percentage of children under five in Cameroon,
India and Kenya whose micronutrient
requirements of vitamin A, iron, zinc and
vitamin C could theoretically be satisfied
through reductions in food losses (see Box 23).
The study shows that large amounts of nutrients
are lost due to preventable post-har vest losses.
It demonstrates that reducing post-har vest losses
of selected crops could increase the availabilit y
of micronutrients, which could in turn improve
nutrition. 47 The study is the first to estimate the
connection between nutrient loss in the food
supply chain and micronutrient deficiencies in
children. However, its results should be
interpreted with caution. The study assumes that
food loss decreases the intake of food and its
nutrients by nutrient-deficient people and that
micronutrient-deficient children would have
access to the recovered nutrients. In realit y, the
lead cause of micronutrient deficiencies in
children is not a lack of access to food, but rather
infections, which reduce appetite and hamper
the utilization of nutrients. 48–50

Food safety and its implications for food security
and nutrition
Food safet y, which can be associated with food
loss and waste or inter ventions to reduce it,
is of crucial importance to food securit y and
nutrition. Food-borne illnesses caused by the
consumption of contaminated foods, for example,
hamper nutritional intake. Food that is not safe
must be removed from the food system, resulting
in losses; but, on the other hand, qualitative
food loss reduction may increase food safet y.
These effects are illustrated by the purple boxes
in both scenarios of Figure 11.
Depending on the context, food safet y and food
loss and waste may be causally linked, negatively
or positively. First, the disposal of unsafe food
can be considered as food loss. Second, many
of the practices that prevent physical food loss
and obser vable losses in qualit y also improve
food safet y. It is often easier to motivate food
actors to limit obser vable losses, since they have
financial implications; improvements in food
safet y then become a welcome by-product of loss
reduction. Third, producers and suppliers may
apply chemicals to food to protect it against pests
or preser ve it. While this may prevent food from
being lost or wasted, it can also threaten food
safet y and undermine consumer confidence in
the safet y of their food. For this reason, the “safe
food supply” box in Figure 11B is considered as a
positive effect from increased levels of food loss
and waste.
»

Fish and fish products are a source of valuable
nutrients and micronutrients and are thus
of fundamental importance to healthy,
diversified diets. Fish can be a relatively cheap,
locally available means to diversif y the diet
of low-income groups. However, fish spoils
easily and post-har vest handling, processing,
packaging, storage and transportation require
particular care to maintain qualit y and avoid
losses and waste. Alongside the rise in
consumption of fish products in recent decades,
there is a growing interest in food qualit y and
safet y, with increasingly stringent hygiene
standards at national and international levels. 52

THE IMPACTS OF FOOD LOSS ON MICRONUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES IN CHILDREN UNDER FIVE

A pilot study by FAO in Cameroon, India and Kenya
established a link between the amount of losses for a
number of food products (selected because of their
importance in diets, and the availability of up-to-date
nutrient data) and the loss of nutrients. Vitamin A
deficiency is a major health and nutrition concern in
developing countries. It is the leading cause of
preventable blindness in children and increases the
risk of disease and death from severe infections.51
FAO estimates that the requirements of nearly a
quarter of vitamin A-deficient children in the three
countries in the study could theoretically be satisfied
through food loss reduction. The figure in this box
shows how this potential varies from one food product
to another.
Due to a lack of country-specific data on zinc, iron
and vitamin C deficiencies for children under five, the
study used the percentages of all children under five in
each country whose nutritional needs could
theoretically be satisfied by food loss reduction,
regardless of their nutritional status. The results of the

study vary considerably between countries and
nutrients. In Kenya, food loss reductions are assumed to
satisfy the iron and vitamin C requirements of 24 and
33 percent, respectively, of all children under five. In
Cameroon, loss reductions could satisfy the vitamin C
needs of 83 percent of all children under five. In India,
food loss reductions were unable to satisfy nearly any
of the iron or zinc requirements; however, 23 percent
of children in the country would receive their
requirements for vitamin C through loss reduction.
Note that the validity of the study results is
determined by the multitude of assumptions used, as
well as by the gaps in country-specific data on nutrient
deficiencies and food composition. In addition, the
methodology to estimate post-harvest losses is
inconsistent across countries and food products. The
study also fails to factor in the logistical and other costs
of addressing nutrient deficiencies through food loss
reduction. In view of these shortcomings, the study’s
case for addressing nutrient deficiencies in children by
reducing food losses is weak.

GENDER RELATIONS INFLUENCE FOOD SAFETY AND FOOD LOSSES – THE CASE OF
RURAL ETHIOPIA

Where women play a primary role in agriculture,
inclusive interventions towards loss reduction can
improve food availability and accessibility. Rural
women often have less access to and control over
resources than men, which may result in the loss of
food. In addition, the work assigned to women is
often arduous, time-consuming and repetitive, much
of it around the home in conjunction with household
and caring tasks. This double or triple role carries a
heavy time and energy burden and can significantly
contribute to food loss.65
In rural Ethiopia, women are often responsible for
preventing grain loss during storage, but they have less
access to and control over agricultural assets than men.
One study finds that women’s disempowerment forces
them to resort to less effective methods to prevent
losses. Some of these methods may threaten food

safety. Treating grain with chemicals, for example, can
pose a threat to human health and affect the nutritional
value of the grain. Women report applying chemicals
above the recommended levels to avoid losses and
conflict with men. Poor storage conditions increase the
likelihood of contamination, which further promotes the
use of chemicals – to which women are especially
exposed. To overcome food gaps when cash is short
and production yields are poor, women reported
consuming grains of which up to 50 percent were
damaged.66
Gender-responsive interventions to improve
women’s standing and decision-making power in the
consumption and sale of household production may
help reduce food losses, and thus strengthen food
security, not least by improving food safety and dietary
diversity (see also Chapter 6).67–70

» The detection of food safet y hazards may result in

contaminated food to poorer buyers, for
example in the informal sector. This may entail
financial losses, without eliminating the food
safet y risk. Unsafe food is often diverted to
lower-income groups that are physically and
economically v ulnerable to disease. 59 National
estimates indicate that dietar y exposure to
mycotoxins in developing countries is much
greater than in developed countries. 8 Mean
dietar y exposures in sub-Saharan African
countries, for example, are 100 times greater
than those in developed countries. 60 A study
of rural women in Kenya found that high
levels of mycotoxin exposure were strongly
associated with povert y – in particular, a
lack of disposable income for household
expenditure – as well as with food insecurit y
and severe hunger. 61 A study in Ethiopia found
that women’s lack of control over agricultural
assets contributes to the consumption of grain
contaminated by fungi or pests. Box 24 discusses
the Ethiopia case study in the broader context
of women’s empowerment and its connection to
food loss and food securit y.

the loss of food products. The nature and extent
of contamination, together with the effectiveness
of food safet y reg ulations, determine the scale of
the loss. For example, the Kenyan Government
destroyed nearly 14 000 tonnes of maize in 2014
due to contamination with af latoxins, a t ype
of mycotoxin produced by a fungal infestation
of crops. 54 Mycotoxins are toxic and can cause
extensive harm to human and animal health. 55–57
Food safet y concerns that are unverified by
experts may result in precautionar y destruction
which in some cases can be mitigated with
expert consultation. For instance, fears that
mangoes had been treated with formalin led the
Government of Bangladesh to destroy hundreds
of tonnes of the fruits, while safet y experts later
concluded they posed no risk to human health. 58
Similarly, stringent food safet y reg ulations
produce extensive losses.
In other cases, especially where food safet y
standards or their enforcement are weak, the
detection of food safet y hazards may lower the
value of food products. Suppliers may divert
| 79 |

CHAPTER 4 FOOD LOSS AND WASTE AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

Food safet y hazards are often invisible to the
eye and difficult to measure without specialized
equipment. Suppliers may therefore have little
incentive to control food safet y risks. If
enforcement of food safet y reg ulations is weak,
unsafe food may enter the market. Suppliers are
t y pically more motivated to address quantitative
losses or obser vable qualit y deterioration that
affect marketable volumes. Measures aimed at
limiting such losses may also promote food
safet y. For example, the use of hermetic bags to
store grain drastically reduces obser vable,
quantitative losses, but also prevents contamination
with fungal toxins. 62, 63 Refrigeration inhibits the
growth of most bacteria that cause food to spoil,
as well as those that have adverse health effects.

occurrence of food safet y hazards in foods,
in particular those with the highest risks to
human health. In addition, unsafe food discards
should be removed from the food supply chain
in a way that ensures they do not end up being
consumed. n

FOOD LOSS AND WASTE
REDUCTION AND THE
IMPORTANCE OF
LOCATION
As seen above, food loss and waste reductions
may affect food securit y and nutrition in
various ways, depending on the location of the
reductions and the food-insecure groups, both
geographically and along the supply chain.

In contexts where reg ulation is lacking or
unenforced, food loss reduction measures can
compromise food safet y. For example, pesticides
may prevent on-farm losses, but can be harmful
to human health; chemical preser vatives may
prevent food spoilage, but can also be hazardous.
An example is the treatment of fish, meat
and milk with formaldehyde for preser vation.
As formaldehyde also occurs naturally in these
foods (its presence increases over time as a
by-product of decomposition), adulteration
with formaldehyde is difficult to detect. 64 The
continued monitoring of food for the presence
of harmful preser vatives is important to ensure
consumer confidence in its safet y.

The impacts operate through different channels.
Food loss and waste negatively affect the
quantit y and qualit y of food supplies; and they
also affect prices and thus the equilibrium of
the food system. These in turn affect the income
of actors along the supply chain and ultimately
food securit y beyond the affected supply chain
(primarily through price changes).
A reduction in food losses or waste at a
g iven stage in the supply chain increases the
amount of food supplied to subsequent stages.
This depresses prices paid by the stakeholders
in these stages, boosting their incomes (shown
by the “increased sales at or after point of
reduction” box in Figure 11A). The impact on the
income of those who achieve the reduction,
however, depends on how much their sales
volume increases and how much prices fall.
Actors operating at earlier stages in the supply
chain may be negatively affected if a reduction
in losses or waste by their buyers means the
demand for their output falls and their sale price
goes down. As a result, incomes, and therefore
the food securit y status of these upstream
actors, decline (see orange box below the axis
of Figure 11A).

The recent growth in food recover y and
redistribution initiatives may give rise to food
safet y concerns. While some countries (such
as Canada, New Zealand, the United States of
America and a number of European countries)
have formulated reg ulations and g uidelines
related to food recover y and redistribution,
others do not impose any rules or controls on
these often spontaneous and uncategorized
practices. This lack of reg ulation and oversight
poses food safet y risks.11
The above findings demonstrate the need for
inclusive food safet y policies that ensure no
one, especially the most v ulnerable, is forced
to consume contaminated foods due to lack of
access to safe alternatives. Discarding unsafe
food will always be preferable to consuming
it. W hat is really required is a reduction in the

the food supply resulting from reduced loss or
waste depresses food prices further down the
food supply chain and thus improves access to
food at these stages.
A reduction in on-farm losses may have strong
positive food securit y impacts. This is particularly
true for smallholders in low-income countries
where the availabilit y of food for subsistence
farmers improves. Farmers who market part of

THE IMPACTS OF A REDUCTION IN FOOD LOSSES AT THE PRIMARY PRODUCTION AND FOOD
PROCESSING STAGES ON FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

Wageningen Economic Research carried out a
simulation exercise, commissioned by FAO, of the
impact of a 25 percent reduction – in terms of
economic value – in global food losses in primary
production and food processing, based on FAO’s most
recent food loss estimates. The simulation was carried
out in MAGNET, a multisectoral, multiregional
computable general equilibrium model of the world
economy that is widely used to simulate the effects of
agricultural, trade, land and biofuel policies on the
global economy.72 It aimed to understand how loss
reductions impact on food security and nutrition
through prices.i, ii The 25 percent reduction in losses
can be represented as changes in productivity that
increase global food production by 4.3 percent, of
which 2 percent is at the primary production stage
and 2.3 percent at the processing stage. The table in
this box indicates the impact of the loss reduction on
economic and food security and nutrition indicators
globally and in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and
Southern Asia, where food insecurity is prevalent.
The results of the model show that a worldwide
reduction in food losses brings about an improvement
in global economic and food security and nutrition
indicators. World Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as
an indicator capturing the overall response of the
global economy to the effects of the loss reduction on
efficiency, increases (moderately) following the
reduction. Both the availability (measured as total
primary food production) and the access (measured as
food purchases by private consumers) to food improve
after the loss reduction as a result of its effects on
prices and incomes. The model does not capture
actual intake; however, it shows that the nutrient
content of the three micronutrients for which global
intake of food is inadequate increases, indicating an
improvement in food utilization.73
The improvements in global indicators, ranging
between 0.1 and 0.6 percent, are not large; however,
two factors should be taken into account when
interpreting these changes. First, the demand for food
is all in all not very responsive to price changes. Thus,
while the model predicts that the loss reduction and the
resulting boost in the amount of food available at retail

level will lead to a global fall in food prices of
4 percent, food purchases do not increase significantly
(+ 0.53 percent). Second, the changes in indicators
vary widely across regions. GDP and total primary
production in regions with generally lower levels of per
capita income are found to be generally more
responsive to loss reduction, as the agriculture and
food sectors in these countries typically account for a
larger share of the economy.
These results help identify the best entry points for
loss reduction aimed at improving food security and
nutrition. The table distinguishes between the
contributions to changes in GDP and three of the food
security dimensions as a result of interventions in the
primary production stage on the one hand, and in the
processing stage on the other.
Interventions that reduce losses have a larger
impact on food security and nutrition indicators in the
primary production stage than those in the processing
stage. The difference is particularly stark for
availability: in both sub-Saharan Africa and Central
and Southern Asia, primary production decreases as a
result of a fall in prices brought about by loss reduction
at the processing stage. These loss reductions can
negatively affect the food security of vulnerable farming
households, as they are output-augmenting at
production but input-saving at the processing stage.
The impact of loss reduction on access and
utilization is positive at both stages of the supply
chain. In sub-Saharan Africa, loss reduction at the
primary production stage has an impact that is
around 20 times stronger than it is at the processing
stage and 10 times stronger than at the processing
stage in Central and Southern Asia. These results
confirm that interventions towards loss reduction
focusing on the early stages of the supply chain are
more effective in achieving better food security and
nutrition outcomes.
The results of the modelling exercise demonstrate
that the impact of loss reductions on food security and
nutrition is much stronger domestically than abroad.
They show that loss reduction improves food access
and utilization both domestically and abroad, but
reductions abroad have a negative impact on the

availability of food in both sub-Saharan Africa and
Central and Southern Asia. This result is explained by
the fact that imports replace domestically produced
food. Indeed, the loss reduction abroad results in a fall
in the price of imports, discouraging demand for
domestic food and favouring cheaper imports. The

indicators for food access and utilization are based on
a combination of domestically produced food and
imported food while the fall in prices results in an
improvement in these two indicators.

FAO’s Statistics Division provided food loss estimates by food group, country group and supply chain stage. In the simulation exercise, food loss reductions vary across food
products, regions and supply chain stages. However, due to the difference between FAO’s food loss estimation methodology and the structure of MAGNET, the supply chain stages
included in the simulation exercise are limited to the primary production and processing stages; other supply chain stages, such as storage, transportation, wholesale and retail,
are not covered.

CHAPTER 4 FOOD LOSS AND WASTE AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

» their incomes and food securit y may increase,

food losses brings about a modest improvement
in global economic and food security indicators.
However, the results demonstrate that while a fall
in prices resulting from loss or waste reduction in
developed countries may improve food access for
food-buying households in developing countries,
it may also depress incomes, and thus undermine
the food security and nutrition status of farming
households in these countries. n

provided the price drop resulting from the output
boost does not offset this effect.
A reduction in losses or waste by suppliers
beyond the primar y production stage boosts
supplies and lowers prices further along the
supply chain. However, farmers may see the
demand for their products decrease, with negative
implications for their incomes and thus food
security, shown by the orange arrows in Figure 12.

FOOD LOSS AND WASTE
REDUCTION AND LEVELS
OF FOOD INSECURITY

A reduction in the amount of food wasted by
consumers improves food availabilit y and access
for consumers, but the resulting reduction in
consumer demand may leave farmers and other
actors in the supply chain worse off.

The role of food loss and waste reduction in
lowering food insecurit y also depends on the
degree of food insecurit y prevalent in different
countries. A global measurement of the severit y
of food insecurit y is available through the Food
Insecurit y Experience Scale (FIES), p which
measures limits in access to food, at the level of
households or individuals, due to lack of
resources. Respondents are asked eight direct
yes/no questions about their experiences in
accessing food over the previous 12 months. 3
Based on the responses, levels of food insecurit y
are assessed according to the following scale:

Consumers increase their disposable income
by cutting back waste, which may lead them to
change their diet to include a wider range of
nutritious, perishable products, e.g. meat, fish,
fruits and vegetables. 71 The following result may
well be an increase in the amount of food wasted,
in particular food with a higher environmental
footprint. 30
How food loss and waste reductions impact
on the incomes, and thus food securit y status,
of stakeholders in the food supply chain
depends on how price changes ripple through
it. Geographical proximit y largely determines
the strength of this price transmission. The
likelihood that a reduction in losses or waste
will improve the food securit y status of groups
located far away from the point of reduction is
small. A reduction in food wasted by consumers
in high-income countries, for example, does not
necessarily mean the recovered food becomes
available to the food insecure in a low-income
countr y, nor do they automatically benefit from
the price drop resulting from waste reduction.

 severely food insecure: no food for a day
or more;
 moderately food insecure: compromising on
food qualit y and variet y or reducing food
quantit y and skipping meals;
 mildly food insecure or food secure: potential
uncertaint y about the abilit y to obtain food.
The FIES provides useful insights into the degree
of urgency of ensuring food access, including
food quality considerations. Where severe
food insecurity is high – as in low-income and
lower-middle-income countries, as shown in Table 1
– the scope for food loss and waste reduction to
contribute to reducing hunger through increased
availability and access to food is potentially large.
Interventions preventing avoidable food loss can
ameliorate food shortages, particularly at local
level in smallholder production as these areas

Drawing on FAO’s new estimate of food
losses (from the Food Loss Index described
in Chapter 1), Box 25 presents the results of an
economy-wide modelling exercise to assess
transmission of the impacts of a 25 percent drop
in global food losses or waste on food security and
nutrition across the primary production and food
processing stages of the supply chain and across
regions. It shows that a worldwide reduction in

are not well connected to markets and therefore
trade is minimal. 74 This could increase farmers’
incomes and improve food access. If reductions in
losses are large enough to affect prices, the urban
food insecure may also stand to benefit. Overall, a
strateg y aiming to reduce food loss and waste
is likely to be more effective in improving food
security for the populations in these countries
than in high-income countries, particularly by
focusing on reducing losses at the farm level and
early steps in the supply chain.

It has to be borne in mind that povert y and
inequalities are drivers of food insecurit y. 3
Hence, inter ventions aimed directly at reducing
povert y and inequalities may be more effective at
improving food securit y than food loss or waste
reduction. The latter can make a contribution
but cannot be considered the solution to the food
insecurit y problem. Also note that food waste
levels on the one hand, and food insecurit y
indicators on the other, generally do not move
in the same direction. A rise in incomes often
results in an increase in food waste as households
buy more food, though the share of food in the
overall household budget falls and diets shift
towards more perishable foods: meat, fruits and
vegetables. An increase in food waste may thus
be a symptom of greater food securit y. However,
an increase in food losses indicates that the
availabilit y of food is negatively impacted by
structural problems, such as insufficient
agricultural infrastructure. 75 n

As levels of severe food insecurity recede –
in upper-middle-income and, particularly,
high-income countries – the importance of food
loss and waste reduction in terms of improvements
in food security declines. Also the nature of the
required strategies changes as more targeted
approaches are needed to reach the food insecure,
e.g. through the redistribution of food in urban
areas, which often experience rising levels of
waste. Especially in high-income countries,
problems of food access touch on a much smaller
share of the population, even though numbers
of moderately food insecure remain relatively
significant. Large-scale campaigns to reduce
food waste – the most pressing problem related
to food loss and waste in high-income countries
– are unlikely to benefit the remaining numbers
of food-insecure people. Targeted loss or waste
reduction inter ventions, such as redistributing
food, especially well-balanced meals, to the
food insecure may do more to improve access to
quality and nutritious food by the severely and
moderately food insecure. However, eliminating
lingering food insecurity will also require
a broad set of social policies addressing its
underlying causes.

CHAPTER 4 FOOD LOSS AND WASTE AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

THE RELATIVE
(COST-)EFFECTIVENESS
OF FOOD LOSS AND
WASTE REDUCTION IN
IMPROVING FOOD
SECURITY AND
NUTRITION

An innovative study found that the reduction
of post-har vest food losses by improving
infrastructure lowers food prices and increases
the amount of food available, thus improving
food securit y. However, it is not as cost-effective
as investments in agricultural research and
development aimed at reducing post-har vest
losses. Although both options offer high
economic returns to investment, the returns
for agricultural research and development are
considerably higher than those for infrastructure
improvements. 22 In addition, it has been arg ued
that the improvement in food securit y resulting
from the reduction of post-har vest losses as
estimated in the study may be exaggerated, as
better infrastructure can also lead directly to
an increase in food productivit y and a drop in
retail prices. Overall, the cost-effectiveness
of improving food securit y by means of
reducing post-har vest loss with infrastructure
improvements is unclear. 76 There are currently no
similar studies available on the cost-effectiveness
of food waste reduction measures.

So far, this chapter has examined whether
food securit y and nutrition can be improved
by reducing food loss and waste at different
stages in the supply chain. It has arg ued that
positive effects are not a given and that the
impact depends on location, both geographically
and along the supply chain, of the loss or waste
reduction and of the food insecure. The
discussion has shown that loss or waste
reductions are most likely to improve food
securit y and nutrition if they occur near the
food insecure.

Another study into the relative effectiveness
of various food securit y measures to meet the
projected food demand in 2050 finds that food
loss or waste reduction is least effective at
boosting the availabilit y of food worldwide. 5
Yield gap closure through improved nutrient
supply and management, enhanced irrigation
efficiency and improved rainwater management
are found to be most effective at increasing
national food supplies, with an increase in
national food production of 56 –113 percent.
A shift in diets towards more plant-based
products is estimated to boost national food
supply by 28 –36 percent and food loss and waste
reduction by 7–14 percent. The impact of a
reduction in food losses or waste on food
supplies varies widely from one countr y to
another; the increases in supply range from
2.5 to 25 percent at the moderate implementation
level (a 25 percent reduction in losses and
waste), and from 2.5 to 100 percent at the high
implementation level (a 50 percent reduction in
losses and waste). n

This chapter has examined evidence as to the
effectiveness of loss and waste inter ventions
at different stages in the food supply chain in
terms of food securit y and nutrition. The limited
data available suggest that certain inter ventions
may not bring about a significant improvement.
Food waste reductions in high-income countries,
in particular, are unlikely to have a more than
negligible impact on food securit y and nutrition
in low-income countries. The reduction of
on-farm losses in these countries themselves is
more likely to have a significantly positive impact
on food securit y.
An important follow-up question is whether
loss or waste reductions are a cost-effective
way of alleviating food insecurit y. Indeed, the
cost of reducing food loss and waste, including
comparing it to the costs of alternative measures
to improve food securit y and nutrition, is an
important factor in deciding on the desirabilit y of
such reductions. However, few studies look into
the costs of various food loss or waste reduction
measures and further research is needed to g uide
appropriate policy decisions. 29

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2019

CONCLUSIONS

not extensive and reducing food losses or
waste is unlikely to bring significant food
securit y benefits. Pockets of food insecurit y
and malnutrition in these countries are most
often associated with povert y. The recover y and
redistribution of food may help alleviate food
insecurit y in these cases; however, wider social
policies are necessar y to address the underlying
causes of food insecurit y.

The impact of reductions in food losses and
waste on food securit y and nutrition is not
straightforward. Assuming that loss and waste
reductions will automatically improve food
securit y and nutrition or eliminate hunger,
irrespective of location and cost, is incorrect.
Indeed, the impact depends on the location, both
geographically and along the supply chain, of
the loss or waste reduction and of those who are
food insecure. The desirabilit y in terms of food
securit y and nutrition of reduction measures
depends on the cost-effectiveness of these
measures compared to alternative measures.
Note that a certain level of loss and waste is
a necessar y outcome of having enough buffer
supplies to g uarantee food securit y and adequate
nutrition across time and space. An excessive
reduction of these buffer supplies may jeopardize
the stabilit y of food supplies and prices and thus
access to food.

A reduction in the amount of food lost or wasted
in high-income countries is unlikely to boost the
availabilit y of food in other countries with high
levels of food insecurit y. Indeed, such an impact
is conditional on the possibilit y of transporting
the recovered losses or waste to food-insecure
groups abroad. Lower food prices resulting from
waste reductions in high-income countries may
be transmitted to countries with lower incomes
via international markets; however, the size of
the impact may not be large and will depend on a
range of factors. Loss reductions in high-income
countries may boost the competitiveness of food
imported into lower-income countries through
lower prices; this may benefit food-buying
households in those countries, but negatively
affect households that produce food.

A key question is where to reduce food losses or
waste in order to obtain the most impact in terms of
food security and nutrition. The optimal entry point
for interventions depends on the context; however,
general principles can offer some guidance.

There are currently no studies that demonstrate
the effect of reductions in food losses or waste
on people’s nutrient deficiencies, though a few
available studies estimate the potential effect of
this. However, estimates of the effect of food loss
and waste reduction on micronutrient deficiencies
in children may be overstated because these are
often caused by infections that reduce appetite
and hamper nutrient utilization, rather than
by a lack of food. 49, 50 Nevertheless, reducing
qualitative food losses or waste throughout the
supply chain is likely to have a beneficial impact
on nutrition in any countr y, as the availabilit y of
qualit y, nutritious and safe food increases.

In low-income countries with high levels of food
insecurit y, food losses are often a more pressing
problem than food waste. Here, the reduction
in food losses at the early stages of the food
supply chain is most likely to have strong positive
food securit y impacts, as its effects will be felt
throughout the rest of the chain. The reduction
of on-farm losses, which constitute a critical loss
point in low-income countries, as demonstrated
in Chapter 2, may significantly improve the food
securit y status of poor smallholders; it may also
boost supplies in local or national food markets,
improving overall food securit y. Reductions in
food losses or waste at other stages in the food
supply chain can also have positive food securit y
impacts. A reduction in the amount of food
wasted by households, for example, improves
households’ food securit y status; the potential for
improvement depends on the level of food waste.

Food loss and waste reduction is not necessarily
the most cost-effective way of improving food
securit y and nutrition. Increasing agricultural
productivit y through research and development
has been found to be more cost-effective in
this respect than reducing post-har vest losses.
Meanwhile, broad efforts towards agricultural
development may have positive side effects in
terms of loss or waste reduction. n

The retail and consumption stages are t ypical
loss points in high-income countries; however,
overall food insecurit y in these countries is

Key messages

1

Reducing food loss and waste can
contribute to feeding the world
population in an environmentally
sustainable manner as it helps to improve
resource use efficiency and decrease the
amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs)
emitted per unit of food consumed.

2

To be environmentally effective,
interventions to reduce food loss and
waste need to consider where food loss
and waste has the greatest impact on
the environment – both in terms of food
products and the stage of the food
supply chain.

3

Food loss and waste reduction
measures will ultimately have
implications for the environment through
lower food prices, which will reduce
production and the associated negative
environmental impacts.

4

Environmental improvements
associated with reductions in food loss
and waste will be difficult to target
geographically when price signals are
transmitted along geographically
widespread supply chains.

CHAPTER 5
FOOD LOSS AND
WASTE AND
ENVIRONMENTAL
SUSTAINABILITY

When targeting land and water
impacts, which are concentrated in
primary production, policymakers must be
aware that their food loss and waste
reduction interventions are most effective
in the early stages of the supply chain and
in geographic proximity to the
environmental impact.

6

When targeting GHG emissions,
which accumulate throughout the entire
food supply chain, policymakers must be
aware that their food loss and waste
reduction interventions will be most
effective at the consumption and retail
stage, independently of the location of
the interventions.

CHAPTER 5

FOOD LOSS AND WASTE
AND ENVIRONMENTAL
SUSTAINABILITY
Reducing food loss and waste is enshrined
in SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and
production – specifically in Target 12.3, which
calls for the halving of food waste and reduction
of food losses by 2030. It is also connected
to the environmental dimension of the other
SDGs, including SDG 6 on water and sanitation
(Target 6.4 on the efficiency of water use),
SDG 13 on climate action (Target 13.2 on the
reduction of GHG emissions), SDG 14 on marine
resources (Target 14.2 on protecting marine and
coastal ecosystems) and SDG 15 on life on land
(Target 15.1 on the conser vation of ecosystems).
The inclusion of food loss and waste reduction
in the SDGs ref lects the fact that producing
food that is not eaten – whether lost in the field
or wasted on a plate – not only diminishes the
quantit y of food available, but also constitutes a
waste of economic and environmental resources.1

should be formulated taking into consideration
the location of the environmental damage and
the extent to which the damage is local or global.
Finally, the chapter looks at the cost-effectiveness
of food loss and waste reduction to improve
environmental sustainabilit y and discusses
possible trade-offs with other environmental
objectives. n

FOOD LOSS AND WASTE
REDUCTION AND
ENVIRONMENTAL
SUSTAINABILITY
Feeding the world population in an environmentally
sustainable manner will become increasingly
challenging over the coming decades. The global
demand for agricultural outputs is forecast to
increase by 35 –50 percent between 2012 and 2050
as a result of population and income growth. 2
Meeting this demand will further strain the
world’s natural resources and may cause
considerable environmental damage, including
climate change, land degradation, water scarcit y,
water pollution and loss of biodiversit y
(see Box 26). Against this background, food loss
and waste reduction is seen as a way to improve
the environmental sustainabilit y of the global
food system.

This chapter explores the available evidence
on the impact of food loss and waste on
environmental sustainabilit y and examines the
potential for achieving environmental objectives
through food loss and waste reduction. For this
purpose, it first analyses the potential impact
on the environment of food loss and waste
reduction and discusses the factors to be taken
into account in the formulation of reduction
inter ventions with an environmental purpose.
It then describes how food loss and waste
actually affects the environment, depending on
the stage in the supply chain where the losses
or waste occur, the t ype of food, and – in some
cases – the geographic location of the losses.
After discussing the potential of food loss and
waste reduction in achieving environmental
objectives, the chapter then reviews the role of
prices and the transmission of price changes in
determining the actual environmental impact
of reducing food loss and waste. It arg ues that

BOX 26

THE MOST COMMON ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT INDICATORS FOR FOOD LOSS AND WASTE
Food loss and waste have three generally
quantifiable types of environmental footprints:
GHG emissions (carbon footprint); pressure on land
resources (land footprint); and pressure on water
resources (water footprint). These footprints may in
turn affect biodiversity. 1

forests, which play an essential role in environmental
sustainability.10 Land use is therefore of critical
importance in terms of climate change, biodiversity
and ecosystem services.
As yet, there is no generally applicable method to
measure the entire land footprint of food production.
The present report calculates the land footprint of food
based on the surface of land needed to produce that
food. Under this definition, the primary production
stage accounts for nearly all land use, since other
phases of a food product’s life cycle, such as
processing, do not occupy substantial land surfaces.1
As in the case of carbon footprint, the land footprint of
food also largely depends on the type of food being
produced, as well as on the characteristics of the
production system.

Carbon footprint
The carbon footprint of food is the total amount of
GHG that is emitted throughout the food’s life cycle,
expressed in carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent.8
This amount includes all GHGs emitted during
production, transportation, processing, distribution
and consumption, as well as the emissions from
waste disposal. Indeed, in many countries, most of
the food that is lost or wasted is dumped untreated in
controlled or uncontrolled landfill, where it releases
GHGs. Some waste management systems, such as
anaerobic digestion, can actually generate energy
and thus provide indirect GHG savings.1 However,
waste management issues are beyond the scope of
this report.
In both developed and developing countries,
substantial GHG emissions occur during the primary
production phase; this is where agricultural inputs are
used, livestock is reared and soils are cultivated. GHG
emissions further accumulate as food completes its life
cycle, during processing, transportation, distribution,
preparation and disposal.9 For this reason, the carbon
footprint of food that is lost or wasted towards the end
of the supply chain may incorporate significantly larger
embedded levels of GHG emissions than food lost
earlier on in the chain. Note that the carbon footprint
of food losses or waste varies considerably from one
type of food to another,i while also depending heavily
on the characteristics of a country’s food production
system.1

Water footprint
From the irrigation of crops and watering of livestock
to aquaculture purposes, agriculture accounts for
about 70 percent of total global water withdrawals;ii
the remaining 30 percent is taken for industrial
production and domestic water supply.6
The water footprint of a food product is a measure
of all the freshwater used to produce and supply that
product to its final consumer, at all stages of the
supply chain.
The water footprint consists of three components
that capture different types of water:
 blue water: groundwater or surface water;
 green water: rain; and
 grey water: water used to dilute pollutant
concentrations to acceptable levels. 8
Studies of the water footprint of food typically focus
on the blue-water footprint, which depends on the
type of food, as well as the characteristics of the
production system.iii Similar to the land footprint, most
of the water used to produce and supply food is used
on farm, for irrigation purposes, even though the
processing of certain food products may also require
significant quantities of water.1, 11

Land footprint
Competition for land is projected to intensify in the
coming decades due to population growth, changes
in diets and consumption patterns, and a growing
demand for bioenergy. Most of the historic expansion
of agricultural areas has come at the expense of

other. When thinking about water availability,
for example, it may be difficult to foresee the
geographic location of the impacts of a reduction
of losses or waste. On the other hand, GHG
emissions linked to food that is lost or wasted
have worldwide repercussions independently of
where the loss or waste occurs. n

 Based on data from the 2011 FAO study,
another FAO study that was published in 2013 1
estimated that:
i. The global carbon footprint of food loss and
waste, excluding emissions from land use
change, is 3.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide
(CO 2) equivalent, corresponding to about
7 percent of total GHG emissions.
ii. The use of surface and groundwater
resources (blue water) attributable to
food lost or wasted is about 250 km 3 ,
representing around 6 percent of total water
withdrawals. 6
iii. Almost 1.4 billion hectares, equal to about
30 percent of the world’s agricultural land,
are used to produce food that is later lost or
wasted. 4

FOOD LOSS AND WASTE
REDUCTION AND THE
ENVIRONMENT –
KEY QUESTIONS AND
CONSIDERATIONS
As in the case of food security, the geographic
location and stage in the supply chain of the loss
or waste and of the intervention influence the
intervention’s impact in terms of environmental
sustainability. Interventions towards food loss and
waste reduction can therefore contribute towards
reaching the targets of SDG 6, SDG 13, SDG 14
and SDG 15 if formulated with due consideration
for the nature and location of the environmental
impact per type of food product and the location in
the supply chain of the loss or waste. In addition,
the costs and trade-offs associated with different
reduction interventions should be considered.

 Springmann et al. examine ways to ensure
the environmental sustainabilit y of food
production until 2050. 7 Food loss and waste
reduction is one of the options considered. 4, 5
Based on loss and waste percentages reported
in the 2011 FAO study, Springmann et al.
estimate that halving food loss and waste from
2010 to 2050 would reduce environmental
pressures linked to agriculture by
6 –16 percent, depending on the environmental
dimension (GHG emissions, cropland use,
blue-water use, nitrogen and phosphorus
application), relative to the projected values
for 2050. The report arg ues that food loss
and waste reduction has a role to play as
part of a broader package of inter ventions
towards environmental sustainabilit y,
together with, for example, dietar y change and
technological improvements.

The following questions are essential to formulate
suitable inter ventions towards food loss and
waste reduction for environmental purposes:
 What is the environmental objective?
The objective is important since the carbon,
land and water footprints are affected
differently by food loss or waste depending
on the food product, how it is produced,
and the stage in the food supply chain
where loss or waste occurs. The land and
water footprints of food are concentrated
at the primar y production stage, although
sig nificant amounts of water may also be
used during processing, whereas GHG
emissions may occur and accumulate along
the entire supply chain. GHG emissions
per unit of food lost or wasted are therefore
higher towards the retail and consumption
stages of the chain.

Estimates such as these suggest that food
loss and waste reduction has the potential to
improve the environmental sustainability of
food systems significantly. However, aggregate
estimates do not provide any indication as to
which loss or waste reduction measures are
most effective in environmental terms, nor
do they disting uish between context-specific
impacts of food loss or waste on the one hand,
and broader, or even global, impacts on the
| 92 |

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2019

 To what extent do different food products
contribute to food loss and waste, and
what is their environmental footprint?
The answer to this question may var y
significantly across countries and reg ions due
to differences in production, supply systems
and socio-economic conditions. It will also
depend on the env ironmental dimension under
rev iew. For example, while cereals and pulses
may require significant amounts of water, the
same may not be the case for land.

reducing food losses or waste at specific points
in the food supply chain also depends on the
costs. A related question is: Are there any
trade-offs between different environmental
objectives? Reducing one t y pe of footprint
may lead to another t ype becoming larger.
For example, improving packaging can reduce
food loss and waste and its associated
environmental impacts on land use, water use
and GHG emissions; however, packaging also
involves GHG emissions and an increase in
the use of plastics. Designing solutions that
minimize these trade-offs will be key in any
strateg y to reduce food loss and waste. n

the greater the potential to reduce them. 4

QUANTIFYING THE
ENVIRONMENTAL
IMPACTS OF FOOD
LOSS AND WASTE

 What is the objective of the measure:
improve resource use efficiency or reduce
the overall amount of resources used?
The reduction of food losses or waste improves
resource use efficiency and allows more food to
reach consumers while using the same amount
of resources. Food loss or waste reduction may
help meet the world’s growing demand for food
in a sustainable manner. However, improved
resource use efficiency does not necessarily
mean that fewer resources are used, or fewer
GHGs emitted; these impacts depend on how
the reduction in losses or waste influences food
prices and thus the demand and supply of food.

This section discusses empirical evidence
related to the first three questions raised in the
previous section. It attempts to quantif y the
environmental impacts of food loss and waste
for various food products and regions, as well as
for the different stages of the food supply chain.
By doing so, the section demonstrates that the
environmental effectiveness of an inter vention
aimed at reducing food loss or waste depends
on the food product, as well as on the location –
geographically and along the food supply chain
– of the environmental damage.

 Will the environmental impact of a reduction
in food losses or waste be traceable back to
a particular geographic location or will it be
more diffuse? In practice, it may be difficult to
foresee the geographic location of the impacts of
a reduction of losses or waste on land or water
use. The environmental impact is indirect and
depends on how food loss and waste reduction
measures affect food prices and, through prices,
the use of land or water for food production
in different locations. GHG emissions have
global ramifications, irrespective of where they
occur, so the geographic location of reduction
interventions is therefore irrelevant.

The environmental footprints of food loss and
waste across food products and regions
Policymakers interested in reducing the
environmental impact of food loss and waste
should first consider which environmental
dimension to target (carbon, land or water) and
which food products contribute most to that
dimension’s footprint when lost or wasted.
Figure 13 provides estimates of the relative
contribution of the main food groups to overall
global food loss and waste in terms of quantities
(first bar on the left), as well as to the associated
carbon, blue-water and land footprints (second,

Note: The environmental footprints are calculated by multiplying the amount of food lost and wasted by its environmental impact factors. The carbon, blue-water and land impact
factors were taken from FAO (2013), which provides environmental impact factors for different products, regions and supply chain stages.1 For a breakdown of the impact factors by
region and food group, see Tables A7–A9 in the Statistical Annex. The carbon impact factor expresses tonnes of CO2 equivalent emitted, the land impact factor indicates hectares of land
used, and the blue-water impact factor indicates cubic metres of water used, all per tonne of food lost or wasted. The stacked bars present the relative contribution of a food group to
total food loss and waste and to each of the environmental footprints of food loss or waste. The estimations of food loss and waste differ from the ones presented in Figure 4 with
respect to the inclusion of the retail level, the share of food loss and waste being measured in terms of quantity (rather than economic value), and the use of loss and waste data for only
those commodities for which an impact factor was available. Thus, food products that do not belong to any of the groups included in the figure (e.g. coffee beans) are excluded from the
graph due to the lack of data for impact factors, despite contributing around 20 percent to food loss and waste. These data refer to 2015.

The estimates include loss and waste from

and animal products to overall food loss and
waste is limited; however, their contribution to
the land footprint of food loss and waste is not.
Indeed, meat and animal products account for
over 60 percent of the total land footprint (last bar
on the right). This percentage reflects the fact that
livestock production requires substantial amounts
of agricultural land to produce animal feed or for
grazing.1 Any interventions that aim to reduce
the land footprint of food losses or waste should
therefore focus on this product group.
If the aim of an inter vention is to address
water scarcit y, then cereals and pulses should
be targeted as a product group, followed by
fruits and vegetables. Together, these two
categories account for nearly 90 percent of the
water footprint of total food loss and waste.
This percentage ref lects the fact that a significant

share of irrigation water is used to produce these
crops, especially wheat, rice and maize.15

Meat and animal products from systems that use
feed produced on irrigated fields may well have a
larger water footprint than other food groups. 8

The livestock sector contributes relatively little
to the blue-water footprint associated with food
loss and waste. This may be explained by the fact
that the data on loss and waste focus mostly on
milk and eggs and less on meat and other animal
products, which may have a larger blue-water
footprint.14 Global average blue-water footprints
are estimated at 86 m 3 per tonne of milk, 244 m 3
per tonne of eggs and over 500 m 3 per tonne of beef
or sheep meat.13 Another explanation is that the
average blue-water footprint of meat and animal
products incorporates the footprint of livestock
systems that do not use irrigated feed grains.

The relative contribution of meat and animal
products to total GHG emissions associated with
food loss and waste is limited, due to the limited
share of these products in total food loss and
waste, but the carbon footprint per tonne of meat
and animal products is the largest of all food
groups, with the exception of cereals and pulses.
Indeed, emissions of methane by ruminants such
as cattle, sheep and goats account for the bulk of
agricultural GHG emissions in CO 2 equivalent,
followed by emissions from feed production and
manure management.

SOURCE: FAO, 20131

The environmental footprint of a given food
product varies across regions and countries,
inter alia, due to differences in crop yields
(see Figure 14). This is particularly true for water
and land footprints. Central and Southern
Asia, for example, are the largest contributors
to overall food loss and waste and account
for over half the global blue-water footprint
of food loss and waste. Latin America and
the Caribbean, on the other hand, despite
representing more than 20 percent of total
food loss and waste, account for only 9 percent
of the blue-water footprint. These outcomes
are in line with the results of a 2013 FAO
study on the footprint of food wastage, which
identified cereals, especially wheat and rice,
as the main contributors to the blue-water
footprint of food loss and waste in Asia
(see Figure 15 for key findings).1

Averages mask the fact that the same food product
can have different blue-water footprints depending
on the type of production system, which varies
across geographic locations. A crop grown using
irrigation has a larger blue-water footprint than
the same crop grown under a rainfed system.
Thus, geographic location is an important
consideration when targeting interventions aimed
at reducing the blue-water footprint.

The environmental footprints of food loss and
waste at different stages in the supply chain
The environmental effectiveness of inter ventions
to reduce food losses or waste depends not only
on the t y pe of food product and the geographic
location, but also on where along the supply
chain food is lost or wasted.
| 96 |

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2019

In fact, even though all stages of the food supply
chain offer scope to mitigate the environmental
impacts of food loss and waste, the extent of this
scope at the various stages of the supply chain
varies according to a country’s level of economic
development and the environmental dimension
targeted. In industrialized countries, as most food
is wasted towards the end of the food supply chain,
targeting consumer waste may bring about the
largest reductions in food loss and waste and the
environmental damage it causes. In developing
countries, reduction measures that target on-farm
losses may be most effective in reducing the
environmental footprints of food loss and waste.

the use of land or water, inter ventions closer to
the primar y production stage may prove most
effective, as subsequent stages will add little to
the environmental damage.
Contrar y to GHG emissions, environmental
problems caused by the unsustainable use of
land or water are mostly specific to a geographic
location. This is another reason why it is often
advisable to inter vene in, or close to, the primar y
production stage to remedy these problems.
Inter ventions further along the supply chain may
be less effective in remedying a location-specific
environmental problem, as not all products
targeted originate from the problem area. In other
words, measures towards food loss or waste
reduction will improve the countr y wide average
blue-water and land use efficiency no matter
where they are implemented. However, improving
resource use efficiency where it matters most
requires an understanding of the extent to which
land and water footprints are determined by
geographic location, as well as the location in the
supply chain of food losses or waste.

Inter ventions that aim at that stage in the supply
chain where most food is lost or wasted are not
necessarily the most effective in mitigating the
environmental impacts of food loss and waste.
The following paragraphs demonstrate that
inter ventions should also consider the stage in
the supply chain where environmental footprints
are largest.
For instance, the carbon footprint of food loss
and waste follows a pattern throughout the
various stages of the food supply chain quite
different from that of land or water footprints.
Hence, the location of reduction measures that
aim to reduce the carbon footprint should not, in
principle, be the same as those aiming to reduce
water scarcit y or land degradation. Indeed, GHG
emissions embedded in a food product tend
to increase as the product moves along the
supply chain and the accumulated contribution
of each stage in the chain is larger than the
preceding stage. This implies that a unit of food
lost or wasted at the wholesale or retail stages
has a larger carbon footprint than a unit lost
on farm, especially in high-income countries.
The accumulation is much less pronounced
for land and blue-water footprints, where the
bulk of the environmental impact occurs in the
agricultural production phase.

Box 27 illustrates the variabilit y of impact factors
for each environmental footprint by focusing on
a single product, maize, in four different regions.
Data aggregation across commodities, countries
and regions blurs some of the specificities of
footprints for particular products or geographic
locations along the supply chain, such as the
cumulative effect of the carbon footprint. But
looking at a single product provides more
detailed insight into these specificities. n

It follows that if the main objective of measures
towards food loss and waste reduction is to
reduce GHG emissions, the greatest impact
per unit of food loss or waste avoided is at the
consumption stage, where products incorporate
all GHG emissions of the previous stages. If, on
the other hand, the main objective is to reduce

So far, the chapter has discussed the potential for

of food loss and waste based on the magnitude
of food loss and waste and its environmental

THE CASE OF MAIZE

The figures in this box present the carbon, water and
land impact factors for maize in Europe, Western
Africa, South-eastern Asia and South America.
GHG emissions clearly accumulate as maize moves
along the food supply chain (Figure A). Consequently,
the consumption stage has the largest carbon footprint.
Here all the emissions throughout the supply chain
are embedded in the product. The land and water
footprints of losses or waste of maize are the same at
all stages in the supply chain, assuming that land and
blue water (Figures B and C) are used solely during
the primary production phase.

The figures below show that both GHG emissions
and natural resources used for maize production differ
from one region to the other. The production of a tonne
of maize causes more GHG emissions in South-eastern
Asia and South America than in other regions. It
requires most land in Western Africa, especially in
comparison to Europe, where land use efficiency
appears to be highest. However, maize production in
Europe is much more water-intensive than in the other
regions, most likely because of the more widespread
use of irrigation in Europe.

the reduction in food loss and waste and how
suppliers and consumers react to those price
changes. In theor y, a decrease in the amount of
food lost by producers or suppliers will boost
the supply of food. Similarly, a decrease in food
wasted by consumers will dampen the demand
for food. In both cases, since more food is
available, food prices fall. This reduction in prices
is transmitted through the food supply chain.

across geographic locations. Assuming that
individual producers cannot inf luence prices,
the fall in prices will incite producers to reduce
their output, ultimately leading to reduced use
of natural resources and lower GHG emissions.
However, there may be counterbalancing
second-round effects if the reduced food prices
lead to an increase in demand. This, in turn,
would lead to higher food prices and a renewed
increase in supply and natural resource use.
This may counterbalance, at least in part, the
initial impact. The exact outcome will be an
empirical question.

To the extent that markets are closely integrated
and interdependent, the price changes will
also be transmitted to a greater or lesser extent
| 99 |

CHAPTER 5 FOOD LOSS AND WASTE AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

In contrast, in situations where the adoption of loss
reduction measures are the result of regulation,
the increased costs associated with reducing
food loss and waste may have a limiting effect on
supply in combination with an increase in prices.
As production declines, natural resources will be
conserved and fewer GHGs emitted.

Operators located well after the primar y
production stage may still produce considerable
GHG emissions. A reduction in food losses at an
early stage of the supply chain that lowers the
costs of inputs for those operators may induce
them to expand their output, and as more food
moves throughout the supply chain, the eventual
result would be increased GHG emissions.

The following section will look more carefully at
the role of price changes and their transmission,
which has important implications in terms of where
to intervene to reduce food loss and waste based on
environmental objectives. The first part looks at
price transmission along the food supply chain,
while the second part focuses on transmission
across geographic areas. The third part presents
empirical evidence. It emerges that the environmental
effectiveness of an intervention to reduce food loss
or waste depends on the location of the environmental
damage geographically and along the supply chain,
as well as on the impact of the reduction on the
prices of inputs and outputs.

This is illustrated in Figure 16. Here, food incorporates
the accumulated emissions of all the preceding
stages of the supply chain, meaning that a unit of
avoided food loss or waste has the strongest impact
on GHG emissions at the retail and consumption
stages. Therefore, reduction measures aimed at
reducing the carbon footprint of food loss and
waste should intervene at the later stages.

Price transmission and the geographic location
of environmental damage
In the previous part it was pointed out how
price changes associated with a reduction in
food loss and waste are transmitted throughout
the supply chain to reach the operators causing
the environmental damage, and how this
determines the environmental outcome of the
reduction. A similar reasoning can be applied
with respect to the geographic location where the
environmental damage occurs.

Price transmission and the location of
environmental damage along the food
supply chain
A reduction in food losses or waste at a particular
location in the supply chain affects prices both
upstream and downstream from that location,
assuming the reduction is large enough to have
an impact on prices. How those price changes are
transmitted throughout the supply chain to reach
the operators causing the damage determines the
environmental outcome of the reduction.

In fact, if the reduction of food loss and waste
occurs close to the location of the environmental
damage, the resulting change in prices is
likely to be transmitted more strongly to those
causing the damage; hence, it will be more
effective at inducing those actors to adjust their
output and thus resource use. To illustrate, if
the environmental objective being pursued is
water-scarcity reduction, decreasing food losses in
water-scarce areas near or at primary production,
where the bulk of water resources are used,
may prove the most effective. Indeed, farmers
using those same water resources would feel the
resulting fall in prices more strongly, therefore
discouraging production and resource use.

The bulk of the land and blue-water footprint of
food losses or waste originates in the primar y
production stage (see Box 27). Therefore, a
reduction in food losses or waste that depresses
farmgate prices and thereby induces producers to
scale back their production – and thus their use of
natural resources – will lead to an environmental
improvement, irrespective of the location along
the supply chain of the losses or waste.
Contrar y to the land and blue-water footprints,
which originate above all in the primar y
production stage, the carbon footprint of food
losses or waste grows incrementally as
food progresses along the supply chain.

If, instead, interventions occur further away from
those actors, price effects must ripple through
the supply chain to reach them but may be
weakened by the time they do so, lowering the

incentive for output and resource use adjustment.
While they can impact on natural resource use
across a system, they may well fail to target
specific critical areas. This is important for
environmental harm that is highly localized,
as is often the case for land and water stresses.
To build on the previous example, if reduction
measures occur instead at the wholesale level,
policymakers risk not reducing water scarcity
in water-scarce regions, as food products may
derive from many geographically dispersed
farmers who do not necessarily suffer from water
scarcity. Hence, by the time prices are transmitted
to farms in water-scarce regions, the diluted

price effect may not be strong enough to induce
farmers to adjust production and resource use.
Price transmission is likely to be stronger between
suppliers who are directly linked, as opposed to
indirectly through other agents.
How changes in prices resulting from a reduction
in food losses or waste are transmitted along the
supply chain also depends on the geographic
spread of that chain. In a geographically
concentrated supply chain, a loss or waste
reduction targeting a local environmental
problem is likely to “hit” its target as price
changes are transmitted clearly and directly
| 101 |

CHAPTER 5 FOOD LOSS AND WASTE AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

between suppliers and consumers. In supply
chains with a wide geographic spread, food at the
consumption stage may be sourced from many
different locations, including other countries.
Here, reductions in consumer waste are unable
to target location-specific environmental
damage; this must be done through reduction
inter ventions close to the location of the damage,
geographically and in the supply chain. q

confirms that interventions early on in the
supply chain may reduce land stress, while GHG
emissions should be addressed further down the
chain. Although the modelling framework does
not account for income or population growth, its
results are nevertheless very relevant in light of
the growing demand for agricultural products
expected over the coming decades.16
Alongside the issue of where in the supply chain
reductions in food loss occur, further complexit y
is added when considering interactions between
different parts of the food system, as well as
with other sectors. In this respect, another study
finds that reducing assumed food losses from
20 percent of production to 5 percent would
decrease agricultural prices by about 4 percent,
which in turn would boost the production of meat
and biofuels benefiting from lower agricultural
input prices. Overall, the reduction in loss and
waste would cut the use of agricultural land by
4.5 percent, reducing the increase in GHG
emissions over the 2000 –2020 period from an
estimated 25 percent under a business-as-usual
scenario to less than 8 percent. However, the
study does not assess the feasibilit y of specific
measures for food loss or waste reduction, nor
does it outline how those measures could be
implemented in practice.16 n

The dilution of the price effects of loss or waste
reductions – for example, from waste reduction by
consumers back to the farmer – may not be an issue
for non-location-specific environmental damage,
such as GHG emissions. Here, a small drop in
production by a large number of farmers following
a diluted price signal will help mitigate climate
change. In other words, the geographic location of
interventions to reduce food losses or waste does
not matter for policymakers aiming to reduce GHG
emissions, which are a global concern.
In conclusion, while irrelevant for GHG emission
reductions, location is important for interventions
aimed at alleviating localized environmental harm,
for instance to land or water resources. However, in
these cases, it may well be advisable to address
location-specific environmental stresses through
measures targeted directly at those stresses, rather
than by reducing food loss or waste.

Empirical evidence on the effects of price
transmission across sectors and regions
The impact through prices of a reduction in
food losses or waste on food demand and supply
depends on how the price changes affect actors
within and across markets and countries. Box 28
illustrates the complexities of these effects, based
on the results of an economy-wide modelling
framework. It shows how a global 25 percent
reduction in food losses at the primary production
and processing stages reduces the use of land but
fails to bring about any significant reduction in
GHG emissions at the global level. This result

The environmental sustainabilit y of the global
food system is put at risk by the increasing
demand for food from a growing world
population, as well as by dietar y changes
associated with rising incomes. Against this

q In certain cases, such as pollution of large watersheds, water issues
can no longer be considered “local”. For example, agricultural runoff
into the Mississippi River causes eutrophication in the Gulf of Mexico.
Given the scale of the Mississippi River Basin, even an untargeted
campaign towards food loss or waste reduction may mitigate this
damage.

BOX 28

THE IMPACTS OF A 25 PERCENT REDUCTION IN GLOBAL FOOD LOSSES ON AGRICULTURAL LAND USE
AND GHG EMISSIONS
The effect of a reduction in food losses or waste on
land and water use and GHG emissions is determined
by how the price changes caused by that reduction
are transmitted throughout the supply chain and the
wider economic system.
Wageningen University and Research used a
global, economy-wide model known as MAGNET to
simulate a 25 percent reduction in losses at the primary
production and processing stages based on FAO’s most
recent food loss estimates (see also Box 25).i
This reduction in losses can be represented as
changes in productivity that increase global production
by 4.3 percent, of which 2 percent is at the primary
production stage and 2.3 percent at the processing
stage. The impacts of the reduction on agricultural land
use and GHG emissions are summarized in the table in
this box.
The study shows that a 25 percent loss reduction at
the primary production and processing stages has a

very limited effect on global GHG emissions
(-0.07 percent). Two separate phenomena may
explain this result. First, GHG emissions
accumulate as food moves along the supply chain.
A loss reduction early in the chain means that more
food reaches the retail level, which boosts
aggregate GHG emissions. A reduction in
consumer food waste comparable to the reduction
in losses earlier in the supply chain, as simulated in
the model, can be expected to have a greater
impact on GHG emissions. Second, a reduction in
losses may result in the reallocation of resources to
other sectors. If these sectors emit more GHGs than
the one where the food loss is avoided, overall
GHG emissions may rise.
Both processes are at the root of increases in
GHG emissions in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin
America and the Caribbean resulting from the
simulation. These occur in spite of decreased

resource use intensity per unit of food reaching the
consumer. Regions showing a significant economic
expansion following the loss reduction are more likely to
experience a net increase in GHG emissions (e.g. subSaharan Africa). Changes in GHG emissions that result
from the shifting of resources between sectors are
typically beyond the scope of any policies that target the
food system and are difficult to predict.
The reduction in food losses in one country may
affect GHG emissions in another. A reduction in losses
overseas may make imported foods cheaper, resulting
in a substitution away from domestically produced
foods, thereby causing a drop in domestic GHG
emissions.
The model predicts a decrease of nearly
0.7 percent in agricultural land use following a
25 percent reduction in food losses at the primary
production and processing stages. While still limited,
this impact is considerably larger than for GHG
emissions and may serve to counterbalance the
projected increase in the demand for agricultural land
associated with growing food requirements over the
coming decades. The background paper of the study
demonstrates that interventions close to the primary
production stage are more effective at reducing the
demand for agricultural land than interventions at the
processing stage, due to the stronger transmission of
price changes between directly linked producers and
buyers (not shown in the table).
According to the model, both domestic and
foreign loss reductions decrease the use of
agricultural land in all regions, except for Oceania,
where domestic food loss reductions result in a slight
increase in land use. Foreign loss reductions tend to
have a stronger limiting impact on land use; only in
Central and Southern Asia and in Eastern and
South-eastern Asia is the effect of domestic reductions
stronger. The significant impact of foreign food loss
reductions on land use is explained by the
substitution of imports for domestically produced food
(see also “availability” in the table in Box 25), which

reduces the pressure on domestic land. Domestic loss
reductions, on the other hand, may have the opposite
effect on the use of land. Indeed, improved
productivity following a loss reduction makes
domestic foods more competitive relative to imported
foods, which may provide a boost to domestic
production. The resulting increase in land use works
against the initial limiting effect on land use of
domestic food loss reductions; in some cases, the net
result may be a heavier land footprint. The policy
implication is that reducing food loss in one region is
more likely to have an effect on demand for
agricultural land outside of that region than inside it.
There are a number of caveats to the interpretation
of the simulation results for policy purposes. First, the
model assumes that loss reductions are the result of the
voluntary adoption of measures that lower production
costs and thus boost profits. However, some loss
reduction measures may cause production costs to
increase, for example in the case of taxes or bans
imposed by law. This negatively affects the
competitiveness of domestically produced food,
reducing GHG emissions and domestic land use, but
may increase environmental damage in other regions.
Second, the results of the simulation depend on the
degree to which price changes are transmitted across
regions. This transmission determines whether loss
reductions have an impact on GHG emissions and land
use in locations far from those where the reductions
take place. The degree to which price changes are
transmitted across regions depends on the type of food
product, the structure of the supply chain that brings the
product to consumers and whether the product is
traded between regions. How price changes will be
transmitted across regions is not straightforward to
predict. The results of the model as to the domestic
effects of loss reductions are therefore more robust than
those that concern the effects of foreign loss reductions.
For this reason, the model’s results as to domestic
effects on the one hand, and foreign effects on the
other, are presented separately in the table.

FAO’s Statistics Division provided food loss estimates by food group, country group and supply chain stage. In the simulation, food loss reductions vary across food products, regions
and supply chain stages. However, due to differences between FAO’s food loss estimation methodology and the structure of MAGNET, the supply chain stages included in the simulation
are limited to primary production and processing stages; the simulation does not cover other supply chain stages, such as storage, transportation, wholesale and retail.

WATER USE IN THE PRODUCTION OF MANGOES IN AUSTRALIA – TARGETING RESOURCE
USE EFFICIENCY VERSUS ACTUAL WATER USE
A study of the use of water to produce mangoes
in Australia analyses the environmental impacts of
three possible interventions for water saving.21 Of
these, reducing loss and waste is found to be the
most effective in terms of resource use efficiency.
Halving wastage at the distribution and consumption
stages would cut the water footprint of 1 kg of
fresh mango from 87 to 57 litres, a reduction
of 34 percent. A reduction of 40 percent of the
water used to irrigate half of Australia’s mango
orchards would reduce the water footprint of each

kilogram of fruit by 18 percent. An expansion of
mango production in water-abundant regions by
20 percent would reduce the average water footprint
of 1 kg of fruit by 11 percent. This is an interesting
case, showing the difference between resource
use efficiency and actual use. Reducing waste
guarantees more efficient use of resources but not
necessarily a comparable reduction in use, while
reducing irrigation acts directly on the amount of
irrigated water used but at a smaller gain in resource
use efficiency.

moderate and strong technological progress
in agriculture; widespread adoption of more

of these inter ventions, implemented moderately
and intensely. The inter ventions are different
in nature. Even in this case, they could be
comparable if there was a sense of the costs of
implementing them, but this information is not

practical terms, they can provide a sense of the
order of magnitude of the environmental effect
of inter ventions that seem within reach in the

use efficiency, food loss and waste reduction can
help boost food supplies without aggravating
the damage inf licted on the environment, even
if overall resource use (or GHG emissions) and
environmental impacts are not reduced (see Box 29
for an example).

The environmental impacts of food loss and
waste reduction as compared to those of other
interventions towards sustainability
The available evidence suggests that while
food loss and waste reduction can contribute
towards environmental sustainabilit y, it must
be complemented by other inter ventions to
significantly alleviate the damage inf licted by the
food system on the environment. Among these
other possible inter ventions are improving
agriculture technolog y or promoting dietar y
change.18

The study finds that of the single inter ventions
analysed, improved technolog y is the most
effective inter vention towards reducing cropland,
blue-water and fertilizer use. A reduction in
food loss and waste by 50 or 75 percent is the
second most effective inter vention in this
respect, cutting cropland use by 14–21 percent,
blue-water use by 13 –19 percent, nitrogen by
16 –24 percent and phosphorus by 15 –23 percent.
Dietar y change is found to be least effective in
terms of cropland, blue-water and fertilizer use.
In terms of the impact on climate change, food

Springmann et al. estimate the impacts of a range
of possible inter ventions aimed at reducing the
environmental footprint of the global agrifood
system. 7, 19 The study delineates baseline
trajectories for GHG emissions, cropland and
blue-water use and the application of nitrogen
and phosphorus in the global food system until

CHAPTER 5 FOOD LOSS AND WASTE AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

loss and waste reduction is the least effective at
reducing GHG emissions, resulting in a reduction
of 6 –9 percent by 2050. Dietar y change brings
about a reduction of 29–52 percent in global GHG
emissions, making it the most effective measure.

Ensuring the availabilit y of safe, qualit y food
around the world, especially in the face of
climate change, requires adequate cold chain
facilities. 22 In 2009, the International Institute
of Refrigeration estimated that if developing
countries acquired the same cold chain capacities
as those in developed countries, over 200 million
tonnes of food would be saved annually.
According to the same study, this corresponds
to roughly 14 percent of consumption in these
countries. 23

Note that the simulations in Springmann et al.,
aside from not factoring in the costs associated
with the inter ventions, do not consider the
institutional and organizational changes
necessar y to formulate and implement them.
Indeed, the barriers to adopting certain
changes may be considerable, e.g. in the case
of technologies and practices to mitigate and
adapt to the effects of climate change. 20 On
the other hand, reducing food loss and waste
has one possible advantage over other options
for reaching environmental objectives such
as technological change or dietar y change:
it can save people money. Institutional and
organizational aspects are facilitated when there
is a private motivation for reducing loss and
waste, both for businesses that save on inputs and
for consumers saving money by avoiding wastage.

Improving the energ y use efficiency of cold chain
technologies may help reduce GHG emissions
from refrigeration. An example is the replacement
of current refrigerators, including those in homes,
with greener alternatives. r Box 30 illustrates how
implementing clean-energ y technologies may
help save food, while at the same time reducing
GHG emissions.
Adequate packaging may prevent food losses
or waste by protecting and extending the shelf
life of food products. The use of reusable plastic
crates instead of wooden crates or bamboo
baskets for transporting fruits and vegetables in
the Philippines, for example, was found to reduce
losses at low cost. 27

All in all, food loss and waste reduction will not
resolve all environmental problems associated
with food production and must be complemented
by other improvements, such as technological
progress and dietar y change, to ensure the
environmental sustainabilit y of the food
system. While assessments at the global level
provide an indication of the order of magnitude
of the impacts of these improvements, more
detailed information is needed to identif y the
most effective and cost-effective measures.
Gathering such detailed information will
constitute a major challenge for researchers in
coming years.

While packaging may help avoid losses or waste,
its production generates GHG emissions.
The packaging itself also becomes waste at
the end of its life cycle unless recycled. 28
Packaging accounted for 36 percent of the total
400 million tonnes of plastic produced in 2015
and 47 percent of the total 300 million tonnes
of primar y plastic waste. 29 It is estimated that
40 percent of all packaging material, plastic and
other, produced in 2007 (as measured in USD)
was to package food. 30

Trade-offs between the environmental impacts
of food loss and waste reduction

Packaging is increasingly blamed for having
one of the highest environmental footprints in
the food system. However, assessments of its

While the reduction in food losses or waste is by
and large beneficial for the environment, certain
reduction measures may add to environmental
stresses. Improvements in cold storage facilities
aimed at loss or waste reduction, for example,
may increase the use of energ y in the food system
and thus GHG emissions. 22

r Household refrigerators are often overlooked as part of the cold
chain, even though it is estimated that there are 1 billion domestic
refrigerators worldwide. Most of these are in industrialized countries,
although their use in developing countries is rising steadily.22, 24
Estimates suggest that domestic refrigeration represents around
6 percent of the total emissions of GHGs from refrigeration.
Commercial, industrial and transport refrigeration accounts for the
remaining 94 percent.25

FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF CLEAN-ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES IN THE MILK SUPPLY CHAIN

Milk spoils quickly if it is not chilled, yet many
rural areas lack adequate cold storage facilities.
Off-grid cooling technologies may help prevent milk
losses without adding to GHG emissions. A recent
FAO study analysed the financial and economic
benefits of milk-cooling systems powered by biogas
or solar energy in Kenya, Tunisiai and the United
Republic of Tanzania.
In Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania, the
adoption of a biogas-powered domestic milk chiller
requires an upfront investment of USD 1 600 but
brings direct private benefits in the form of better
quality milk and increased sales for farmers. Dairy
farmers in Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania
can earn an additional USD 1.96 and USD 2.17 per
day, respectively, by chilling the evening milk. At the
same time, using a biogas milk chiller generates an
additional annual value of USD 531 and USD 128
throughout the supply chain in Kenya and the United
Republic of Tanzania, respectively. The introduction of
chillers also creates jobs for skilled workers and
improves health by reducing indoor air pollution from
the use of conventional solid fuels, such as fuelwood
and charcoal. In terms of environmental impacts, each
chiller is estimated to make an annual reduction of

1.68 tonnes of CO2 equivalent in GHG emissions by
replacing solid biomass fuels. However, since the
biogas used to run the milk cooler is produced by
means of a digester, and each digester system requires
between 50 and 100 litres of water per day to mix the
manure, around 25 000 litres of additional water are
required per year.
Solar coolers are an alternative to biogas-powered
systems and are particularly suitable for sunny regions.
In Kenya, for farmers who already have a system
powered by a diesel generator, the solar cooler brings
an additional USD 876 annually by cooling milk faster.
In Tunisia and the United Republic of Tanzania,
revenues increase by around USD 10 800 and
USD 8 400, respectively.ii A solar cooler also brings
economic benefits by generating employment and
additional revenues throughout the supply chain in all
three countries. By reducing milk loss, the technology
also has the capacity of saving around 1 million litres
and 3 million litres of water per year in the United
Republic of Tanzania and Tunisia, respectively.
However, this impact is negligible for Kenya.iii Despite
the overall environmental benefits, the required initial
investment of USD 40 000 presents a substantial
barrier to adoption.

For Tunisia, only the solar cooler intervention is mentioned, since the biogas domestic milk chiller was not analysed in the country.

Unlike Kenya, no diesel-powered system or other cooling facilities are assumed as benchmark.

environmental impact often overlook the benefits
that it brings in reducing food losses or waste. 31–33
To evaluate the total environmental burden of
food packaging adequately, the environmental
footprint of the losses or waste that are avoided
by using it, as well as the potential for recycling
the packaging, must be considered. The net
balance of environmental benefits and damage
varies between food products. Using packaging
to avoid losses of products with a heav y footprint
in production may bring more environmental
gains than not using packaging and facing a

higher level of losses. 31, 32, 34 Avoiding the loss
or waste of meat or dair y products – which have
a large GHG footprint – by using packaging,
for example, may result in a net cut in GHG
emissions. Box 31 discusses in greater detail the
trade-off between the environmental footprint
of food packaging on the one hand, and that
of food losses or waste avoided on the other.
Maximizing the environmental performance of
packaging, for example by optimizing formats or
using recyclable materials, is challenging but may
bring considerable environmental benefits. n

BOX 31

THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF PACKAGING TO REDUCE FOOD LOSS AND WASTE

Food packaging can help avoid food loss and
waste and thus lessen the environmental burden;
however, the production and disposal of packaging
also harms the environment. The outcome of the
trade-off depends on the environmental footprint of
the food product (which varies across types of food
and locations) as well as the packaging material
used.35 Glass, metal, plastic, paper, paperboard and
biodegradable polymers each have their advantages
and disadvantages.36 The food-to-packaging ratio
is defined as GHG emissions per kilogram of food
produced and processed, divided by the GHG
emissions associated with packaging 1 kg of that
food. An extensive literature review found the range of
the ratio to be from 0.06 to 700, depending on food
and packaging configurations.32 Generally speaking,

the higher this ratio, the larger the benefits in terms
of avoiding GHG emissions obtained by reducing
losses through packaging. While the study only looked
at the impact of the production and packaging of
food on GHG emissions, it demonstrates how the
resource intensity of food determines the environmental
performance of its packaging.
A sensible and practical approach to the reduction
of food loss and waste through packaging technologies
considers the environmental footprints associated with
different product categories. There are greater
environmental benefits from reduced food loss and
waste through packaging for categories of food with a
high environmental footprint (e.g. meat and dairy
products) than for those with a lower environmental
footprint (e.g. vegetables and cereals).

CONCLUSIONS

resource use and GHG emissions, through
changes in prices. How these changes are
transmitted, both within the supply chain and
across the wider economic system, determines
their impact on the environmental footprints of
food losses or waste.

Reducing food loss and waste can help meet
the future demand for food from a growing
and increasingly wealthy world population in
a sustainable manner. Achieving sustainabilit y
requires more efficient natural resource use and
reductions in the amount of GHGs emitted per
unit of food consumed. Reducing food loss and
waste can contribute towards this goal.

Overall, the theor y and case studies discussed
in this chapter provide indications as to where to
inter vene to reduce food losses or waste, along
the supply chain and geographically, depending
on the environmental objective pursued. To
address location-specific environmental stresses,
inter ventions aimed at reducing losses should
be implemented within the supply chain and
geographically as close as possible to the location
of the stresses. This will ensure that price signals
are transmitted strongly to the actors causing the
damage. Thus, inter ventions aimed at alleviating
pressures on land or water resources should be
undertaken at the primar y production stage,
where the bulk of the land and water footprint
of the food system is concentrated. As GHG
emissions accumulate when food products move
along the supply chain, inter ventions to reduce
the carbon footprint of food losses or waste

The linkages between food loss and waste and
the sustainabilit y of the food system are complex
and context-dependent; they need to be well
understood to formulate effective policies aimed
at addressing environmental concerns through
food loss or waste reduction. For example,
improving the resource use efficiency of food at
one stage in the supply chain may depress food
prices and thus boost demand at subsequent
stages; this can lead to an increase in overall
resource use.
Food loss and waste reduction affects production
and consumption decisions, and thus natural

should therefore target stages towards the end of
the chain. Since cuts in GHG emissions benefit
the environment irrespective of where they occur,
such inter ventions need not target a specific
geographic location.

lack of data on the costs and environmental
benefits of measures towards food loss and
waste reduction complicates any assessment
of the efficiency and effectiveness of reducing
food loss and waste as a means to improving
environmental sustainabilit y. Data gaps need
to be overcome if reducing food loss and waste
is to be widely adopted as part of a strateg y for
meeting the SDG targets relating to land, water
and climate change.

Other elements to be considered in formulating
inter ventions are the potential to reduce food
losses or waste at a particular location, the costs
associated with particular inter ventions and their
cost-effectiveness in comparison with alternative
strategies. It is generally advisable to complement
measures towards food loss and waste reduction
with other t ypes of inter ventions.

Finally, although not the focus of this chapter,
it is important to be aware that climate change
may lead to greater levels of post-harvest losses,
especially at the primary production stage. 37
Extreme weather events, such as droughts or
floods, can destroy crops and livestock and damage
infrastructure, while erratic rainfall may reduce
harvests, impair drying processes and promote the
development of moisture-reliant pathogens such as
mycotoxins. 38, 39 In addition, higher temperatures
and greater humidity are likely to favour the
spread of transboundary crop and animal pests
and diseases. Temperature increases can also
accelerate food spoilage, adding to concerns over
food safety. An increase in climate-induced food
losses may trigger an expansion in agricultural land
at the expense of forests – which hampers GHG
sequestration. n

Policymakers must take due account of the fact that
measures to reduce food losses or waste may also
have some negative impacts on the environment.
The use of packaging to protect and preserve food,
for example, may lead to increased levels of plastic
pollution. Similarly, refrigeration helps prevent food
losses or waste but also causes GHG emissions.
Taking a longer-term view, reducing food loss
and waste will always improve the efficiency of
natural resource use and GHG emissions per unit
of food consumed. The above considerations can
provide initial g uidance on where to focus efforts
in reducing food loss and waste. However, the

Key messages

1

Food loss and waste reduction can play
an important role in achieving the SDGs,
in particular those related to food security
and nutrition and environmental
sustainability. However, the linkages
between food loss and waste reduction
and these objectives are complex.

2

Public interventions – in terms of policies
and infrastructure investments – may
create an enabling environment that allows
private actors to invest in the reduction of
food losses or waste; such interventions
should be chosen in line with policymakers’
ultimate objective, whether related to
economic efficiency, food security and
nutrition, or environmental sustainability.

3

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a
global problem and any intervention that
reduces food losses or waste may help cut
them, irrespective of location in the world;
but interventions that target the final stages
of the supply chain are likely to have the
biggest impact.

4

Food loss or waste reduction measures
are likely to be most effective at
alleviating stresses on natural resources
such as land or water if implemented near
the location of these stresses, both
geographically and along the supply chain.

PRINCIPLES

5

To improve food security and nutrition,
reduction interventions must target
vulnerable populations. In countries where
food insecurity is highest, policymakers
should intervene early on in the supply
chain, where food security impacts are
likely to be strongest.

6

To ensure these reduction interventions
are effective, current data collection
methods need significant improvement to
allow monitoring and impact assessments.
Countries should share practical
experiences, for example as to the
identification of critical loss points as well
as the costs of monitoring efforts.

POLICYMAKING FOR FOOD
LOSS AND WASTE REDUCTION
– GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Earlier chapters of this report discussed the
motives of private actors for investing in
food loss or waste reduction (the business
case), as well as the rationale for public
inter vention. The arg ument has been made that
public inter ventions may be justified by the
economy-wide efficiency gains to be had from
loss or waste reduction (the economic case), as
well as its potential contribution to improved
food securit y and nutrition or environmental
sustainabilit y. This chapter discusses the t ypes
of public inter ventions that can reduce food
losses or waste, not as a goal in themselves
but rather as a means towards wider social or
environmental goals. The scarcit y of reliable data
as to how much and where food is lost or wasted,
and the lack of information regarding the costs
of reduction efforts, are a major obstacle to the
formulation of effective policies for loss or waste
reduction. The chapter therefore also presents a
possible road map for the collection of reliable,
comparable data worldwide. n

improved productivit y, job creation, and better
food securit y and nutrition and/or environmental
sustainabilit y. Innovative loss-reducing
technologies, for example, can significantly
improve the efficiency of production, as well as
environmental sustainabilit y.
Conversely, there are also situations where the
business case for reducing food loss and waste
may be weak, i.e. where suppliers and consumers
face constraints when deciding on levels of food
loss or waste that they consider optimal. 3, 4 For
example, though smallholders may benefit from
reductions in post-har vest losses, they often
lack the necessar y funds to bring about such
reductions. 5 Other prominent barriers include
lack of information, distance to markets, access
to social capital, weak tenure securit y and
exposure to risks and shocks. 4 These barriers
are often more severe for women than for men.
Moreover, even if private stakeholders, driven by
private profit motives, implement solutions that
indeed result in food loss and waste reduction,
the impact on levels of food loss and waste is
likely to be limited.

ENABLING PRIVATE
ACTORS TO REDUCE
FOOD LOSS AND WASTE

Given the potential for food loss and waste
reduction to boost economic growth and create
jobs, there may be a justification for public
interventions to eliminate these barriers and
encourage actors to further reduce losses or waste.
For example, providing consumers and suppliers
with information on options to reduce food losses
or waste has proven to be a cost-effective strateg y
for policymakers (see Boxes 18 and 32).

Actors in the food supply chain are primarily
driven by self-interest: producers aim to
maximize profits and consumers their well-being.
As rational decision makers, they reduce food
losses or waste as long as the benefits outweigh
the costs. Completely eliminating all food loss
and waste is unrealistic, as the costs would be
exorbitant.1

Public inter ventions that affect food prices can
also inf luence incentives for consumers and
producers to avoid food losses or waste, since
the higher the price of food, the greater the
financial incentive for suppliers or consumers to
avoid losses or waste. On the other hand, policy

Chapter 3 has arg ued there may be a business
case for private actors to reduce food losses or
waste. 2 While driven by financial motivations,
this may also contribute to wider societal goals:

FOOD WASTE REDUCTION CAMPAIGNS – CHINA, TURKEY, NORTH MACEDONIA AND DENMARK
An NGO in China launched the Clean Your Plate
campaign in 2013 to raise consumer awareness about
food waste. More than 750 restaurants in Beijing
participate in the campaign, which has also received
considerable public support. Restaurants serve smaller
dishes, encourage the use of doggy bags or offer
discounts and certificates to customers who do not leave
any food on their plate.8 The following year, the Chinese
Government took several steps towards food loss and
waste reduction, issuing a circular on “Practising strict
economy and fighting against waste”. Evidence of the
impact is unclear.
Turkey launched a campaign to reduce bread waste
in 2013 to raise public awareness about waste, avoid
losses throughout the supply chain and promote
consumption of whole wheat bread. Despite the fact
that any efforts in the campaign are voluntary, it has
resulted in fewer loaves being wasted daily, down from
5.9 million in 2012 to 4.9 million in 2013. By
encouraging consumers to purchase only the bread
they can actually eat, the campaign resulted in a drop
in bread purchases of 10 percent and consumers saved
a total of USD 1.1 billion in 2013.9, 10
Since 2017, a North Macedonian civic-led network
set up in 2011 to reduce national organic and nonorganic waste, has focused on food waste.11 Initiatives
include a web platform that allows businesses from
farmers to food service providers to post food
donations online and civil society organizations to
claim these donations for redistribution. The

organization further advocates legislative changes on
broadening food surplus donation regulations,
including tax benefits for food donors.12 Another
initiative is a pilot learning programme about food
waste targeting secondary school students, the Food
Waste Experiential Program.13
Denmark provides an interesting example of the
impact that awareness raising can have on food loss
and waste. The country reduced food waste by
25 percent between 2010 and 2015 through a number
of initiatives, including educating consumers and
supermarkets offering discounts on food near its
expiration date or with superficial flaws.14 Leading this
movement is the Stop Wasting Food campaign,
supported by both the private and the public sector.14, 15
As part of the initiative, consumers received tips on
how to best plan food purchasing and prepare meals.
It also stimulated innovation among food manufacturers
and retailers, for example in packaging design and
portion sizing. Because they wasted less food,
consumers saved money and a number of price-related
initiatives meant that food prices decreased too.16, 17
Local authorities responsible for waste disposal
benefited from lower waste disposal costs: primarily
incineration, as most food waste in Denmark is
incinerated.15 Besides improving their reputation for
social and environmental stewardship, participating
businesses also increased sales – through being able to
sell products that would otherwise be thrown away –
and decreased their costs (e.g. disposal).17

food prices artificially low (e.g. through food
subsidies) may have the unintended consequence

ser vices, such as credit and insurance, may
allow suppliers to invest in technologies that
also reduce food loss and waste. An example
of an economic development inter vention with
a side benefit of reducing food losses is the
International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development’s financing of improved grain
storage in Mexico, boosting smallholders’
competitiveness. 6

Public policies to promote overall economic
development can have the side benefit of
promoting food loss and waste reductions by the
private sector. For instance, inclusive financial

REFORMING BREAD SUBSIDIES IN THE NEAR EAST

While food subsidies may be an element in social
safety nets and increase food security, they can also
induce consumers to waste more food.18 Depending
on their design, the benefits may be largely captured
by high-income consumers, without necessarily helping
the poor.19
Before its reform in 2014, the bread subsidy system
in Egypt was believed to encourage consumers to waste
bread and suppliers to behave opportunistically.9
Subsidized flour was often bought at low cost and
resold at higher prices, either as flour or bread, or
leaked from the supply chain. This leakage occurred at
all stages of the supply chain, in warehouses, mills and
bakeries. The 2014 reform introduced a smart card
system that subsidizes bread rather than flour and limits
the number of loaves a person can buy each day.
Unused credit can be used to buy other subsidized food
items. Thus, consumers – and through them, suppliers
– have an incentive to manage their bread purchases
more efficiently.9, 20, 21 After the reform there was a

decrease of 15–20 percent in the demand for bread,
as consumers started to adjust their consumption.9
Other countries in the region, such as Jordan, have
adopted a similar approach. There bread subsidies are
seen as a way to improve food security and thus ensure
stability, especially after the bread riots of 1996.
However, it is estimated that the needy consume only
13 percent of subsidized bread, while 12 percent is
consumed by wealthy segments of society.22 Low-priced
subsidized wheat flour is often resold by bakers or
used to produce non-subsidized bread; livestock
owners even use it as animal feed.22, 23 To reduce public
spending and avoid food wastage, in 2018 the
government replaced its broad bread subsidy
programme with a targeted assistance system that sets
new price caps for bread without directly subsidizing
bakeries.23, 24 Beneficiaries are paid through an
electronic benefit transfer card to counter fraud and
waste. The new system is expected to reduce
government spending by around USD 106 million.23

Another strateg y to promote such reductions
is through public–private partnerships.
Coordinating public and private investment in
infrastructure and logistics (for example, through
World Bank Sustainable Development Bonds)
may improve producers’ access to markets, thus
reducing losses. s International trade cooperation
or free trade agreements that reduce delays in
moving perishable food products across borders
can also help avoid losses.

instance, a reduction in food losses by processors
may reduce demand from processors for farmers’
output, thus depressing farmers’ income.
The distribution of the costs and benefits along
and beyond the food supply chain is of major
importance when formulating policies to reduce
food loss and waste.
Apart from the financial gains, private initiatives
to reduce food loss and waste may also bring
considerable benefits to wider societ y in terms of
food securit y and nutrition (see Chapter 4) and
environmental sustainabilit y (see Chapter 5).
The precise linkages between food loss and waste
reduction and these societal objectives are not
always straightforward and are discussed in the
following section. n

One important aspect that public inter vention
must take into consideration is that food loss
and waste reductions have winners and losers.
The benefits (or costs) are not always enjoyed
(or borne) by those implementing them.1 For
s World Bank Sustainable Development Bonds allow investors to help
borrowing member countries achieve their development goals through
financial services, access to experts and a pool of knowledge in
development-related disciplines.7

PUBLIC INTERVENTIONS
FOR BETTER FOOD
SECURITY AND
NUTRITION AND
ENVIRONMENTAL
SUSTAINABILITY

Policy decisions related to food loss or waste
reduction also depend on where in the food
supply chain most food is lost or wasted.
Indeed, there is little point in focusing
on locations where the levels are low.
However, targeting the locations in the food
supply chain where losses or waste are highest
is not necessarily the most effective strateg y
in achieving societal objectives. For example,
policies aimed at improving environmental
sustainabilit y should also take into account
where in the food supply chain environmental
impacts of food loss and waste are largest.

The previous section focused on the role of
public inter ventions in facilitating the business
case of reducing food loss and waste, which
may contribute to economic growth and job
creation, thus benefiting not only private actors
but also societ y at large. Aside from objectives
linked to such financial gains by producers or
consumers, the report has focused on two key
objectives associated with the reduction of food
loss and waste: food securit y and nutrition (see
Chapter 4) and environmental sustainabilit y
(see Chapter 5). Public inter ventions that aim to
produce these societal gains through food loss
and waste reduction can do so by, for example,
reducing market failures and missing markets,
as well as the negative externalities caused by
private actors.

Low-income countries with high food insecurit y
may focus on working to improve food securit y
and nutrition; at the same time, ensuring
sustainable use of land and water resources
may also have a strong positive impact on food
securit y and nutrition. Countries with such
characteristics tend to inter vene early on in the
supply chain and often at the primar y production
stage, where food securit y impacts are likely to
be strongest and losses highest.
High-income countries – where food insecurity is
generally low, and nutrition better – are likely to
focus on environmental objectives and especially
cutting GHG emissions. Reducing food loss or
waste is more effective in cutting these emissions at
the later stages of the supply chain and particularly
the retail and consumption stages. Here, the GHG
emissions embedded in food products are highest;
in addition, in high-income countries, most food
wastage occurs at these stages.

As discussed in Chapters 4 and 5, the impacts
of loss or waste reductions on food securit y
and nutrition and environmental sustainabilit y
depend inter alia on the location of the
reductions, both geographically and in the food
supply chain.
 Loss or waste reductions are expected to have
a greater impact on food securit y if they focus
on the earlier supply chain stages, by boosting
supplies and reducing food prices throughout
the supply chain, to the particular benefit of
the most v ulnerable populations.
 Inter ventions towards loss or waste reductions
may aim to improve the environmental
sustainabilit y of the food system by, for
example, reducing pressures on land or water
resources, or lowering GHG emissions.
This is achieved by inter vening after the
environmental damage has occurred. This is
particularly important for cutting GHG
emissions, which accumulate as a food product
moves along the supply chain.

There may also be synergies between objectives;
reduced on-farm losses in low-income
countries, for example, may lessen stresses
on natural resources, while at the same
time improving food securit y. There may
also be synergies with broader development
objectives, including an enabling business
environment. Indeed, investments aimed at
broader agricultural development – for example,
to improve infrastructure or storage facilities,
enhance rural finance ser vices or boost market
opportunities – may also reduce losses or waste
as a side effect.
Note that there may be trade-offs between
objectives, as an inter vention may contribute

Figure 17 illustrates the linkages between various
objectives of food loss and waste reduction
inter ventions and their entr y points in the
supply chain. This fig ure can help policymakers
narrow down the area for inter vention
based on the objective so that they focus
efforts (e.g. information gathering) on those
inter ventions that are most likely to contribute to
that objective.

towards one objective but worsen outcomes in
another. Improving access to diversified and
nutritious diets, for example, entails a certain
level of food loss or waste and possibly of food
products with a high environmental footprint. 25
Another example of the trade-off between
objectives is boosting cold chain capacities,
which may improve food securit y and nutrition
but also result in greater GHG emissions.
Sustainable cooling solutions that use renewable
energ y resources present a good solution to
prevent food spoiling without adding to GHG
emissions. Local off-grid or microgrid-based
solutions are an attractive option, since
installation costs are now comparable to, or
even lower than, connecting to electricit y grids
(see Box 30 for a feasibilit y analysis of off-grid
cooling technologies in Kenya, Tunisia and
the United Republic of Tanzania). 26 Other
small-scale, simple, self-build cooling solutions
may offer an affordable and more sustainable
alternative to conventional cold rooms.
An example is Coolbot, a device that converts
a standard window air conditioner unit to a
walk-in refrigerator cooler unit; it can also be
powered by an off-grid system (using solar
power, for example). It is estimated to be about
25 percent more efficient than conventional
cooling systems. A study in Kenya found
Coolbot prolonged the shelf life of mangoes
by up to 23 days compared to ambient storage
conditions. 27 n

The colour of the boxes indicates whether an
objective is related to food securit y and nutrition
(orange) or the environment (green), while
the positioning indicates the best entr y point
along the supply chain for measures aimed at
the objective. For example, inter ventions to
boost farmers’ incomes may focus on on-farm
loss reduction, while GHG emissions are best
addressed by focusing on consumer waste.
Certain objectives can only be addressed in the
later stages of the supply chain because they
concern either the final product or the packaging
of that product.
Figure 17 does not disting uish between
objectives that are global and those restricted
to a local area. However, a number of basic
conclusions in this respect can be drawn from
Chapters 4 and 5:
 If the objective is to lower GHG emissions,
then the geographic location of reduction
inter ventions does not matter; reducing GHG
emissions by 1 tonne of CO 2 will have the
same global impact irrespective of where
it occurs.
 Inter ventions aimed at improving food securit y
and nutrition should be implemented at the
local level, as those in one part of the world are
unlikely to affect food securit y and nutrition
thousands of kilometres away.
 At the local level, synergies exist between
the objectives of improving access to food
and reducing environmental footprints
through inter ventions earlier in the supply
chain. However, reducing food losses is
unlikely to be the most effective way to tackle
local environmental problems as a primar y
objective. These are best addressed by directly
improving resource use efficiency.

ENSURING COHERENT
POLICIES FOR FOOD LOSS
AND WASTE REDUCTION

Table 2 shows a number of examples of interventions
towards food loss or waste reduction around the
world. They include both public interventions –
aimed at improving food security and nutrition
or environmental sustainability, or creating an
enabling environment to allow private actors
to reduce losses or waste – and measures
implemented by private actors. Interventions
may have more than one objective and may also
bring side benefits. Improving “best before” and
“use by” labelling may enable retailers to sell food
that would otherwise be wasted. It may also help
consumers diversify their diets, thus contributing
to better nutrition. n

Food loss and waste reduction should be seen not
only as a goal in its own right but also as a means
to achieve other objectives, such as food nutrition
and securit y and environmental sustainabilit y.
Policies aimed at promoting broad agricultural
or economic development may enable suppliers
along the food supply chain to make investments
that reduce food losses or waste as a side benefit. »

EXAMPLES OF INTERVENTIONS TOWARDS FOOD LOSS AND WASTE REDUCTION AROUND THE WORLD

Improving storage to reduce on-farm losses and boost farmers’ incomes
Adequate storage conditions give stability to smallholders by preventing post-harvest losses and
allowing them to sell their produce later in the season at favourable prices. A cost–benefit analysis
for the maize, bean and cowpea supply chains in Benin and Mozambique found the investment in
hermetic bags and metal silos to be beneficial for farmers. Results suggest that farmers in both
countries may realize an up to 11-fold return on investment. The return will largely depend on
whether farmers sell their crops immediately after harvest or during the lean season, on the prices
paid for stored crops later in the season, and on the level of post-harvest losses avoided in a given
context. One limitation of the analysis is that it assumes that metal silos and hermetic bags are
100 percent effective in preserving the produce until the lean season (i.e. eight months later), which
may not be the case in practice. The initial investment costs also present a significant barrier to
adoption, especially for the metal silo, and it can take farmers up to seven years to pay back the
cost of the investment. Public policies should promote inclusive financial services, such as credit or
lower import taxes, so that modern technologies are accessible to farmers. 28, 29

Improving fish smoking and dr ying practices to prevent losses
Smoking and drying fish are the most common small- and medium-scale processing methods. Their
use has a great impact on the level of post-harvest losses, the environmental footprint of the fish
sector and consumer health. FAO has pioneered an innovative technique to smoke and dry fish, the
FAO-Thiaroye Technique, which has greatly improved smoking and drying practices. The
FAO-Thiaroye Technique can be used regardless of climatic conditions and increases the range of
species that can be processed, which strengthens fish processors’ resilience in the face of climatic
variability. The technique has resulted in a near complete elimination of losses at the processing
stage and enhances the quality and safety of the finished product. In Côte d’Ivoire, the technique is
estimated to reduce losses of smoked fish rejected on food safety or quality grounds to the tune of
USD 1.7 million annually. 30

Climate-friendly cold storage
In Morocco, FAO and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) assessed the
potential for more efficient climate control techniques, including cold storage. Improving the
efficiency of the cold chain was found to be a low-hanging fruit, offering the greatest potential to
reduce GHG emissions and improve resource use efficiency of all the 12 technologies and
practices reviewed. However, limited access to capital, uncertainty as to the financial return on
investments and regulatory issues constitute barriers to adopting efficient cold storage
technologies. The Finance and Technology Transfer Centre for Climate Change (funded by the
EBRD and the Global Environment Facility) helps businesses adopt green cooling technologies and
overcome problems related to malfunctioning markets for climate technology, largely through
grants and technical support. 31

Extending shelf life without plastics or cold storage
Apeel is an innovative natural technique to coat fresh fruits and vegetables with a thin peel of
edible plant material that slows down water loss and oxidation – the factors that cause spoilage. 32
The start-up that developed the technique was launched in 2012 in the United States of America. 33
It claims Apeel extends the lifespan of avocadoes by almost a week and doubles their ripeness
window from two to four days by reducing water loss by 30 percent and slowing down softening by
60 percent, relative to untreated avocadoes. The developers also claim that their technique results in
a fivefold reduction in mechanical damage. 34

Discounting ageing produce
Wasteless, an innovative pricing technology using machine-learning, helps retailers cut waste and
increase their revenues through dynamic pricing. The technology ensures that electronic shelf labels
automatically discount the prices of food products as their expiration date comes near. Wasteless
allows for a continuous inventory of products according to their expiration dates and connects to
stores’ point-of-sales systems. A pilot at a leading Spanish retailer resulted in an average decrease
of 32.7 percent in overall waste and an average revenue boost of 6.3 percent. Two-thirds of
consumers faced with choosing between a discounted product with a shorter expiration date and
the same product with a longer expiration date sold at its full price chose the discounted product. 35

Innovative solutions for food redistribution in the European Union
In recent years, EU countries have been applying solutions to encourage food operators to donate
their surplus food. For example, in 2016, a law was passed in Italy to relax regulations that made
donations for food redistribution cumbersome. The law allows food to be donated even if it is past
its “best before” date or is mislabelled (as long as it does not pose any risks in terms of food
safety), and allows farmers to donate unsold produce to charities without incurring costs. 36 Belgium
and France provide other examples of how the administrative requirements of donating food can be
simplified and donation by businesses encouraged. 12

n

National strategies for food loss and waste reduction and prevention in Chile and Argentina
In Latin America, several countries have adopted policies to stem food loss and waste. In 2017, for
example, Chile established the National Committee for Food Loss and Waste Prevention and
Reduction, to facilitate and coordinate strategies to prevent and reduce food loss and waste.
Formed by public institutions and private organizations, the Committee’s 2018–2019 action plan
focuses on three pillars: (i) governance; (ii) information and communication; and (iii) research,
technology and knowledge required to reduce food loss and waste. 37 Similarly, Argentina created a
National Programme for the Reduction of Food Loss and Waste in 2015; more than 80 public and
private institutions have since joined to form the National Network for the Reduction of Food Loss
and Waste. As part of the programme, a national campaign named “Valoremos los Alimentos” was
launched, providing information and videos on how to prevent food loss and waste. 38

REGIONAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORKS TO TACKLE FOOD LOSS AND WASTE EFFECTIVELY

Regional and national platforms between governmental
and non-governmental actors in Africa, Latin America
and the Caribbean contain food loss and waste
reduction goals in their strategic frameworks.
The Inter-American Development Bank has created
#SinDesperdicio, a platform aimed at promoting
innovation and improving the quality of public
interventions on food loss and waste reduction in Latin
America and the Caribbean. Actors including FAO, the
Consumer Goods Forum, the Global FoodBanking
Network, IBM and other companies participate in the
platform.

The African Union has developed a regional
strategy to reduce post-harvest losses with the support
of FAO. The regional strategy helps countries in the
African Union achieve the goal of the Malabo
Declaration of halving post-harvest losses by 2025
(see Box 22) by aligning national strategies as much as
possible. The strategy targets interventions at selected
stages of the supply chains of particular food products.
Data collection focuses on the indicator for post-harvest
losses agreed by member countries and on monitoring
and evaluation.

The alignment of strategies can ensure resources
are used in the most efficient way possible, both
in collecting data and carr ying out the actual
inter ventions. Boxes 34 and 35 provide examples
of regional strategies for food loss and waste
reduction in Latin America and the Caribbean
and Africa, and the EU, respectively.

 Are they appropriate in the cultural and social
context of the supply chain and can they be
adopted widely to have a long-term impact on
losses or waste?47
Finally, it is imperative to assess accurately
whether reduction inter ventions achieve their
objectives. This calls for the exact measurement
of the problem targeted, as well as precise
monitoring and evaluation of the inter ventions –
all of which requires reliable data on the level of
food losses and waste. The current lack of solid
data constitutes a serious barrier to successful
policymaking. The following section lays out a
road map for improved data collection on food
loss and waste. n

To achieve long-lasting food loss and waste
reduction results, policy inter ventions must be
designed and implemented in a way that accounts
for gender. To ensure this happens, policymakers
should:
 consider the results and recommendations of
gender-sensitive maps and analyses of food
supply chains;
 identif y the gender constraints that actors face
at critical loss points in the food supply chain;
 duly consider the differences in needs,
constraints and preferences between women
and men active in the food supply chain; and
 assess the gender and social implications of
any proposed solutions.

TOWARDS BETTER DATA
ON FOOD LOSS AND
WASTE – A ROAD MAP
Obtaining reliable information on the amount of
loss and waste for a wide range of commodities
along the whole food supply chain is challenging.
Although food loss and waste research has been
ongoing for the past 40 years, there are still no
internationally used standards, concepts or
definitions of food loss and waste; current

REDUCING FOOD LOSS AND WASTE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION

The EU is committed to the global fight against food
loss and waste. Food waste prevention was singled
out as a priority area in the EU Circular Economy
Action Plan, adopted in 2015.39, 40 This called on the
European Commission to establish a multi-stakeholder
platform dedicated to food waste prevention.i The EU
Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste, established
in 2016, brings together all key actors representing
both public and private interests from farm to fork
to advance EU progress towards SDG Target 12.3.
Members include international organizations (FAO,
UN Environment, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development), EU institutions,
experts from EU Member States, and stakeholders
from the food supply chain, including food banks
and other NGOs.41
The Platform aims to support all actors in defining
measures to prevent food waste, including possible
recommendations for EU-level action, sharing best
practices and evaluating progress. With the support of
the EU Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste, the
European Commission has adopted EU guidelines to
facilitate food donations and the redirection of food no
longer fit for human consumption into feed. It has
developed a food waste measurement methodology
and is working to improve date labelling practices.42, 43
Measurement is critical to food waste prevention.
Revised EU waste legislation adopted in May 2018
i

has introduced specific measures which will provide the
EU with new and consistent data on food waste
levels.44 On 3 May 2019 the European Commission
adopted a Delegated Act laying down a common food
waste measurement methodology to help Member
States quantify food waste at each stage of the food
supply chain. Based on a common definition, the
methodology will ensure coherent monitoring of food
waste levels across the EU. The Delegated Act is
expected to come into force in autumn 2019.45
EU Member States are expected to provide data
separately for five stages of the food supply chain:
primary production, processing and manufacturing,
retail and other distribution of food, restaurants and
food services, and households. This covers the scope of
both sub-indicators proposed to measure progress
towards SDG Target 12.3 – the FLI and the FWI. The
collected data will contribute in a significant way to
reporting for both indices.
The European Commission’s Reflection paper,
“Towards a sustainable Europe by 2030”, highlights
the importance of pursuing the EU Action Plan to fight
food waste to strengthen the sustainability of our food
systems.46 The forthcoming “Recommendations for
action in food waste prevention”, to be adopted by the
EU Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste by the
end of 2019, are expected to make an important
contribution to this redesign of EU food systems.

EU legislation does not use the concept of food loss and its definition of food waste covers the whole food supply chain.

A ROAD MAP FOR IMPROVED DATA COLLECTION ON FOOD LOSSES

The methodological agenda – international concepts and
definitions and a standardized approach to estimating
food loss
A consensus on a precise definition of food loss and
waste does not exist and the concepts of loss and
waste are often used interchangeably. As a result,
data across countries are hardly comparable. FAO has
worked to consolidate definitions, both with external
partners and through internal consultations, and has
agreed on definitions of food loss and waste from
several perspectives. A detailed description of concepts
related to food loss and waste can be found in
Chapter 1 of this report (see Boxes 1 and 2).
Measuring food loss is not an easy task, given the
multidimensional nature of losses, the different product
characteristics, the variety of supply chains and types
of actors (from small household farms to large
commercial holdings), the various supply chain stages
where losses occur and need to be measured, and the
difficulty of objective measurements. To this end, in
2018 FAO and the Global Strategy to Improve
Agricultural and Rural Statistics developed “Guidelines
on the measurement of harvest and post-harvest
losses”, covering the production (harvest), post-harvest
and processing stages in the food supply chain.49 The
Guidelines offer cost-effective statistical methods and
are targeted primarily, but not exclusively, towards
developing countries. Those for grains are being tested
in three countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Three
additional guideline documents, covering loss
measurement of fruits and vegetables, animal products
and fish products, have also been developed.50 The
Guidelines are complemented by field test reports
providing practical experience and solutions for
specific contexts.
Using comparable methods within and across
countries will help improve the modelled estimates and
enhance understanding of the levels and causes of
losses; this will lead to more informed decisions on
how to tackle the problem.

A capacity development agenda – supporting countries in
collecting food loss data
As a starting point, a set of resources is being made
available online, including the Guidelines, the reports
from the field tests, eLearning courses (on the FLI
and the Guidelines for data collection), standard
questionnaires and training material. These resources
are complemented by a round of international training
workshops in all regions to transfer knowledge and
help countries tackle the measurement issue in all its
complexity. The next steps will be to plan support in
collecting data through new or existing initiatives in
a set of priority countries. These will be grounded in
national statistical systems to ensure sustainability of
data collection and to strengthen the capacity of the
systems themselves. Additional tools will be available,
including guidance for post-harvest loss surveys,
building on the Census of Agriculture framework
– designed to provide support and guidance for
countries to carry out national agricultural censuses
– or adding a sub-survey on farm losses in the
Agricultural Integrated Survey (AGRIS), a farm-based,
multi-year survey programme proposed by FAO to
improve agricultural and rural statistics.51, 52 The tools
will cover sample design issues and the questionnaires
or questions to be used or added to existing surveys.
In the short term – and in the absence of data –
modelled estimates will be used within the framework
of Food Balance Sheets (FBS). Since estimating losses
with econometric modelling can help reduce data
collection costs and increase the quality of data, FAO
has developed a loss imputation model which countries
may choose to adopt and adjust to generate improved
data on food loss.49, 50
A data collection agenda – mining existing information to
estimate food losses
In parallel with the capacity development agenda, as
custodian agency of the FLI, FAO regularly collects
available loss data from all countries, along with its

BOX 36

(CONTINUED)

Data collection started in 2016 and has been
strengthened in 2019: a separate questionnaire on
food losses went out in spring 2019 to all countries to
gather all existing data for the past decade and
validate the historical data collected so far by FAO for
its Supply Utilization Accounts. Later on, a separate
questionnaire will be merged with the annual
Agricultural Production Questionnaire to ease the
burden for respondents.
The data thus obtained will be used to compile the
FLI, where possible, and to improve the model-based
estimates.

Engaging countries in measuring food waste in retail,
food services and households
Despite FAO’s efforts, no single institution can tackle
food loss and waste alone or unilaterally address the
many dimensions of food loss and waste at the local
and global level. Partnerships to align and join efforts
with technical and political stakeholders, private and
public entities, both nationally and internationally,
will be critical. Such partnerships should ensure a
consistent and integrated food systems approach to
policy formulation, technical support and measurement
of food losses and waste.

» may be much greater than anticipated, especially

and waste (see, for example, Boxes 34 and 35).
However, commitments are often collective
expressions of intent that still need to be
translated into action so that reductions can
be monitored.

in emerging economies. UN Environment is
adopting a two-tier approach in developing
the F WI to measure and monitor food waste
worldwide. A draft methodolog y has been
developed, with a first tier building upon the
Food Loss and Waste Accounting and Reporting
Standard (FLW Standard) published in June
2016. Given the lack of national data on food
waste (it is estimated that currently data are
available for only 10 percent of the world’s
population), UN Environment is developing a
second-tier method involving a model that will
provide food waste estimates for all countries.
The precise road map for data collection on food
waste will depend on the final design of the F WI
under development.

The private sector also has a central role to play
when it comes to measuring losses or waste.
Business-level data are valuable for tracking
industr y progress over time, identif ying critical
loss points within businesses, filling data gaps in
national sur veys, sharing best practices, further
motivating other companies to reduce their losses
or waste, and prompting inter ventions and policy
analysis. Even though businesses have been
making progress in measuring and reducing food
loss and waste over the past few years (see Box 15),
the private sector will need to step up if the scale
of reductions called for by SDG Target 12.3 is to
be achieved. Only when countries and businesses
start to establish more solid baselines, develop
credible means of monitoring and measuring
food loss and waste, and make their results
publicly available and easily accessible, will
an assessment of national and global progress
towards SDG Target 12.3 be possible. n

To achieve SDG Target 12.3, efforts by FAO and
UN Environment to develop the FLI and FWI,
respectively, will need to be supplemented by
much government action at the country or even
subnational level. Designing interventions for
action requires ex-ante assessment of potential
interventions such as those suggested in this
report or ex-post assessment of interventions
already in place; these assessments require
measurement in the first place. Indeed, a number
of countries have already taken steps to start
or improve the measurement of their losses

CHAPTER 6 POLICYMAKING FOR FOOD LOSS AND WASTE REDUCTION – GUIDING PRINCIPLES

CONCLUSIONS

later stages of the supply chain, particularly at
the retail and consumption stages, where the
GHG emissions embedded in food products
are highest.

This report has discussed the role that food loss
and waste reduction can play in achieving the
targets of the SDGs – not only SDG Target 12.3,
which explicitly calls for a reduction in food
losses and waste, but other targets, too
(see Figure 1). Private stakeholders may have a
financial incentive to invest in the reduction of
food losses or waste and their efforts may have
positive impacts on the wider societal goals of
food securit y and nutrition and environmental
sustainabilit y, the focus of this report. Public
inter ventions may provide incentives to private
actors to reduce food losses or waste and help
them overcome constraints.

GHG emissions have a global impact, irrespective
of where they occur. The geographic location
of inter ventions to reduce GHG emissions
through food loss or waste reduction is therefore
irrelevant. Food loss or waste reduction measures
are likely to be most effective in alleviating
stresses on natural resources (such as land or
water) if implemented near the location of these
stresses, both geographically and along the
supply chain. Note that measures aimed directly
at better efficiency in the use of natural resources
or reducing environmental stresses are often
more effective in this regard than food loss or
waste reduction.

This report has arg ued that public inter ventions
aimed at broad economic development may
have the side effect of leading to reduced food
losses or waste. Public inter ventions on food
loss or waste reduction must be formulated
in line with policymakers’ ultimate objective
of increasing economic efficiency, improving
food securit y or nutrition, or ensuring
environmental sustainabilit y.

Any reductions in the amount of food wasted by
consumers in high-income countries are unlikely
to have a more than negligible effect on the food
securit y status of v ulnerable groups in distant
low-income countries.
The formulation of effective policies towards food
loss and waste reduction requires comprehensive
information as to how much and where – both
geographically and along the supply chain –
various food products are lost or wasted.
The current lack of comparable and reliable
information constitutes a major obstacle to the
development of effectively targeted policies to
reduce food losses or waste. Improving statistics
on food loss and waste is therefore a priorit y area
for FAO – as it should be for the international
communit y and national governments,
particularly in monitoring progress towards
achieving the SDGs. n

Low-income countries with high levels of food
insecurit y may choose to focus on improving
food securit y and nutrition. Inter ventions
focusing on losses early on in the supply chain –
and especially on-farm losses – are likely to have
the strongest impact.
High-income countries – where food insecurit y
is generally low, and nutrition better – are likely
to focus on environmental objectives, especially
reduced GHG emissions. Efforts towards food
loss or waste reduction are more effective at
reducing these emissions if implemented at the

FOOD LOSS INDEX METHODOLOGY
The loss estimates used in this report are based
on the methodolog y developed by FAO to
monitor food losses within SDG Target 12.3 –
“By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at
the retail and consumer levels and reduce food
losses along production and supply chains,
including post-har vest losses”. Under this
target, FAO developed a Food Loss Index (FLI)
monitoring food losses on a global level for
a basket of key commodities covering crops,
livestock and fisheries products from har vest
up until retail. The index focuses on the supply
stages of food chains and measures changes in
percentage losses over time measured by the
Food Loss Percentage (FLP).
The FLI is expressed in a base 100 and allows
for looking at positive and negative trends in
FLP compared to the base period of 2015 and
for assessing countries’ progress in reducing
losses. The index is comprised of annual FLP
data, which are interpreted as the percentage of
production that does not reach the retail stage.
The FLP is a relative measure of a countr y’s
food system efficiency compared to other
countries. The FLP can be disaggregated into loss
percentages by commodit y and food supply chain
stage (where stage level information exists). The
overarching objective is that countries will want
to make reductions overall at the national level,
while developing policies and tracking progress
in finer detail. FAO, as the custodian agency, will
track post-har vest losses and progress against
SDG Target 12.3.1.a at the global level, report on
changes in the Global FLI and assist countries in
compiling their own national FLIs. This annex
will describe the salient methodological aspects
developed for estimating the FLP and the FLI.

1. FLI AND FLP DESIGN
The FLI has a traditional Laysperes fixed-base
formula comparing percentage losses of countr y
(i) in a current period (t) to the percentage losses
in the base period (t 0 ) for a basket of commodities
(j), using value of production (q ijt 0*p jt 0) in the base
period as the weights. The index is a composite of
commodities that are key in national agricultural
production or food systems, including crops,
livestock and fisheries. It tracks losses as a
percentage of total supply (l ijt) in order to exclude
the impact of production variabilit y on losses
measured in weight. The index formula is:

𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐼𝐼$% =

∑* 𝑙𝑙$*% ∗ (𝑞𝑞$*%. ∗ 𝑝𝑝*%. )
∗ 100
∑* 𝑙𝑙$*1 ∗ (𝑞𝑞$*%. ∗ 𝑝𝑝*%. )

𝐹𝐹𝐿𝐿𝐼𝐼$% =

𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹$%
∗ 100
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹$%(

The indices are also equal to the ratio of an
average FLP in the current period and the FLP
in the base period (multiplied by 100) and can be
expressed with the following alternative and
simpler formula:

Where FLP it is the country’s FLP, itself an
aggregation of the loss percentages of each
commodity l ijt , weighted by its value of production.
The FLP has been estimated and reported in this
report at several aggregation levels:

𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹$% =

∑* 𝑙𝑙$*% ∗ (𝑞𝑞$*%. ∗ 𝑝𝑝*%. )
∑* (𝑞𝑞$*%. ∗ 𝑝𝑝*%. )

The FLPs l ijt which compile the national indices,
and are the most critical pieces of information,
will be the nationally representative loss

percentage for each commodit y along the supply
chain. In the absence of data, these percentages
have been estimated with a model.

The FLI is based on the loss percentages for
each commodit y in the basket. This decision
stemmed from the assumption that percentages
will help isolate the signal and not the noise,
as production varies from year to year and loss
quantities will var y with total production, while
long-term loss trends will be relatively stable
and be a factor of other relevant indicators (e.g.
investments, technolog y, incidence of pests,
capacit y of the supply chain, etc.).

2. CONSTRUCTING THE FLI AND FLP
Selecting the commodities basket
Measuring post-har vest losses is especially
complex and costly because of the multiple
sources of losses, the many nodes of the supply
chain where they can appear, and the difficulty
of capturing them using either declarative or
physical measurement techniques. In addition,
it is not feasible to collect data in ever y year,
for all commodities, at all stages. A review of
loss reduction policies has shown that countries
focus investment and decisions where the
impact can be greatest, that is on a few strategic
commodities, and that diverse diets and food
security are key priorities related to this indicator.

This is especially visible when countries apply
a constant loss factor based on expert opinion
to estimate losses. In the anonymized example
below (Figure A1), wheat losses were set at a f lat
15 percent of supply across all years, yet total
losses f luctuate over time in line with production.
Carr y-over factors are commonly used and occur
in the dataset for the Food Balance Sheets (FBS)
when new data collection or modelling are not
applied, as well as in other data sources such
as the African Posthar vest Losses Information
System (APHLIS).

No single list of ten commodities can be relevant
for all countries, yet comparability is an important
statistical quality. To allow for some international
comparability while ensuring relevance, the
basket is structured in five standard headings to
cover the whole diet, and the two commodities
per heading can indicate the variation in losses
for each country within similar supply chains of
each heading. Countries can go above and beyond
and build on their experiences in measuring
these ten commodities, as country priorities and
resources allow.

An index based on losses in tonnes would
show annual variations and a trend, while the
underlying loss factor is constant. The FLP and
FLI are both constant in this case, neutralizing
the noise coming from annual variations in
production and yields.

Weighting pattern, reference period
and scope of the FLP

The commodities baskets were set by applying
the default method, where the countr y’s
production of primar y commodities is ranked by
economic value (using the international dollar
price) and then sorted by the five headings:
(i) cereals and pulses; (ii) fruits and vegetables;
(iii) roots, tubers and oil-bearing crops; (iv) meat
and animal products; (v) fish and fish products.
For each heading, the top two items are selected.
For a list of the commodities appearing in the
basket of at least one countr y’s FLI, see FAO,
2018.1

After significant discussion, the chosen weights
are in terms of the commodities’ economic value
of production on the assumption that markets
operate efficiently in valuing the commodities’
importance. While there are known biases in
utilizing economic weights, it may be the least
biased of the potential aggregation methods and
provide a context for the cost-effectiveness of
inter vention strategies. The weights for the FLI
and FLP are the value of the commodities baskets
at an international average price in international
dollar terms in the reference year.
When aggregating countries’ loss percentages
into regional or global losses, countries are
weighed by their overall agricultural value,

always in international dollar terms, relative to
the rest of the world. In other words, the most
valuable commodities will impact more on the
FLP at countr y level and countries with larger
agricultural sectors will weigh more heavily in
the regional and global FLP estimates. However,
with the selection of commodities across
commodit y headings, the production bias is
overcome slightly, as different regions are
major producers in different commodities.

and estimates are due in part to the differences
in the abilit y and cost in tracking losses and
waste by individual commodities versus volume
(as is the case for consumer waste) and the
abilit y to focus on different policies that will
target different stakeholders within countries.
In cases where the countries can measure both
indicators, a positive outcome will be if both
indicators decrease.

3. ESTIMATING FLPs

The FLI and FLP scope in terms of the food
supply chain starts on the farm after har vest
and up to, but not including, the retail stage (see
Chapter 1). The scope is different from that in the
FAO 2011 study, 2 which included har vest losses
as well as the demand-side of the food supply
chain, which will be represented in the F WI
under development. The division of the indicators

losses by 1985, the lack of data is still dire.
These persisting data gaps have driven many
decisions in designing the FLI methodolog y
for the SDGs. One of the main limitations
on measuring losses in the past has been the
costliness of data collection along complex and
far-reaching supply chains, which is still the
main known challenge for most countries in
obtaining the FLPs, by commodit y over time.
In order to increase the information base for
SDG measuring and monitoring, FAO adopted a
two-tier approach:

available information (which will be published
concurrent to this report) and the default basket
of commodities.

1. Improve the collection of data along the
supply chain in the medium to long term
with a range of possible sur veys and other
statistical tools to be integrated into national
agricultural statistics systems. To this end,
FAO has produced g uidelines for countries on
cost-effective methods to estimate food losses
along the supply chain.
2. Use model-based loss estimates where data are
not available in the short term. To this end,
FAO developed an estimation model that
incorporates explanator y variables grounded in
reviewing available information at the stage,
countr y and commodit y level. 3 The model will
add value for countries seeking to both
decrease losses and focus on factors that make
the greatest impacts. A succinct description of
the model follows below.

Missing data proved to be a problem for both
the independent and the dependent variables.
The first model by Klaus Grünberger adopted an
annual time trend, the percentage of paved roads
in countries, GDP per capita and dummy variables
for each region, single commodity and commodity
group. Of the independent variables, only the
commodity and the time trend were considered
suitable and effective. The second model was
a purely statistical hierarchical mixed-effect
model that could be used to fill gaps but not for
analytical purposes in looking at relationships
between losses and explanatory factors.

Justification for the model
Modelling efforts to estimate loss factors by
countr y, commodit y and year started as early as
2013. Two previous attempts, both using loss data
from the Supply Utilization Accounts (SUA)/FBS,
did not yield satisfactor y results but provided
the starting ground for the food loss modelled
estimates used in this report.

The new model is structured to create a
comparable, transparent method for countries
that do not have officially reported data and
to estimate loss while addressing many of
the previous limitations. It builds on existing
efforts and includes more policy-relevant
variables and proxies for known causes of
losses. Moreover, it was designed to provide
a mechanism for aggregating losses at the
stage level into a national estimate for each
countr y/commodit y/year along the whole supply
chain, thus solving one of the under-coverage
issues. It fosters a standardized, homogenous
approach for estimating losses and selecting
explanator y variables.

Data reported from countries through the
FBS only covered 7 percent of the necessar y
commodities, countries and years needed for a
full dataset. In addition, the national estimates
using carr y-overs provide a modelling challenge,
indicating that losses do not change irrespective
of policy and inter ventions. With the underlying
paucit y of basic loss data, the model did not
display a significant trend following 2011,
the benchmark year of FAO’s earlier model. 2
Incorporation of secondar y sources has improved
the abilit y for the model to estimate losses
for some regions and commodities; however,
there are still untapped sources of information
available and more movement is required
towards measurement standards. The loss
estimates in this report therefore refer to the
latest available year, i.e. 2016, with currently

Input data
The model rests on three sets of input data:
(i) officially reported loss data; (ii) information
obtained through a literature review on
food losses; and (iii) explanator y variables
representing causal relationships with food losses
found in the literature.

Officially reported loss data

Loss data from the literature review

Chapter 2 extensively describes the challenges
of data collection and analyses available data
densit y (or scarcit y) in Figure 9, by use of heat
maps. As mentioned in the chapter, only
39 countries have officially reported loss data
on an annual basis through FAO’s annual
Agricultural Production Questionnaires for the
period 1990 –2017.

An extensive review of literature in the public
domain was carried out in 2016 –17 and is still
ongoing. It gathered additional information
from almost 500 publications and reports from
various sources (national institutions, academic
institutions, international organizations such as
the World Bank, GIZ, FAO, IFPRI, etc.).
In some cases, the studies were conducted to
focus on a narrow slice of the food supply chain,
which may also over-represent segments of
the supply chain (e.g. storage has been widely
analysed for grains and pulses) or segments
of the population (e.g. smallholder farmers)
that meet development objectives. At the
opposite end, certain commodit y groups are
under-represented (fish and meat), as are the
later stages of the supply chain. In addition,
a critical loss point of har vest losses has not
traditionally been collected as it occurs before
the point at which production is measured
and reported.

In the questionnaires, countries report on total
losses at the national level for a whole tract of the
supply chain defined the SUA/FBS framework
with no breakdown by stages. These estimates
from countries may be modelled, measured
or come from a variet y of internal sources
and expert opinions. Countries may provide
source documentation, if available, through the
improved official loss questionnaire starting
in 2019.
A preliminar y analysis of the national derived
loss percentages showed that they are lower
than those found in the scientific literature
and sector reports, even after aggregation to a
national number. This is because, on the one
hand, case studies and experiments are carried
out where losses are reputed problematic and the
results will therefore be higher than the national
average; and, on the other hand, the SUA/FBS
suffer from under-reporting by countries, which
set losses to nil even on highly perishable
products in the absence of information, and from
underestimation in inter view-based sur veys. t
An increase in the reported loss level must be
therefore expected with the improvement of
available data.

In many cases, the additional data allowed for
considering losses at the various stages and
then aggregating them to the national level.
Although imperfect, these additional studies add
necessar y variation and potential upper bounds
of what loss estimates may be in countries.
However, the studies are also part of a countr y’s
overall loss estimation strateg y in intermittent
data collection years and thus use inconsistent
data sources and methods.
The data have been used and extensively
described for the meta-analysis in Chapter 2.
They are organized in a database with many
metadata dimensions and a user quer y interface.
Links to the source document will be made
available to the public on FAO’s website. u

The estimation model had therefore to expand
its input data to include loss percentages by
stage from other available sources. However, this
information is not used in the place of officially
reported data; instead, it is used to inform the
loss model estimations.

Explanatory variables and their selection
A dataset of >200 possible explanator y variables
was created tapping from various international
databases (International Energ y Agency, World
Bank, FAO, etc.) to represent the numerous causal
factors from the literature. Different proxies at

Model assumptions

the national level as a means of measuring
micro-level effects could be grouped under
common themes to be managed by a single
model. The common themes were: energ y, inputs
and associated costs; investment and monetar y
policy; social and economic factors; storage,
transportation and logistics; weather and
crop cycles.

The model rests on a number of key assumptions:

Estimation of missing explanatory variable data
The explanator y variables time series are in some
cases incomplete or low-frequency. The model
fills in the missing data only after the Random
Forest selects the variables, so as not to bias the
time trends with potential smoothing efforts.

The Random Forests algorithm was used to
standardize the selection of variables and choose
the five most important ones, by commodit y
grouping. The purpose was to better capture
the variation in the causes of losses by countr y/
region and commodit y without limiting the
potential by setting few factors applied widely
without significance, as was the challenge
remaining from the Grünberger approach.

Use of clusters by commodity group and of a
hierarchy of models
In many instances, there are fewer than three
obser vations by countr y and commodit y, which
is considered a bare minimum to run the model
for a countr y–commodit y combination. In all
those cases, available information has been
clustered by commodit y group on the assumption
that causes and rates of losses are more similar
within the groups than across them (for example,
losses of maize and lentils are more similar
than losses of maize and fresh milk); the same
has been assumed for the t y pes of value chain
and solutions. Moreover, clustering scarce data
will even out the impact of potential outliers on
the results.

Model specifications
A widely used econometric model, the Random
Effects Model, has been chosen to exploit
the data in a cross-section – by commodit y
and countr y – and longitudinally over time.
The model assumes that the index-specific effect
(that is, the countr y-commodit y-specific effect)
is a random variable uncorrelated with the
explanator y variables selected. The model is
specified as:

The coexistence of countr y-level estimates and
cluster-level estimates requires a model hierarchy
to fill in the results matrix. The process protects
countr y-level official data and carr y-over data
(the cases where countries have in the past
reported the same estimates from year to year)
from being over-written by the model.

where:

y ijt is the percentage of food losses for the countr y
i, for a given commodit y, j, at time t

The model is then applied by countr y and
commodit y group, where loss data are available
for different commodities in each group, to
estimate the loss percentages for each of the five
commodit y groups. For example, if countr y A
needs an estimate for wheat losses, the model
draws on countr y A’s “cereals and pulses”
basket to create this estimate. This process
repeats for all countr y–commodit y and basket
combinations where there is information for the
other commodities in the basket. Each of these
estimations will use a different selection of
explanator y variables based on what is relevant
for that countr y–commodit y basket. For example,
losses in countr y A may be correlated with the

temperature and humidit y may be more highly
correlated with loss percentages.

Aggregation of loss factors by stage to the
whole supply chain and imputation of the
missing stages

In the remaining cases where a countr y does
not have any loss data for an entire commodit y
heading, then the loss estimates come from a
global model estimated by commodit y heading.
This indicates that countr y C’s loss estimates
may depend on what data are available in
countr y A and countr y B. In some cases, the
model may not perform well (e.g. when most
estimates are f lat carr y-overs) as no factors can
be correlated to the loss percentages. In these
cases, a simple average of available loss factors
by countr y-cluster is applied. Figure A2 illustrates
the model f low.

While the officially reported data cover
the whole supply chain, studies are rarely
carried out across multiple stages of the food
supply chain. To aggregate those loss factors
along the supply chain, a simplified Markov
process that assumes that losses at each point
are independent of each other was used.
Though losses may be caused by upstream
behaviour, the measured losses at each stage are
independent: for instance, losses due to poor
handling in processing have no relationship
with the losses that occurred in transportation.
This process needed to be standardized given
that studies would often add loss percentages
across supply stages and not account for

consumption) at each of the preceding stages.

been made to the FLI methodolog y where the
denominator in those cases is equal to domestic
production plus import quantities. Ver y low
percentages occur in some officially reported
data, with losses lower than 2 percent across the
whole supply chain.

In the case of some commodities, there was no
information at all for some stages of the supply
chain. For example, if countr y A measured losses
of x percent in maize-storage-2000 and not in
maize-storage-2001, losses in storage for 2001
would be considered as a zero. The Markov
aggregation process in these cases produced
biased results due to under-coverage over time.
Losses for missing stages of the value chain have
therefore been estimated using a simple ordinar y
least squares model with losses at each stage
based on countr y, commodit y or cluster, and
time, and integrated in the Markov chain where
the missing value was.

An evolving process
With all its limitations, the food loss estimation
model marks an important step for ward in
analysing, describing and estimating food
losses at commodit y, countr y and global level.
Contrar y to the FAO 2011 study on Food Losses
and Waste, 2 the model is entirely open-source
and estimates are reproducible. Moreover, the
model can incorporate new information as it
becomes available, including from new and
available literature, and be tailored to countries
without chang  the structure. The literature
rev iew is still ongoing and data from a large
number of studies are still to be added to the
input dataset. Additional information on more
countries and commodities certainly exists but
has not been accessed yet. The model itself
could be improved in some aspects, but the
risk is to over-eng ineer it until it produces
“expected” results on the same exceedingly
weak information base.

In other cases, more than one loss percentage was
available for the same year-country-commodity-stage
or year-country-cluster-stage combination.
A simple average has been used in these cases
before applying the simplified Markov process.

Final adjustments
In some cases, the input data may have been
considered as outliers both on the high and on
the low end of the distribution. Thresholds were
set to exclude those outliers from the model, at
three standard deviations below and above the
whole dataset.

The endeavour for the food losses and waste
stakeholders and communit y should rather be
to improve the loss data by supporting data
collection in the countries to build a sound
evidence base. Good-qualit y data will help in
making informed decisions and in achieving
national and global sustainabilit y targets.

Ver y high percentage losses can be found in
import-dependent countries, where loss
quantities of imported products are compared to
a small domestic production. An adjustment has

NOTES ON THE STATISTICAL ANNEX
KEY
The following conventions are used in the tables:
.. = not available
0 or 0.0 = nil or negligible
Numbers presented in Tables A2–A6 can be replicated
starting from the original data sources and then
following the operations of data management
implemented through the Stata software,
available upon request. To separate decimals
from whole numbers, a full point (.) is used.
For Tables A2–A6:
 The mean (or average) is the resulting number
determined by adding all the food loss and
waste estimates reported in each respective
variable (e.g. commodit y group as shown in
Table A2) and then dividing the total by the
number of obser vations.
 Median is the value separating the higher half
from the lower half of the food loss and waste
estimates for each respective variable.
 The standard deviation measures the dispersion
(i.e. the amount of variation) of the food loss
and waste estimates. A low standard deviation
signifies that the obser vations tend to be close
to the mean (or average) of each respective
variable.
 Minimum and maximum present the lowest and
highest food loss and waste estimates of each
variable, respectively.
 Total summarizes the statistics (obser vations,
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum
and maximum) for all of the food loss and
waste estimates.

Data collection methods used

Laboratory trials evaluate losses or waste via

The most used data collection method is the
survey, i.e. inter views with a defined set of
questions. Sur veys considered in the dataset
have a sampling methodolog y and a frame
predetermined to the collection of information.

random assignment after trials conducted not
in the field. Laborator y trials are done in a
fully controlled environment, often with small
sample sizes, and probably do not mimic the
conditions that would occur under normal
circumstances of practice.

The literature review method is when losses or waste
are based on findings from the literature.

Modelled estimates refer to estimation of losses
or waste via statistical models.

The expert opinion method consists in the advice,
belief or judgement given by an expert on the
losses or waste.

The World Resources Institute Protocol provides loss and
waste estimates. However, the protocol does
not predefine a method of data collection nor
does it require consistency across entities on
what data are collected. As such, entities doing
the measurement that use this protocol may
have comparable results over time, but results
may not be expandable for a wider sample
or population.

The rapid assessment data collection method can
be described as assessing a product via a
visual damage scale and then the estimation
of sample weight loss or waste by using
a simple equation. In the database, rapid
assessments include collecting information from
a variet y of stakeholders and sources, such as
semi-structured inter views, reviews of existing
estimates and development of the broad structure
and f low of a commodit y within a countr y.
They can focus on a specific group or area of the
supply chain and identif y critical loss points.
No direct measurement or systematic sur veying
across the wider population is done.

grey literature, national and sectoral reports, by

Source: see Table A2.

Observations count the number of food loss and
waste data points for each countr y as reported in
grey literature and national and sectoral reports,
excluding the officially reported loss estimates.

Case studies examine food losses or waste of
specific persons or groups over a period of
time. Case studies are often limited to a small
set of participants, which may or may not be
representative of the overall population.

as food moves along the food supply chain, the
retail stage has the largest carbon impact factor.
The carbon footprint of lost food is then
expressed as a multiplication of the lost food
quantities, in tonnes, provided by the model
developed for the FLI, and the correspondent
carbon impact factor. Minimum and maximum present
the lowest- and highest-impact factors for each

the average impact factor for each specific region
and food group, across the food supply chain.

The land footprint of lost food is then expressed
as a multiplication of the lost food quantities,

MOVING FORWARD ON FOOD LOSS
AND WASTE REDUCTION
The need to reduce food loss and waste is firmly embedded in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. Food loss and waste reduction is considered important for improving food security
and nutrition, promoting environmental sustainability and lowering production costs. However,
efforts to reduce food loss and waste will only be effective if informed by a solid understanding of
the problem.
This report provides new estimates of the percentage of the world’s food lost from production up to
the retail level. The report also finds a vast diversity in existing estimates of losses, even for the same
commodities and for the same stages in the supply chain. Clearly identifying and understanding
critical loss points in specific supply chains – where considerable potential exists for reducing food
losses – is crucial to deciding on appropriate measures. The report provides some guiding principles
for interventions based on the objectives being pursued through food loss and waste reductions, be
they in improved economic efficiency, food security and nutrition, or environmental sustainability.
