renowned expertise as an organization working
to prevent hunger and open humanitarian

Before the winter snows of 2021/2 cut access

The ‘dry corridors’ of Central America cracked
with heat, and farmers abandoned their lands to
head north with their families in tow. The World
Food Programme reached over 1.7 million
people in drought-stricken and famished
Madagascar. Even as flooding repeatedly
saturated the agricultural lands of South Sudan
beyond exhaustion, and swept valuable topsoil
from Ethiopia, drought distressed the desertifying
Sahel and the rest of the Horn of Africa.

At the November UN Climate Change
Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow, WFP

solutions:

natural buffers against climate change.
• Protect the most vulnerable with

• Anticipate climate hazards and act
early to prevent climate emergencies.
• Re-energize food systems to avoid
deforestation, carbon emissions
and to increase resilience and

to build the resilience of individuals, local
communities and national economies.
For example, an analysis in Eastern Africa, where
the World Food Programme spends around
US$600 million procuring food and warehousing
every year, shows that our pipeline generated
650,000 regional jobs. So wherever viable, our
trend is to purchase food as close to source as
possible, amplifying our local effect with each
neighbourhood purchase.
In this way the World Food Programme is
leveraging its huge service capacity of almost
21,000 staff, its partnerships with international
financial institutions and the private sector,
and its massive logistical and purchasing power
to refine and scale-up practices that support
small farmers, local markets and traders. The
same factors encourage eco-friendly farming
practices, and build resilience to shock in
communities so that people have improved
agency over their lives, even in the face of
disaster.

the most vulnerable first, and hits them
hardest. As pandemic economic injury
deepened through 2021, jobs were
wiped out, remittances from foreign
workers shrivelled, and US$3.7 trillion in
incomes was lost, with the poorest largely
bearing the brunt. In Kenya, for example,
unemployment doubled following
pandemic onset.

he starkest end of the economic

distress spectrum is sheer hunger.

Across 43 countries in 2021, 45 million
people faced the very real prospect of

famine, whilst the pandemic simultaneously
drove 283 million people into acute

food insecurity, almost double that of
pre-pandemic levels. The World Food

Programme increased specialised nutrition

treatment by 40 percent from 2020 to 2021
to alleviate pandemic malnutrition.

We delivered vital assistance to nearly

68 million women and girls and more than
60 million men and boys in greatest need.
The form of absolute poverty when the
cupboards are empty, savings finished,

borrowing capacity zeroed out, and domestic
work opportunities no longer possible,
isolates and leaves almost nowhere to

turn. The uncertainty and scale of the new

poverty created by conflict, climate, and the
economic shocks spurred by the pandemic
is driving new patterns of migration in

countries like Venezuela, where the World
Food Programme began a school-feeding

programme to mitigate childhood hunger,
and economic pain.

To protect their families, however, people move
when and if they can, if they must. By mid 2021,
the global number of forcibly displaced people
was close to 85 million, surpassing previous
record levels. Children below 18 years of age
made up 40 percent of that vast figure who
were largely forced to flee conflict.
The peripheral rural poor are the first to lose
their lands to climate change and conflict
and to move to cities or refugee camps, or to
emigrate altogether, eroding inter-generational
and indigenous land-management knowledge.
They become the peripheral urban poor who
are the first and likeliest to succumb to a lack of
nutritious and plentiful food. In city and country
alike, the poor are also the first to lose their
jobs, either as seasonal workers on land that
relies on rainfall, or as workers in the swollen
urban informal sector.

t has been worse for women. From 2019 to
2020, the pandemic pressed women deeper

into hunger and threw an extra 47 million into
extreme poverty. This was seeded by another
trend as the economic crisis produced by
the pandemic collapsed seminal commercial
enterprises created by first generations
of entrepreneurs in developing countries,
returning them to the hard scrabble
existences of their parents.
By mid-2021, for example, the World Bank
was reporting that the pandemic had reduced
4.7 million Latin American/Caribbean middleclass aspirants to vulnerability or outright
poverty. This reflected a cascading trend
throughout the world – in Lebanon, perhaps
most obviously – of a battered generation
of young people who would ordinarily have
raised the education standards and health of
their children, created jobs for the poor, paid
mortgages and loans, driven innovation, and
boosted national economies.
Although the world’s economy grew
throughout 2021, the effect of pandemic
disruption fell disproportionately on those
countries least able to withstand downturn. In
fragile and conflict-affected countries record
levels of debt sapped national budgetary
allocations available for welfare programmes.
From Liberia to Lebanon, and in 81 other
countries where we established or helped
maximise government-led social protection
schemes, the World Food Programme’s
household-level programmes assumed a
new level of importance as a bulwark against
poverty and hunger.

13

B

y December 2021 the cost of food had
swollen to a decadal high, and rising fuel

prices meant a consequent rise in procurement
and transportation costs, with no indication
that it would ebb. The World Food Programme
competes to purchase food on an open market,
so the budgetary squeeze led to sweeping ration
cuts across a range of programmes.

It is feared that these increases presage further
social and political unrest. More than 20 percent
of the world’s calories are obtained through
cross-border trade. Past history shows that
when the price of food rises in global markets,
the effect is felt in streets and marketplaces,
and in the loaves of subsidised bread which are
one of the few buffers for the urban poor in
impoverished and unstable countries like Egypt
and Lebanon.
Given these global conditions, and the growing
gap between available funding and need, the
World Food Programme increasingly calibrates
its work to the preservation of peace and the
combating of hunger by building community
resilience into our programmes and into local
and national food systems.

they need for bodily and brain development,
and that girls will pass educational attainment
on to their children in the form of better health
and education decisions, as well as a sense of
agency over their own lives. Working with the
government, WFP reached more than a million
children in Benin in pursuit of universal national
coverage by 2025.
But faced with the loss of access for hundreds
of millions of school children due to pandemic
school closures, the estimated 39 billion in-school
meals missed by children in 2020, and the first
downturn in beneficiary numbers in a decade, a
response came in the form of the 2021 launch
of the School Meals Coalition. This groundbreaking partnership orchestrated by the World
