Assumptions and Conventions

A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic
Outlook. It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates will remain constant at their average levels during July 30–August 27, 2009, except for the currencies participating in the European exchange
rate mechanism II (ERM II), which are assumed to remain constant in nominal terms relative to the
euro; that established policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about
fiscal and monetary policies for selected economies, see Box A1); that the average price of oil will be
$61.53 a barrel in 2009 and $76.50 a barrel in 2010, and will remain unchanged in real terms over the
medium term; that the six-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on U.S. dollar deposits will
average 1.2 percent in 2009 and 1.4 percent in 2010; that the three-month euro deposit rate will average 1.2 percent in 2009 and 1.6 percent in 2010; and that the six-month Japanese yen deposit rate will
yield an average of 0.7 percent in 2009 and 0.6 percent in 2010. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that
would in any event be involved in the projections. The estimates and projections are based on statistical information available through mid-September 2009.
The following conventions are used throughout the World Economic Outlook:
...

to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;

–	between years or months (for example, 2006–07 or January–June) to indicate the years or
months covered, including the beginning and ending years or months;
/

between years or months (for example, 2006/07) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.

“Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
“Basis points” refer to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent
to ¼ of 1 percentage point).
In figures and tables, shaded areas indicate IMF staff projections.
If no source is listed on tables and figures, data are drawn from the World Economic Outlook
(WEO) database.
When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size.
Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding.
As used in this report, the term “country” does not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is a
state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

Preface

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the
IMF’s surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments
in international financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and
policies is the product of a comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments,
which draws primarily on information the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member
countries. These consultations are carried out in particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely,
the African Department, Asia and Pacific Department, European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere Department—together with the Strategy, Policy, and
Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets Department; and the Fiscal Affairs Department.
The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction
of Olivier Blanchard, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Jörg
Decressin, Division Chief, Research Department.
The primary contributors to this report are Abdul Abiad, Ravi Balakrishnan, Petya Koeva Brooks,
Stephan Danninger, Antonio Fatás, Prakash Kannan, Daniel Leigh, Pau Rabanal, Alasdair Scott,
Marco Terrones, and Irina Tytell. Toh Kuan, Gavin Asdorian, Stephanie Denis, Angela Espiritu, Murad
Omoev, Andy Salazar, Min Kyu Song, Ercument Tulun, and Jessie Yang provided research assistance.
Mahnaz Hemmati and Emory Oakes managed the database and the computer systems. Jemille Colon,
Tita Gunio, Shanti Karunaratne, Patricia Medina, and Sheila Tomilloso Igcasenza were responsible for
word processing. Julio Prego provided graphics support. Other contributors include Irena Asmundson,
Kevin Cheng, Nese Erbil, Deniz Igan, Thomas Helbling, Armine Khachatryan, Heejin Kim, Prakash
Loungani, Shaun Roache, Jair Rodriguez, Marina Rousset, and Mika Saito. Charles Collyns and David
Romer of the Research Department provided advice and encouragement. Jordi Galí was an external
consultant, and Linda Griffin Kean of the External Relations Department edited the manuscript and
coordinated the production of the publication.
The analysis has benefited from comments and suggestions by staff from other IMF departments, as
well as by Executive Directors following their discussion of the report on September 16, 2009. However,
both projections and policy considerations are those of the IMF staff and should not be attributed to
Executive Directors or to their national authorities.

Joint Foreword to
World Economic Outlook and
Global Financial Stability Report
Foreword

The Recovery Has Started, and the
Challenge Is to Sustain It
The global economy is expanding again, and
financial conditions have improved markedly.
It will still take some time, however, until the
outlook for employment improves significantly.
Emerging and developing economies are
fur­t her ahead on the road to recovery, led by
a resurgence in Asia—in general, emerging
economies have withstood the financial turmoil
much better than expected based on past experience, which reflects improved policy frameworks. How­ever, gains in activity are now being
seen more broadly, including in the major
advanced economies. Financial market sentiment and risk appetite have rebounded, banks
have raised capital and wholesale funding markets have reopened, and emerging market risks
have eased.
The triggers for this rebound are strong public policies across advanced and emerging economies that, together with measures deployed by
the IMF at the international level, have allayed
concerns about systemic financial collapse, supported demand, and all but eliminated fears
of a global depression. These fears had contributed to the steepest drop in global activity
and trade since World War II. Central banks
reacted quickly with exceptionally large interest
rate cuts as well as unconventional measures to
inject liquidity and sustain credit. Governments
launched major fiscal stimulus programs, while
assessing their banks with stress tests and supporting them with guarantees and capital injections. And the IMF made use of its enhanced
lending capacity and more flexible facilities
to help emerging and developing economies
cope with the risks associated with the crisis.
Together, these measures reduced uncertainty
and increased confidence.

x

But complacency must be avoided. Despite
these advances, the pace of recovery is expected
to be slow and, for quite some time, insufficient
to decrease unemployment. Also, poverty could
increase significantly in a number of developing
economies where real GDP per capita is contracting in 2009 for the first time in a decade.
Activity may pick up quickly in the short term.
Yet the forces that are driving the current
rebound are partly temporary in nature, including major fiscal stimulus, central banks’ support
for credit markets, and restocking following
exceptionally large cutbacks in production and
drawdowns of inventories. These forces will
diminish during the course of 2010.
A further key constraint on the pace of recovery will be limits on credit availability. Bank
deleveraging will constrain the supply of bank
credit for the remainder of 2009 and into 2010
in both the United States and Europe, where
credit supply is even more bank-dependent.
Bank balance sheets have benefited from capital-raising efforts and positive earnings reports
but will remain under pressure as a result of
continuing credit deterioration. Our analysis
suggests that U.S. banks have recognized somewhat more than half their projected losses from
impaired assets through 2010. In Europe, loss
recognition is less advanced, reflecting differences in the economic cycle. Although stronger
bank earnings are supporting capital levels,
they are not expected to fully offset write-downs
over the next 18 months. Moreover, steady-state
earnings are likely to be lower in the postcrisis
environment, and reforms under way to bank
regulation are expected to reduce net revenues
and result in more costly self-insurance through
higher capital and liquidity requirements.
Projections for emerging economies assume
that capital flows, which took a major hit over
the past year, will stabilize or grow moderately.
Credit growth will continue to fall or stay at

Foreword

very low levels, and this will hold back investment, with the notable exception of China. Significant credit contraction is generally unlikely,
except in parts of emerging Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
Meanwhile, consumption and investment
are gaining strength only slowly, held back by
the need for balance sheet repair, high excess
capacity as well as financing constraints, and
rising unemployment, which is expected to
peak at over 10 percent of the labor force in
advanced economies. Consumption will be
particularly weak in advanced economies,
especially those that experienced credit booms,
housing bubbles, and large current account deficits, such as the United States and the United
Kingdom, and in a number of other (especially
emerging) European economies. U.S. consumers, in particular, are likely to maintain substantially higher saving rates than before the crisis.
Accordingly, the World Economic Outlook projects activity contracting by about 1 percent in
2009 and expanding by about 3 percent in 2010,
which is still well below rates achieved before
the crisis.
Downside risks remain a concern. The main
risk is that private demand in advanced economies remains very weak. If so, policymakers
may be confronted with the difficult choice
of either maintaining fiscal stimulus, raising
issues of debt sustainability, or phasing out the
fiscal stimulus, raising the danger of adverse
interactions between real activity, the health
of the financial sector, and the fiscal situation.
However, there is also potential for positive
surprises. Specifically, reduced fears about
a 1930s-style crash in activity and an accompanying strong rebound in financial market
sentiment could drive a larger-than-projected
short-term increase in consumption and
investment.

Policy Challenges
It is still too early for policymakers to relax
their efforts to restore financial sector health
and support demand with expansionary macro-

economic policies. The challenge is to ensure
that continued short-term support does not
distort incentives and endanger public balance sheets, with damaging consequences for
the medium term. Furthermore, policies must
begin to address key medium-term challenges,
including the need for reforming financial systems, boosting potential growth, and rebalancing the patterns of global demand.
Notwithstanding already large deficits and
rising public debt in many countries, fiscal
stimulus needs to be sustained until the recovery is on a firmer footing and may even need to
be amplified or extended beyond current plans
if downside risks to growth materialize. However, fiscal policy is likely to become increasingly less effective in supporting demand in
the absence of reassurances to investors and
taxpayers that deficits and debt will eventually
be rolled back. This is likely to require major
efforts to constrain spending by initiating
entitlement reforms and by committing to large
reductions in deficits once the recovery is on a
solid footing. The credibility of such reductions
could usefully be supported with more robust
fiscal frameworks, including suitable fiscal rules
and strong enforcement mechanisms that help
rein in spending pressures when good times
return.
The key issues facing monetary policymakers
are when to start tightening and how to unwind
large central bank balance sheets. Advanced
and emerging economies face different challenges. In advanced economies, central banks
can (with few exceptions) afford to maintain
accommodative conditions for an extended
period because inflation is likely to remain
subdued as long as output gaps remain wide.
Moreover, monetary policy will need to accommodate the impact of the gradual withdrawal of
fiscal support. If and when necessary, instruments exist to start tightening monetary conditions even while central bank balance sheets
remain much larger than usual. The pace at
which the buildup in central bank balance
sheets should be unwound depends on progress
in normalizing market conditions and the types

xi

Foreword

of interventions in place. Supported by appropriate pricing, short-term liquidity operations
are already unwinding naturally as market conditions improve. However, it could take much
longer to unwind the buildup in illiquid assets
on some central bank balance sheets.
The situation is more varied across emerging economies, but the moment for starting to
remove monetary accommodation is likely to
materialize sooner than in advanced economies. In some countries, warding off risks for
new asset price bubbles may call for greater
exchange rate flexibility, to allow monetary
policy tightening relative to easy stances in
advanced economies.
Policymakers face two major financial sector
challenges. The first is to ensure that markets
and banks can support economic recovery.
This calls especially for renewed efforts to
increase bank capital and repair bank balance
sheets. So far, only very partial progress has
been made on this front. Official stress tests
are important instruments through which the
condition of banks can be diagnosed in order
to design appropriate strategies for the recapitalization and restructuring of viable banks
and for the careful resolution of nonviable
banks. In addition, exit strategies from public
support need to be clearly articulated to help
guide markets. Programs need to be phased
out gradually, using market-based incentives to
encourage reduced reliance on public support.
Moreover, clarity on new capital regulation,
liquidity risk requirements, provisioning, and
accounting standards and, where possible,
agreement on resolution strategies are essential for banks to be able to determine how to
deploy their resources and which business lines
are likely to be profitable in the future.
The second challenge is to put in place
financial reforms that forestall a similar crisis
in the future. This will require a major overhaul of prudential policies, which must not be
jeopardized by growing confidence that the
greatest crisis dangers are past, or fears that
national competitive advantages might be lost,
or concerns that first-best solutions are beyond

xii

reach for technical reasons. Four issues deserve
particular attention. First, the perimeter of
regulation needs to be broadened and made
more flexible, covering all systemically important institutions alongside incentives to preclude further buildups of institutions currently
considered “too big or too connected to fail.”
Second, effective market discipline needs to
be encouraged through greater transparency
and disclosure and reform of governance in
financial institutions. Third, macroprudential
frameworks must induce banks to build more
buffers—by raising capital and making provisions in good times that can be used in bad
times. And, fourth, international collaboration and coordination need to be improved to
adequately cope with the challenges posed by
cross-border institutions. Looking forward, to
avoid a similar crisis, there is a need not just
for better rules—through enhanced regulation—but also for adequate enforcement of the
rules—through effective supervision—and for
prudent behavior by financial institutions—
through suitable internal risk-management
processes.

Rebalancing Global Demand
Achieving sustained healthy growth over the
medium term also depends critically on rebalancing the pattern of global demand. Specifically, many current account surplus economies
that have followed export-led growth strategies
will need to rely more on domestic demand
growth to offset likely subdued domestic
demand in deficit economies that have undergone asset price (stock and housing) busts. By
the same token, many external deficit countries
will need to rely less on domestic demand and
more on external demand. This will require significant structural reforms, many of which are
also necessary to boost potential output, which
has taken a hit as a result of the crisis. Key are
measures to repair financial systems, improve
corporate governance and financial intermediation, support public investment, and improve
social safety nets.

Foreword

With respect to social policies, rising
unemployment will present a major challenge
in many advanced economies that must be
met with support for incomes, retraining for
the jobless, and measures that facilitate wage
adjustment in response to shocks. The crisis
Olivier Blanchard
Economic Counsellor

has also been a setback to poverty-alleviation
efforts in many low-income economies, and
continued strong donor support will be
necessary to safeguard the major progress
these countries have made in stabilizing their
economies.

Executive Summary

After a deep global recession, economic growth has
turned positive, as wide-ranging public intervention has supported demand and lowered uncertainty
and systemic risk in financial markets. The recovery
is expected to be slow, as financial systems remain
impaired, support from public policies will gradually
have to be withdrawn, and households in economies
that suffered asset price busts will continue to rebuild
savings while struggling with high unemployment.
The key policy requirements remain to restore financial
sector health while maintaining supportive macroeconomic policies until the recovery is on a firm footing.
However, policymakers need to begin preparing for an
orderly unwinding of extraordinary levels of public
intervention.

Global Recession Is Ending, but a
Subdued Recovery Lies Ahead
The global economy appears to be expanding
again, pulled up by the strong performance
of Asian economies and stabilization or
modest recovery elsewhere. In the advanced
economies, unprecedented public intervention
has stabilized activity and has even fostered a
return to modest growth in several economies.
Emerging and developing economies are
generally further ahead on the road to recovery,
led by a resurgence in Asia. The recent
rebound in commodity prices and supportive
policies are helping many of these economies.
Many countries in emerging Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States have
been hit particularly hard by the crisis, and
developments in these economies are generally
lagging those elsewhere.
The pace of recovery is slow, and activity
remains far below precrisis levels. The pickup
is being led by a rebound in manufacturing
and a turn in the inventory cycle, and there are
some signs of gradually stabilizing retail sales,
returning consumer confidence, and firmer

xiv

housing markets. As prospects have improved,
commodity prices have staged a comeback from
lows reached earlier this year, and world trade is
beginning to pick up.
The triggers for this rebound are strong
public policies across advanced and many
emerging economies that have supported
demand and all but eliminated fears of a global
depression. These fears contributed to the
steepest drop in global activity and trade since
World War II. Central banks reacted quickly
with exceptionally large interest rate cuts as well
as unconventional measures to inject liquidity
and sustain credit. Governments launched major
fiscal stimulus programs while supporting banks
with guarantees and capital injections. Together,
these measures reduced uncertainty and
increased confidence, fostering an improvement
in financial conditions, as evidenced by strong
rallies across many markets and a rebound
of international capital flows. However, the
environment remains very challenging for lowertier borrowers. More generally, as emphasized in
the October 2009 Global Financial Stability Report
(GFSR), the risk of a reversal is a significant
market concern, and a number of financial
stress indicators remain elevated.
Looking ahead, the policy forces that are
driving the current rebound will gradually lose
strength, and real and financial forces, although
gradually building, remain weak. Specifically,
fiscal stimulus will diminish and inventory
rebuilding will gradually lose its influence.
Meanwhile, consumption and investment
are gaining strength only slowly, as financial
conditions remain tight in many economies.
Thus, after contracting by about 1 percent in
2009, global activity is forecast to expand by
about 3 percent in 2010, which is well below
the rates achieved before the crisis. These
projections reflect modest upward revisions to
those in the July 2009 WEO Update.

Executive Summary

• A
 dvanced economies are projected to
expand sluggishly through much of 2010,
with unemployment continuing to rise until
later in the year. Annual growth in 2010 is
projected to be about 1¼ percent, following
a contraction of 3½ percent in 2009. The
recovery of activity is more clearly evident
on a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter
basis: from 2009:Q4 to 2010:Q4, real GDP
is expected to rise by about 1¾ percent,
up from an expansion of about ½ percent
(annualized) during the second half of 2009
and a 2 percent contraction in the first half.
• In emerging economies, real GDP growth is
forecast to reach almost 5 percent in 2010,
up from 1¾ percent in 2009. The rebound
is driven by China, India, and a number of
other emerging Asian economies. Other
emerging economies are staging modest
recoveries, supported by policy stimulus
and improving global trade and financial
conditions.
Downside risks to growth are receding
gradually but remain a concern. The main
short-term risk is that the recovery will stall.
Premature exit from accommodative monetary
and fiscal policies seems a significant risk
because the policy-induced rebound might be
mistaken for the beginning of a strong recovery
in private demand. In general, the fragile global
economy still seems vulnerable to a range of
shocks, including rising oil prices, a virulent
return of H1N1 flu, geopolitical events, or
resurgent protectionism.
However, short-term risks are not only on the
downside, as evidenced by the recent, morerapid-than-expected improvement in financial
conditions. In particular, the policy-induced
reduction in fears about a 1930s-style crash in
activity and the accompanying strong rebound
in financial market sentiment might induce a
larger-than-expected surge in consumption and
investment across a number of advanced and
emerging economies.
Extending the horizon to the medium term,
there are other important risks to sustained

recovery, mainly in the major advanced
economies. On the financial front, a major
concern is that continued public skepticism
toward what is perceived as bailouts for the
very firms considered responsible for the
crisis undercuts public support for financial
restructuring, thereby paving the way to
a prolonged period of stagnation. On the
macroeconomic policy front, the greatest risk
revolves around deteriorating fiscal positions,
including as a result of measures to support the
financial sector.

Beyond 2010: Rebalancing the Global
Economy
Achieving sustained healthy growth over
the medium term will depend critically on
addressing the supply disruptions generated by
the crisis and rebalancing the global pattern of
demand.

Lower Potential Output
Financial firms will need to be restructured
and markets repaired to deliver adequate
credit for sustained increases in investment
and productivity, while labor will need to be
redeployed across sectors. Historical evidence
presented in Chapter 4 indicates that there were
typically large, permanent hits to output in the
aftermath of past financial crises, although the
extent is difficult to determine and there have
been a wide variety of outcomes. The current
medium-term output projections are indeed
on a much lower path than before the crisis,
consistent with a permanent loss of potential
output. Investment has already fallen sharply,
especially in the economies hit by financial
and real estate crises. Together with rising
scrap rates, as corporations go bankrupt or
restructure, this is reducing effective capital
stocks. In addition, unemployment rates
are expected to remain at high levels over
the medium term in a number of advanced
economies.

Executive Summary

Demand-Side Rebalancing
To complement efforts to repair the supply side
of economies, there must also be adjustments in
the pattern of global demand in order to sustain
a strong recovery. Specifically, many economies
that have followed export-led growth strategies
and have run current account surpluses will need
to rely more on domestic demand and imports.
This will help offset subdued domestic demand
in economies that have typically run current
account deficits and have experienced asset price
(stock or housing) busts, including the United
States, the United Kingdom, parts of the euro
area, and many emerging European economies.
To accommodate the shifts on the demand side,
there will need to be changes on the supply side
as well. This will require action on many fronts,
including measures to repair financial systems,
improve corporate governance and financial
intermediation, support public investment, and
reform social safety nets to lower precautionary
saving. Even with a strong commitment by all
countries to reform along these and other lines,
however, this process of rebalancing global
demand will be a drawn-out process and will
need to be supported by greater exchange rate
flexibility.

Policy Challenges
The key policy priorities remain to restore the
health of the financial sector and to maintain
supportive macroeconomic policies until the
recovery is on a firm footing, even though
policymakers must also begin preparing for an
eventual unwinding of extraordinary levels of
public intervention. The premature withdrawal
of stimulus seems the greater risk in the
near term, but developing the medium-term
macroeconomic strategy beyond the crisis is key
for maintaining confidence in fiscal solvency
and for price and financial stability. The
challenge is to map a middle course between
unwinding public interventions too early, which
would jeopardize the progress made in securing
financial stability and recovery, and leaving

xvi

these measures in place too long, which carries
the risk of distorting incentives and damaging
public balance sheets.

Timing the Tightening of Accommodative
Monetary Conditions
The key issues facing monetary policymakers
are when to start tightening and how to unwind
large central bank balance sheets. The two
objectives do not necessarily present major
conflicts, because instruments exist to start
tightening monetary conditions even while
balance sheets remain much larger than usual.
The pace at which the buildup in central bank
balance sheets should be unwound depends on
progress in normalizing market conditions and
the types of interventions in place.
Regarding the timing of monetary policy
tightening, advanced and emerging economies
face different challenges. In advanced
economies, central banks can (with few
exceptions) afford to maintain accommodative
conditions for an extended period because
inflation is likely to remain subdued as long as
output gaps remain wide. Moreover, monetary
policymakers will need to accommodate the
impact of the gradual withdrawal of fiscal
support. The situation is more varied across
emerging economies; in a number of these
economies it will likely be appropriate to
start removing monetary accommodation
sooner than in advanced economies. In some
economies, warding off risks for new asset price
bubbles may call for greater exchange rate
flexibility, to allow monetary policy tightening to
avoid importing an excessively easy policy stance
from the advanced economies.
As the October 2009 GFSR emphasizes,
continued central bank support will likely be
needed through at least next year in many
economies, and it could take much longer to
unwind the buildup in illiquid assets on some
central bank balance sheets. In the meantime,
central banks have tools available to absorb
reserves as needed to tighten monetary

Executive Summary

conditions. Looking beyond the short-term
challenges, what are some lessons of the crisis
for conducting monetary policy? Historical
evidence suggests that relatively stable inflation
and output growth offer little protection against
major shocks to the economy from bursting
asset price bubbles: output and inflation are
poor predictors of asset price busts. Chapter
3 shows that other variables, notably credit
growth and the current account balance,
are better predictors and may deserve more
attention from monetary policymakers. Thus,
if concerns mount about domestic demand and
asset prices, monetary policymakers should
consider tightening more than required purely
for the purpose of keeping inflation under
control over the coming year or two. The
chapter also argues that policymakers should
consider complementing inflation targeting
with the introduction of macroprudential tools
to help stabilize economies. Macroprudential
tools have the advantage of working directly to
lean against credit cycles and can therefore be
helpful in complementing the role of interest
rates in stabilizing economies. Expectations
of what can be achieved, however, need to be
realistic.

Maintaining Fiscal Support while Safeguarding
Fiscal Sustainability
Notwithstanding already large deficits and
rising public debt in many countries, fiscal
stimulus needs to be sustained until the
recovery is on a firm footing and may need
to be amplified or extended beyond current
plans if downside risks to growth materialize.
Governments should thus stand ready to roll
out new initiatives as necessary. At the same
time, they need to commit to large reductions
in deficits once the recovery is on a solid
footing and must start addressing long-term
fiscal challenges by advancing reforms to put
public finances on a more sustainable path.
The achievement of such reductions could
usefully be supported with more robust fiscal

frameworks, including suitable fiscal rules
and strong enforcement mechanisms. Such
frameworks and rules can play helpful roles
in reining in spending pressures when good
times return, thereby providing a degree
of reassurance to investors that deficits and
debt eventually will be rolled back. This is
essential to again create significant room
for countercyclical policy and rebuild public
support for financial markets, both of which will
be needed to respond to future shocks.

Healing Financial Sectors while Reforming
Prudential Frameworks
Completing financial sector repair and
reforming prudential frameworks are
indispensable for a return to sustained growth.
Restructuring financial firms’ activities is
key to a resumption of normal lending. As
explained in more depth in the October 2009
GFSR, this will require balance sheet cleansing,
recapitalization, and new business plans that
are consistent with new funding models and
new prudential frameworks. So far, there has
been only very limited progress in removing
impaired assets from bank balance sheets. The
main challenge now is ongoing deterioration
of asset quality. In this regard, official stress
tests are important instruments through which
the condition of banks can be diagnosed in
order to design appropriate strategies for
the recapitalization and restructuring of
viable banks and for the careful resolution of
nonviable banks. On this front, progress across
countries has been uneven, and it is a source
of concern that support for recapitalization
faces political obstacles. Exit strategies need to
be clearly articulated to help guide markets.
Banks face a “wall of maturities” in the next two
years, increasing rollover risks. In this setting,
programs need to be phased out very gradually,
using market-based incentives to encourage
reduced reliance on public support.
Regarding fundamental reform, the
achievement of a major overhaul must not

xvii

Executive Summary

be jeopardized by growing confidence that
the greatest crisis dangers are past, fears that
national competitive advantages might be lost,
or concerns that first-best solutions are out of
reach for technical reasons. As the October
2009 GFSR emphasizes, four challenges deserve
particular attention. First, the perimeter
of regulation needs to be broadened and
made more flexible, covering all systemically
important institutions alongside incentives
to preclude further buildup of institutions
currently considered “too big or too connected
to fail.” Second, effective market discipline
needs to be encouraged through greater
transparency and disclosure and reform of
governance in financial institutions. Third,
macroprudential frameworks must induce
banks to build more buffers—by raising
capital and making provisions in good times
that can be used in bad times. And, fourth,
international collaboration and coordination
need to be improved to adequately cope
with the challenges posed by cross-border
institutions.

xviii

Structural and Social Policy Challenges
Rising unemployment will present a major
challenge in many advanced economies,
and poverty will continue to challenge many
developing economies. The evidence in
Chapter 4 suggests that unemployment rates
typically tend to rise significantly and remain
higher for many years after financial shocks.
Limiting the extent of job destruction will
require slower wage growth or even wage cuts
for many workers. The impact of the necessary
adjustments on poorer segments of the labor
force could be cushioned with earned income
tax credits or similar programs that limit the
social repercussions of wage adjustment. In
addition, better job matching and education
and training can help limit job and wage losses.
Poverty could increase significantly in a number
of developing economies, notably in sub-Saharan
Africa, where real GDP per capita is contracting
in 2009 for the first time in a decade. Continued
donor support from advanced economies will be
crucial if these economies are to sustain hardwon macroeconomic stability gains.

The Global Recession Is Ending

Global Prospects and Policies

After a deep global recession, economic growth has
turned positive, as wide-ranging public intervention
has supported demand and lowered uncertainty and
systemic risk in financial markets. Nonetheless, the
recovery is expected to be slow, as financial systems
remain impaired, support from public policies will
gradually have to be withdrawn, and households in
economies that suffered asset price busts will continue
to rebuild savings. Risks to the outlook remain on
the downside. Premature exit from accommodative
monetary and fiscal policies is a particular concern
because the policy-induced rebound might be mistaken
for the beginning of a strong recovery. The key requirement remains to restore financial sector health while
maintaining supportive macroeconomic policies until
the recovery is on a firm footing. At the same time,
policymakers need to begin preparing for an orderly
unwinding of extraordinary levels of public intervention. Policies also need to facilitate a rebalancing of
global demand, because economies that experienced
asset price busts will need to raise saving rates, and
there is a need to bolster potential growth in advanced
economies, which has suffered as a result of the major
financial shocks. Rising unemployment and setbacks
to progress in poverty reduction pose social challenges
that also must be addressed.

The Global Recession Is Ending
The global economy appears to be expanding again, pulled up by the strong performance
of Asian economies and stabilization or modest
recovery elsewhere (Figure 1.1). Nonetheless,
the pace of recovery is slow, and activity remains
far below precrisis levels. Growth is being led by
a rebound in manufacturing and a turn in the
inventory cycle, and there are some signs of gradually stabilizing retail sales, returning consumer
confidence, and firmer housing markets. As
prospects have improved, commodity prices have
staged a comeback from lows reached earlier this
year, and world trade is beginning to pick up.

The triggers for this rebound are strong public policies across advanced and many emerging
economies that have supported demand and
all but eliminated fears of a global depression.
These fears had contributed to the steepest
drop in global activity and trade since World
War II (Figure 1.2; Box 1.1). Central banks
reacted quickly with exceptionally large interest
rate cuts as well as unconventional measures to
inject liquidity and sustain credit. Governments
launched major fiscal stimulus programs, while
supporting banks with guarantees and capital
injections. Together, these measures reduced
uncertainty and increased confidence, fostering
an improvement in financial conditions.
The key question is, how far will this initial
rebound go? Specifically, is it a harbinger of a
strong recovery? Or is a renewed recession in
the offing over the next year as expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies lose impetus and
private demand fails to gain momentum in the
face of limited credit? The projections in this
World Economic Outlook (WEO) describe an intermediate path: there is a recovery, but it will be
weak by historical standards.
According to these forecasts, the current
rebound will be sluggish, credit constrained,
and, for quite some time, jobless. Global growth
is projected to reach about 3 percent in 2010,
following a contraction in activity of about
1 percent in 2009 (Table 1.1). During 2010–14,
global growth is forecast to average just above
4 percent, appreciably less than the 5 percent
growth rates in the years just ahead of the
crisis. Financial and corporate restructuring will
continue to exert considerable downward pressure on activity, and wide output gaps will help
keep inflation at low levels. Demand is likely to
be dampened by the need in many advanced
economies to rebuild savings. Downside risks
to growth are receding gradually but remain a
concern.

Improving, but Still Difficult, Financial Conditions

The remainder of this chapter discusses
global economic developments and policy challenges in more depth. The next section reviews
the forces of contraction and expansion that
will determine the shape of the recovery over
the short term. This is followed by a discussion
of medium-term prospects for potential output
growth and a rebalancing of global demand.
The subsequent sections discuss the risks to
recovery and the macroeconomic, financial,
and structural policy priorities for bringing the
global economy back onto a healthy growth trajectory. Chapter 2 explores these themes from a
regional perspective.

Deleveraging and Slow Job Growth
Ahead
Recent data suggest that the world economy
has begun to enter recovery. Global activity
is estimated to have risen by about 3 percent
during the second quarter of 2009, following
a 6½ percent contraction in the first quarter,
and high-frequency indicators point to stronger
growth in the second half of the year. Nonetheless, firms are still going bankrupt at a high rate,
employment continues to drop, and private
consumption and investment remain anemic
as households struggle with income and wealth
losses, firms operate with large excess capacity,
and lending conditions remain tight. History
suggests that these forces tend to be long lasting following financial crises, entailing sluggish
recoveries after periods of sharply contracting
activity (see Chapter 3 of the October 2008
World Economic Outlook). Policies have helped
cushion the impact of these forces on growth,
but policy stimulus will diminish in the future.

Improving, but Still Difficult, Financial
Conditions
The nascent recovery is most evident in financial markets, although conditions are still very
difficult for many borrowers. Public intervention, low policy interest rates, and expectations
for recovery have spurred strong rallies in many

markets as well as a rebound in international
capital flows (Figure 1.3). Initially, the main
driver was public policy, including guarantees
for financial institutions, capital injections,
provision of ample liquidity, and intervention in
credit markets. Now, improving growth prospects are beginning to feed back into financial
conditions, with declining risk aversion adding
further momentum. However, the environment
remains very challenging for lower-tier borrowers, notably small and medium-size enterprises
and many households, as emphasized in the
October 2009 Global Financial Stability Report
(GFSR). Securitization markets are still heavily
impaired, which severely limits banks’ capacity
to originate (and distribute) credit. More generally, the risk of a reversal is a significant market
concern, and a number of financial stress indicators remain elevated.
Since the first quarter of 2009, equity markets
have posted strong gains, corporate risk spreads
have declined, and spreads in interbank markets
have fallen to levels fairly close to those prevailing before the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
in September 2008. Investors are allocating an
increasing amount of funds away from government bonds in search of higher yields. Confidence in advanced economy banking systems
has received a fillip from better-than-expected
earnings results and a series of successful bank
capital raisings. In addition, stress-testing exercises, completed and published in the United
States and ongoing in various other countries,
are helping to rebuild trust in banks. Still, questions remain about the sustainability of bank
earnings and the implications of elevated credit
risks, with loan delinquencies continuing to
increase and delays by banks in recognizing loan
losses.
International capital flows have recovered,
including to emerging markets (Figure 1.4).
Since the beginning of the year, sovereign
spreads are down and sovereign issues are up for
both advanced and emerging economies, consistent with a noticeable pickup in portfolio flows.
The recovery in activity has been better than
expected, which has buoyed market sentiment,

Improving, but Still Difficult, Financial Conditions

particularly in Asia and Latin America. Since
midyear, emerging market corporate and sovereign deals have been oversubscribed and refinancing risks have fallen sharply, although less
so in emerging Europe and the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS). As in mature markets, high-quality corporate borrowers can access
funding fairly easily, but the borrowing capacity
of those with weaker credit is more constrained.
Notwithstanding these favorable market developments, vulnerabilities remain, especially in
emerging Europe and other countries heavily
dependent on external financing. Cross-border
funding for emerging market banks remains
vulnerable to the need for mature-market banks
to further deleverage. Refinancing and default
risks in the corporate sector continue to be relatively high, especially in emerging Europe, but
also for smaller, leveraged corporations in Asia
and Latin America.
The return of some appetite for risk in international markets has contributed to depreciation of the dollar and yen and appreciation
of emerging market currencies. This followed
sharp movements in the opposite direction at
the height of the crisis (Figure 1.5). The euro
recently strengthened against both the dollar
and the yen, although it has held more or less
steady at the level prevailing before the crisis
in nominal effective terms. The renminbi has
moved in line with the dollar over the past year.
Even with improving financial market conditions, however, many households and firms
in both advanced and emerging economies
will continue to face difficult conditions. In
particular, bank loans to the private sector are
still stagnating or contracting in the United
States, the euro area, and the United Kingdom,
consistent with surveys among bank loan officers
that point to a continuation of very tight credit
conditions. Using revised methodologies, the
October 2009 GFSR estimates that global bank
write-downs could reach $2.8 trillion, of which
$1.5 trillion has yet to be recognized. The bulk
of these losses are attributable to U.S., U.K., and
euro area banks. Furthermore, these banks face
a wall of maturing debt, which will reach $1.5

Figure 1.3. Developments in Mature Credit Markets
Public intervention has fostered a significant improvement in financial conditions.
Nonetheless, for most households and firms credit will continue to be difficult to
obtain, as evidenced by still-tight bank lending conditions and high interest rates on
lower-quality credit.

trillion by 2012. At the same time, markets for
securitized products remain essentially broken
or heavily reliant on public support, which is
a particular concern in the United States and
other economies where these markets have a
major influence on the general availability of
credit.
Deleveraging is thus likely to continue for
a considerable period in the United States,
the euro area, and the United Kingdom. The
current outlook for these areas presumes that
nonfinancial private sector credit will contract
or barely grow during the remainder of 2009
or the first part of 2010, consistent with GFSR
estimates. Conditions may ease sooner in the
United States, where banks have delevered
faster. Because risk premiums remain elevated
on high-yield securities and bank lending
standards remain tight, financing conditions
for many (particularly small and medium-size)
enterprises and consumers will remain very
difficult.
Projections for emerging economies assume
that capital flows, which took a major hit over
the past year, will again begin to grow broadly
in line with GDP. Credit growth will continue to
fall or stay at very low levels, and this will hold
back investment, with the notable exception of
China. Significant credit contraction is generally
unlikely, except in parts of emerging Europe
and the CIS, where debt markets are open only
to some major corporations and banks and
where financial systems are still early in the
process of recovering from major credit busts.
In general, emerging economies have withstood
the financial turmoil much better than expected
based on past experience, which reflects
improved policy frameworks (Box 1.2).

Sluggish Real Sector Dynamics
The rebound in activity in the real sector
is lagging that in the financial sector and will
remain subdued over the coming year, particularly in advanced economies. The current recovery in activity is substantially driven by a turn in
the inventory cycle, after the sharp destocking

Sluggish Real Sector Dynamics

that came with the abrupt halt of production
at the peak of the crisis. Public policies have
successfully improved confidence, demand,
and financial conditions, and this has helped
industrial production to stabilize and even to
increase in a growing number of countries,
notably in Asia. As a result, demand for commodities has increased, and with it real sector
activity in a number of other emerging economies, boosting international trade. However, in
major advanced economies, spare capacity is
high and still rising, and household finances are
under pressure. Therefore, firms will be cautious
about investment, and households will increase
their consumption of durables and housing very
gradually. Furthermore, many firms and households will continue to struggle to repay debt,
which will slow the recovery in housing and
financial markets. Subdued demand in advanced
economies will hold back the recovery of activity
in emerging economies.
Faced with low demand, weak revenue, large
excess capacity, and tight credit conditions, nonfinancial corporations in advanced economies
are likely to continue to lay off workers. In the
United States, the unemployment rate climbed
by over 4 percentage points during the past year
to a 26-year high of 9.7 percent in August and
is projected to exceed 10 percent by early 2010.
Starting from a higher level, the rate in the euro
area rose by 2 percentage points to 9½ percent.
Countries that experienced particularly large
real-estate-related shocks, for example, Ireland
and Spain, have seen much larger increases in
unemployment because of the sharp contraction in construction jobs. The more moderate
increase in the unemployment rate in Europe
reflects these economies’ greater tendency
to adjust payrolls in response to changes in
demand by lowering hours worked rather than
the number of workers, a practice encouraged
in part by labor market policies and institutions
(Box 1.3). However, because the euro area is
expected to make only a sluggish recovery, more
job cuts are likely.
Saving rates are likely to stay high, investment
rates low, and labor markets weak. Any substan-

Figure 1.5. External Developments
(Index, 2000 = 100; three-month moving average unless otherwise noted)
Growing risk appetite has accompanied dollar and yen depreciation. Nonetheless,
both currencies remain appreciated relative to precrisis levels, whereas those of
emerging economies have mostly depreciated, which reflects in part the limited use
of currency reserves to buffer external shocks.

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

Box. 1.1. Trade Finance and Global Trade: New Evidence from Bank Surveys
The collapse in trade during the crisis was
attributed in part to a lack of credit to exporters and importers. Increased uncertainty led
exporters and importers to switch from less
secure forms of trade finance to more formal
arrangements. Exporters increasingly asked
their banks for export credit insurance (ECI)
or asked importers to provide letters of credit
(LCs, a bank’s certification that the importer
can pay). This increase in the demand for trade
credit was assumed to be partly offset by the
fact that some merchants switched from bankfinanced trade credit to more general loans, as
importers were asked to pay for goods before
shipment and exporters sought more liquidity
to smooth their cash flow. Anecdotes abounded,
but there was a lack of information on the
extent and types of changes in the demand and
supply of trade finance.
To fill this information gap the IMF worked
with the Bankers’ Association for Finance and
Trade to initiate a series of surveys of banks
on factors affecting the supply of and demand
for trade credit. This box reports the results of
a survey comparing conditions in the second quarter of 2009 with those in the fourth
quarter of 2008, and conditions in the fourth
quarter of 2008 with those in the fourth quarter of 2007. Participants in this survey included
a wide range of advanced and emerging market
banks. This was the third survey, completed in
July and coordinated by FIMetrix.
The survey results suggest that the downturn
in trade largely reflected falling demand rather
than a lack of trade finance. Trade generally fell

increases in employment appears a long way

by much more than trade finance during 2008
and the first half of 2009, including in the areas
hit hardest by the crisis (industrial economies,
emerging Europe, Latin America, and—in the
first half of 2009—emerging Asia). Correspondingly, six of seven banks pointed to a decrease
in trade as the main driver of the decrease in
their trade finance activities, and about half also
indicated that lower commodity prices contributed to the fall in the value of their trade finance
activities. There is, however, some evidence of a
separate effect from credit conditions: four of ten
banks also cited limited credit at their own banks
as a reason for lower trade finance activity, and
a similar proportion identified a lack of credit at
counterparty banks as a constraint.
Research on the behavior of trade elasticities during downturns also points to demand,
rather than trade finance, as a key driver of the
downturn. Recent work by Freund (2009) shows
that the responsiveness of trade to GDP has
increased over time, with elasticities of more
than 3.5 during this decade (first figure). The
pattern of trade responses across economies
also points to increased flexibility: Germany
and Japan experienced much larger declines
than expected given their diversified export
bases and broad access to financial markets.
Correspondingly, the rebound may be sharper,
and recent data seem to bear this out.
The cost of trade credit also rose during the
crisis. Higher funding costs and increased risk
continue to put upward pressure on the price of
trade credit, for which the increase in demand
has been the largest. Even so, the upward price
pressures seem to be easing for some instruments, with increasing evidence that the collapse
in trade is bottoming out, as demand starts to
recover and banks become more positive about

their demand for housing. In addition, saving
will increase to help rebuild net household
wealth. This is particularly true in the United
States and the United Kingdom, where household debt is relatively high, house prices have
fallen considerably, and asset price changes tend

the economic outlook. For example, price
increases have started to ease for ECI and LCs
(possibly also reflecting competition from official
lending bodies whose resources were enhanced).
The shift toward bank-intermediated trade
finance appears to be continuing. Surveyed
banks estimate that open account transactions
(for which exporters provide credit directly to
importers) continued to shrink as a share of
the total, to less than 40 percent in the second
quarter of 2009, from 45 percent at the end of
2007. This has been largely offset by the increasing reliance of traders on bank finance—mainly
LCs—as well as by a more modest shift toward
cash-in-advance transactions (for which importers pay for goods before shipment). These
trends appear to reflect increased risk aversion
on the part of both nonfinancial corporations
(the decline in the share of open accounts)
and banks (increased margins driving some to
cash-in-advance transactions), and as such may
reflect a more permanent switch in the nature
of trade financing (second figure).

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

Box 1.2. Were Financial Markets in Emerging Economies More Resilient than in Past Crises?
Given the intensity of the global crisis, financial markets in emerging economies have been
remarkably resilient. Although many financial
institutions in the advanced economies engaged
in significant deleveraging, the ruptures in capital markets did not lead to widespread sudden
stops of capital flows, and emerging economies
with large near-term debt-rollover requirements,
such as Turkey, managed to finance such debt
relatively well.
The broader economic disruptions in the
emerging economies were far from negligible,
however. Stock markets fell drastically in the
aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy,
primary funding markets ceased to function
for some months, exchange rates came under
severe pressure in some regions, and sovereign spreads widened. This box explores how
financial markets in emerging economies fared
compared with past crises and what might
explain any differences (the analysis builds on
the approach developed in Chapter 4 of the
April 2009 World Economic Outlook).
To gauge the resilience of financial markets
in emerging economies, we track developments
in the Emerging Markets Financial Stress Index
(EM-FSI) during the current crisis and during
past crises. The EM-FSI measures disruptions
in financial intermediation by assessing market
signals in various segments of an economy’s
financial system, including securities markets,
the banking system, and foreign exchange markets.1 By comparing how this index has evolved
around the peak of the current crisis with its
pattern around past crises, differences in financial market responsiveness can be determined
for emerging economies as a whole and by

The main author of this box is Stephan Danninger.
1For a description of the EM-FSI and the corresponding index for the advanced economies (AE-FSI),
see Balakrishnan and others (2009). The index measures the intensity of stress in the various segments as
the deviation from past averages of prices, returns, or
volatility indices. The index does not cover corporate bond spreads (CEMBI) due to limited time and

subsided from historical highs during the first
months of 2009. Interestingly, the stress index
shows increased resilience across all emerging
regions during the current crisis. The bottom
panels compare the EM-FSI during the current
and past crises in advanced economies––the
collapse of Long-Term Capital Management
in 1998, the dot-com crash in 2000, and the
U.S. corporate crises (WorldCom, Enron, and
Arthur Andersen defaults) in 2002––adjusted
for the higher level of stress in advanced
economies during the current event.2 Two
results stand out: (1) financial stress rose much
less compared with past global episodes, and
(2) financial market resilience was observed in
all emerging regions (lower left-hand panel).
These findings were confirmed in a more stringent econometric analysis (see Balakrishnan
and others, 2009).
To better understand the forces driving this
increased resilience, the differences in response
were separated according to the various components of the financial sector: foreign exchange
markets, sovereign debt markets, the banking
sector, and equity markets (lower right-hand
panel). Four of the five components show less
responsiveness during the current crisis; only
banking sector stress rose, albeit moderately.
Because the current crisis is concentrated in
the banking sector, the muted increase in stress
in this sector is somewhat surprising. The stress
response in exchange markets was less strong
but broadly the same as in the past. The main
contributors to the increased resilience during
this crisis were a considerably more moderate
widening of sovereign debt spreads and a less
sharp increase in equity market volatility. The
latter may reflect the fact that earlier crises were
centered primarily in the securities markets.
The resilience of sovereign debt markets during
the current crisis, however, appears to be an
important new development.
2The regional EM-FSIs for the current crisis were
scaled by the intensity of financial stress in advanced
economies to obtain comparable responsiveness measures between past and current crises.

What could explain the uniformly more
moderate stress response of financial markets
in emerging economies? The fact that the more
muted financial market response occurred in
all emerging regions could indicate that global
developments may have played a role, although
limited country coverage within some regions
hides important variations (for example, the
Baltic economies experienced large financial
turmoil but are not in the sample). Focusing
on the available sample, two factors could have
moderated the stress response in sovereign debt
markets, exchange markets, and the banking sector: (1) improved macro conditions in
emerging economies, such as higher foreign
reserves or fiscal balances; and (2) declining
foreign currency exposure among borrowers
in emerging economies, which was a source
of stress during past crises. The analysis first
examines whether these variables exhibit a common trend across regions and then assesses the
extent to which they can explain differences in
resilience across economies.
The two upper panels of the second figure
depict trends in fiscal balances and foreign
reserves coverage rates across emerging regions.
Over the past decade, fiscal vulnerabilities have
decreased in most regions and could explain
the more limited response of sovereign debt
spreads. Similarly, growing reserve buffers may
have helped prevent greater exchange market pressure. Further empirical analysis using
country-by-country data suggests that rising fiscal balances are associated with a lower financial
stress response but there is no strong association
with changes in foreign reserves.
The lower left-hand panel depicts trends in
local currency lending by foreign banks and
domestic subsidiaries in different emerging
regions (share of local currency lending in overall foreign lending) to capture the willingness of
foreign investors to bear an economy’s currency
risk. The share of local currency lending has
risen in all regions and may reflect the development of more stable financial systems and the
implementation of stronger macroeconomic
policy frameworks, leading to lower perceived

variable complements the association between
resilience and stronger fiscal balances.3
Finally, it may be surprising that financial
sectors in emerging Europe were as resilient as
those in emerging Asia or Latin America, even
though many emerging European economies
entered the crisis with weaker macroeconomic
fundamentals. One reason is that the available
sample omits many of the vulnerable economies
in emerging Europe. Another is that investor
exposure to emerging Europe was very large in
individual economies (Austria, Belgium) and
was generally concentrated in the banking sector (lower right-hand panel). As a result, efforts
to coordinate the policy response, for instance
through multilateral support by the European
Union and international financial institutions
(European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund, and others), may have led lenders
to agree to retract more gently from financial
markets in the region to avoid adverse repercussions from an abrupt slowdown.
In sum, the global crisis severely strained the
financial systems of emerging economies but
by less than would have been indicated by past
patterns of financial stress transmission. Stronger fiscal balances and more limited foreign
currency exposure among borrowers could
have strengthened these economies’ resilience,
although efforts to coordinate the response of
investors, especially in emerging Europe, may
also have helped limit the fallout.

Box 1.3. Will the Recovery Be Jobless?
The response of unemployment during the
current global recession has been very different
across economies and regions. In the United
States, the unemployment rate has risen by
nearly 5 percentage points, to levels not seen
since the early 1980s. In contrast, in Germany,
despite a major drop in output, the unemployment rate has increased only by ¾ percentage
point and remains well below levels seen earlier
this decade. This box tries to explain such differences for advanced and emerging economies
by comparing current dynamics with those seen
around past cycles.
We follow the approach of Chapter 3 of
the October 2009 World Economic Outlook and
compare current labor market dynamics with
those around previous recessions.1 However, we
do not look solely at employment dynamics but
also at labor productivity and labor participation
dynamics.2 This allows us to get a fuller picture
of what is driving output per capita. Specifically,
we make use of the fact that the logarithm of
output per capita is equal to the sum of the
logarithms of labor force participation, the
employment rate, and output per employee:
Y

Dlog — = Dlog — + Dlog ——

where Y is real GDP, P is population, E is

and t = 0 is the point at which real GDP reaches a
peak.
2Labor productivity is usually measured here as output per employee because of the lack of comparable
data on hours worked for many advanced and emerging economies. However, when comparing German
and U.S. labor dynamics, we measure labor productivity as output per hour.

further decompose output per employee:

This allows us to examine how economies
adjusted to recent shocks. Has employment
adjusted more quickly during this recession?
Or is labor hoarding more prevalent than in
previous recessions, with productivity initially
taking a bigger hit and employment declining
only marginally or slowly over time? How uniform are these responses across economies? We
apply the decomposition to both advanced and
emerging economies, and then use richer data
available on labor market institutions and across
sectors to take a deeper look at employment
dynamics in the advanced economies.
Labor Hoarding or Employment Losses: Which
Dominates after a Recession?
As shown in the first figure, during past
recessions, the employment rate declines and
labor productivity (as measured by output
per employee) growth slows, with the latter
even turning negative for the average emerging economy, consistent with labor hoarding.4
During the current crisis, there has been a
much bigger impact on output per capita, both
in advanced and emerging economies. This is
driven mainly by a significantly larger fall in
output per employee, which suggests that labor
hoarding has been much higher on average
during this recession.
However, there is considerable heterogeneity
across countries (second figure). For example,
among advanced economies, the United States
shows a pattern opposite to that of the median
country: employment has been cut deeply,
helping to maintain labor productivity (whether
defined as output per hour or per employee),
with little difference in the dynamics of labor
force participation. Indeed, during the second
quarter of 2009, U.S. nonfarm output per hour
grew at its fastest pace in six years (seasonally
adjusted annual rate). This is similar to the

worked. This allows us to see which margin is being
adjusted: hours worked per employee or employment
levels.

so are not discussed in detail.

dynamics of U.S. output per hour following the
previous recession, in 2001, which was followed
by a so-called jobless recovery, and contrasts
with most earlier recessions, when output per
hour declined considerably. U.S. employment
losses during the current cycle have been significantly larger than for the 2001 recession, or any
previous recession. Hours worked per employee
have also fallen significantly, but in line with
previous cycles.
At the other extreme, Germany, which has
also faced an output decline much deeper than
during previous recessions, has so far experienced substantially fewer employment losses
when compared with previous recessions or with
the United States. Output per hour has taken a
deep hit, despite hours per employee being cut
sharply. This pattern may have been affected by
subsidies for part-time work (Kurzarbeitergeld)—
the availability of which has been lengthened
from 6 to 24 months—and by special provisions
in collective wage agreements.
Among the emerging economies, during past
cycles, southeast Asia tended to demonstrate
smaller adjustments in employment and thus
had more volatility in output per employee;
emerging Europe displayed the opposite pattern. This time around, emerging Europe faces
a massive output adjustment, implying declining
output per employee, as well as major employment losses. In southeast Asia, employment
losses have been minor so far, even relative
to previous cycles, whereas in Latin America,
there appears to have already been a significant
adjustment on the employment margin (third
figure).
Can Labor Market Institutions and Regulations
Explain the Differences across Advanced Economies?
To explain the heterogeneity, we examine
the impact of labor market flexibility, which
has many dimensions, such as the types of
wage-bargaining arrangements and the level
and duration of unemployment benefits. A
comprehensive analysis of all facets of labor
market flexibility is beyond the scope of this
analysis. Instead, we focus on employment

is produced annually and generally goes back
to the mid-1980s. It is a summary indicator, which
weighs 14 subcomponents of EPL (on dismissal procedures for regular contracts and the use of temporary
contracts).
6Of course, many economies have significantly
reduced EPL since the mid-1980s (and have made the
labor market more flexible in general). However, this
doesn’t affect the ranking. Moreover, as a robustness
check, we examine whether the responses around
previous recessions are different before and after the
late 1980s, and find that they are quite similar.

protection legislation (EPL), which should be
especially important during the current crisis.
Research indicates that, although the effect of
stricter EPL on the steady-state employment
rate is not clear, it could slow the reallocation
of labor after major shocks. Of course, EPL may
be correlated with other characteristics of labor
markets that can affect employment, such as
unionization, collective wage bargaining, and
various programs to support the unemployed
(including subsidies for part-time employment),
and EPL could therefore act as a proxy for
other labor market characteristics.
Given the lack of data on EPL measures for
emerging economies, we focus on advanced
economies. We group such economies by
their degree of EPL, which we measure by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development’s index of EPL strictness.5 Economies are ranked according to their average EPL
score during 1985–2007. Canada, the United
Kingdom, and the United States are designated
as having “low” EPL, and all other advanced
economies are designated as having “medium/
high” EPL.6
The third figure shows the different dynamics of labor productivity (measured by output
per employee) and the employment rate
across the two groups of advanced economies,
during previous recessions and currently. The
drop in output per employee is substantial for
both groups in the current downturn, but it is
particularly sharp among medium/high EPL
economies, suggesting a greater degree of labor
hoarding given the size of the output drops.

16

The big difference between the two groups is in
the employment rate response. During previous cycles and during the current recession,
the initial employment losses are much greater
among low EPL economies and are even outside
the interquartile range for medium/high EPL
economies. Regarding job creation once the
recovery has taken root, during previous cycles,
low EPL economies also tended to register
larger employment gains.
What explains this? Clearly, the size of the
shock is much larger this time (the biggest
global financial crisis since the Great Depression
combined with the largest recession since World
War II), and this explains the bigger declines in
output per capita and output per employee on
average. The stronger employment response in
low EPL economies, relative to medium/high
EPL economies, is consistent with the academic
literature, which suggests that employment
protection reduces both inflows to and outflows
from employment. For medium/high EPL
countries, the reduction in employment during
this crisis has been similar to that during previous cycles despite substantially bigger output
losses, which suggests a higher degree of labor
hoarding. Spain, a medium/high EPL economy,
is an important exception, most likely because
of the dual nature of its labor market. For
example, during the current downturn, about
half the total employment decline is a result of
fixed-term employment losses in the construction sector.7

7Both historically and during the current recession, Spain has seen bigger employment losses in the
downturn phase than low EPL countries. Although
employment protection has recently been reduced significantly on regular contracts, at the time fixed-term
contracts were introduced (in 1984) it was very high,
which led to most new jobs being created on a fixedterm-contract basis. The relatively large stock of fixedterm contracts makes it easier for firms to adjust the
level of employment, and also explains why labor productivity (measured as output per hour or employee)
doesn’t tend to fall in Spain during recessions.

Sluggish Real Sector Dynamics

How Are Different Sectors Responding in Advanced
Economies?
Because the current recession involves housing busts and systemic banking crises in some
of the major advanced economies, we examine
whether there is a significantly different sectoral
decomposition to employment losses than for
previous recessions. We use employment data
at the sectoral level, focusing on Spain, the
United Kingdom, and the United States, which
have all suffered housing busts, and looking at
five sectors: manufacturing, construction, other
industries, financial and real estate services, and
other services (see third figure).
During previous cycles, on average, the
service sector provided the bulk of the jobs
created during expansions, but most of the job
losses during recessions were in the manufacturing sector. Indeed, during downturns,
on average, employment increased in services
(both financial and other). During this crisis,
the manufacturing sector has shed labor as
expected, but there have also been big employment losses in construction and financial and
other services, consistent with the larger impact
of financial crises on financial sector services
and of housing busts on construction. The
big decline in other services employment may
reflect the size of the output drops and spillovers from other sectors.
A Jobless Recovery?
The signs point to substantial labor hoarding in advanced and emerging economies,
given that most of the adjustment so far seems
to have been in terms of productivity declines
rather than employment losses. Of course, this
may be part of a rational response by firms,
which, because of hiring and firing costs, may
be willing to hoard labor if the shock hitting
the economy looks transitory. As a recession
deepens, however, firms may consider the shock
to be more persistent and may start to shed jobs
at a faster pace. Given the size and persistence
of the recent shocks to the global economy, this
harbingers the potential for a jobless recovery,

as excess labor hoarding is gradually unwound,
although the analysis suggests that it is critical to
distinguish among individual economies.
Advanced economies with low levels of EPL
(Canada, United Kingdom, United States)
have already experienced major employment
losses. If history is any guide, employment in
these economies will bounce back strongly,
potentially presaging a return to job creation
in the not-too-distant future (although after the
2001 recession, employment took a long time
to pick up in the United States). The employment losses in the United Kingdom and United
States, however, reflect that they have suffered
not only recessions but also housing busts and
systemic financial crises. As demonstrated in
IMF (2009a), such a combination generally
leads to large output drops and significantly
delays recovery, suggesting a slow and tepid
pickup in job creation for these two economies.
Many advanced economies with medium/
high levels of EPL have also suffered major
recessions but have so far not seen their unemployment rates spike. Some of the adjustment
has been through reduced hours, although this
may only delay inevitable job losses unless the
global recovery is more vigorous than currently expected. For Germany, subsidies for
part-time work are making it easier for firms to
retain workers by reducing hours worked per
employee. These benefits last up to two years,
and the result may be reduced job destruction
in the downturn, but also significantly less job
creation in the recovery period, as hours per
employee are simply increased—close to 1.2
million employees, about 3 percent of the labor
force, are receiving support under this program.
Emerging economies are expected to recover
more strongly than advanced economies, with
the notable exception of emerging Europe and
the Commonwealth of Independent States, and
this should support employment growth. In
emerging Europe, the employment adjustment
has been severe, and labor market flexibility will
be key to the necessary reallocation and future
job creation.

17

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

are declining at a slower rate or beginning to
stabilize in some advanced economies, such as
the United States and the United Kingdom, but
many markets still face the risk of further price
declines (Box 1.4). Even though the heavy drag
on growth exerted by falling residential investment is diminishing, a return to more buoyant
housing conditions is unlikely as long as households are facing difficult job market prospects
and foreclosures continue to mount. Furthermore, the fall in activity has yet to bottom out
for commercial real estate, which has lagged the
residential sector but is now also going through
a severe downturn. Thus, construction activity
is likely to stay weak for the foreseeable future,
with adverse implications for the financial sector.
Growth dynamics are somewhat stronger in
emerging economies. Domestic demand appears
relatively robust, particularly in China and
India, helped by strong macroeconomic policy
support. In addition, many economies are now
benefiting from the rebound in commodity
prices. Limited information on unemployment
in emerging economies points to less difficult
although still challenging conditions, with
economies in emerging Europe and the CIS suffering large job losses. However, subdued consumption in advanced economies will weigh on
many emerging economies’ exports, particularly
once inventory rebuilding has run its course.

Continued, but Diminishing, Support
from Policy
Monetary, fiscal, and financial policies have
played a critical role in cutting the adverse
feedback loops between the financial and real
sectors. However, the policy boost to growth will
gradually diminish because room for additional
stimulus is limited. Moreover, fundamental
financial sector repair is progressing slowly.

Expansionary Monetary Policies
The sharp drop in activity and rise in output
gaps have decreased inflation pressures. At the
global level, year-over-year inflation moderated

18

to 1.0 percent in July, down from more than
6 percent a year earlier. In the advanced economies, headline inflation has been below zero
since May, as oil prices have remained far below
levels a year earlier despite their recent pickup.
Core inflation has eased to 1.2 percent, down
from just over 2 percent a year earlier. Similarly,
headline and core inflation in the emerging
economies have moderated, falling to 4.2 percent in July and 0.4 percent in June, respectively.
However, developments have been uneven, with
inflation falling mainly in emerging Asia and
less so in emerging Europe.
Policy interest rates have been brought down
considerably, close to the zero floor in many
advanced economies (Figure 1.6). In response
to the growing crisis, central banks proceeded
with large cuts in policy rates, which have averaged more than 300 basis points on a global
basis since August 2007. In most advanced
economies, policy rates were reduced to
between 0.25 percent (Canada, Sweden, United
States) and 1 percent (euro area). With few
exceptions, room for further cuts has thus been
exhausted in advanced economies, and markets
do not foresee significant rate hikes over the
coming year.1 In an effort to transmit cuts in
short-term rates to longer maturities, the U.S.
Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada, and the
Swedish Riksbank have explicitly committed to
maintaining low policy rates until there are clear
signs of recovery. Cuts were generally smaller
in emerging economies, reflecting a combination of higher inflation at the onset of the crisis
and pressure for exchange rates to depreciate
in response to capital outflows. Looking ahead,
some central banks in Asia and Latin America
may start to tighten again if the strong rebounds
there are sustained, although some central
banks in emerging Europe are still exploiting

room to cut rates in response to more stable
external financial conditions.
Central banks in most advanced economies
and some emerging economies resorted to
a range of unconventional measures to further ease financial conditions during the past
year. There have been a variety of different
approaches, mainly reflecting different financial
system structures.2 All central banks deployed
extensive liquidity support measures for banks,
given their importance in every financial system.
For example, the ECB introduced much more
flexibility into its repurchase facilities, broadening an already wide range of acceptable collateral and introducing six-month and one-year
maturities. Many central banks also provided
liquidity in U.S. dollars, arranged via swap lines
with the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve
and Bank of England, among others, intervened
with outright purchases of government bonds
in an effort to lower long-term yields. Given the
much greater importance of securities markets
for the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve
also intervened heavily in markets for the debt
of government-sponsored enterprises,3 for
mortgage-backed securities, and for commercial
paper and provided funding and some protection to investors in asset-backed securities.4
Together with policy rate cuts and fiscal
stimulus, these operations helped to reduce tail
risks related to rapidly falling confidence and
liquidity constraints. In fact, some interventions
are already unwinding naturally in the wake of
improvements in financial conditions. Overall,
operations targeted at specific dislocated markets appear to have been more effective than
purchases of government bonds, although these

Central banks have implemented unusually large interest rate cuts to combat the
recession. In addition, they have intervened in credit and asset markets to ease
financial conditions. With inflation expected to remain constrained, very limited
policy tightening is expected over the coming year.

example, in the euro area, bank financing
accounted for roughly 70 percent of firms’ total external
financing during 2004–08. In the United States, marketbased sources comprised 80 percent of total external
financing (Trichet, 2009). Markets for mortgage-backed
securities are also much larger in the United States.
3These include the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (Freddie Mac).

Box 1.4. Risks from Real Estate Markets
The global correction in residential real
estate markets has generated large declines in
house prices and construction activity across a
broad range of economies, although there are
some recent signs of stabilization in a few. The
median annual decline in real house prices
across economies in the year ending in the first
quarter of 2009 was 7 percent, with far more
dramatic declines in the Baltic economies,
Iceland, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates,
and the United Kingdom (first figure). Housing
activity—measured by the number of transactions or residential investment—has also been
falling; housing permits, for instance, showed a
median annual decline of about 35 percent in
the first quarter of 2009.
With the residential housing bust and the
severe global economic downturn, demand for
office space and retail/industrial buildings has
declined, bringing down the commercial real
estate market too. Office vacancy rates increased
significantly during 2008 in many cities across
the globe. Hardest hit were major cities in some
emerging markets, such as Moscow and Shanghai, and international financial centers such as
Dublin, New York, London, and Tokyo (second
figure).1 Investment in nonresidential construction has dropped sharply and, in a few cases,
has eclipsed the decline in residential construction (third figure).2 Commercial property sales
have come close to a halt (fourth figure), and
property prices are falling.

Continued, but Diminishing, Support from Policy

How much further are house prices likely to
fall? And what are the risks to the macroeconomy
from the corrections in residential and commercial real estate markets? This box updates the
analysis of the housing market in previous issues
of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) and extends
it to commercial real estate.3
Corrections in House Prices
On average across advanced economies,
upturns in housing markets have lasted about
six years, with real house prices going up about
50 percent during that period. Downturns have
been characterized by house prices falling by
24 percent over a five-year period (see table). The
latest upturn was twice as long as the previous
average and more than twice the magnitude (in
terms of price). Hence, although house prices
have already fallen 20 percent during the ongoing
downturn—close to the historical average—there
could still be a significant correction to come.
Of course, the extent of the total price correction will vary across economies, and recent
price declines have gone further in some than in
others. Given the difficulties in assessing house
price overvaluation, the fifth figure presents four
approaches to computing the likely price correction still to come. The top panel shows the gap
between the house price decline in an economy
during the current housing downturn and the
average declines in that economy during past
episodes. If past is prologue, these estimates suggest that the Netherlands and Finland are likely
to see further house price declines, whereas the
corrections in Australia and the United States
are close to complete.
However, this approach does not account for
differences across cycles in the driving forces
behind house price movements. The estimates
in the second panel are based on an econometric model that seeks to explain the increase
in house prices that has taken place over the
past decade in terms of relevant explanatory

compared with Box 3.1 in the April 2008
WEO and Box 1.1 in the October 2008 WEO, this
house price model reflects two enhancements. First,
to avoid sensitivity to base-year assumptions, the house
prices in the first quarter of each year from 1997 to
2001 are used as alternative base levels from which the
fitted values of the house price increases are accrued;
the cumulative gap is then calculated as the average
over these base years. Second, the model now includes

effects of these variables are captured through
the inclusion of lagged real house price growth
and an affordability ratio (the lagged ratio of
house prices to disposable income). This model
is estimated for each economy using quarterly
data for 1970 to 2008. The increase in house
prices between end-2008 or the first quarter
of 2009 and the 1997–2001 period that is not
explained by these fundamental factors—
referred to as the house price gap—provides an
estimate of the remaining potential for correction in house prices. This analysis suggests that
further price adjustments are likely in Ireland,
Italy, and the United Kingdom. Compared
with earlier WEO estimates, the average estimated misalignment drops from a 10 percent
overvaluation to a 6 percent overvaluation.
The ranking of economies remains broadly
unchanged. 5

construction costs as a proxy for supply conditions.
Although the gap estimates could still partly reflect
omitted fundamental factors, they provide an indication of how large those omitted factors would have to
be for the rise in house prices over the past years to
be considered an equilibrium outcome.
5The same data series running from 1970 to 2008
is used to produce estimates under the model used in
the earlier reports and under the enhanced model.
Hence, the difference in misalignment estimates is
due to the enhancement of the model, not to the
declines recorded since the date of the last report.
Estimates for several economies are sensitive to
country-specific factors. For instance, in the case of
Australia, if the impact of long-term migration on
housing demand is taken into account, the results do
not produce evidence of a significant overvaluation
of house prices. Similarly, for the Netherlands, the
estimated house price gap might be smaller if the rise
in single-person households is taken into account,
together with institutional factors (strict zoning regu-

Continued, but Diminishing, Support from Policy

Long-term relationships between house
prices, rents, and incomes can also be used to
gauge the extent of likely declines. The lower
panels show the gap between the current priceto-income ratios in different economies and
their respective historical averages (third panel)
and the gap between the house price-to-rent
ratios and their historical averages (bottom
panel). For most economies, both ratios are still
well above historical averages; this is particularly
true for Australia and Spain.
To summarize, all four approaches suggest
that for most economies, house price corrections still have some way to go. The analysis
most consistently points to further large
declines for Denmark, Spain, and the United
Kingdom, while in Germany, Korea, and the
United States corrections are likely to be small.
Of course, there could be more pronounced
corrections at the subnational level than is
evident from the aggregate data. In Canada,
for instance, the potential for further price corrections is estimated to be much higher in the
western provinces (Alberta, British Columbia,
Saskatchewan) than in the eastern provinces
(Ontario, Quebec).6 In the United States, the
northeast corridor, the West Coast, and three
of the four “sand states” (Arizona, Florida,
Nevada) appear to be susceptible to continuing corrections, based on analysis of price-toincome ratios.7

lations and generous mortgage interest deductibility).
For Italy, low loan-to-value ratios, low household
debt levels, and demand from foreigners considerably diminish downside risks to real estate prices. For
Japan, given the persistent decline in house prices
over the past few decades, gap estimates may be sensitive to specification of trends.
6IMF (2009b).
7These price-to-income (“affordability ratio”) calculations compare the median household income in a
state to the income level required to obtain a standard
mortgage loan for purchase of a median-priced home
in the area. See Collyns, Igan, and Loungani (2009)
for details. Further disparities across regions are
reflected in delinquency and foreclosure rates, again
led by the sand states (Arizona, California, Florida,
Nevada).

Corrections in Commercial Real Estate Prices
Commercial real estate markets are facing
substantial price corrections. Current rent levels
on office, retail, and industrial space are, on
average, almost 15 percent above the historical
norm (sixth figure). Rents have already started
to decline around the world, and this trend is
likely to continue given the economic outlook,
which will put pressure on commercial property
prices. Systematic global price data are not available, but the U.S. market illustrates the scale of
the problem. In the United States, commercial
real estate prices went through a boom of their
own between 2005 and 2007, which has since
turned into a bust (seventh figure). As of the
second quarter of 2009, U.S. commercial real
estate prices had already declined almost 40 percent from their peak in the second quarter
of 2007. This compares with a peak-to-trough
decline of 27 percent in the market bust of
1987–92. Implications of such a sharp correc-

tion are likely to be considerable: defaults on
commercial real estate loans currently stand at
7.9 percent but, given the size of the bust and
the fact that they reached 12 percent in the
early 1990s, they could more than double.8
Impact on the Real Economy
At a conceptual level, the impact of housing
corrections on the real economy depend on the
extent of house price misalignment, as estimated above; the impact of a given house price
correction on macroeconomic variables—which
could vary across economies due to differences
in the characteristics of mortgage markets or
because or differences in policy responses to
housing shocks; and transmission and amplification mechanisms, such as the impact of defaults
on bank balance sheets or the indirect effects
on commercial real estate, which may not be
fully captured in a standard macroeconomic
model of the impacts of housing price shocks.
To provide a baseline assessment of the
impact of house price declines on the economy,
we estimate a vector autoregression (VAR)
model for each of 20 advanced economies for
which we have long series of quarterly data.9
Each model includes the following variables:
real GDP, real private consumption, real
residential investment, consumer price index
inflation, short-term interest rate, and real
house prices.10 The sample period is the first
quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 2008.

Delinquencies peaked in the first quarter of 1991,
more than three years after prices did. Although an
in-depth analysis of the determinants of default rates
is beyond the scope of this box, these estimates are
consistent with forecasts in IMF (2009a). For more

Continued, but Diminishing, Support from Policy

We use the model to trace the response of GDP,
residential investment, and consumption to a
shock to housing prices. The results indicate
that, on average, a 10 percent decline in house
prices leads to declines after one year of about
2 percent in real GDP, 2½ percent in consumption, and 15 percent in residential investment.
In many economies, private consumption
growth became closely linked to house price
appreciation during the past decade, and house
price declines are now driving down consumption growth. Some economies show high
responsiveness of the macroeconomy to house
prices, including Finland, Greece, and New Zealand. The heterogeneity in the response across
economies could be due to numerous factors,
but previous work reported in various issues of
the WEO suggests that a critical factor is likely
to be the ease with which households are able
to access mortgage credit.
The VAR model provides baseline estimates
of the macro impact of house price declines but
may not fully reflect transmission and amplification mechanisms that may be in play. Such
mechanisms may be especially important in
economies where residential construction has
been an important contributor to GDP growth
in recent years or where household balance
sheets became largely dependent on residential
assets. For instance, in Spain, the construction
sector grew to account for more than 10 percent of value added in 2007, compared with
6 percent in 1997; in the latest data for 2009,
this share has started to shrink, with important
implications for income growth and employment. A similar pattern is visible in Estonia and
Ireland and, to a lesser extent, in Norway and
the United Kingdom.
The indirect effects from weaknesses in
commercial real estate are also important
at present. Because commercial real estate
investors are typically more leveraged than
residential homeowners, the impact of price
declines on delinquencies and thus on financial
institutions’ balance sheets is likely to be bigger
than the impact of house price declines. In the
United States, there are concerns about rising

House prices continue to decline across a
broad range of economies, although signs of
stabilization have emerged recently where the
correction has been ongoing for a number of
years, such as the United States. But an analysis of past house price cycles suggests that for
most economies, there could still be significant
corrections to come given the stronger-thanaverage upturn in house prices that preceded
the present downturn. Moreover, the global
recession has put pressure on commercial
property markets, where increasing vacancy
rates and decreasing rents drove down nonresidential construction investment. Leveraged
commercial real estate investors are likely to
face difficulties in refinancing the loans that
are coming due, and soaring delinquencies
therefore have the potential to create a second
wave of financial distress in exposed financial institutions. The ongoing effects on the
real economy of house price corrections and
increasing stress in commercial property markets are being amplified in economies where
construction has been an important contributor to growth in recent years, where consumption was driven by house price appreciations,
and where commercial real estate markets have
been placed in a precarious position by the
weakening of the real economy.

ties, and remain elevated. In August 2009, the U.S.
Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury Department
announced the extension of the Term Asset-Backed
Securities Loan Facility to mid-2010 for CMBSs to
support the ailing commercial real estate market.
Exposure of nonbank financial institutions to CMBSs
is cause for concern under current market conditions.
12For example, in the United States, Wells Fargo,
Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase are among
the top commercial real estate lenders. Smaller, more

geographically concentrated lenders have already
reported losses associated with such loans. Overall,
commercial banks hold $1.6 trillion in commercial
mortgage loans amounting to 45 percent of the total
outstanding. CMBS issuers (26 percent), life insurance
companies (9 percent), and savings institutions (6 percent) are the other major holders of commercial real
estate debt.

operations may be hard to unwind as long as
markets remain illiquid and fundamental market failures remain unaddressed.5

In both advanced and emerging economies,
fiscal policy has provided major stimulus in
response to the deep downturn, which was
particulary important because the transmission
of monetary policy has been impaired in many
economies (Figure 1.7). Overall fiscal deficits
are projected to increase by about 6 percentage

parity in 2009–10 compared with 2007 precrisis levels. The fiscal expansion is greater in
advanced economies, reflecting the larger size
of their governments and the greater role of
automatic stabilizers such as income taxes and
transfers (welfare payments, unemployment benefits). For the Group of 20 (G20) economies,
crisis-related discretionary measures are estimated at about 2 percent of GDP for 2009 and
1.5 percent of GDP for 2010, both relative to
2007 baselines, with the largest policy packages
in Asia, the Middle East, and the United States.
The categories of stimulus that were implemented most rapidly—tax breaks and transfer
payments—are those that typically have lower
effects on activity. Stimulus measures that have
higher multipliers will likely be implemented at
an accelerated pace during the second half of
2009, reflecting the lags inherent in new and
expanded government spending programs, particularly in infrastructure.
With some signs that conditions are stabilizing, most countries are taking a “wait-and-see”
approach, focusing on implementing previously
announced measures and on assessing their
impact before providing additional stimulus.
Estimates for 2010 reflect the phased implementation of stimulus spending initiated during
2009 and a carryover of tax provisions as well as
the continued operation of automatic stabilizers.

Public Debt

Fiscal policy is providing significant stimulus to the global economy. Public debt,
however, is rising fast, particularly in advanced economies. Large corrections in
fiscal balances will be necessary to reverse this trend once the recovery is on a firm
footing.

Budget deficits are thus projected to be broadly
the same in 2010 as in 2009, implying continued
support for activity. For the G20 economies, fiscal policy is estimated to boost GDP by at least
1 percentage point in 2009 and by less in 2010.6
The continued stimulus to growth in 2010
reflects implementation lags and the growing
share of capital (infrastructure) spending, which
has larger multipliers than taxes or transfers.
In subsequent years, fiscal deficits will start to
contract, in the absence of further measures, as
stimulus measures phase out and the recovery
improves cyclical components of the budget.

Financial Sector Support
In addition to central bank efforts, governments also intervened heavily in financial
systems to relieve concerns about a potential systemic collapse and to reestablish trust. Measures
included deposit and debt guarantees, recapitalization of financial institutions, and programs
to ring-fence or remove bad assets from these
entities’ balance sheets (Figure 1.8). Differing
country circumstances spurred a wide variety
of approaches. Most governments provided
guarantees, because these entail low up-front
fiscal costs and are relatively easy to implement.
Programs to recapitalize financial institutions
and remove their toxic assets quickly ran into
major political obstacles, as skeptical electorates
resisted what they considered overly generous
bailouts for the very firms seemingly responsible
for the crisis or questioned the growing role of
government in credit intermediation. Recapitalization also raised a number of specific difficulties, notably how to gauge capital shortfalls with
uncertain valuations for bad assets and resistance from existing shareholders who did not
want their stakes and influence diluted.
Accordingly, only a limited amount of government funding has been allocated up front
6The size of fiscal multipliers is uncertain. Based on
plausible ranges, stimulus packages could boost GDP by
1 to 5 percentage points in 2009 and by 0 to 1 percentage point in 2010, both with respect to the previous year.
These estimates consider cross-country spillover effects.
For details, see Horton, Kumar, and Mauro (2009).

A Subdued Recovery and Vulnerability to Mild Deflation

for financial support operations. The advanced
G20 economies are estimated to have put aside
somewhat less than 6 percent of GDP; for the
emerging G20 economies, whose financial
systems are affected much less directly by the
crisis, that number is below 1 percent of GDP.7
The amount of financial sector support actually disbursed generally has been even less,
reflecting a variety of factors. Some are innocuous, such as the precautionary nature of initial
announcements and indications of increasing
stability and improved bank liquidity. Others are
more worrisome, such as lags in implementation
of programs for recapitalization and asset purchases caused by financial institutions’ preference to wait out the crisis and deleverage rather
than take write-downs and accept government
support to increase lending.
Various governments have taken an active role
in assessing their banking systems by performing
stress tests, which, when accompanied by credible measures to address any shortfalls in capital,
have been a useful tool in accelerating balance
sheet repair and restoring confidence in banks.
But much more work remains to be done on
this front in many countries. Accordingly, capital
remains far short of the levels required to forestall further bank deleveraging, representing an
important drag on the forces of recovery.

A Subdued Recovery and Vulnerability to
Mild Deflation
Summing up the short-term prospects,
the policy forces that are driving the current
rebound will gradually lose strength, and the
real and financial forces remain weak but are
gradually building. Specifically, fiscal stimulus
will diminish and inventory rebuilding will
gradually lose its influence, while consumption
and investment will slowly build. Thus, after contracting by about 1 percent in 2009, global activity is forecast to expand by about 3 percent in
2010. These projections reflect modest upward

revisions to those in the July 2009 WEO Update
(Table 1.1; Figure 1.9).
Advanced economies are projected to expand
sluggishly through much of 2010, with output
growth rising toward medium-term potential
only later in the year. Thus, average annual
growth in 2010 will be only modestly positive,
at about 1¼ percent, following a contraction
of 3½ percent during 2009. The recovery of
activity is more clearly evident on a fourthquarter-over-fourth-quarter basis: from 2009:Q4
to 2010:Q4, output is expected to rise by about
1¾ percent, up from an expansion of about ½
percent (annualized) during the second half
of 2009 and a 2 percent contraction in the first
half. The recovery is being felt first by advanced
economies in Asia. In the United States, consumption should receive some support from
gradually diminishing employment losses, as well
as firmer asset prices. In Europe, improvements
are being driven by policy support and recovering confidence and trade—output in France and
Germany already expanded moderately in the
second quarter of 2009. However, a prolonged
period of significant job losses is expected to
weigh on activity in Europe well into 2010.
In emerging economies, real GDP growth is
forecast to reach 5 percent in 2010, up from
1¾ percent in 2009. The rebound is driven by
China, India, and a number of other emerging Asian economies. Economies in Africa and
the Middle East are also expected to post solid
growth of close to 4 percent, helped by recovering commodity prices, whereas Latin America
will benefit from higher commodity prices and
rising global trade. In emerging Europe and
the CIS, the recovery may lag because of tighter
external financial constraints that are bringing
down very large current account deficits (see
Chapter 2).
The gradual pace of recovery points to a
prolonged period of subdued inflation and
vulnerability to mild deflation (see Figure 1.10).
Although the risks of sustained deflation have
diminished over the past quarter, deflation
pressures—as gauged by a broad indicator that
comprises various price indicators, estimates

of capacity utilization, and asset prices for
most G20 economies—are expected to remain
relatively high over the coming year.8 For the
United States and the euro area, for example,
IMF staff estimates suggest that potential output
growth has fallen, is currently close to zero, and
will pick up only slowly to about 2 percent and
1¼ percent, respectively, over the medium run
(Figure 1.11).9 Nonetheless, large output gaps
are opening, typically measuring about 3–5 percent of potential GDP. Accordingly, inflation in
advanced economies is projected to be close to
zero in 2009 and to accelerate very modestly to
about 1 percent in 2010, largely reflecting rising
commodity prices. Prices for many manufactured goods will probably continue to decline
for some time. Fortunately, inflation expectations have generally remained well anchored,
providing some protection against sustained
large price declines. In emerging economies,
inflation is forecast to hover around 5 percent
in 2009–10, down from more than 9 percent
in 2008. Only China, a few of the ASEAN-5,10
and most emerging European economies are
projected to see inflation fall appreciably below
5 percent. Low potential growth and inflation
will slow the process of deleveraging, adding to
contractionary forces.

9The (multivariate filter) estimates are obtained by
examining various macroeconomic variables and the
relationships among them. If falling output translates
into falling core inflation, the slowdown is cyclical; to the
extent it does not, it is structural, reflecting lower potential growth. Data on output, however, are available only
quarterly. More insight can be gleaned about the short
term by scrutinizing capacity utilization and unemployment, and their past relationships to output. In general,
however, real-time estimates of potential output are subject to wide margins of error, particularly during booms
and recessions. See Bernes and others (2009).

Beyond 2010: How Will the Global
Economy Rebalance?

Figure 1.10. Global Inflation

Achieving sustained healthy growth over the
medium term will depend critically on addressing the supply disruptions generated by the
crisis and rebalancing the global pattern of
demand. On the supply side, financial firms will
need to be restructured and markets repaired to
deliver adequate credit for sustained increases in
investment and productivity, and labor will need
to be redeployed across sectors. On the demand
side, rebalancing hinges on switching from public to private demand and from domestically to
externally driven growth in the many economies
that experienced asset price busts. By implication, economies that previously relied on exportled growth will need to switch from externally to
domestically driven growth.

The global recession has caused a large drop in inflation and rising concern about
mild deflation. However, the decline in inflation pressures has been limited among
some emerging economies.

Historical evidence presented in Chapter 4
indicates that there were typically large, permanent hits to output in the aftermath of past
financial crises, although there has been a wide
range of outcomes and major losses have been
avoided in some cases. In the past, output losses
following crises manifested themselves in falling capital, higher unemployment, and lower
total factor productivity. Capital accumulation
typically plunged as a result of the interaction
among surging funding costs, slumping demand,
falling collateral values, and growing excess
capacity. The dynamics of these interactions
tended to be long lasting, pushing unemployment to high levels. Over time, unemployment
evolved from cyclical into structural, as the
jobless lost skills or were eased out of the labor
force with generous early retirement or other
long-term benefits. The latter played an important role in boosting structural unemployment
in Europe following the big recessions of the
1970s and 1980s.11 Total factor productivity

labor hoarding, obsolescence of physical and
human capital, and lower research and development expenditures.
The current medium-term output projections are indeed on a much lower path than
before the crisis (Figure 1.12), consistent with
a permanent loss of potential output. Investment has already fallen sharply, especially in the
economies hit by financial and real estate crises.
Together with rising scrap rates, as corporations
go bankrupt or restructure, this is reducing
effective capital stocks. In addition, unemployment rates are expected to remain at high levels
over the medium run in a number of advanced
economies. In the euro area, for example, rates
are projected to rise to close to 12 percent in
2010 and to retreat only gradually to 9½ percent
by 2014. By contrast, in the United States, with
its more flexible labor market, unemployment
is projected to decline from a peak of about
10 percent in 2010 to 5 percent by 2014.

Demand-Side Rebalancing
To complement efforts to repair the supply
side of economies, there must also be adjustments in the pattern of global demand in
order to sustain a strong recovery. Specifically,
many economies that have followed export-led
growth strategies and have run current account
surpluses will need to rely more on domestic
demand—notably emerging economies in Asia
and elsewhere and Germany and Japan. This
will help offset subdued domestic demand
in economies that have typically run current
account deficits and have experienced asset
price (stock or housing) busts, including the
United States, the United Kingdom, parts of
the euro area, and many emerging European
economies. In these economies, private consumption and investment are unlikely to pick
up the slack that will be left by diminishing
fiscal stimulus, given that household incomes
and corporate profits will be subdued and balance sheet repair will be under way for some
time, implying higher saving rates. Hence, these
economies’ imports will be sluggish and their

Beyond 2010: How Will the Global Economy Rebalance?

current account deficits will narrow. In addition, there will need to be sectoral shifts of
resources on the supply side to accommodate
shifts in demand.
This process of rebalancing global demand
will be drawn out. To illustrate the challenge,
consumption in China––the main current
account surplus economy––amounts to only
about one-quarter of total consumption in the
United States and the European economies with
large current account deficits. Furthermore, the
scope for advanced economies such as Germany
and Japan to contribute to rebalancing is limited, given their need to build savings to prepare
for population aging. Thus, rebalancing must
involve a broad range of emerging economies
if solid global growth is to be sustained over the
medium term. It will also require major changes
in consumption patterns, supported by an economic environment that fosters lower precautionary saving and higher investment, including
in emerging economies that have traditionally
exported large amounts of capital. This is a
long-term policy challenge that involves complex issues related to lowering corporate saving,
expanding and improving financial intermediation, eliminating distortions that foster production of tradable goods, and strengthening social
safety nets. Rapid progress cannot be expected
in the near term.
Hence, these projections paint a sobering picture of the path for demand-side rebalancing.12
In 2009, global current account imbalances
decline sharply (Figure 1.13). Current account
deficits fall in the United States and various
advanced economies (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom) and in emerging
Europe—together, these economies accounted
for the bulk of the world’s current account
deficits before the crisis. Meanwhile, surpluses
diminish for oil exporters, as the value of oil

Figure 1.12. GDP Growth
Historical evidence suggests that declining output after crises is driven to a roughly
equal extent by lower employment, lower effective capital stocks, and lower
productivity. World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecasts for output have been marked
down appreciably relative to precrisis levels, in line with historical evidence. With
lower investment and consumption, current accounts of advanced economies are
expected to improve.

revenues drops sharply, and for Germany and
Japan. Looking further ahead, however, imbalances widen again. The recovery of oil prices
is expected to boost the savings and current
account surpluses of the oil exporters while
lowering those of importers. The turnaround
in the global manufacturing cycle is expected
to raise surpluses for Germany and to a lesser
extent for Japan (because of the recent appreciation of the yen). Nonetheless, these two
economies and the oil exporters are expected
to contribute less to global imbalances over the
medium term than they have recently. At the
same time, little current account adjustment is
forecast for the emerging economies of Asia,
notably China, over the medium term. As a
result, global imbalances widen again over the
medium term; also, the global current account
discrepancy—the sum of all economies’ current
accounts—is forecast to widen somewhat compared with the recent past (Box 1.5). However,
the widening of this discrepancy is limited and,
for this and other reasons, its implications for
the growth forecast are probably limited.

Risks to a Sustained Recovery
Downside risks to growth are receding gradually but remain a concern. The main short-term
risk is that the recovery stalls and deflationary
forces become entrenched. This could be triggered by a number of adverse developments.
Premature exit from accommodative monetary
and fiscal policies, possibly driven by rising
concerns about government intervention and
unconventional action by central banks, seems
to be a significant risk because the policyinduced rebound could be mistaken for the
beginning of a strong recovery. Also, there
could be resistance to extending policy support
long enough to allow private demand to make a
sustained recovery. Progress in repairing financial balance sheets could be undercut by rising
unemployment, greater-than-expected increases
in delinquencies on residential mortgages and
commercial real estate, and more corporate
bankruptcies. With banks only weakly capital-

Risks to a Sustained Recovery

Box 1.5. From Deficit to Surplus: Recent Shifts in Global Current Accounts
The global current account discrepancy is
a well-known anomaly in economic statistics
(IMF, 1987; Annex 3 in the October 1996
World Economic Outlook (WEO); and Box 2.1 in
the September 2002 WEO). In theory, global
exports—the sum of all economies’ exports—
should equal global imports, but in practice
they do not.1 In fact, the discrepancy has been
large on occasion, reaching as much as ½ percent of global GDP in absolute value (figure,
upper panel). The origins and behavior of this
discrepancy have long been of interest to policymakers and academics who analyze current
account developments and prospects. The issue
has taken on added importance in light of the
necessary rebalancing of global demand in the
wake of the current crisis. Specifically, two interrelated sets of questions have arisen.
What factors explain the turnaround in the
global discrepancy in recent years to a “surplus”
after many decades of “deficit”?
What are the prospects for the global discrepancy? Is the continued increase in the discrepancy implied by the WEO projections consistent
with past trends?2
The analysis in this box suggests that movements in the discrepancy, including its recent
The main authors of this box are Thomas Helbling
and Marco E. Terrones.
1The transactions subsumed in the external current
account of an economy are typically referred to as
international trade transactions. These are referred
to as “current transactions” in balance of payments
statistics (as opposed to transactions in the capital
and financial accounts). Specifically, current transactions include the following major categories: exports
and imports of goods and services, receipts of income
from assets bought from nonresidents, return payments on liabilities to nonresidents (including returns
on human capital), and receipts and payments of
current transfers.
2The WEO country forecasts are based on common
assumptions and consider variables such as growth in
trading partner economies, but they do not explicitly
incorporate “adding up” constraints for international
transactions at the global level. The discrepancy
implied by the aggregation of the country trade forecasts has thus long been used as a measure of their
global consistency.

Box 1.5 (continued)
turnaround from deficit to surplus, reflect
changes in global economic conditions and a
trend increase in measurement biases toward
exports, which is mostly relevant for services.
The deceleration in global growth during
2008–09 already resulted in some narrowing of
the global current account discrepancy in 2008,
and some further narrowing seems likely in
2009. Against this cyclical decline works a growing trend for a global services surplus. However,
results from simple econometric models for
the global discrepancy suggest that the continued large increases in the global discrepancy
during 2013–14 implied by the WEO forecasts
might be stronger than consistent with historical trends.
What Factors Are behind the Recent Turnaround in
the Global Discrepancy?
As the figure shows, the discrepancy has generally been rising since 2001, became positive in
2005, and peaked in 2007. Based on preliminary
data, the discrepancy narrowed from ½ percent
of global GDP in 2007 to about !/3 of global GDP
in 2008. Quarterly data for a subset of economies suggest that the discrepancy narrowed
sharply in the second half of 2008, when global
trade collapsed, but that most of this decline
was reversed in the first quarter of 2009.3
A breakdown of global trade into major categories, as shown in the second and third panels of the figure, suggests that the switch from
a global current account deficit to a surplus
reflects primarily increasing positive discrepancies (“surpluses”) in the trade of goods and of
so-called other services.4

3The subset of economies accounts for about 93
percent of global GDP.
4As discussed in IMF (1987) and Annex 3 in
the October 1996 WEO, the negative discrepancy
(“deficit”) in the 1980s and 1990s was largely a result
of deficits in transportation services and investment
income. These deficits were attributed to the underrecording and/or failure to report credits by shipping
nations (transportation services) and the underreporting by investment credit recipients (tax evasion, etc.).

36

The rising surplus in the global goods trade
during 2001–07 likely reflects transportationrelated lags in the recording of imports
compared with exports at a time of rapidly
expanding global trade.5 With some exports
recorded one period earlier in the source
economy than the corresponding imports in
the destination economy, a pickup in global
trade growth can lead to an increase in the
global trade surplus. With the fragmentation of
production processes, trade has expanded at a
much faster pace than value added (or GDP)
in recent years. The observed decrease in the
global trade discrepancy in 2008 could then be
explained by the sharp drop in global trade,
which was recorded in exports before imports.
The composition of the discrepancy in the
trade of services has shifted in recent years.6 In
the 1980s and 1990s, a global deficit in transportation services was the main source of the
negative discrepancy in this sector. Since 2001,
however, a growing surplus in the trade of other
services has more than compensated for the
still-negative discrepancy in transportation services, implying a positive discrepancy in services
trade overall.

5Other

factors could also have played a role. For
example, it is often argued that there is a greater
incentive to underreport imports, because imports are
taxed more heavily than exports. Hence, when global
trade picks up, the recorded increase in imports could
be systematically biased downward. Nevertheless, with
trade in manufacturing components increasingly duty
free, this factor may well have played a less prominent
role in recent years compared with two decades ago.
6Measured international trade in services has been
increasing rapidly in recent years. Although this
expansion undoubtedly reflects rapid increases in
underlying transactions, given the growing tradability
of services, it also reflects important progress in measuring this type of international trade. An increasing
number of economies have started to record and
report trade in services over the past 50 years (Lipsey,
2009). Moreover, the number of economies reporting different kinds of trade in services has increased
significantly over the past 30 years. For instance, the
number of economies reporting exports and imports
of financial services increased from 10 to more than
100 between 1985 and 2005.

Risks to a Sustained Recovery

The rising discrepancy in other services likely
reflects measurement problems associated with
the rapid increase in international trade in
nontraditional services, such as offshoring of
business, financial, and communication services.
The measurement problems include the fact
that exporters are easier to identify than importers because they specialize partly in providing
these services (whereas the need for imports
is often more sporadic) and they tend to have
larger overall transaction volumes than importers. For example, law firms involved in resolving
cross-border legal issues typically are long-established specialist firms, whereas many clients do
not have such legal needs on a regular basis.
Exporters are thus more likely to be identified
and exceed the threshold for participation in
the surveys that underpin measurement of a
large part of international trade in services.7 As
a result, exports are more likely to be recorded
than imports, which can introduce a bias toward
a positive discrepancy. And this discrepancy has
risen relative to global GDP as such services
have greatly increased in importance.
Other reasons for positive discrepancies in
the trade of “other services” include policyrelated incentive biases—policymakers are often
interested primarily in services exports (as a
means to stimulate growth), and measurement
efforts therefore focus on exports rather than
imports. There is also a lack of appropriate data
collection systems in services trade in emerging
and developing economies, which typically are
net importers of services.
It remains difficult to forecast the likely evolution of the discrepancy in the global trade of
other services. Rapid trend growth in the trade
of other services is likely to continue, but statistical agencies are in the process of improving
the related measurements. The extent to which

7Unlike in the trade of goods, there are no customs
records available for many types of international trade
in services. Indeed, in the areas where the recording
of services trade has long been established—transportation and travel—there are at least related customs
records available.

this will affect the magnitude and direction of
the discrepancy remains highly uncertain at
this point.
What Are the Prospects for the Global Discrepancy?
The current WEO forecasts imply that, after a
further decline in 2009, the global discrepancy
will again increase relative to global GDP during
2010–14 and will grow well beyond its peak in
2007. Such a pattern seems qualitatively plausible, given the recent trends discussed above,
but it would also be desirable to quantitatively
assess the consistency with past trends. In other
words, the question is whether the fluctuations
in the discrepancy implied by the forecasts are
within historical margins of error.
Marquez and Workman (2001) examine this
question with an econometric model of the
global current account discrepancy, which they
use to check whether the implied discrepancy
falls within the 95 percent confidence interval
of the model forecast. This approach was predicated on their finding that during 1972–98,
the discrepancy fluctuated systematically with
changes in global economic conditions and
past values of the discrepancy itself. Building on this work, the IMF staff reexamined
these features of the discrepancy, taking into
account more recent data and, on this basis,
estimated a somewhat modified econometric
model.
Simple statistical analysis of the overall global
current account discrepancy and its major components suggests the following (first table):8
The means of the global discrepancy and its
major components are significantly different
from zero. This implies that, despite the recent
switch from deficit to surplus, the discrepancy
has not been on average zero.
Another key property of the global discrepancy and its major components is that they are
highly persistent time-series processes. In other

words, past levels of the discrepancies matter
for their current levels, because the first-order
autoregressive coefficients are generally significantly different from zero. The relatively large,
positive values of these coefficients imply that
the discrepancies at any point in time are typically quite similar to the levels in the previous
period.
For services trade and the overall current
account balance, the autoregressive coefficients are slightly greater than 1 in value, suggesting that these discrepancies have grown
over time.
Simple econometric analysis also confirms
the key finding of Marquez and Workman
(2001) that the global discrepancies generally
fluctuate with global economic conditions but
also shows that the discrepancies can grow
over time (second table). Two models are fitted
to the data for the global discrepancy for the
current account as well as its components: one
model features a time trend as well as global
output growth, oil prices, and the six-month
U.S. dollar London interbank offered rate. The
other model omits the time trend, working with
the first differences of the discrepancy variables
rather than the levels. The findings suggest first
that the discrepancies tend to be procyclical. In
other words, they increase when global growth

38

picks up and decrease when global growth
slows. Second, the discrepancies tend to grow
over time.
Hence, in assessing projections for the global
discrepancy, the predicted changes in global
economic conditions and its trend behavior
should be taken into account. Doing this with
the two models generates a forecast for the
levels of the global current account discrepancy
for 2008–14.9 Comparing the model forecasts
for the discrepancy during 2008–14 with the
changes implied by the international trade forecasts in the current WEO projections shows that
the latter are generally within the 95 percent
confidence interval around the model forecasts
through 2010 and 2012, respectively (lower
9Information criteria and in-sample forecast error
comparisons suggest that a first-difference specification is preferable to a specification in levels. The
estimation problems associated with highly persistent
time-series processes would also argue in favor of such
a specification. That said, on theoretical grounds,
the global current account discrepancy should be a
stationary process when it is scaled with global GDP
(as in the analysis presented here). Comparing the
model forecasts and the implied forecasts presented
below shows that the implications of both specifications are the same. The forecasts for first difference of
the global discrepancy were subsequently transformed
into levels to allow for a comparison.

the global discrepancy in 2011–14 and 2013–14,
however, are outside the 95 percent confidence

of the global discrepancy from the upper ends

to 0.1 to 0.2 percent of world GDP. This finding
suggests that the growth projections underlying

not be fully consistent with global trade equilibrium, pointing to collective excessive optimism

conditions. (These and other financial sector
risks are discussed in the October 2009 GFSR.)
More generally, many shocks that otherwise
could be absorbed—for example, a virulent
return of H1N1 flu or geopolitical tensions that
remove excess capacity in the oil sector—may
have a significant destabilizing impact, given
the vulnerable state of the global economy and
financial system.
However, there are some upside considerations, as evidenced by the recent, faster-thanexpected improvement in financial conditions.
In particular, the success of various policy

of a need to rebalance global demand, this
finding could be an indication that the forecast
increases in national savings relative to investment in the economies that recorded current

by commensurate declines in national savings in
surplus countries at the assumed constant real
exchange rates. However, these inconsistencies

measures in allaying fears about a 1930s-style
crash in activity and fostering a strong rebound
in financial market sentiment could cause consumption and investment to surge in a number
of advanced and emerging economies, just
as the increase in uncertainty triggered their
collapse in late 2008 and early 2009. In other
words, just as the crisis in confidence was underestimated during the downward spiral, so too
the restoration of confidence may be underestimated during the rebound.
This assessment of the short-term risks to
activity is broadly consistent with that of the markets, as embodied in selected data on options

prices and Consensus Economics expectations (Figure 1.14). These data can be used to
construct a fan chart, which confirms that risks
have narrowed since the April 2009 WEO but
suggests that they remain on the downside.13
The distribution of forecasts for the evolution
of term spreads—typically, a high term spread
anticipates recovery—points to downside risks to
growth, although less so than in the recent past.
Options data about the Standard & Poor’s 500,
by contrast, suggest that stock prices are more
likely to surprise on the upside than the downside, consistent with upside risks to growth.
Market data also give indications about other
specific short-term risks to the recovery. Much
of the recent rebound in oil prices was related
to cutbacks in production by the members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, which were designed to stabilize
prices in response to slumping demand (Appendix 1.1). One key concern in the markets is that
higher oil prices could hinder economic recovery. In fact, oil prices have almost doubled from
their trough earlier this year, and options prices
point to further upside risks. Against this,
considerable spare capacity and high inventory levels should reduce the risk of a sustained
price surge, barring a major geopolitical event.
Thus the projections assume that prices do not
rise much further, in line with forward market
prices. This does not rule out temporary price
spikes, possibly fueled by speculative pressures,
although financial factors cannot drive permanent shifts in real prices.
Another market concern is inflation risk,
namely, that central banks may need to tighten
monetary policy by more than expected to quell
inflation pressures. The inflation risk comes
from two sources. First, potential output may
have slowed more than appreciated, just as
during the late 1970s, following a prolonged
slowdown in activity that policymakers mistook
as cyclical rather than structural. Underlying
inflation pressure would then be higher than
13For a detailed description of the methodology underlying this fan chart, see Elekdag and Kannan (2009).

Risks to a Sustained Recovery

apparent in current inflation data and could
be exacerbated if the recovery surprises on the
upside. Second, the large buildup of excess
central bank reserves generated by unconventional monetary policy actions could feed a
surge in credit growth when the recovery gains
strength. As discussed below, central banks
therefore must follow market developments
closely and use a broad range of tools to tighten
monetary conditions in the face of building
pressures, although such a situation does not
seem imminent.
For a number of emerging economies, by
contrast, inflation risks seem more pressing.
Inflation pressures have not eased as much as
in the advanced economies, except in some
emerging Asian and European economies. At
the same time, output gaps are smaller and
the rebound has been stronger in a number
of these economies. Also, higher commodity
prices tend to spill over faster into generalized wage pressures. Adding to these concerns,
some economies are already seeing large asset
price increases in response to low interest rates
and easy credit, and such pressures could be
exacerbated by strong capital inflows attracted
by their dynamic performance.
Extending the horizon to the medium term,
there are two important risks to sustained recovery, which mainly affect the advanced economies. On the financial front, continued public
skepticism toward what is perceived as bailouts
for those responsible for the crisis could undercut public support for financial restructuring,
thereby prolonging the crisis. The result would
be an even more sluggish recovery or, possibly, a
long-lasting credit crunch and the equivalent of
a “lost decade” for growth.
On the macroeconomic policy front, the
greatest risk revolves around deteriorating
fiscal positions, including as a result of measures to support the financial sector. The
large increase in public debt and contingent
liabilities incurred to provide stimulus to the
economy and stabilize financial systems has
already raised concerns in financial markets, as
suggested by higher credit default swap (CDS)

spreads on sovereign debt and larger sovereign spreads for some advanced economies.14
If the recovery were to stall and be followed
by a prolonged period of stagnation or very
low growth, deficits and debt could balloon to
difficult-to-sustain levels. There is a low probability that such a development could seriously
unsettle global bond markets. Presumably,
concerns would surface first in vulnerable
advanced and emerging economies, notably
those with large financial sectors relative to
the size of their economies or with low revenue
bases and high (notably short-term) public
debt. This could then trigger another retrenchment in capital flows, which could drag down
a number of other advanced and emerging
economies. There could then be another crisis
of confidence, currencies could adjust abruptly,
and demand could slump, possibly raising fears
about fiscal sustainability in even the larger
advanced economies. Investors could react to
these fears by taking flight into government or
corporate bonds issued in economies with low
public debt, including potentially some emerging economies, or by purchasing large amounts
of precious metals. In either case, the world
economy would go through profound turmoil
and a long period of low activity.
Two further risks bear watching. First, whereas
oil prices present some short-term risks, they
present greater medium- to long-term risks to
global growth. In particular, as current excess
capacity is absorbed, prices could rise abruptly
to very high levels just as they did during the
previous upswing. This risk is amplified by cutbacks in investment in new capacity during the
present downturn and continued uncertainties
about oil investment regimes in some countries
that have deferred investment in new fields.
Second, although generally solid international
collaboration has largely contained pressure for
trade and financial protectionism until now, this
pressure could strengthen as unemployment

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

and social problems mount. Barriers to trade
and financial flows might then be erected in
some economies, triggering retaliatory moves
by others. Financial markets could react quickly
and vigorously, anticipating future losses in profits and productivity, leading to another downward spiral in activity. At the time of writing,
however, a surge in protectionism appears to be
a low-probability scenario.
From a policy perspective, the key questions
are how some of the risks discussed here could
interact with the challenges posed by rebalancing and what policymakers can do to prevent
significant damage to global growth. The issues
are illustrated with two scenarios (Figure 1.15).15
In the upside scenario, the major economies
make rapid progress in fixing their financial
systems, with a resulting increase in productivity.
Emerging Asia is assumed to forcefully pursue
policies to raise consumption (strengthening
social safety nets and implementing financial
reforms), while following flexible exchange
rate policies that provide room for sustained
appreciation of both real and nominal exchange
rates. Governments also contribute to demand
through government investment spending concentrated on “green” initiatives and infrastructure spending, the latter especially in emerging
Asia and other economies where there is the
greatest need for additional infrastructure.16 All
these measures encourage a decrease in precautionary saving, especially in emerging Asia,
Japan, and the other major economies, and to a
lesser extent in the euro area. The exception is
the United States, where private saving increases
further, because of the ongoing need for consumer deleveraging. Under this scenario, world
GDP growth is about 1.3 percentage points
higher starting in 2010, contributing to improvements in fiscal positions worldwide. There is
some movement toward global current account
rebalancing as net debtors’ current account

on “green” initiatives could be encouraged
by a broad multilateral agreement on a new framework to
deal with climate change.
16Spending

42

deficits improve and net creditors’ surpluses
decline, with magnitudes equal to about 0.7 percent of GDP in the United States and emerging
Asia and somewhat less elsewhere.
The downside scenario assumes that the
process of restoring the health of the financial
systems in the major advanced economies is
even slower than in the WEO baseline forecast,
with a resulting loss of productivity. Economic
policy missteps could exacerbate this deterioration, including through protectionist measures
that distort incentives and reduce output. In
this scenario, emerging Asia makes very limited progress in rebalancing demand toward
domestic sources, with private saving failing to
decrease by as much as projected in the WEO
baseline. In some regions, especially Japan but
also the United States, sluggish growth is exacerbated by the fact that monetary policy remains
constrained by the zero bound on nominal
interest rates, implying rising pressure on real
interest rates due to price disinflation. Under
this scenario, world GDP growth is about 2.2
percentage points lower starting in 2010. The
objective of global current account rebalancing becomes more elusive, as current accounts
move toward larger surpluses in emerging Asia
and deteriorate in the United States and the
euro area.

Policy Challenges: Reconciling Shortand Medium-Term Objectives
The key policy priorities remain to restore
the health of the financial sector and to maintain supportive macroeconomic policies until
the recovery is on a firm footing, even though
policymakers must also begin preparing for an
eventual unwinding of extraordinary levels of
public intervention. The premature withdrawal
of stimulus seems the greater risk in the near
term, but developing the medium-term macroeconomic strategy beyond the crisis is key to
maintaining confidence in fiscal solvency and
for price and financial stability. The challenge
is to map a middle course between unwinding
public interventions too early, which would jeop-

From a policy perspective, key questions are: How might various risks interact with the challenges posed by rebalancing? And what can policymakers do to prevent
significant damage to global growth? In the upside scenario, the major economies make rapid progress in fixing their financial systems, and emerging Asia is assumed to
forcefully pursue policies to raise consumption, while following flexible exchange rate policies that provide room for sustained appreciation of both real and nominal
exchange rates. Under this scenario, world GDP growth is about 1.3 percentage points higher starting in 2010. The downside scenario assumes that the process of
restoring financial system health in the major advanced economies will be even slower than in the World Economic Outlook (WEO)baseline and various economic policy
missteps exacerbate output losses. Under this scenario, world GDP growth is about 2.2 percentage points lower starting in 2010. The goal of global current account
rebalancing is even farther from resolution, as emerging Asia’s current account moves into larger surplus and the United States and the euro area experience current
account deterioration.

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

ardize the progress made in securing financial
stability and recovery, and leaving these measures in place too long, which carries the risk
of distorting incentives and damaging public
balance sheets. The timing and sequence of
action will vary across countries, depending on
the momentum of their recoveries, policy room,
and progress toward financial sector repair, but
coordination will be necessary to avoid adverse
cross-border spillovers.
History suggests that both premature and/or
delayed exits can be costly. For example, fiscal
retrenchment and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s
doubling of reserve requirements during
1936–37 are blamed for helping to undercut
a nascent recovery.17 Similarly, premature
tax hikes in 1997, along with an unfavorable
external environment, were among the factors
that seem to have contributed to pushing Japan
into recession. By contrast, some argue that the
withdrawal of monetary accommodation after
the bursting of the dot-com bubble was too slow,
leaving easy conditions to fuel excessive risk taking and the subsequent house price boom (see
Taylor, 2009).
Coordination within and across countries is
important, because spillovers from unwinding
some measures could compromise the success
of unwinding others. For example, the premature withdrawal of liquidity support measures
or retail deposit guarantees could delay the
unwinding of government guarantees for bank
bond issues, which rank among the most distortive types of public intervention.

Timing the Tightening of Accommodative
Monetary Conditions
The key issues facing monetary policymakers are when to tighten and how to unwind
large balance sheets. The two objectives do not
necessarily present major conflicts, because
instruments exist to start tightening monetary
17The

extent to which they contributed is still subject
to debate. See Romer and Romer (1989) and Feinman
(1993).

44

conditions even while balance sheets remain
much larger than usual.
The pace at which the buildup in central
bank balance sheets should be unwound
depends on progress in normalizing market
conditions and the types of interventions in
place. As the October 2009 GFSR emphasizes,
continued central bank support will likely be
needed through at least 2010 in many economies, and it could take much longer to unwind
the buildup in illiquid assets on some central
bank balance sheets. Supported by appropriate pricing, short-term liquidity operations will
unwind naturally as market conditions improve,
and this is already occurring. Assets purchased
outright can be resold into markets, starting
with government securities and moving toward
other securities as their markets normalize.
However, getting the timing right is important,
because resale of nongovernment securities
too soon could undermine the gradual process
of stabilizing distressed markets. Specifically,
mortgage-backed securities probably need
to be held for a while, possibly to maturity if
their sale is complicated by the need to continue supporting vulnerable housing markets.
In the meantime, central banks can absorb
reserves as needed to tighten monetary conditions by engaging in reverse repurchase
operations, offering interest-bearing term
deposits to banks, or issuing their own paper.
Less attractive options include raising reserve
requirements or having treasuries sell government paper and deposit the proceeds in
central banks. In any case, it would be useful
for national treasuries and central banks to
develop arrangements to protect central bank
balance sheets from the risks associated with
holding securities for extended periods, as
has been done in some countries, such as the
United Kingdom. Such arrangements help mitigate concerns that central banks might delay
tightening out of concern for the impact of
higher interest rates on the value of the assets
on their balance sheets.
Regarding the timing of monetary policy
tightening, advanced and emerging economies

Policy Challenges: Reconciling Short- and Medium-Term Objectives

face different challenges. In advanced economies, central banks can (with few exceptions)
afford to maintain accommodative conditions
for an extended period. As discussed above,
underlying inflation remains very low, with
spare capacity high and restructuring and rising unemployment putting downward pressure
on labor costs. Fiscal stimulus to growth is
diminishing, and therefore tightening prematurely could undercut the recovery. Although
a prolonged period of very low interest rates
could fuel excessive risk taking, the likelihood
of this is limited over the near term, because
financial markets and households will take a
long time to repair their balance sheets and
extend credit. Nonetheless, once the recovery has firmed to such an extent that output
gaps narrow and inflation becomes more of a
concern, conditions will need to be tightened.
Indeed, as credit begins to grow, accommodative policies may need to be removed more
quickly than after the bursting of the dot-com
bubble in order to limit the scope for renewed
excess (consistent with the findings in Chapter 3), especially in the absence of important
progress toward strengthening prudential
frameworks.
The situation is more varied across emerging
economies, but for a number of them, it will
likely be appropriate to start removing monetary accommodation sooner than in advanced
economies. Inflation pressure has eased in
much of Asia and in some emerging European
economies, and a number of emerging economies, notably in Asia, are already enjoying
relatively vigorous rebounds in activity. Accordingly, unemployment is not forecast to be much
higher in 2010 than before the crisis, implying only limited downward pressure on prices
going forward. Furthermore, some of these
economies are again seeing large asset price
increases in response to low interest rates, raising the danger of new asset price bubbles. As
Chapter 3 underscores, under such conditions,
monetary policymakers may want to tighten
more than suggested by output and inflation
developments. In some economies, this may

require allowing more exchange rate flexibility
to avoid importing an excessively easy policy
stance from the advanced economies.
Looking beyond the immediate challenges,
what are some lessons of the crisis for conducting monetary policy? Chapter 3 argues
that monetary policymakers should put more
emphasis on containing macrofinancial risks,
helped by the introduction of macroprudential tools. Historical evidence suggests that
relatively stable inflation and output growth
offer little protection against major shocks to
the economy from asset price busts: output
and inflation are poor predictors of asset price
busts. Chapter 3 shows that other variables,
notably credit growth and the current account
balance, are better predictors and may deserve
more attention from monetary policymakers. Thus, if concerns mount about domestic
demand and asset prices, monetary policymakers should consider tightening more than
required purely for the purpose of keeping
inflation under control over the coming year or
two. Macroprudential tools have the advantage
of working directly to lean against credit cycles
and can therefore be helpful in complementing
the role of interest rates in stabilizing economies. Expectations of what can be achieved,
however, need to be realistic.
A further question facing central banks is
whether to maintain various changes in monetary policy operations introduced in response
to the crisis, including those relating to their
role as lenders of last resort. The crisis has
made apparent the benefits of a large number
of central bank counterparties and a broad
range of acceptable collateral. However, access
to emergency lending must come in exchange
for tighter supervision and regulation, and in
some cases this requires that supervisors share
more information with central banks. Similarly,
central banks can continue to accept a broader
range of collateral but should adjust pricing
and access conditions to ensure that such
operations are used only to address temporary
liquidity needs and do not become a normal
part of financial intermediation.

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

Maintaining Fiscal Support while Securing Fiscal
Sustainability
Notwithstanding already large deficits and
high debt in many economies, fiscal stimulus
needs to be sustained until the recovery is on
a firm footing and may need to be amplified
or extended beyond current plans if downside risks to growth materialize. Governments
should thus stand ready to roll out new initiatives as necessary. At the same time, they need
to commit to large reductions in deficits over
the medium term and must start addressing
mounting long-term fiscal challenges by advancing reforms to put public finances on a more
sustainable path.
A major concern is that the financial shock
has saddled advanced economies with a large
amount of public debt just as fiscal pressures
from population aging are becoming more
pressing. Public debt in the advanced economies is projected to exceed 110 percent of GDP
by 2014, up from about 80 percent of GDP
before the crisis, even building in significant
fiscal adjustment (much of which remains to
be incorporated into specific measures). This
reflects persistent primary deficits, mounting
interest bills, and modest economic growth.
Population aging will add to deficit pressures
and debt trajectories, particularly after 2015.
Aging-related spending could rise by about
5 percent of GDP in the European Union by
2060 and by about 4–6 percent of GDP in
the United States.18 Large increases are also
expected for Japan. In emerging economies,
by contrast, debt levels are expected to decline
after the initial postcrisis peak, and few of these
economies face a comparable expansion in
aging-related spending.
The large increase in government debt is
likely to put upward pressure on long-term
interest rates as the recovery is sustained, crowding out private investment and some emerg-

(2006), and U.S. Congressional Budget Office (2005).

46

ing economy sovereign issues.19 This will have
dampening effects on growth, but there may
also be other potentially negative effects. Are
there debt levels that are simply too high, that
will cause investor flight even from traditionally safe assets, for example, U.S. government
bonds? Within reasonable debt ranges, there is
no straightforward answer to this question. It
depends on an economy’s growth prospects, on
investor preferences and interest rates, and the
room available to cut spending or raise taxes to
repay the debt in the future, which also brings
up political considerations. Some countries,
such as Italy and Japan, have sustained very
high debt levels for a while already. Fortunately,
neither of them featured among the advanced
economies whose financial systems were badly
hit by the crisis, thus they have avoided major
contingent liabilities. Nonetheless, Italy suffered
a major increase in risk premiums on its debt
for a period during this crisis and had to forego
major fiscal stimulus, whereas Japan has been
protected by its unique circumstances.20 Looking forward, pressures on spending and debt in
advanced economies will mount, and markets
have a tendency to suddenly catch up with slowly
increasing vulnerabilities. In the meantime, the
price of much higher debt in advanced economies is diminished room for countercyclical

19The October 2009 GFSR presents evidence for a
panel of up to 31 advanced and emerging economies
over the period 1980–2007, suggesting that an increase
in the fiscal deficit raises long-term government interest
rates from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 60 basis
points for each percentage point of GDP increase in the
fiscal deficit. The impact of debt accumulation on bond
yields is smaller but still significant. A 1 percent of GDP
increase in debt raises government bond yields by 5 to
10 basis points, with the effects varying depending on
country-specific characteristics. However, GFSR projections through the end of 2010 suggest that in the United
States and euro area net issuance of total credit (sovereign and private) will be well below the levels seen during
the boom years of 2002 to 2007.
20Japanese savers have a very strong preference
for holding domestic government debt. Also, a significant portion of the domestic debt is held by public
institutions.

Policy Challenges: Reconciling Short- and Medium-Term Objectives

policy and financial support in the face of any
new crises.
However, sustained fiscal support in the
near term need not undercut progress toward
long-run fiscal sustainability. Reforms to social
spending programs—particularly if focused on
measures that increase labor force participation
(for example, by linking retirement ages to life
expectancies) or raise the efficiency of welfare
programs––could contribute significantly to
lowering spending over the long term, thereby
facilitating more fiscal support for the recovery. For example, lowering the growth rate of
health care costs by 1 percent a year could lower
government spending by about 1½ percent of
GDP in the Group of Seven (G7) countries in
15 years. Raising the retirement age by one year
could yield fiscal savings of up to ½ percent of
GDP after 15 years. Accordingly, with progress
on both fronts, up-front government financing
costs connected with financial sector support
operations would be recouped fairly quickly.
In practice, such reforms certainly face
formidable political obstacles, and the room
available for stimulus is limited. Thus, it will
be crucial to ensure that stimulus spending
is allocated in a way that maximizes support
for recovery and accelerates a return to solid
medium-term growth. This means that any
new initiatives should give priority to funding
financial sector repair, addressing the heavy
social costs of labor market disruptions, and
helping to forestall large increases in structural
unemployment.
Moreover, rising concerns about fiscal sustainability imply that countries that have accumulated large amounts of debt during this crisis
need to adopt ambitious medium-term adjustment targets and support their achievement
with fiscal frameworks, including suitable fiscal
rules and strong enforcement mechanisms.
Such frameworks and rules can play a useful
role in reining in spending pressures when
good times return, thereby providing a degree
of reassurance to investors that deficits and debt
eventually will be rolled back. Many countries

have already moved in this direction.21 Encouragingly, more steps in this direction are being
taken or are under consideration (for example,
in Germany and the United States), but achieving the right mix of flexibility and discipline
will not be straightforward.

Healing Financial Sectors while Reforming
Prudential Frameworks
Completing financial sector repair and
reforming prudential frameworks are indispensable for a return to sustained growth over the
medium term. In many countries, policy actions
have been insufficient to return banking systems
to a position from which they can sustain the
recovery with solid credit growth, and remedying this shortfall must be given priority. In
addition, attention must be paid to managing
the exit from public support for financial operations and to reforming prudential frameworks to
ensure stronger risk management.
Restructuring financial firms’ activities is key
for normal lending to resume. This will require
balance sheet cleansing, recapitalization, and
new business plans that are consistent with new
funding models and new prudential frameworks.
So far, there has been only very limited progress
in removing impaired assets from bank balance
sheets.22 The main challenge now is ongoing
deterioration of asset quality, and so public policies and financial institutions have to become
more forward looking and preemptive. Official
stress tests are important instruments through
which the condition of banks can be diagnosed
and comprehensive recapitalization programs
put in place. On this front, progress across
countries has been uneven, and it is a source of
21See

Ter-Minassian and Kumar (2008).
arrangements for dealing with impaired
assets are in place in the United States, for example, but
have hardly been utilized thus far. The European Union
has adopted harmonized guidelines to deal with impaired
assets, leaving it up to individual countries to decide
whether to do this through a bad bank, guarantee, or
hybrid approach.
22Institutional

47

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

concern that support for recapitalization faces
important political obstacles.
Exit strategies need to be clearly articulated
to help guide bank restructuring. Banks face
a “wall of maturities” in the next two years,
increasing the rollover risks. In this setting,
there are risks associated with abrupt changes in
the level of support provided to these institutions, and strict deadlines for ending such
programs should be avoided––some countries
that had announced deadlines for removing
wholesale guarantees have had to extend them.
Instead, subsidies can be gradually reduced
and access terms tightened for any facilities
that may need to be extended. Healthy firms
should be encouraged to repay capital injections
and issue nonguaranteed debt to signal their
viability, whereas chronically undercapitalized
firms should be resolved rather than kept on life
support. Reprivatization can wait until reform is
sufficiently advanced, but management of publicly owned financial institutions should focus on
limiting distortions to competition or stability.
Regarding fundamental reform, the October
2009 GFSR explains the many challenges facing
policymakers. Even though initiatives are getting
under way to address these, the achievement of a
major overhaul must not be jeopardized by growing confidence that the greatest crisis dangers
are past, fears that national competitive advantages might be lost, or concerns that first-best
solutions are out of reach for technical reasons.
Three challenges deserve particular attention:
• The perimeter of regulation needs to be
broadened and made more flexible, covering all systemically important institutions.
In this regard, the challenge of dealing with
the problem posed by institutions that are
too big or too connected to fail will need to
be addressed. Proposals have been made to
strengthen resolution frameworks, including by requiring such institutions to develop
resolution plans and to hold more capital to
compensate for their larger contributions to
systemic risk, as well as giving authorities the
power to impose losses on senior creditors.
Other proposals are to separate commercial

48

from investment banking and to remove
proprietary trading activity from commercial
and investment banks. The costs and benefits
of such proposals require further analysis,
weighing potential losses from lower returns
to scale and scope against potential benefits
from reduced exposures to systemic risks.
• Prudential frameworks must play a greater
stabilizing role over the economic cycle. Once
the crisis started, mark-to-market rules and
constant regulatory capital ratios forced financial institutions to take dramatic measures
to reduce their balance sheets, exacerbating
fire sales and deleveraging. The opposite
forces were driving a credit accelerator during boom times. It is difficult to gauge the
extent to which these forces are hardwired
into prudential frameworks or imposed by
markets. One element of procyclicality could
be addressed through establishing minimum
capital requirements according to stress-test
scenarios and an overall leverage ratio. These
could be complemented by raising supervisory risk weights for rapidly growing loan or
asset classes. Other proposals include requiring countercyclical capital charges or allowing
regulators to alter capital requirements (or
other regulatory requirements) over the cycle
just as central banks alter interest rates.23
• The final challenge is to improve international coordination and avoid financial
protectionism. This will require greater
supervisory and regulatory convergence, with
a view to limiting incentives for cross-border
regulatory arbitrage, and robust arrangements (including appropriate bank-specific
insolvency frameworks at national levels) to
resolve cross-border institutions and counter
incentives for beggar-thy-neighbor approaches
to addressing crises. Progress is being made
on convergence under the auspices of the
Financial Stability Board; progress on resolution faces major political hurdles, even within
23These

proposals present major challenges for policymakers, not least of which is determining when buffers
need to be built up and when they can be released.

Policy Challenges: Reconciling Short- and Medium-Term Objectives

the European Union, which has been debating this issue for some time.

Structural and Social Policy Challenges
Rising unemployment will present a major
challenge in many advanced economies.
Chapter 4 suggests that unemployment rates
tend to rise significantly and for many years
after financial shocks, and this time will be no
exception. Limiting the extent of job destruction will require slower wage growth or even
wage cuts for many workers. The impact of the
necessary adjustments on poorer segments of
labor forces could be cushioned with earned
income tax credits or similar programs that
limit the social repercussions of wage adjustment. Subsidizing part-time work to facilitate a
broad distribution of reductions in labor input
and allow a more gradual reduction in wages
may also be appropriate, provided there are
reassurances that such programs are cut back
as good times return. Those who still lose their
jobs should be supported with unemployment
benefit programs that are generous (to support
demand and prevent hardship) but not too
long in duration, appropriately means-tested
social support mechanisms, and increased
resources for job matching as well as better
education and training. In addition, many of
the structural reforms that past issues of the
WEO have emphasized to improve the flexibility of labor markets remain relevant, possibly
even more so to raise medium-term prospects
after a damaging crisis.24
In some countries, product or services
market reforms could help create new employment opportunities and enhance productivity

24Recovery

from the major shocks of the 1970s and
early 1980s was made more difficult by sometimes wellmeaning but often ill-considered initiatives that hindered
labor market adjustment, such as the introduction of
early retirement programs or the abuse of support for the
disabled or the poor through the provision of virtually
open-ended support for able but jobless workers. See,
for example, Layard, Nickell, and Jackman (1991), and
Blanchard and Wolfers (2000).

growth.25 In emerging economies with large
external surpluses and tradables sectors,
reforms could usefully focus on the service
sectors, which tend to be less competitive and
more protected, and to generate relatively
slower productivity growth.26 Completion of the
Doha Round of global trade negotiations could
provide a timely boost to global confidence and
trade, although it remains equally critical to
avoid any backsliding on trade liberalization
and competition policies.
Structural reforms, together with greater
exchange rate flexibility, can also make an
important contribution to facilitating global
demand rebalancing. In this regard, the upside
scenario for rebalancing underscores the
importance of measures to repair financial
systems; improve corporate governance and
financial intermediation; support public investment, including in green technologies; and
reform social safety nets (including both health
care and pension systems) with a view to fostering lower precautionary saving in some countries with large current account surpluses. Even
with a strong commitment to reform along
these and other lines by all countries, however,
rebalancing is likely to be a drawn-out process. In the meantime, the reforms would help
strengthen the resilience of a global economy
that remains unusually vulnerable to renewed
shocks.
Finally, there is a risk that poverty could
increase significantly in a number of developing economies, notably in sub-Saharan Africa,
where real GDP per capita is contracting in
2009 for the first time in a decade. Past reforms
and changes in trade and financial patterns
should help soften the blow from lower growth
in advanced economies in comparison with
past crises. Nonetheless, continued donor support from advanced economies will be crucial
25In fact, evidence on successful labor market reforms
in response to crises in Europe suggests that it was often
supported with product market reforms, because they
boosted job creation and wages. See, for example, Estevão (2005) and Annett (2006).

Developments and Prospects

Nese Erbil, Thomas Helbling, Shaun Roache, and
Marina Rousset.
After collapsing during the second half of
2008, commodity prices broadly stabilized in
early 2009 and subsequently staged a strong rally
in the second quarter, despite generally high
inventories that resulted from the weak demand
through the recession (Figure 1.16; Table 1.2).
A rally this strong at such an early stage in the
recovery of global industrial production contrasts with past experience.27 In previous global
downturns, prices typically continued to fall into
the early phases of recovery (Figure 1.17) or
rose at rates far below the increases recorded
in recent months. The exception is oil prices,
which recorded substantial increases early in
previous recoveries as well. However, commodity

prices also fell faster and by larger magnitudes
during the second half of 2008 than during
previous downturns.
The early commodity price rebound has led
to renewed discussion of whether prices are
increasingly driven by commodity financial
investment. The revival in investor risk appetite
and improved sentiment since March 2009,
together with a renewed tendency toward dollar
depreciation, have led to increased financial
investment in commodity assets. However, as
noted in previous issues of the World Economic
Outlook, these inflows still tend to follow changes
in fundamentals. In the current circumstances,
they reflect two interrelated factors. First, there
was the growing consensus that the worst of the
global recession and the collapse in commodity
demand were over and that a recovery would
begin in 2009. Second, there was increasing
confidence that, with unprecedented financial
sector support and macroeconomic policy stimulus, the probability of another systemic financial
sector event had decreased.
The perception of an improving near-term
outlook has affected physical commodity markets primarily by increasing the incentive to
hold inventories. At the same time, improving
financial conditions have provided for increased
credit availability for inventory financing at
more normal costs. The rising inflows into commodity funds, which contributed to the normalization of liquidity conditions in commodity
futures markets, likely facilitated the hedging
of inventory positions. Against this backdrop,
additional expectations-based demand for inventories, and some stabilization in stock buildups
as end-user demand bottomed out, allowed for
easier absorption of the continued excess supply
(current supply minus current end-user consumption). Downward pressure on spot prices
eased in turn. Longer-dated futures prices have
been less affected by the change in expectations
about near-term market conditions, and the
upward slope of commodity futures curves has
flattened as spot prices have recovered.
The magnitude of recent price increases varied considerably across commodities, irrespec-

tive of the relative strength of financial inflows.
Underscoring the influence of fundamentals,
the variation in price changes reflects differences in the cyclical sensitivity of commodities,
but also reflects commodity-specific factors,

52

as discussed below. In particular, prices in oil
markets were supported not only by recovery
expectations, but also by Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) supply cuts,
while metal prices have been buoyed by restocking in China.
Commodity demand prospects now depend
increasingly on growth in emerging and developing economies, given the steady rise in their
market shares (Table 1.3). Moreover, commodity demand in these economies is more
income-elastic than in advanced economies.
With a buoyant recovery already under way in
emerging Asia and the recovery in emerging
and developing economies generally advancing
ahead of that in advanced economies, commodity demand is strengthening ahead of activity
in advanced economies. Commodity prices,
especially in cyclically sensitive sectors, have thus
responded strongly to news about an earlierthan-expected recovery under way in emerging
Asia in the second quarter of 2009.
The extent of further upward price pressure
will depend on the timing and strength of the
global recovery. With inventories remaining
above average except for food commodities and
with substantial spare capacity in many commodity sectors, such pressure is likely to remain
moderate for some time, unless stronger-thanexpected global growth leads to a rapid drawdown of these buffers. There are also near-term
risks that the largely expectation-driven price
rebound could be partially reversed if the
global recovery is more sluggish than currently
expected in commodity markets. Probability
distributions derived from the option prices of
key commodities suggest that the market has
become more confident that the recent rebound
of commodity prices during the second quarter
of 2009 will be sustained and that further price
increases are likely (see Box 1.6 for further
details). In particular, option pricing for a
broad-based commodity index, crude oil, and
copper suggests that investors anticipate higher
prices during the second half of 2009 compared
with the first two quarters. That said, the probability of another commodity price spike is seen

Appendix 1.1. Commodity Market Developments and Prospects

Box 1.6. What Do Options Markets Tell Us about Commodity Price Prospects?
Over the past decade, both exchange-based
and over-the-counter commodity derivative markets have grown rapidly. The growth pattern of
these markets appears to vary widely across commodities and across derivative types. For example, derivative (options and futures combined)
contracts for crude oil trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange grew fivefold during 1998–
2008, with options outgrowing futures by five
times. For other key commodities, the growth
magnitude is smaller, and the divergence in
growth rates between options and futures is
less prominent (first figure). The number of
commodity derivative contracts outstanding,
however, plummeted during the second half
of 2008—particularly for crude oil—although
there have been signs of a rebound for some
commodities more recently.

What Is the Logic behind the Use of Option Prices
for Economic Analysis?
The rapid growth of commodity futures and
options transactions has increased the depth,
liquidity, and efficiency of these derivative
markets, thereby improving their information content. Indeed, it is well documented
that derivatives—particularly options—contain
useful information about market expectations
that can enrich the analysis of economic and
financial prospects.1 The logic is that option
premiums conveying the right to buy or sell an
underlying asset at a certain strike price should
reflect markets’ views of the probability distribution of future prices, which determines the
expected option payoff. For example, a bullish
and forward-looking investor would be willing to
pay a higher premium to exercise a call option
at a strike price beyond the current spot price;
similarly, a bearish and forward-looking investor
would be willing to pay a higher premium to
exercise a put option at a strike price below the
current spot price.

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

Box 1.6 (concluded)
Such information extracted from options
markets can help in gauging risks in the future,
which can help in devising alternative scenarios
or stress tests. Furthermore, unlike uncertainty
measures from most econometric models that
are backward looking, measures from this
approach are forward looking, and thus implicitly encompass all risk factors currently considered in the market.
In this respect, the World Economic Outlook has
presented a so-called risk-neutral probability
distribution for Brent crude oil for the past few
years. Recently, the IMF staff has developed a
new framework that provides for more stable
results and can be applied to other futures
options as well.2 The advantage of the new
framework is that, unlike the old framework,
which required data input of a granular set of
artificial price quotes estimated by the Intercontinental Exchange, the new framework relies
solely on actual market data. Furthermore, the
new model allows a high degree of flexibility to
capture a wide range of statistical properties.
This framework has been used to generate
probability distributions for the Continuous
Commodity Index—a broad-based commodity
index consisting of 17 component commodities—as well as a number of key commodities
including crude oil, gold, copper, and corn (second figure). The results suggest that compared
with distributions estimated in early April, the
probability distributions (as of early August and
mid-September) of the eight-month-forward
contracts for crude oil and copper have shifted
to the right—suggesting a higher expected
price—while their dispersion has declined—suggesting a decline in perceived volatility (third
figure). This decline in dispersion also echoed a
decline in the Crude Oil Volatility Index by the
Chicago Board Options Exchange in the second

2This framework—which builds on the doublelognormal approach by Bahra (1997)—uses a mixture
of multiple lognormal distributions. For a detailed discussion on the technical foundation of the framework
and its advantages over other existing methodologies,
see Cheng (forthcoming).

shifted slightly to the left, but also with a slightly

Caveats
The information derived from option
prices must be interpreted with some caution.
Specifically, the estimated probabilities, as in
any other approach, assume that markets are
risk neutral. This method tends to exaggerate
the likelihood of an undesirable outcome if
investors are risk averse. Intuitively, a risk-averse

addition, the distributions have also become
somewhat less skewed with a less-thick tail, although
the differences are marginal.

Finally, commodity prices will also partly
depend on U.S. dollar developments. Empirically, there has been a generally robust negative association between commodity prices and
fluctuations in the effective U.S. dollar exchange
rate, both in nominal and real terms.28 Although

may vary over time, depending on the underlying disturbances, the negative correlation is
consistent with incentives to hold commodity
inventories to hedge against dollar fluctuations in the short term, with the dollar’s effect
on relative purchasing power becoming more
important over the longer term.
Commodity prices are projected to remain
high by historical standards through the
medium term. The crisis has reduced prices
somewhat below their 2008 peaks, but
demand is expected to continue rising from
current levels at a solid pace as industrializa-

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

tion continues in emerging and developing
economies. Accommodating this demand will
eventually require a substantial further capacity expansion in many commodity sectors,
with some need to tap higher-cost sources.
The extent of medium-term price pressure
will vary across commodities, depending on
the speed of and impediments to capacity
buildup, as discussed below.

Oil Markets
Oil prices have responded strongly to perceptions that the worst of the global recession
is over and to signs of a demand rebound in
China. After reaching a low of $36 a barrel on
February 27, 2009, oil prices started to rebound
in March and climbed to $70 by midyear.29 At
the same time, oil price volatility declined to
levels that were still somewhat elevated compared with pre-2008 values but well below those
following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in
September 2008.
The strong price response to signs of an
expected pickup in activity follows patterns
observed during some earlier global slowdowns,
notably 2000−01. However, in the current
downturn, global oil consumption contracted
much more deeply than in any recession since
the early 1980s, by well in excess of 2 million
barrels a day (mbd) from the fourth quarter of
2008 to the second quarter of 2009 (Table 1.4).
The large demand declines are largely attributable to advanced economies, particularly the
United States and Japan, although oil-consumption growth in emerging and other developing
economies also decelerated and, in some cases,
entered negative territory in the first quarter of
2009.
Faced with such demand weakness, OPEC
implemented a series of production cuts to
support prices. By August 2009, the reduc-

Average Petroleum Spot Price (APSP), which is a simple
average of the prices for West Texas Intermediate, dated
Brent, and Dubai Fateh grades.

56

tion in OPEC production from the September
2008 base level was estimated at 2.8 mbd, some
70 percent of the target. This compliance record
is broadly in line with the past record, although
the downward adjustment in both OPEC production quotas and actual production was faster.
Non-OPEC production has broadly stagnated
through the contraction. Although excess supply has narrowed in recent months with OPEC
production cuts, it remained positive through
the first half of 2009, and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
inventories continued to increase, primarily in
the United States.
Price developments will partly depend on how
strongly supply responds to recovering demand.
With non-OPEC supply unlikely to pick up
substantially—given high decline rates in some
large, mature fields, notably in the North Sea
and Mexico, and given sluggish capacity buildup
because of barriers to investment in many
countries—this response will depend largely on
OPEC production. The experience of recent
episodes of deliberate production cuts suggests
that OPEC members will respond gradually and
with some lag to increasing demand and rising
price pressure. Indeed, recent statements by key
OPEC officials suggest that OPEC production
increases will be predicated on a substantial
drawdown of OECD inventories to more normal
stock-use levels and on an oil price within the
target range of $70−$80 a barrel.
Risks of a sustained price surge from current
market levels during the recovery should be contained by large excess capacity and high inventories, barring any significant change to the
medium-term oil market outlook. Some tightening of demand-supply balances in the second
half of 2009 and in 2010 has already been priced
in. Measured spare capacity is not necessarily
a good indicator of actual oil market tightness
in a period of price-oriented production policy
decisions. Nevertheless, current spare capacity—
which, as of August 2009, is estimated at some
6½ mbd, with about 3½ mbd accounted for by
Saudi Arabia—is twice the average level over
the past decade and will be boosted by already

In line with broad commodity market developments, most metal prices rebounded in the second quarter of 2009. By end-July, the IMF metal
daily index had risen by nearly 60 percent from
its trough earlier in the year—led by copper,
lead, and nickel (Figure 1.19, upper right-hand
panel). Besides the improvement in near-term
global economic and financial prospects—which
elicited strong price responses from the cyclically
sensitive base metals—the price rebound also
reflected metal-specific factors.

subdued in advanced economies. On the supply
side, the concern is that capacity expansion will
remain sluggish, as in 2005–08. The financial
crisis and the oil price decline of last year have
already delayed some projects and led to the
suspension of others. Nonetheless, the recessionrelated setback to capacity expansion is likely to
be temporary. Oil prices have already recouped
some of the losses of 2008 and are now well
above the average price over the past decade.
The costs of oil investment have also declined in
recent quarters, which should support exploration and development.
The main supply-side concerns, however,
continue to be oil investment regimes and geological and technical constraints. First, the deterioration in incentives provided by investment
regimes in some producer countries remains a
concern.30 Second, new oil fields are smaller in
size and present greater technological and geological challenges, and the decline rates of many
existing fields have risen by more than expected.
As a result, more investment is needed just to
maintain current capacity.

As metal prices approached or fell below marginal costs, key metal producers began cutting
production runs to save costs. Indeed, unlike in
the 2001 global downturn, when metal production moved sideways despite a strong decline in

30See

Box 1.5 in the April 2008 World Economic Outlook.

Appendix 1.1. Commodity Market Developments and Prospects

demand, supply cuts were prompt and much
more prominent (Figure 1.19). Global production of a few key metals—such as aluminum,
tin, and zinc—declined by about or more than
10 percent (seasonally adjusted annual rate)
during April 2008–February 2009, when global
industrial production was contracting.

Restocking in China
As part of China’s fiscal stimulus package, the
country’s Strategic Reserve Bureau started to
boost its inventories to support domestic smelters and refiners. Private metal demand in China
also started to increase because of a rebound in
industrial production. Along with a rising price
differential at the Shanghai Futures Exchange
relative to the London Metal Exchange, this
boosted net imports to China (Figure 1.19,
middle and lower panels).
The impetus from restocking in China will be
temporary, and metal price prospects depend
on the speed at which activity in China strengthens and on the pace of recovery in the rest of
the world. As in the case of oil, a good part of
the recovery in metal demand has already been
priced in, and further strong price increases
in the near term seem unlikely at this point
because of substantial excess capacity.

Food
On signs of improving global economic and
financial conditions in March, food prices enjoyed
a broad-based, albeit modest, recovery. More
recently, however, commodity-specific factors—
including stabilizing weather conditions and
expanded acreage in some major crop producers—have led to wide divergence in price changes
across the major global crops. The overall food
price index increased by 15 percent through
the first seven months of 2009, but corn prices
declined by 5 percent and soybean prices rose
20 percent. Corn has been affected by declining
demand for industrial usage, including ethanol,
while projected harvests for 2009−10 are higher.
Looking ahead, as reflected in futures prices,
food prices are expected to rise only gradu-

ally throughout the global economic recovery.
Demand is relatively insensitive to the business
cycle compared with other commodities, and
future harvests are expected to be fairly abundant, although there is the prospect that the El
Niño weather pattern may affect production of
some crops, particularly soybeans, through 2010
(Figure 1.20, first panel).
However, there are upside risks to prices.
Agricultural supply-demand balances remain
relatively tight, with the global stock-to-use ratio
for the major crops of corn, rice, soybeans, and
wheat expected to remain below their average
levels over recent decades (Figure 1.20, second
panel). Low inventory ratios are a result, in
part, of food demand in emerging economies,
which rose quickly during 2001−07 (Figure 1.20,
third panel). The renewed pickup in growth
in these economies over the coming years will
keep market balances tight, and risks are that
the increases in food price volatility observed
over the past decade or so will be sustained (see
Box 1.7).
Another risk concerns the higher cost of
energy, particularly as oil prices remain well
above their decade averages. Higher energy
prices drive up the cost of farming through fuel
inputs and fertilizer prices. An indirect effect
of higher oil prices is the increased incentive
to divert food crops toward biofuel production.
Acreage dedicated to biofuel production has
increased significantly in recent years—helped
by high oil prices and, particularly in advanced
economies, by policy incentives. In the United
States, the fall in the oil price has led to a
sharp decline in ethanol-refining margins and
to industry consolidation. However, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture projects that the
proportion of U.S. corn production used for
ethanol will still rise in 2009−10, albeit at a
slower pace than had been projected in 2008
(Figure 1.20, fourth panel). These emerging
biofuel linkages have led to an increase in the
correlation between food and energy prices, and
although these prices were possibly inflated by
the effects of the extreme volatility of 2008, they
will likely remain higher than in the past.

Appendix 1.1. Commodity Market Developments and Prospects

Box 1.7. What Explains the Rise in Food Price Volatility?
The sharp rise and fall of food prices during 2005–08 was associated with a significant
increase in price volatility. For the IMF food
price index, realized volatility—measured by
the annualized standard deviation of monthly
price changes—increased from about 8 percent
for the decade through 2007 to more than
22 percent since 2008 (first figure, first panel).
Although still lower than for other commodities, the volatility of prices for most major crops
reached record or multidecade highs during
this latest period.
This box presents evidence that long-term
real price volatility—variability that is expected
to prevail on average over very long time
horizons—has risen for most major crops in
recent years.1 Market-determined food prices
will always be subject to short-term variability
because factors such as weather and crop pests
affect harvests, and there is little that policies
can do to reduce these effects. Over longer time
horizons, stretching beyond the next harvest,
other factors could have more persistent effects
on longer-term volatility. This box identifies four
such factors, including the volatility of U.S. inflation, the volatility of the U.S. dollar exchange
rate, the volatility of global economic activity,
and changes in futures market trading volumes.
Volatility spillovers from energy prices may have
only just begun to exert a significant influence.
The macroeconomic effects of elevated food
price volatility can be broad and far-reaching,
particularly when increases persist for long periods. The direct effects are felt through the balance of payments of importers and exporters,
inflation, and poverty levels (food can account
for a large share of consumption expenditure in
low-income countries). Volatility can also complicate the response of policymakers, including
through the effects on budgets and the planning decisions of food producers, processors,
and consumers.
The author of this box is Shaun Roache.
1Food commodity prices are denominated in U.S.
dollars and have been deflated by the U.S. consumer
price index for this analysis.

Estimating Long-Term Food Price Volatility
Almost all methods to estimate price volatility assume that the long-term level of variation (also known as unconditional volatility) is
constant, a restrictive assumption considering
the shifts in commodity price volatility observed
over long horizons. An alternative approach
outlined by Engel and Rangel (2008) is to
allow for gradual changes in long-term volatility
over time.2 Applying this method to six major
crops—corn, palm oil, rice, soybeans, sugar, and
wheat—suggests that although long-term real
price volatility moves much more gradually than
total volatility (which includes seasonal factors),
it has been increasing in recent years (second
panel, which shows wheat as an example). The
increase for rice has been modest, but for the
other five commodities, estimated long-term
volatility in annualized terms had increased by
between 7 and 13 percentage points as of June
2009 compared with the levels of the mid-1990s
and now ranges from 23 to 26 percent for corn,
soybeans, and wheat, the most traded commodities (third panel). For most crops, these
increases reflects a steady rise in real price
variability that predates the most recent boom
and bust.
Factors Affecting Unconditional Volatility
Previous research suggests a range of factors
that may influence long-term food price volatility. A number of models posit a strong role for
the level of inventories, with periods of low
stocks characterized by higher volatility as market participants react quickly to the prospects of
physical shortages. Macroeconomic factors such
as the level and volatility of U.S. inflation, U.S.
real interest rates, and the U.S. dollar exchange
rate are also potential influences. Commodities
are often regarded as stores of wealth, and the
incentive to hold them—as financial assets or
inventory—increases with inflation and lower
2This model uses a nonparametric approach—an
exponential quadratic spline—to generate a smooth
curve describing long-term volatility based exclusively
on data evidence.

purchasing power and the effect on margins for
producers with non-U.S.-dollar costs. Changes
in global economic activity affect commodity
demand, and demand volatility is likely to spill
over to food price volatility. Crude oil price volatility may play a role, because of the impact on
input costs and, more recently, the demand for
food crops as biofuels. Global stock market volatility could be influential as a result of its role as
a barometer of investor risk aversion and uncertainty. Futures market activity, such as changes
in open interest and trading volumes (measured
in percentage terms to remove trends) may
also affect variability, particularly if new market
participants follow price momentum strategies
and amplify price movements.4 The study also
includes a measure of the effect of El Niño
weather patterns, because some studies have
shown that these have a significant influence
on commodity prices (Brunner, 2002).5 One
important factor missing from this analysis is the
impact of farm policy, which has been shown
to be important for some crops during certain
periods but which is difficult to measure.
To assess the importance of these factors,
long-term real food price volatility was estimated
as a function of these factors using harvest
year data from 1968 through 2008. The results
identified four factors as exerting a significant
influence on long-term volatility.6 U.S. infla-

4All variables were tested for endogeneity. Only
open interest exhibited endogeneity for most commodities. All regressions were rerun using lags as
instruments for open interest, and the results were
not qualitatively different.

in global weather patterns caused by shifts in Pacific
Ocean atmospheric pressure and the resultant El

variables.

tion volatility has a strong effect, which may
reflect commodities’ role as a store of wealth.
For example, one standard deviation increase
in annualized inflation volatility (about 70 basis
points) increases long-term real food price
volatility by between 3 and 7 percentage points,
depending on the commodity. Increased variability in global economic activity, as measured
by an index of real shipping costs constructed
by Kilian (2009), leads to higher food price
volatility, which underscores the long-lasting
impact of changing demand.7 U.S. dollar volatility is significant, but only after controlling for
tion of inflation measures, whereas coefficients on the
volatility of oil prices, equity prices, and open interest
were zero, which was accepted by log-likelihood ratio
tests. Rice was excluded from the analysis because
it exhibited significantly different behavior from all
other commodities. The level of U.S. inflation was
highly significant only for sugar.
7As noted by Kilian (2009), this provides a direct
measure of global economic activity that does not
require exchange rate weighting and aggregates
activity in all countries, incorporating changes in the
composition of real output, or changes in the propensity to import industrial commodities for a given unit
of real output. Levels of activity also had an influence,
but the sign changed based on the estimation, which
makes these results less robust.

the influence of the real interest rate, because
the two variables were highly collinear.8 Of the
financial market measures, only the change
in trading volume is significant, with higher
futures market activity raising real price volatility. However, the effect is small; for example,
the average 68 percent increase in volume over
2008 would lead to an increase in long-term
volatility of less than 1½ percentage points.
In summary, the evidence suggests that
changes in some macroeconomic and financial
variables can have a lasting impact on food
price volatility. Other factors included in the
study, including El Niño weather patterns and
inventories, appear to have only short-term
effects. For the two potential sources of volatility
that have come to the fore recently—financial
speculation and oil prices—there is less evidence of significant effects. However, in the case
of energy prices, the linkage process may be
at an early stage, and the role of biofuels may
strengthen this volatility transmission mechanism in the future.

The U.S. Economy Is Stabilizing as the Crisis Subsides

Country and Regional Perspectives

The global economy seems to be on the verge of recovery. The advanced economies, hit particularly hard by
financial crises and the collapse in world trade, are
showing signs of stabilization, driven mainly by an
unprecedented public policy response. The shape of the
recoveries will vary, however, with economies that suffered financial crises likely to experience weaker recoveries than those that were affected mainly by the collapse
in global demand. The rebound in emerging and other
developing economies is being led by a resurgence in
Asia, most notably in China and India, fuelled by
policy stimulus and a turn in the global manufacturing cycle. Other emerging economies are benefiting
from commodity price increases, as well as from policy
frameworks that are stronger than during previous
crises. However, recovery in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) and emerging Europe is
likely to be difficult, especially for economies most
affected by sharply falling capital flows and domestic
financial sector turmoil.

The U.S. Economy Is Stabilizing as the
Crisis Subsides
The U.S. economy is showing increasing signs
of stabilization. Output declined substantially
during the first half of 2009, and the unemployment rate rose to a level not seen since the early
1980s. Nevertheless, unprecedented monetary,
financial, and fiscal policy interventions are
helping stabilize consumer spending and
housing and financial markets, which points to
renewed moderate growth in the second half of
2009 (Figure 2.1).
Financial conditions have improved by considerably more than anticipated in the April
2009 World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast.
Interbank spreads have returned close to precrisis levels, and equity markets have rallied,
although they remain way below previous peaks.
High-grade corporate issues have rebounded,
and corporate bond and mortgage spreads have

tightened considerably, the latter in part reflecting massive purchases of mortgage-backed
securities by the U.S. Federal Reserve. On the
negative side, although the Term Asset Loan
Facility has helped restart some securitization
in markets for consumer and small business
credit, overall securitization activity remains
low. Credit also remains difficult to obtain for
many households and businesses, with bank
loan standards continuing to tighten, albeit at a
slower pace.
For banks, the results of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) reported in May
have bolstered investor confidence, with many
banks subsequently raising common equity on
public markets and issuing nonguaranteed debt.
Results for the second quarter of 2009 outperformed expectations, although in part because
of a temporary surge in underwriting revenues,
even while provisions for losses on most asset
classes continued to rise in view of the likely
continued deterioration of loan performance.
Output data confirm that the economy is stabilizing, with the preliminary estimate for 2009
second-quarter real GDP showing a decline of
only 1 percent (seasonally adjusted annual rate),
a significant improvement from the 6.4 percent
fall during the first quarter. Nonetheless, the saving rate continues to climb and business investment to sink. Given the collapse of demand
in the rest of the world, exports have made a
negative contribution in recent quarters, which
has been more than offset by the reduction in
imports. Positive contributions were made by
state and federal spending in the second quarter, reflecting the impact of fiscal stimulus.
The U.S. economy is projected to contract
by 2¾ percent in 2009, mainly because of the
sharp contraction during the first half of the
year (Table 2.1). Growth is expected to turn
positive in the second half of 2009, reflecting
the continuing fiscal boost and turns in both

the inventory and the housing cycles. However,
although financial conditions have improved
significantly in recent months, markets remain
stressed, and this will weigh on investment and
consumption. Combined with the impact of rising unemployment, the temporary nature of the
fiscal stimulus, and subdued growth in trading
partner economies, growth will remain sluggish, reaching 1½ percent for 2010 as a whole.
Unemployment is expected to peak at above
10 percent in the second half of 2010, while rising economic slack should keep core inflation
below 1 percent through most of next year.
Given the magnitude of shocks and the
cloudy outlook for the rest of the world, there
remains substantial uncertainty around the
near-term outlook. On the upside, the strong
policy response and a rapid recovery in emerging markets could lead to a virtuous circle of
rising confidence, improving financial conditions, and strong aggregate demand growth.
But receding downside risks remain a concern.
In particular, continued household deleveraging and rising unemployment may weigh more
on consumption than forecast, and accelerating
corporate and commercial property defaults
could slow the improvement in financial
conditions.
Turning to the medium-term outlook, potential growth is likely to fall below 2 percent for a
considerable time. Analysis of previous financial crises (see Chapter 4) suggests that many
are followed by large, permanent output losses
relative to precrisis trends, because impaired
financial systems take time to heal and to again
intermediate effectively, slowing investment and
innovation. High cyclical unemployment could
also raise structural unemployment, although
the flexible nature of U.S. labor and product
markets may make the needed reallocation of
employment and capital across sectors more
rapid and less painful than in some other
regions with greater rigidity. On the demand
side, although the personal saving rate has
already climbed to about 5 percent, it may have
to rise further given the need to rebuild household balance sheets.

on Eurostat’s harmonized index of consumer prices.

The strength and sustainability of the recovery will depend on meeting three key policy
challenges:
• continued stabilization of the economy
and financial system;
• an appropriately timed and orderly
unwinding of public support for the
financial system and development of a
strategy to shrink the Federal Reserve’s
balance sheet; and

•

addressing long-term imbalances in
public, household, and financial balance
sheets.
Monetary and fiscal support should be kept
in place until the recovery is well established. If
downside tail risks materialize and the recovery
falters, there will likely be a need for further
measures to support demand on the fiscal side
given that the federal funds rate is close to the
zero bound, although the Federal Reserve could
69

Chapter 2   Country and Regional Perspectives

set up additional targeted credit facilities and
purchase more assets. Moreover, efforts must
continue toward returning financial institutions
to full health through recapitalization and the
repair of balance sheets—this is the indispensable condition for sustained growth. The results
of the SCAP undoubtedly boosted investor confidence in major financial institutions. This could
be undermined, however, if the recovery falters,
leading to depressed earnings, an increase in
nonperforming assets, and further capital losses.
Helping financial institutions clear their balance sheets of troubled assets will also contribute to their renewed ability to resume lending.
The Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP)
was set up to achieve this, by leveraging both
public and private capital within public-private
partnerships to purchase distressed assets, allowing banks and other financial institutions to
free up capital and stimulate new credit. The
PPIP comprises two related parts. The Legacy
Loan Program seeks to draw private capital
into loan markets by providing debt guarantees
from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and equity co-investment from the U.S.
Treasury; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is currently proceeding with a pilot. The
Legacy Securities Program seeks to target legacy
securities by providing debt financing from the
Federal Reserve and by matching private capital
raised for purchasing such securities. Fund managers have been appointed, although no assets
have yet been purchased. It remains to be seen
how successful these programs ultimately will
be, particularly if banks prefer to hold assets to
maturity rather than selling them and recognizing losses up front.
Once a recovery gains traction and wide output gaps start to close, the process of unwinding the monetary stimulus will need to start.
Although this point remains well in the future,
early communication of a clear exit strategy is
key to maintaining market confidence. A premature withdrawal of support before the financial
system has healed would impede the recovery.
Calibrating the timing will be especially challenging given the uncertainty regarding how

70

much the financial crisis has reduced potential
output. Moreover, the massive increase in bank
reserves (one consequence of the ballooning Federal Reserve balance sheet) must not
be allowed to transform into excessive credit
growth and lead to inflation.
Even though many of the short-term liquidity
facilities are already unwinding as market conditions improve, the large quantity of longer-term
assets on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet
will be harder to reduce, and this exposes the
Federal Reserve to significant interest rate risk.
This is especially true for assets that, unlike government securities and agency mortgage-backed
securities, lack a liquid market. Timing the
sale of such longer-term assets will be delicate,
especially given the potential market impact, but
the Federal Reserve can use other tools—reverse
repos and interest paid on deposits—to start
tightening conditions as needed, even while its
balance sheet remains large.
Regarding financial sector regulation, the
crisis has revealed major weaknesses, particularly
a failure to recognize the buildup of systemic
risk. The Obama Administration’s proposals for
regulatory reform are sensible, including an
enhanced focus on systemic risk through creation of a Financial Services Oversight Council
and new mechanisms for prompt, corrective
action for all large, interconnected institutions
(including conservatorship and receivership
powers). The key will be to implement the measures as a comprehensive package, rather than
in piecemeal fashion, and to tackle the problem
of having firms that are “too big or connected to
fail.” One solution to the latter is penalizing size
and complexity via higher capital requirements.
This would also help to partly address increasing
concentration in the U.S. financial system, which
if not resolved could markedly reduce competition and innovation.
The fiscal legacy of the crisis is a high and rising debt trajectory that could become unsustainable without significant medium-term measures.
Deficits are forecast to be 10 percent of GDP for
2009/10 and 2010/11. Although deficits will fall
below the 10 percent level thereafter, the level

Asia: From Rebound to Recovery?

of gross general government debt will continue
to rise rapidly, reaching nearly 110 percent of
GDP by 2014, a worrisome deterioration given
looming health care and pension pressures
related to population aging. The current budget
proposal increases transparency about such
pressures by including medium-term forecasts,
but these are based on growth assumptions that
seem optimistic. More adjustment will likely be
needed to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability,
particularly on the revenue side, given that nondefense discretionary spending is near historical
lows. The shape of health care reform will also
be critical. Whereas richer nations such as the
United States can be expected to spend relatively more on health care, there are significant
inefficiencies in the U.S. health care system, as
evidenced by the fact that similar health care
outcomes are achieved at different costs across
the U.S. states. With this is mind, coverage
should only be expanded in a budget-neutral
manner, and measures are needed to bring
down the rate of cost growth to help maintain
debt sustainability.

Asia: From Rebound to Recovery?
Although Asia’s export-oriented economies
were battered by the abrupt global downturn,
the economic outlook for the region improved
markedly during the first half of 2009. Recent
developments point to a strengthening of
domestic demand and exports, but questions
remain about whether the rebound can become
a self-sustaining recovery—ahead of a stronger
growth pickup in the rest of the world.
The recent, swift turnaround of economic
fortunes is remarkable. At the onset of the crisis,
Asian exporters were hit hard by the collapse of
external demand. The deterioration of activity was especially rapid for the more exportoriented economies (Figure 2.2). In Japan,
GDP shrunk by well above 10 percent on an
annualized basis in the two quarters following
the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September
2008. Slumping demand for durable goods,
especially cars, and a decline in investment

Figure 2.2. Advanced and Emerging Asia: Can the
Recovery Be Sustained?
Signs of a strengthening recovery are increasingly helped by large fiscal stimulus
packages. Financial markets have rebounded, and capital has begun to flow back into
equity markets, while the pullback of foreign banks has ceased. Meanwhile,
industrial production began to grow again in the first half of the year helped by an
unwinding of inventory adjustments.

Chapter 2   Country and Regional Perspectives

activity in the emerging economies in the region
hurt manufacturing exports. Domestic demand
faltered amid rapidly falling confidence, rising
uncertainty, weakening labor markets, tightening
financial conditions, and rising spare capacity. In
other parts of Asia, the manufacturing-oriented
economies (Korea, Singapore, Taiwan Province
of China) also slumped and, by the end of
2008, had recorded peak declines in industrial
production of about 25 percent compared with
levels one year earlier. Only China, Indonesia,
and India escaped a severe recession, the result
of a large policy stimulus and, in the case of
India, less dependence on exports.
The downward slide moderated during the
first half of 2009. Recent indicators point to a
strengthening recovery led by a rapid rebound
in China, where growth accelerated to an annual
rate of 7.1 percent in the first half of the year,
driven entirely by domestic demand. In Japan,
the turnaround was more gradual. Industrial
production began to grow again in March, and
retail sales followed in April, leading to a return
to growth in the second quarter (2.3 percent).
Other emerging and developing Asian economies showed similar signs of stabilization, with
rising industrial production in Hong Kong SAR,
India, Korea, Philippines, Taiwan Province of
China, and Thailand, which lifted growth during the second quarter into positive territory in
several of these economies. The rebound was
led by the electronics sector, which had experienced a sharp drop in production right at the
onset of the crisis. The overall health of banking
sectors in the region also limited the impact of
the financial crisis.
The intensifying rebound in Asia can be
linked to three factors: (1) expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, which has been very
aggressive in some countries; (2) a rebound
in financial markets and capital inflows, which
eased financing constraints for smaller export
enterprises and improved consumer and business confidence; and (3) the growth impulse for
industry following large inventory adjustments.
Extensive fiscal and monetary support helped
ease tensions in financial markets and helped

72

soften the decline in domestic demand, even
bolstering demand in China and India. Central
banks provided ample liquidity (Japan) and
lowered policy rates (India, Indonesia, Korea,
Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan Province of China,
Thailand). In China, a relaxation of credit ceilings and low interest rates buoyed credit growth
(private credit grew by 24 percent during the
first six months of 2009). Given its comparably
robust fiscal position at the onset of the crisis,
discretionary support in Asia has been stronger than in other regions. Fiscal packages in
China and Japan will reach close to 5 percent of
GDP for 2009–10. Most programs are aimed at
bolstering consumption, especially for durables
(Japan, Korea) and at upgrading infrastructure
and retooling factories (China).
The rebound in equity markets and the
resumption of capital inflows in the context of
a generalized decline in risk aversion is providing a further impetus for the Asian economies.
Stock markets rose during the first eight months
of the year by 28 percent in Japan, 65 percent in
the ASEAN-4 economies,1 and 52 percent in the
newly industrialized Asian economies (NIEs).2
This upward shift was accompanied by renewed
capital inflows. Sovereigns tapped international
capital markets, and net equity inflows turned
positive in the second quarter. In addition,
creditor banks in advanced economies stopped
reducing their exposure in emerging Asia. In
tandem, most currencies strengthened, although
they remained below precrisis levels. These
developments were accompanied by a decline
in the spread for Asian corporate debt of more
than 250 basis points since January 2009, which
helped ease financing constraints on corporations and households. Nonetheless, credit
growth has stabilized in several Asian economies,
including India and the NIEs, as private domes-

Asia: From Rebound to Recovery?

tic demand picked up and banks benefit from
ample liquidity and sound capital positions.
A third factor contributing to the rebound in
activity has been inventory rebuilding. In much
of Asia, firms responded to the sharp decline
in demand in the fourth quarter of 2008 by
reducing production and inventories. By mid2009, this destocking process was far advanced
in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan Province of China,
implying that the current rebound in external
demand, together with progress in inventory
adjustment, will provide impulses for increased
production in the export sector.
Despite these positive signs, a sustained turnaround is not assured. Weakening labor markets
will likely put a drag on consumption, and significant excess capacity in industry will dampen
investment demand. Furthermore, the main
driver of past recoveries—a durable rebound in
external demand from outside the region—may
be lacking this time around. Overall, exports
from Asia are still far below 2008 peaks (about
30 percent lower), including in key sectors such
as electronics. That said, the sharp increase in
domestic demand has boosted Chinese imports
from the region, especially from Indonesia and
Korea, and this has helped arrest the sharp contraction in the region’s export sector.
In the baseline projections, growth momentum will build during the second half of 2009,
forming the basis for a generally moderate
recovery in 2010, as external demand from
advanced economies strengthens (Table 2.2).
China and India will lead the expansion this
year and will grow at rates of 8.5 and 5.4 percent, respectively, boosted by large policy stimulus that is increasing demand from domestic
sources. In Japan, after a sharp first-quarter fall,
activity is expected to contract by 5.4 percent in
2009 as a whole, although a sizable fiscal stimulus and a modest increase in exports will support growth in the second half of 2009 and will
lead to a recovery of 1.7 percent in 2010. Given
the significant slack in the economy, inflation
will remain negative until 2012. The outlook for
growth and inflation is similar in the exportoriented NIEs. Output will contract during 2009

by 2.4 percent but will accelerate in the second
half of the year, paving the way for a moderate
expansion in 2010 (3.6 percent). For the ASEAN
economies, the outlook is more mixed. In the
more export-oriented economies (Malaysia,
Thailand), activity will increase gradually during
the second half of 2009, with stronger growth in
2010.
The risks to the growth outlook are gradually becoming more balanced. The pickup
in activity is so far being supported by many
factors that could turn out to be temporary:
rebounding capital markets, inventory adjustment, and expansionary fiscal and monetary
policy. These forces may not be able to bring
about a self­-sustaining recovery if activity does
not strengthen in other regions. On the upside,
however, the policy stimulus in China could support recoveries in other parts of Asia.
With the recovery gaining strength, the
policy challenge is to determine when and
how to withdraw policy support while ensuring a successful transition to more balanced
medium-term growth. Asia’s dependence on
export demand has contributed to rising global
imbalances and has made the region vulnerable
to global demand developments (Table 2.3).
A return to past growth and demand patterns
is unlikely—given drawn-out adjustments in the
United States and Europe—and many Asian
economies therefore need to shift their composition of growth to be more focused on domestic
demand.
From this perspective, some caution is warranted about the sustainability of the rapid level
of credit growth in a few countries, especially
China. Maintaining credit growth at this level
carries the risk of creating incentives for overinvestment, unsustainable asset price inflation,
and a worsening of credit quality in the banking system. Recent monetary expansion should
therefore be unwound as soon as there are clear
signs that economic recovery is established. To
promote growth that is based more on strengthened domestic demand and less on investment
and exports, fiscal support should encourage
private consumption as in Japan, Korea, and

Taiwan Province of China, for example. In
some economies, concerns about fiscal sustainability must be addressed, including through
development of credible medium-term consolidation plans (India, Japan, Malaysia). Particular
attention also must be given to devising exit
strategies from credit-guarantee programs for
corporations, which were adopted in many
parts of Asia during the crisis. Experiences in
Japan and Korea during the past decade show
that such programs can encourage excessive
risk taking and that scaling them back can be
challenging.
Shifting toward a more balanced growth path
will require a combination of demand- and
supply-side measures.
By developing or improving social safety nets
and health care systems, many emerging and
developing economies can help reduce precautionary saving by households. This would
74

free up resources for consumption and create a
larger market for domestic suppliers.
Development of the financial sector should
help ensure efficient allocation of credit. As
financial markets become deeper and more
robust, they can offer stable saving and investment vehicles, which would reduce reliance on
foreign financing and make household savings
a more important funding base for the financial
sector. Easier access to market-based domestic
financing for smaller enterprises may also help
lower high corporate saving rates, help develop
domestic services sectors, and support consumption. Of course, the development of the financial sector should take place in the context of
proper supervisory and regulatory frameworks.
More flexible exchange rate regimes would
help rebalance growth. Appreciating exchange
rates in economies where there is productivity
growth would imply an increase in real house-

hold incomes as import prices decline, thereby
strengthening domestic demand, and would also
send a signal to businesses to shift supply toward
the domestic sector. More flexible exchange
rates would also allow Asian economies to
develop monetary policy into an independent
tool for macroeconomic management, which

Europe: A Sluggish Recovery Lies Ahead
Recent data from Europe suggest that the
pace of decline is moderating. In the second
quarter of 2009, euro area GDP contracted less
than previously expected, with France and Germany posting positive growth and the United
Kingdom registering a more moderate decline.
Although contraction continues in much of
emerging Europe, Poland recorded positive
growth in both the first and second quarters.
Even so, the rebound in Europe is likely to be
slow. Financial market conditions in the region
have improved, but the largely bank-based
financial system will take time to fully resume its
intermediating role. Tight credit conditions will
limit private investment, and rising unemployment will weigh on consumption, even as public
support will need to be gradually withdrawn.
Emerging Europe will need to adapt to much
tighter external financing constraints.
The output decline across the region was
driven by a combination of falling domestic
demand—especially investment—and shrinking trade within the tightly integrated region,
with individual economies suffering to varying
extents depending largely on their precrisis
imbalances (Figure 2.3). Abrupt reversals of
asset price booms, especially in real estate,
caused sharp falls in activity in Ireland, Spain,
the United Kingdom, and a number of other
economies, including some in emerging Europe.
Iceland was hit especially hard and is receiving
IMF support following the collapse of its financial sector. Economies with moderate current
account deficits or surpluses have generally seen
smaller downturns. However, given its export-oriented economy, Germany was severely affected
by the fall in external demand, although activity is now benefiting more than elsewhere in
the region from the recovery in global trade.
In comparison, the downturn in France was
somewhat less pronounced, in part because of
lower trade openness and a larger public sector.
75

Figure 2.3. Europe: A Slow Rebound
The recession is giving way to recovery. The depth of the downturn was linked,
in part, to the extent of domestic and external imbalances in individual economies.
The collapse in intraregional trade and cross-border financing weighed heavily
on the closely integrated regional economy.

Emerging Europe has been hit particularly hard
by the drop in capital inflows. This led to major
contractions in the Baltic economies, Bulgaria,
and Romania, although exchange rates acted
as a shock absorber in economies with flexible
regimes. Bosnia, Hungary, Latvia, Romania, and
Serbia are currently receiving IMF balance of
payments support, whereas Poland has access
to the IMF Flexible Credit Line in order to
safeguard market confidence. In recent months,
the pace of contraction has slowed dramatically
in much of the region, with risk appetite returning, exports accelerating, and the inventory
drawdown moderating, although private credit
remains sluggish and unemployment is on the
rise (Figure 2.4).
The strength of the initial macroeconomic
policy response has been largely determined by
policy room, which varied considerably across
the region. With inflation rates low and credit
markets severely disrupted, central banks in
the advanced economies reduced interest rates
aggressively and introduced some unconventional measures, including direct acquisition of
assets by the Bank of England and purchases of
covered bonds by the European Central Bank.
Many advanced economies committed considerable budgetary resources to support the financial sector, mainly through guarantees. Capital
injections and asset purchases have generally
been more limited so far, with the exception
of Austria, Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands,
Norway, and the United Kingdom. A number of
countries, including Germany, Spain, and the
United Kingdom, introduced large discretionary
stimulus packages to support the economy more
broadly, in addition to the considerable support
provided by automatic stabilizers. At the same
time, countries with more limited policy room at
the onset of the recession, such as Greece, Italy,
and most of the emerging economies, were not
in a position to introduce major stimulus. Moreover, most countries of emerging Europe have
also been constrained by the outflow of foreign
capital (or the risk thereof), with some forced to
tighten their monetary stance and consolidate
fiscal accounts, particularly those economies

Europe: A Sluggish Recovery Lies Ahead

with fixed exchange rates. More recently, subsiding risk aversion has allowed some emerging
economies to cut interest rates.
The pace of decline in activity appears to be
moderating, but the recovery will likely be modest during the coming quarters. The turnaround
during the second half of 2009 is expected to
be driven mainly by rising exports and a turn
in the inventory cycle, with continued support
from policy stimulus. The euro area is projected
to emerge from the recession in the second half
of 2009, with recovery strengthening over the
course of 2010, while inflation should remain
low (see Table 2.1). The turnaround is most
apparent on a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter
basis, from a decline of 2.5 percent in 2009 to
an increase of 0.9 percent in 2010. The modest
pace of recovery is consistent with continued
housing market pressures in some economies,
enduring strains in the largely bank-based
financial sector, and a drag from the labor markets. Even though initial job cuts were moderate, unemployment is projected to approach
10 percent during 2009 and to reach almost
12 percent by 2011, with job creation likely
subdued as widespread reductions in hours
worked are reversed. In the United Kingdom,
real GDP growth is expected to turn positive in
the second half of 2009, as the real estate and
financial markets stabilize and the weakened
sterling supports net exports. In emerging
Europe, following a contraction in real GDP of
5¼ percent in 2009, a return to positive growth
is expected in 2010 (Table 2.4). The recovery is
expected to be slower than in other emerging
regions because many economies will continue
to face serious adjustment problems, given that
cross-border capital flows will likely remain lower
for some time. And the recovery will be uneven:
some emerging European economies—notably
the Baltics—will continue to contract in 2010,
but sizable output gains are expected elsewhere,
notably in Poland and Turkey.
Downside risks to the outlook for Europe are
receding, and some upside risk has surfaced in
several economies. The recovery may be more
sluggish than expected if conditions in the

Figure 2.4. Europe: Challenges Ahead
The recovery will likely be slow, with tight credit conditions limiting private
investment and rising unemployment weighing on consumption. Coordinated policy
action remains key to regaining growth momentum in the region, while exit needs to
be careful and well timed.

financial and corporate sectors get worse and
if unemployment rises faster than currently
anticipated. Financial institutions are vulnerable to a further deterioration in asset quality,
because losses in the corporate sector may rise
while capitalization remains fairly low. Emerging Europe is especially vulnerable to further
contractions in cross-border funding, and large
cross-border exposures by Austria, Belgium,
and a number of other advanced economies
remain a risk to banks in these countries. The
recourse to shortened work hours in an effort
to preserve jobs may have slowed the fall in
employment so far, but as labor market pressures continue in the months ahead and as
employment-support programs reach their
limits, job shedding could intensify more than
currently projected. The downside risks could
become more pronounced if policy support
in the advanced economies is withdrawn too
early, if political pressures delay financial sector
repairs, or if policy coordination falters. The
upside risks lie mainly in a faster-than-anticipated recovery of global trade and confidence.

78

Over the medium term, GDP growth is likely
to return to precrisis rates only gradually, as
supply remains sluggish and balance sheet
adjustment continues to weigh on demand.
Unemployment is forecast to remain high for
some time, and it is likely that some of the
increase will become structural, as displaced
labor finds reentry difficult, especially in the
euro area and some emerging economies. As
credit conditions remain tight and public support is gradually withdrawn, investment will
likely remain low, and some of the existing
capital stock will need to be scrapped as corporations in a number of countries restructure.
Indeed, past experience indicates that employment, capital accumulation, and productivity
remain sluggish for a long time following financial crises (see Chapter 4). At the same time,
private demand is likely to remain particularly
subdued in the many European countries that
have undergone an abrupt unwinding of precrisis asset price and credit booms. Linked to this,
current account deficits are expected to narrow
in a number of countries, in particular, Greece,

Commonwealth of Independent States: A Difficult Recovery for Some and Damage Containment for Others

Ireland, Spain, and much of emerging Europe.
Current account surpluses are forecast to
diminish in Germany and a few other countries
in 2009 but to widen again later on.
Forceful and innovative policy measures
have significantly reduced the negative risks in
economies that faced severe pressure, but more
needs to be done to ensure a sustained recovery
throughout the region. Challenges remain for
policy coordination, especially in developing
approaches to financial sector stress and providing assistance for hard-hit economies. There
have been steps in the right direction, including
the recently announced overhaul of the European Union’s financial stability architecture,
coordinated stress tests of the largest EU banks,
and stress tests of banks in central, eastern, and
southern Europe conducted with the help of the
IMF. However, these steps need to be followed
by bank recapitalization to restore confidence in
the financial system and rebuild lending capacity. Moreover, considerable uncertainty remains
regarding the value of distressed assets and
asset quality in general, which continues to raise
questions about banks’ capital bases and their
capacity to extend financial intermediation.
Furthermore, a comprehensive and transparent framework for bank resolution, especially
for cross-border banks, remains a priority. Steps
have also been taken to meet the challenges in
the hard-hit emerging economies, including
through the Bank Coordination Initiative to support cross-border banking flows, but a common
strategy and supporting framework for assisting
hard-hit countries and for dealing with accumulating debt is still lacking.
Turning to macroeconomic policies, the
policy stance in the advanced economies should
continue to support demand until the recovery
gains a much stronger foothold. As a result of
the severe downturn in activity and the sharp
declines in commodity prices from their precrisis peaks, headline inflation is low throughout
the region. Against this background, there is
ample room to maintain very low interest rates
and use unconventional instruments to counter
adverse feedback loops between the real and

financial sectors. However, as the recovery takes
hold, a careful exit needs to be engineered, consistent with continued support for the economy
yet forestalling a rise in inflation as output gaps
diminish, especially given that potential output
has likely fallen. Discretionary fiscal stimulus
should not be withdrawn too early, but the fiscal
costs of the crisis are high. Public finances in the
advanced economies are expected to deteriorate
sharply, with the average general government
deficit in excess of 5 percent of GDP in 2009
and 2010 and with debt levels rising fast. Debt
sustainability is a major concern, as excessive
debt buildup may crowd out private capital accumulation and further depress potential growth,
amid growing demographic pressures. Thus,
fiscal stimulus should be allowed to unwind and
consolidation plans should be implemented
once the recovery takes hold, supported by
effective national fiscal frameworks and by the
EU’s Stability and Growth Pact.
Given the prospect of slow growth over the
medium term, more needs to be done to ensure
that unemployed workers can be reabsorbed
into the labor force. Labor market policies
continue to focus on protecting insiders, while
continuing to leave out other groups (for
example, migrant workers) that are likely most
at risk of hysteresis. At the same time, as economies recover, provisions for higher and longer
unemployment and social benefits and subsidies
for reduced work time will need to be reversed
to prevent lasting damage to employment
incentives. Service and product market reforms
are needed to raise productivity growth and
facilitate a reallocation of resources between the
tradable and nontradable sectors. In this regard,
the crisis could present an opportunity to push
forward with ambitious reforms that would help
energize growth in Europe for years to come.

on the region’s economic outlook. A sharp contraction in Russia, on top of the effects of the
global recession and financial crisis, has led to
painful adjustments in lower-income net energy
importers in the region. With many of these
economies still dependent on Russia for remittances and export earnings, the crisis depressed
domestic demand, upended credit booms,
and in some cases shut down access to foreign
capital markets. Most of the energy-exporting
countries are weathering the financial turmoil
and the drop in energy prices comparatively
well, because they could draw on large policy
buffers and are less dependent on developments
in Russia.
Russia is reeling from the unraveling of an
oil-boom-related surge in capital inflows, which
culminated in the devaluation of the ruble in
January 2009 (Figure 2.5). The earlier focus on
exchange rate stability had encouraged substantial foreign-currency borrowing by banks and
corporations and contributed to unsustainably
high rates of credit growth. The drop in commodity prices and a sudden reversal of capital
flows led to a fall in fixed investment and shattered the nexus of high growth in investment,
productivity, and real wages. As a result, GDP
plummeted by almost 10 percent in the first
half of 2009 relative to the same period a year
earlier. Recent data indicate however that the
contraction has begun to moderate: the rate
of growth of industrial production recovered
to –1.0 percent in the second quarter of 2009
from a trough of –40 percent earlier this year,3
and the pressure on the capital account and the
exchange rate have eased.
Lower-income CIS economies have seen a
large fall in activity accompanied by currency
devaluations (Armenia, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan). Many economies had previously enjoyed
rapid growth based on foreign-financed credit
booms and buoyant domestic demand supported by remittance income. As these funding
sources dried up, activity came to a halt, espe3Annualized percentage change of three-month moving

cially in construction sectors. The crisis is taking
a particularly sharp toll in Ukraine, which is a
major steel exporter and borrower in international markets and now receives IMF support.
Energy exporters in the CIS fared comparatively
better, with the recovery of energy prices, and
growth slowed only moderately during the first
half of 2009. An exception is Kazakhstan, for
which the global crisis provided a further blow
to a financial sector already weakened by a sudden reversal of capital inflows in early 2008 and
then a real estate market meltdown thereafter.
The path toward recovery will be difficult
for most CIS economies (Table 2.5). Russia is
projected to experience a deep recession in
2009, with GDP contracting by 7.5 percent, followed by a tentative recovery in 2010, helped by
expansionary fiscal policy, improving commodity
prices, and recovery in Europe and the United
States. Without this regional growth locomotive, the lower-income, non-oil-exporting CIS

economies (Armenia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova,
Tajikistan) are expected to experience steep
growth declines in 2009 followed in 2010 by a
modest recovery—growth of less than 3 percent.
The recession is expected to be very deep for
Ukraine, which continues to struggle for external financing—GDP is forecast to be –14 percent in 2009.
For energy-exporting economies, the growth
outlook is more benign. Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan are projected to experience only a moderate slowdown in 2009, followed by unchanged
growth in 2010, as energy prices recover and
fiscal expansions support domestic demand. An
exception is Kazakhstan, which is projected to
contract by 2 percent this year as its economy
works through adjustment in the financial
sector. A projected modest recovery in 2010 is
mainly the result of a $10 billion anticrisis plan
aimed at recapitalizing banks and supporting
economic recovery.

81

Chapter 2   Country and Regional Perspectives

The risks to the outlook for the region are
tilted downward, with greater risks for economies that are in deeper recessions and face
difficult financing conditions. For these economies, room for supportive fiscal policy is limited
in light of sustainability concerns, and measures
to ease credit may have only a limited effect. A
protracted global downturn would also delay
the recovery in Russia, with negative repercussions for economies closely tied to its fortune.
For energy exporters, the risks to the outlook
are linked to energy price developments, which
are in turn tied to the fate of the global recovery
during 2010. On the upside, positive impulses
could come from China, which has growing
trade ties with the region, especially for energy
exporters, such as Kazakhstan.
A main policy challenge, given the scale of the
slowdown, is to provide effective fiscal support.
In Russia, planned fiscal measures should be
well targeted and temporary to mitigate the risk
of deficits becoming entrenched. The hard-hit
energy importers should aim to support domestic demand by providing transfers to groups
most severely affected (such as those who have
lost remittances), but the extent of such support
is constrained by the availability of funds and
sustainability concerns. Some of these economies may need to draw on multilateral assistance
or enhanced donor support. Energy exporters,
on the other hand, should use available funds
to smooth domestic demand (for example, by
advancing infrastructure investment).
The main challenge for monetary policy is to
strike the right balance between domestic and
external stability. After the currency devaluations earlier in 2009, monetary policy has been
directed toward safeguarding stability through
higher interest rates. Where these policies have
succeeded and external conditions have become
more favorable, as in Russia, monetary policy
could become more accommodative to respond
to rising output gaps. In the lower-income
economies of the region, exchange rate flexibility should be maintained to ensure that depreciations protect the competitiveness of ailing
export sectors.

82

The overarching challenge for financial sector
policies is to lay the foundation for a resumption of credit growth on a much sounder basis
than in the recent past. This will require that
many economies draw up a comprehensive
approach that includes intensified monitoring
by regulators and action to keep rising shares
of nonperforming loans from causing systemic
problems. Policymakers should also be prepared
to act quickly if strains in the financial sector
reemerge, by supplying liquidity, providing capital to ailing but sound financial institutions, and
facilitating restructuring in the financial sector
or elsewhere in the economy.

Other Advanced Economies: On the Path
to Recovery
After experiencing severe recessions or
slowdowns, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand
are transitioning to recovery. Real GDP growth
in the first quarter of 2009 was negative for
Canada and New Zealand and slightly positive
for Australia. However, the recent evolution of
industrial production, retail sales, and confidence indicators suggests that Australia is on its
way to recovery and that the Canadian and New
Zealand economies are stabilizing (Figure 2.6).
Activity is expected to grow in the second half
of 2009 for all three economies. The recent
rebound in commodity prices and reduced reliance on manufactured products have helped
exports, particularly for Australia. Because of
weak performance during the first half of 2009,
the baseline projections show a contraction in
real GDP in 2009 followed by modest growth
in 2010 (see Table 2.1). On a fourth-quarterover-fourth-quarter basis, real GDP growth in
these economies is projected at about 3 percent
in 2010. New Zealand and, to a lesser degree,
Australia, with their sizable short-term external
debts, are more vulnerable than a number of
other advanced economies to a weakening in
investor confidence.
Australia, Canada, and New Zealand took
advantage of the prolonged period of prosperity

put in place sound macroeconomic and regulatory frameworks. As a result, they have had
ample room to implement expansionary policies
to limit the damage from the global recession and to support recovery as needed. Since
September 1, 2008, these central banks have
significantly reduced interest rates (between 275
and 550 basis points). Floating exchange rates
have acted as a shock absorber and have helped
to mitigate the impact of external shocks. Large
fiscal stimulus packages for 2009 and 2010 are
being implemented to help support domestic
demand—in the range of 2 percent of GDP a
year for Canada and Australia. In the event that
the recovery falters, these economies will have
further room for stimulus, both monetary and
fiscal (Australia and Canada). Nonetheless, they
face important challenges. There is a need to
develop and implement strategies to unwind the
expansionary policies and to further strengthen
financial supervision and regulation. Specifically,
the liquidity guidelines to encourage banks in
New Zealand and Australia to reduce their reliance on short-term wholesale funding need to
be implemented, whereas Canada needs to carry
out the announced move to centralized supervision of securities.

There are signs that economic activity in these economies is rebounding. Australia’s
export performance has been remarkable. Export composition (lower manufacturing
exports) and markets (more reliant on China) seem to be the key to this performance.

Activity contracted in the fourth quarter of
2008 and the first quarter of 2009, as consumption, investment, and exports fell sharply as a
result of tighter external financing conditions, a
deterioration in the region’s external demand,
and lower worker remittances. The deterioration
in activity varied across the region and greatly
depended on the nature and intensity of the

Figure 2.7. Latin America: Recovery Is within Reach1
Recovery in Latin America is not homogenous across countries, with Brazil leading
the recovery in the region. Mexico, the hardest-hit economy in the Western
Hemisphere, is expected to start recovering later this year. This heterogeneity can be
explained by differences in the composition and destination of exports and by other
factors, such as the degree of integration into the world economy and the policy
response to the crisis.

acteristics. For example, the decline in worker
remittances and tourism earnings severely
affected several economies in Central America
and the Caribbean. Net commodity exporters, including the region’s largest economies
(Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico,
Peru, Venezuela) suffered terms-of-trade losses.
Especially significant export revenue losses were
experienced by the energy-intensive economies
of Bolivia, Ecuador, and Trinidad and Tobago.
For many economies in the region, the intensity of these shocks has been mitigated by an
enhanced ability to implement countercyclical
monetary and fiscal policies, more resilient
financial sectors, and a willingness to use the
exchange rate as shock absorber.
There are indications that recovery got under
way during the second quarter of 2009, and it
should gather moderate speed in the second
half of the year, led by Brazil (Figure 2.7).
Capital flows have restarted to the region, and
sovereign spreads have narrowed. Industrial
production has picked up in many economies,
notably Brazil, and the contraction in Mexico is
moderating. The recent rebound of commodity
prices is also improving the overall outlook for
the region, given the prominence of commodity
exports. Consumer and business confidence have
improved, and retail sales have firmed up.
Despite these positive signs, real GDP in the
region is still projected to contract by 2.5 percent in 2009 (Table 2.6), reflecting weak activity in the first half of the year, before growing
by 2.9 percent in 2010. The pace of recovery,
however, is not uniform across economies.
Brazil will lead the way, in part because of its
large domestic market and its diversified export
products and markets, especially its increasing links to Asia. The Peruvian economy, after
several years of rapid growth, virtually stagnated
in the first half of 2009 but will resume strong
growth in the second half of the year. In contrast, Mexico—the hardest-hit economy in the
Western Hemisphere4—will recover more slowly

the global recession on Argentina and Mexico. The real

4Private analysts estimate that consumer price index inflation has been considerably higher. The authorities have created a board of academic

because its economy has suffered a sharper
drop in trade flows, because of its high trade
integration, dependence on the United States,
and reliance on manufacturing exports.
Inflation pressures in the region have eased,
reflecting the continued weakness in economic
activity and large output gaps. In particular,
inflation is projected to fall from about 8 percent in 2008 to 6.1 percent in 2009 and 5.2 percent in 2010. Despite the potential pass-through
effects of currency depreciation, inflationtargeting regimes have helped anchor price
expectations, and inflation in these economies
is projected to be in the 2–5 percent range. Venezuela will continue to post the highest inflation rate in the Western Hemisphere because of
strong public spending and easy monetary policy, and there continue to be data issues related
to the inflation rates recorded in Argentina. 5

GDP growth losses associated with this illness in Mexico
are estimated at between ½ and 1 percent in 2009.
5The authorities have created a board of academic advisors to assess these issues.

The current account deficit for the region is
projected to widen slightly but remain modest in
2009, driven by the collapse of current account
surpluses in Venezuela and other energy exporters. Nevertheless, the current account deficits of
several economies of the region, including most
in Central America, are projected to narrow in
2009, as the large import contraction outweighs
the decline in exports.
Downside risks to this outlook are receding
but remain a concern. A weaker-than-expected
global recovery could lead to a simultaneous
drop in exports and remittances, dampening
the prospects for recovery in some economies. A
tightening of global financial conditions could
increase external financing costs and reduce
capital inflows, affecting some of the more
vulnerable corporations and governments in
the region.
The policy response to the external shocks
has been rapid and, in some cases, aggressive.6

Chapter 2   Country and Regional Perspectives

The inflation-targeting economies (Brazil,
Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay) had
more policy room than other economies, reflecting their strengthened policy frameworks and
macroeconomic fundamentals at the onset of
the global recession. In particular, these economies have cut their policy rates by between 375
and 775 basis points since September 2008,
while allowing their currencies to float. Other
central banks in the region (including in the
Dominican Republic and Venezuela) have
also eased monetary conditions. A number
have complemented such policies with steps to
provide liquidity, including through lower bank
reserve requirements (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Peru) and an expanded set of instruments
that can be used at the discount window. These
central banks should keep interest rates low
until a recovery is solidly under way and upward
inflation pressures become relevant. In the
event that growth is weaker than expected, some
economies may have room to reduce interest
rates still further.
Fiscal policy in many economies in the region
has, for the first time in decades, been countercyclical. This is a reflection of improved macroeconomic frameworks, lower debt levels, and
larger reserve buffers. Several countries in the
region announced fiscal stimulus packages ranging from ½ percent of GDP in Brazil to about
3 percent of GDP in Chile. The timely implementation of these packages has been helpful
in supporting the recovery, whereas increased
coverage of social programs has mitigated the
social costs of the downturn. Falling oil revenues
and the drop in economic activity have led to
a sharp deterioration in the fiscal balances of
some economies (Venezuela), reducing significantly the room for additional fiscal stimulus. In
addition, room for countercyclical fiscal policy is
limited in many countries in the Caribbean, as
a result of a sharp decline in budgetary revenues, high debt, and limited access to external
financing.
have balance of payments support, whereas Colombia and
Mexico have access to the new Flexible Credit Line.

86

The domestic financial systems in Latin
America have endured the global financial crisis
rather well. In particular, the banking systems
have generally remained sound, reflecting in
part the important regulatory and supervisory
changes introduced before the global crisis. As
credit growth to the private sector slowed, public
banks were encouraged to increase their lending
operations to private corporations (most notably
in Brazil). This development should be closely
monitored to avoid a buildup of contingent fiscal liabilities.
The region faces important medium-term
challenges. Continued progress is essential in
strengthening fiscal and financial management
frameworks, including adopting a long-term
approach to fiscal policy. Tax and pension
reforms are also needed in some countries,
particularly where government revenues rely
heavily on energy revenues. In order to increase
resilience to future external shocks, oil and commodity exporters should consider developing or
enhancing frameworks for countercyclical policies tied to oil and commodity prices, learning
from the successful experience of Chile. These
countries also need to ensure that investment
regimes provide adequate incentives for investment in new facilities to forestall dwindling
production capacity.

Middle East: Strengthening Growth
Prospects
The outlook for the Middle East has improved
recently, with the global economy stabilizing
and oil prices rebounding. These economies
have been hit hard by the global recession and,
as a result, growth has decelerated sharply. In
particular, the collapse in oil prices and sharp
contraction in worker remittances and foreign
direct investment have weighed on the economies in the region. The recent improvement in
global financial conditions and rise in commodity prices, however, are helping restore the pace
of economic activity. Nonetheless, the aftermath
of the regional asset price collapse continues to
weigh down the outlook.

Middle East: Strengthening Growth Prospects

Real GDP growth for the region is projected
at 2 percent in 2009 and almost 4¼ percent in
2010 (Figure 2.8; Table 2.7). Real GDP growth
of oil importers is projected at about 4½ percent
in 2009, more than three times the growth
rate of the oil exporters. The sharp slowdown
in activity of oil exporters reflects cutbacks in
oil production, a result of efforts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
stabilize oil prices, although most oil exporters
have maintained strong public spending growth
to help their non-oil sector. Part of this spending
has spilled over to the non-oil producers in the
region, providing important support to these
economies. Within these regional aggregates,
there are important cross-country differences.
For instance, among oil exporters, the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) non-oil sector has been
most affected by its linkages to global trade
and financial markets and by the fall in real
estate prices. In contrast, Lebanon continues
to demonstrate strong resilience to the global
crisis because improved security conditions have
buoyed economic activity, particularly in tourism
and financial services.
Inflation in the Middle East has subsided
as economies have slowed. For the region as a
whole, inflation is projected to decline from 15
percent in 2008 to 8.3 percent in 2009. At the
country level, Jordan and Lebanon are projected to experience the sharpest drop in inflation (from double digits in 2008 to low single
digits in 2009), as a result of the decline in the
prices of imported food and fuel experienced
by these import-dependent economies. Inflation in Egypt and the Islamic Republic of Iran is
projected to remain in double digits, however.
The current account surplus of the region is
projected to narrow by 15¾ percent of GDP in
2009, primarily from a sharp reduction in oil
exports (Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia).
The key risk to the outlook is the possibility
that the global recovery may not be sustained and
that oil prices may fall sharply, which could have
important implications for oil exporters and their
regional trading partners. In an attempt to bolster fiscal positions, oil exporters may need to cut

Figure 2.8. Middle East: Resuming Growth1
The growth prospects in the Middle East region have strengthened following an
improvement in global financial conditions and a rebound in oil prices. Policies
should remain supportive of economic growth after the drying up of bank credit and
the collapse of asset prices, which weigh on the strength of the recovery.

public spending. This expenditure compression
could have important regional spillover effects on
the oil-importing countries by significantly reducing worker remittances. Another risk is that the
banking systems of several oil-exporting countries
could come under severe stress if global financial
conditions tighten again.
Public policies should be geared to supporting domestic demand while recoveries remain
fragile, provided countries have enough policy
room. Monetary policy should balance the need
to continue supporting domestic demand while
avoiding the risk of allowing inflation pressures
to build (Egypt). Some economies have been
reducing interest rates (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
UAE) as inflation has fallen. Although there is
now limited room for further interest rate cuts,
some central banks could modestly reduce interest rates if their economies slow.
Fiscal policies have been supportive of domestic demand in many Middle Eastern economies.
In particular, oil exporters have maintained high
levels of public spending despite a sharp drop
in revenues. Countries with fiscal room should
continue with these policies (which serve a
similar function as automatic stabilizers) to help

88

the recovery gain momentum. Saudi Arabia,
which had sizable government surpluses during
the oil boom, is implementing the largest fiscal
stimulus program (as a percent of GDP) among
the Group of 20 countries. However, countries
with weaker fiscal positions will need to cut back
unproductive spending to avoid an unsustainable debt path. As part of such efforts, subsidy
policies should be reined in.
An important task for some countries in the
region is to return financial sectors to health
and lay the foundation for greater stability. Bank
supervisors should closely monitor the health of
these institutions, particularly in the Gulf Cooperation Council, including through regular stress
testing, and should assess potential recapitalization needs. Progress is needed in introducing
mechanisms for cross-border supervision as well.
Bank credit to the private sector in the region
dried up following the financial sector problems
in Bahrain and Dubai, the region’s main financial centers, and this is sapping the strength of
the recovery.7 To support their banking systems,

Africa: Regaining Momentum

some central banks injected liquidity, whereas
some provided guarantees for private sector
deposits and increased their own deposits at
commercial banks. Finally, sovereign wealth
funds should be managed under more transparent frameworks, particularly given their growing
participation in domestic economies.

Africa: Regaining Momentum
Growth in Africa has slowed significantly as a
result of the collapse of global trade and disruptions in global financial markets, but growth
is expected to regain momentum as the global
recovery gets under way. The effect of the global
recession was initially felt most strongly in those
economies more highly integrated into global
financial markets, including South Africa.
Subsequently, the impact of the fall in financial
flows propagated to oil exporters (including
Algeria, Angola, Libya, Nigeria), manufacturing
exporters (Morocco, Tunisia), and commodity
exporters (Botswana) as global trade collapsed.
The recent improvement in financial conditions
and commodity prices, however, will help these
economies recover from the damage.
Real GDP growth in Africa is projected
to decline from an average of 6 percent in
2004–08 to 1¾ percent in 2009, before accelerating to 4 percent in 2010 (Table 2.8). This
growth performance, while disappointing in
light of the experience of the mid-2000s, is still
encouraging given the severity of the external
shocks. An important factor behind this outcome has been that many governments in the
region have been able to use fiscal balances as
shock absorbers, sustaining domestic demand
and helping contain employment losses. Net
exports are expected to subtract from growth,
mainly reflecting the region’s sharp drop in
exports (Figure 2.9). Relative to their 2004–08
performance, oil exporters (Angola, Equatorial
Guinea, Nigeria) are expected to experience
the sharpest growth slowdowns in 2009, as oil

commodity prices. Policies have played an important role in supporting domestic
demand.

revenues have fallen hard. GDP growth in oil
importers is projected to decelerate as well,
from about 5 percent in 2004–08 to 1½ percent
in 2009, as their exports contract. Real GDP in
South Africa, the largest economy of the region
and an oil importer, is projected to contract
by 2.2 percent in 2009. Growth is expected to
resume during the second half of 2009, supported by expansive fiscal and monetary policies
and the projected recovery in global trade. The
recent pickup in capital flows to South Africa
is also expected to contribute to the recovery,
particularly given the recent upgrade in its
sovereign credit rating. Two of the economies
hardest hit by the global recession are Botswana
and Seychelles. Botswana’s economy is being
90

hit by the collapse in international demand for
diamonds; in Seychelles, which is undertaking a
comprehensive reform program, the economy is
being affected by a sharp contraction in tourism
receipts. On the other hand, many low-income
countries in the region that have more diversified commodity exports seem to be weathering
the global recession fairly well and are placed to
quickly return to the higher growth paths of the
mid-2000s.
Inflation in the African region is projected to
fall from about 10¼ percent in 2008 to 9 percent in 2009, before easing to 6½ percent in
2010. Excluding Zimbabwe, a country for which
information is unreliable, there are three economies (Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia,

Africa: Regaining Momentum

Seychelles) with projected average inflation rates
for 2009 in excess of 20 percent. The majority of
economies belonging to the CFA franc zone and
Maghreb region, in contrast, are expected to
have inflation rates below 5 percent. In contrast
with the past, many countries in the region have
had the fiscal policy room to allow automatic
stabilizers to operate. As a result, the fiscal balance of the region is projected to switch from
a surplus of over ½ percent of GDP in 2008 to
a deficit of 4½ percent of GDP in 2009. The
increased policy room was achieved through
relatively prudent fiscal policies, together with
debt relief in recent years.
The outlook for the region is subject to
significant uncertainty. A weaker-than-expected
recovery of the global economy would slow the
recovery in commodity markets and worsen the
prospects for inflows, including remittances and
foreign direct investment. Moreover, a tightening of global financial conditions may have
repercussions for the emerging markets of the
region, although probably less than elsewhere
because of the relatively limited reliance on private financing. However, donor countries, themselves mired in severe recessions, may reduce
aid flows to the region with serious repercussions for those countries where external aid
finances are a large fraction of total revenues.
Poverty could also increase significantly in the
sub-Saharan region as real GDP per capita contracts in 2009—the first decline in a decade—
unemployment rises, and the region suffers
from a lack of extensive social safety nets.
Policies should be geared toward mitigating
the impact of the global recession on economic activity and poverty, while continuing to
strengthen the foundations for sustained growth.
The fiscal policy response should be supportive of economic recovery. In countries with
policy room, the priority is to implement already
announced stimulus measures. As the recovery
becomes firmly grounded, the focus of fiscal
policy should move toward growth and fiscal
sustainability considerations. Countries with
no policy room should focus on reprioritizing

spending or increasing revenues, which would
allow increased spending on infrastructure
and social safety nets without worsening debt
sustainability.
Monetary policy should continue to be supportive of domestic demand, and exchange rates
should act as external shock absorbers. In countries with high inflation, central banks should
reiterate their commitment to low inflation
and, if needed, should tighten monetary policy.
In countries with low inflation and flexible
exchange rates, monetary policy should continue to sustain domestic demand until growth
is back on a healthy path.
Financial institutions in the region have been
largely resilient to the downturn. However, bank
balance sheets in some economies have been
affected by the region’s slowdown. Financial
supervisors should identify vulnerabilities in
the banking sector, including by conducting
frequent bank stress tests to identify credit risks
and potential solvency and liquidity issues, and
should take action as needed.
Looking beyond the short-term challenges,
Africa must move ahead with a series of reforms
to strengthen the region’s resilience to external
shocks and growth prospects. The development
and implementation of sound and transparent
public policies need to be further promoted,
including through improved capacity for public
financial management and the implementation
of medium-term economic frameworks. A priority for the public sector should be creating and
using fiscal room for the enhancement of transport infrastructure and health and education
services and introducing well-targeted povertyreduction programs. To facilitate private sector growth, continued progress is needed in
reforming the business environment, including
reducing start-up costs for new enterprises. In
the financial sector, banking supervisory capacity should be strengthened, and the perimeter
of financial sector regulation and supervision
should be expanded. Some countries also need
to take measures to further integrate their
economies with the rest of the world.

Lessons for Monetary Policy
from Asset Price Fluctuations

T

he current crisis gives occasion to revisit
an old question: should monetary
policy be used to prevent asset price
busts? The question has at least three
aspects, each of which is addressed in this chapter. First, we examine the historical evidence in
search of consistent macroeconomic patterns
that could be used as reliable leading indicators
of asset price busts. Second, we examine the role
of monetary policy in the buildup to the current
crisis. In particular, we assess the validity of accusations that policymakers created the current
crisis by reacting insufficiently to growing inflation pressure or that they raised the likelihood
of an asset price bust by placing insufficient
weight on credit and asset prices when setting
interest rates. Third, we consider whether the
goal of monetary policy should be expanded
beyond just the stability of goods price inflation,
how this could be done, and the potential tradeoffs involved.
The chapter presents the following findings.
Inflation and output do not typically display
unusual behavior ahead of asset price busts.
By contrast, credit, the share of investment in
GDP, current account deficits, and asset prices
typically rise, providing useful leading indicators
of asset price busts. These patterns can also be
observed in the buildup to the current crisis.
Also, in the period since 1985, the stance of
monetary policy has not generally been a good
leading indicator of future house price busts,
consistent with the evidence that inflation and
output are poor leading indicators. There is
some association between loose monetary policy
and house price rises in the years leading up to
the current crisis in some countries, but loose
monetary policy was not the main, systematic

﻿

cause of the boom and consequent bust. If
monetary policymakers are to blame, it is mainly
for acting too narrowly and not reacting strongly
enough to indications of growing financial
vulnerability.
This chapter makes the case that putting
more emphasis on macrofinancial risk could
bring stabilization benefits. Simulations suggest that using a macroprudential instrument
designed specifically to dampen credit market
cycles would help counter accelerator mechanisms that inflate credit growth and asset prices.
In addition, a stronger monetary reaction to
signs of overheating or of a credit or asset price
bubble could also be useful. Such a broader
approach to monetary policy might require that
concern for macrofinancial stability be explicitly
included in central banks’ mandates. However,
expectations should be realistic. It is difficult to
discern whether credit and asset price booms or
surging current account deficits are driven by
benign or malign developments. Even the best
leading indicators of financial vulnerability are
noisy, sometimes sending false signals and raising the risk of policy errors.
The first section of this chapter examines
asset price busts during the past 40 years, presenting evidence on the typical costs of such
episodes, outlining patterns in macroeconomic
variables leading up to the busts, and identifying
potential leading indicators of future busts. The
second section analyzes whether these patterns
held for a cross section of advanced economies
in the years leading up to the current crisis.
The third section looks at the role of monetary
policy in these countries, paying particular
attention to the associations between monetary
conditions, credit expansion, and house price
appreciation. Next, the chapter uses a modelbased approach to explore the potential role of
monetary and macroprudential policy in dampening house price rises and credit expansion.

The final section discusses policy implications.
Data sources and transformations are explained
in Appendix 3.2.

Asset Price Busts in the Modern Era
This section examines busts in house and
stock prices over the past 40 years. The focus is
on key macroeconomic variables in the run-up
periods in an attempt to identify systematic patterns in their behavior. The issue of whether or
not policymakers should respond to these leading indicators is taken up later in the chapter.
The focus on the run-up to house price and
stock price busts is a relatively novel contribution to the literature. Borio and Lowe (2002a)
and Gerdesmeier, Reimers, and Roffia (2009)
present empirical evidence on how booms in
credit, asset prices, and investment have predictive power for banking crises and asset price
busts, respectively. In this chapter, house prices
and stock prices are examined separately, leading to new results. In particular, we find a recurring pattern of deteriorating current account
balances in the run-up to house price busts.
Furthermore, this chapter identifies patterns in
asset price busts after 1985 that are unique compared with busts that occurred before 1985.1

Stylized Facts about Asset Price Busts
The first task for this analysis is to define asset
price busts. This chapter uses a simple methodology, similar to that used by Bordo and Jeanne
(2002).2 Busts are defined as periods when the
1A related strand of literature focuses on asset price
booms. Adalid and Detken (2007) and Detken and Smets
(2004), for example, document stylized facts on real and
financial variables around asset price booms and analyze
the influence of liquidity shocks and monetary policy
during these episodes. A related paper, Mendoza and
Terrones (2008), looks at booms in domestic credit and
the associated behavior of macroeconomic and microeconomic variables around these episodes.
2Bordo and Jeanne (2002) define a bust as a period
when the three-year moving average of the growth rate of
asset prices is smaller than the average growth rate minus
a multiple of the standard deviation of growth rates. The
thresholds that are used in this chapter for housing and

94

four-quarter trailing moving average of the
annual growth rate of the asset price, in real
terms, falls below a particular threshold. The
threshold is set at –5 percent for house prices
and –20 percent for stock prices.3 A higher
threshold (in absolute terms) is used for stock
prices due to the fact that stock prices are typically more volatile. This methodology is objective, easily reproducible, and can be applied
consistently across countries. In addition, the
thresholds also pick up the major well-known
asset price busts—Japan in the early 1990s,
the dot-com episode in the 2000s—while still
leaving asset price busts as relatively infrequent
episodes.
Applying this technique to data for real stock
and real house prices identifies 47 house price
busts and 98 stock price busts from 1970 to 2008
(Table 3.1).4 House price busts are generally
longer lasting and are associated with greater
output loss. The average house price bust lasts
for two and a half years, whereas stock price
busts last for about one and a half years.5 The
cumulative decline in output below trend is

equity busts are roughly equal to the average growth rate
of the respective asset prices across the whole sample
minus one standard deviation of the growth rates. Bordo
and Jeanne use a multiple of 1.3 times the standard deviation of growth rates.
3To be clear, a bust occurs when the following condition holds:
gt–3 + gt–2 + gt–1 +gt
—————---------— < x ,
4
where g is the growth rate of the asset price and x is
the relevant threshold (–5 for house prices and –20 for
stock prices). If the condition holds, then the periods t–3
through t are labeled as a bust.
4The data set consists of quarterly observations on asset
prices and macroeconomic variables for 21 advanced
economies from 1970 to 2008. Subject to data limitations,
the sample includes the following countries: Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
United Kingdom, and United States. Details are in
Appendix 3.2.
5The duration of a bust is the amount of time the
four-quarter moving average of the growth rate of the
asset price remains below the relevant threshold. Because
periods t–3 to t are labeled as a bust, there is a minimum
duration of one year for all busts.

roughly 4¼ percent for the first year after the
onset of a house price bust,6 compared with a
1¼ percent decline after stock price busts. These
findings mirror those of previous issues of the
World Economic Outlook (WEO) (April 2003 and
April 2008), as well as those of Claessens, Kose,
and Terrones (2008).
Figure 3.1 shows that asset price busts are
relatively evenly distributed before and after
1985—a year that broadly marks the beginning
of the “Great Moderation,” a period characterized by substantially lower macroeconomic
volatility in advanced economies (see McConnell
and Pérez-Quirós, 2000, and Galí and Gambetti,
2009). Several episodes are clustered across
countries, including busts in 1974–75, 1983,
1992, and 2008. The current episode is the most
widespread cluster of busts for both house prices
and stock prices.

Patterns in Macroeconomic Variables in Run-Ups
to a Bust
Asset price busts, particularly house price
busts, are long and costly. Can they be predicted? Theory suggests that it is not possible
to predict the timing of asset price movements,
particularly large drops, with a high degree
of accuracy. If it were, investors would sell, or
short, these assets, and there would be no boombust cycles. Even so, there may be some regular
6Trend output is measured using a one-sided HodrickPrescott (HP) filter with a smoothing coefficient of 1600.

patterns in the behavior of macroeconomic
variables that can help indicate the likelihood of
a bust, even if they provide only limited insight
into its timing.
Before exploring whether there are such
macroeconomic patterns, we must first correct
for slow-moving trends. Although this analysis focuses, to a large extent, on growth rates,
there are slow-moving trends in these rates over
the four decades covered by the sample. For
example, for almost all the countries, inflation
rates were markedly lower during the 1990s
than during the 1970s, and therefore looking
at deviations from an average calculated on the
basis of the full sample would be misleading.
The same holds true for output growth, reflecting a diminishing impetus from post–World War
II catch-up and population aging. To correct for
such slow-moving trends, a trailing eight-year
moving average is used as a filter to isolate large
or abnormal movements in these variables. The
choice of filter was based on three factors. First,
it is easily reproducible. Second, the trends for
the variables under study are fairly slow moving.
Third, this measure—unlike centered moving
averages or the popular two-sided HodrickPrescott (HP) filter—does not include any information unavailable at the time.7
7As a robustness check, the analysis was also carried out
using a rolling HP filter with a slow-moving trend. Qualitatively similar patterns were obtained. The smoothness
parameter was set to 400,000 following Borio and Lowe
(2004). See Kannan, Rabanal, and Scott (forthcoming a)
for results using this detrending procedure.

filter should be interpreted carefully. For a variable experiencing a temporary but persistent
increase in its growth rate, the deviation from a
trailing moving average eventually gets smaller
as the trend “catches up” with the higher growth
rate. This could, erroneously, be interpreted as
a return to normal behavior, even though the
variable continues to experience high growth.
The choice of an eight‑year window for the
moving average mitigates this problem somewhat because it lengthens the period over which
a boom must persist in order for the trend to
catch up.
What patterns do we observe using this
detrending procedure? Figure 3.2 shows the
behavior of eight key macroeconomic variables
around the onset of house price busts before
1985 and during and after 1985. Three factors
motivated the decision to split the sample. As
mentioned, 1985 marks roughly the beginning
of the Great Moderation. Second, the dynamics
of asset price busts in the pre-1985 period may
have been very different because of the different nature of shocks, such as the two oil crises of
the 1970s. Third, during the post-1985 period,
financial markets were more liberalized and
monetary policy was more consistent—a macroeconomic environment much more similar to
today’s than to the one before 1985.
Several interesting findings emerge from Figure 3.2. Run-ups to house price busts in 1985
and after feature higher-than-normal growth
rates of credit relative to GDP, large deteriorations in current account balances, and higherthan-normal ratios of investment to GDP. Both
house and stock prices also grow faster than
the eight-year moving average trend, though
the difference does not vary significantly from
zero within the two years before the busts. Of
equal interest, output growth does not display
any significant deviation from the measured
trend, and inflation is actually below its eightyear moving average. Before 1985, there is no
pattern of rapid increases in credit relative to
GDP or deteriorating current account balances
in the run-up to busts, although there are large

Asset Price Busts in the Modern Era

deviations in inflation coinciding with the two
oil crises.
The post-1985 period shows a similar pattern
of large increases in credit growth and in the
ratio of investment to GDP during the run-up to
stock price busts, as shown in Figure 3.3. There
are, however, two notable differences between
the behavior of macroeconomic variables before
stock price busts and before house price busts.
First, output growth tends to be significantly
higher than trend during the run-up to stock
price busts. Second, there is no deterioration in
current account balances as there is for house
price busts. Even though the median current
account balance deteriorates in the year leading
up to a stock price bust, the level is not significantly different from zero.
As shown in Table 3.1, asset price busts, particularly house price busts, are costly events. Do
macroeconomic variables display different patterns in the run-up to particularly costly house
price busts? Figure 3.4 shows the behavior of the
same set of variables solely for house price busts
from 1985 to 2008. The observations are divided
into house price busts that were associated with
large falls in output and those that were not.8
The growth rate of credit relative to output,
the share of residential investment in GDP, and
the rate of increase of house prices themselves
are all higher in costly busts than in episodes
that were not as costly. Interestingly, there is no
significant difference in inflation and output
growth in the run-up to a high-cost bust compared with other busts.

and during House Price Busts

Since 1985, house price busts have been typically preceded by large deviations in
credit relative to GDP, the current account balance, and investment. Output and
inflation, on the other hand, do not display such large deviations.

these variables? From a policymaker’s perspective, monitoring, or even reacting to, abnormal
growth in these macroeconomic variables can be
justified only if they help gauge the risks of asset
price busts.
To assess the predictive ability of these
variables, we use an approach pioneered by
Kaminsky, Lizondo, and Reinhart (1998) and
Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999).9 The approach
involves determining whether excessively large
movements in particular variables are associated with subsequent busts. Large movements
are defined as deviations from an underlying
trend, for which the eight-year moving average
is used. When the deviation from trend exceeds
a particular threshold, we say an “alarm” has
been raised. For each quarter, the threshold
for each variable for a given country is computed based on observations over the previous
15 years.10 Whether these alarms are deemed
informative depends on their association with
subsequent busts.
The choice of a threshold above which an
alarm is raised presents an important tradeoff between the desire for some warning of an
impending bust and the costs associated with
a false alarm. A very high threshold, for example, leads to infrequent alarms, because only
extreme movements in the variables are captured. These extreme movements may be strong
signals of impending asset price busts—and
thus reduce the likelihood of a false alarm—but
they may miss a large number of busts. With a
low threshold, on the other hand, less extreme
movements in the variables would more frequently raise alarms. Policymakers would very
likely be alerted to impending busts, but would
also be subject to a lot of false alarms. Choosing thresholds that minimize the ratio of false
to legitimate alarms balances this trade-off.
9The

analysis of the predictive ability of macroeconomic variables with regard to asset price busts is related
to the literature on early warning systems (see Berg and
others, 2000, for a survey).
10The use of this moving 15-year window dictates that
these statistics are calculated and presented only for 1985
and after.

Here, the same percentile threshold is used for
a particular variable across all countries, but
the actual cutoff value differs from country to
country because of the varying distributions of
the variables.11
Each observation for a given variable can be
classified into one of four categories, as shown
in Table 3.2. Deviations in the credit-to-GDP
ratio illustrate how the observations can be classified. The 90th percentile of the distribution of
this variable has the smallest ratio of false alarms
to legitimate alarms, which makes this a suitable
threshold. An observation on this variable above
the 90th percentile is considered to raise an
alarm, placing the observation in the first row of
the matrix. If an asset price bust occurs within
a particular time frame (discussed later) after
the alarm, that alarm is considered a legitimate
alarm and is placed into cell A. If there is no
bust, that alarm is considered to be only noise
and is placed into cell B. An analogous classification procedure determines the placement
of observations into cells C and D. Ideally, all
observations would fall into cells A or D, which
correctly predict the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a bust.
Two statistics that can be derived from this
approach are of particular interest. The first is a
measure of the conditional probability of a bust,
which is the probability that a bust will occur
within a particular time horizon once an alarm

specifically, we choose the threshold based on
percentiles of the distribution of deviations such that the
noise-to-signal ratio—defined as the ratio of the share of
false alarms to legitimate alarms—is minimized. To avoid
the influence of extreme observations, we limit our grid
search to four percentiles: 70th, 75th, 80th, and 90th. For
the thresholds used, see Table 3.5 in Appendix 3.1.

Figure 3.5. The Probability of an Asset Price Bust

(Percent of times a bust occurs 1–3 years after an alarm is raised relative
to the unconditional probability of a bust)
For house price busts since 1985, large deviations in credit, current account, and
residential investment to GDP are particularly predictive of the likelihood of an
impending bust. In the case of stock price busts, these variables are also more
predictive than the unconditional probability, though the difference is smaller.

has been raised based on a particular variable.12
The second is a measure of the predictive ability
(or lack thereof) of the variables, which essentially captures the proportion of periods during
which a bust occurred one to three years in
the future but for which no alarm was raised.13
These two statistics capture the trade-off
involved in the choice of a suitable threshold.
An extremely high threshold that identifies only
one observation from the sample will perform
well on the conditional probability measure if a
bust occurs within a particular time horizon, but
will fare poorly on the other measure because
no alarm would be raised for most of the busts.
Computing these probabilities also involves
selecting the appropriate time horizon. If the
horizon is too short, the alarm will have no
operational relevance because any action by
policymakers would be too late to affect the
economy and forestall or mitigate the bust. If
the horizon is too long, the alarm becomes
uninformative, meaning that it loses its predictive ability. We chose a horizon that considers an
alarm legitimate if it successfully predicts a bust
within three years, with a minimum lead time of
one year.
Figure 3.5 shows the difference between the
conditional probability of a bust occurring one
to three years after an alarm has been raised
and the unconditional probability of a bust over
the same horizon. This gauges the predictive
ability of the conditional probability measures.
In the sample, the unconditional probability of
a house price bust occurring one to three years
in the future is 14 percent during the post-1985
period. For stock price busts, the corresponding
probability is 29 percent.
In the post-1985 period, large deviations in
credit relative to GDP, in the current account
balance, in the residential investment share
of GDP, and in house prices themselves are
particularly predictive of an impending house

12In terms of the matrix presented in Table 3.2, this
statistic can be computed as A divided by (A+B).
13In this case, the relevant statistic is C divided by
(A+C).

Asset Price Busts in the Modern Era

price bust. Large deviations in the credit-toGDP ratio, for example, are associated with a
28 percent probability of a house price bust one
to three years in the future, which is twice the
unconditional probability of such a bust. Large
deviations in output and inflation—the conventional components of monetary policy rules in
the academic literature—have little ability to
predict house price busts. For stock price busts,
output and inflation perform slightly better
as leading indicators, but credit, the current
account balance, and residential investment
have much more predictive ability, as they do for
house price busts. The degree of significance of
the marginal predictive ability of these variables
is confirmed in a formal econometric (probit)
analysis (see Table 3.6 in Appendix 3.1).
These results suggest that large deviations in
the ratios of credit, the current account, and
residential investment to GDP are significant
predictors of asset price busts. What happens
when all three variables raise alarms at the same
time? The bottom bars in each panel of Figure 3.5 indicate that 56 percent of these occasions were associated with a house price bust
one to three years in the future.14 The ratio is
roughly the same in the case of predicting stock
price busts.
These results should be interpreted with caution. As mentioned, the most predictive thresholds for these variables may be those that result
in identification of just a few observations that
yield particularly reliable alarms. When considering the simultaneous raising of alarms by all
three variables, this restriction becomes more
severe. To complement the analysis, therefore,
we look at the proportion of periods during
which the indicators fail to raise an alarm one to
three years ahead of a bust (Figure 3.6). Large
deviations in variables such as credit to GDP,
current account to GDP, and residential investment to GDP raise alarms in advance of a bust
only one-quarter to one-half of the time during

percentage is computed as the sum of the
percentage indicated in the bar and the unconditional
probability of each type of bust.

Asset Price Bust

(Percent of quarters the variables failed to raise an alar m 1–3 years before

Even though large deviations in credit, the current account, and investment to GDP
are good predictors of asset price busts, they raised alarms only about one-quarter
to one-half of the time prior to a bust in the post-1985 period.

Figure 3.7. Recent Developments in House and Stock
Prices1
With the exception of Germany and Japan (which are experiencing secular declines
in house prices), most economies have experienced strong rises in asset prices,
followed by sharp falls. The extent of house price falls is related to the extent of
previous house price rises. The extent of recent stock price falls is similar across
countries but does not closely relate to the extent of previous rises.

the post-1985 period. The most reliable indicator is credit, which raises an alarm in one-half of
all cases.
In summary, large booms in credit and investment, as well as deteriorating current account
balances, substantially increase the probability
of a bust occurring in the near future. When
these indicators raise an alarm, the probability
of a bust is more than twice the unconditional
probability. Nonetheless, even the best indicator
failed to raise an alarm one to three years ahead
of roughly one-half of all busts since 1985. Thus,
asset price busts are difficult to predict.

Macroeconomic Patterns ahead of the
Current Crisis
These findings lead to the following question: Do the patterns associated with previous
episodes of asset price busts show up ahead of
the current crisis? Undoubtedly, recent years saw
several important developments, such as innovations in securitization, that might suggest the
current crisis is fundamentally different from
previous crises. However, for house prices, this
crisis had a very familiar macroeconomic pattern: house price busts were preceded by strong
growth in credit, worsening current account
balances, and house price booms.
Figure 3.7 shows average annual real house
and stock price growth across all economies
in the sample from the start of 1995 through
2008. Apart from the current episode, stock
prices experienced one other boom-bust cycle
during this period. Real house prices registered
strong growth rates, on average, until 2007.
Subsequently, most economies experienced
falls in asset values that are severe by historical standards. Asset price paths differ widely
across countries. From the fourth quarter of
2001 through the third quarter of 2006, real
house prices rose strongly in Ireland, New Zealand, and Spain, but fell in Austria, Germany,
and Japan.15 Consistent with the results from
15These dates were chosen because they cover the
period during which most economies (except for Austria,

Macroeconomic Patterns ahead of the Current Crisis

previous issues of the World Economic Outlook
(April 2003 and April 2008), larger house price
increases have generally, though not uniformly,
been followed by larger decreases from recent
peaks. Except for Germany and Japan, which
have been experiencing long-term declines in
real house prices, the correlation between house
price rises and subsequent falls is 0.79.16 In
contrast, the recent fall in stock prices was relatively uniform across countries and was largely
unrelated to previous stock price rises.
Were the macroeconomic indicators identified in the previous section associated with the
recent asset price busts? Figure 3.8 shows the
proportion of countries that experienced house
price busts for which the credit-to-GDP, residential-investment-to-GDP, and current-accountto-GDP variables were raising alarms, based on
the definitions in the previous section. Signs of
a residential investment boom, in some cases
funded by current account declines, are apparent in at least half the economies one to three
years before the onset of house price busts.
Credit growth was unusually high in roughly half
the economies over almost the entire three-year
period. The alarm from the current account
is more muted until about one year ahead of
the bust, when it was raised for nearly half the
countries.
Figure 3.9 shows how recent cross-country
variations in house price changes are associated with variations in credit growth, residential
investment, and current account relative to
GDP. Economies with the largest house price
appreciations also had large increases in residential investment as a share of GDP, large current
account deficits as a share of GDP, and large
expansions of credit relative to the expansion in
output. Furthermore, stronger credit growth was
also typically matched by more severe deteriorations in household balance sheets: a version of a

(Percent of countries with recent house price busts that raised alarms)

Residential investment booms were observed for more than half the economies that
subsequently experienced a house price bust. Credit booms and large deviations
from trend in current account balances were also observed for a significant
proportion of these economies.

household “quick ratio”—the ratio of liabilities
to liquid assets (deposits and currency)—was
found to be highly associated with house price
growth (Figure 3.10).17 At the macroeconomic
level, therefore, the evidence suggests that this
was a conventional crisis in that it displayed
patterns historically evident in asset price booms
and busts. A key question, then, is whether these
boom-bust cycles resulted from monetary policy
actions.

The Role of Monetary Policy
Two criticisms have been leveled against monetary policymakers:
• The first criticism is that monetary policy was
too loose from 2002 to 2006—in particular,
that central banks held the policy rate below
the level specified by a simple rule for reacting to an output gap and inflation.18 Had
monetary policymakers not deviated from a
Taylor rule, goes the argument, the rise in
asset prices—and, by implication, the current
crisis—would have been avoided. Note that
the essence of this argument is that monetary
excesses were the main cause of the booms
and subsequent busts.
• The second criticism argues that setting monetary policy by looking only at consumer price
index (CPI) inflation and the output gap is
too narrow an approach: in a simple version,
monetary policy should lean against unsustainable asset price rises or developments that
raise financial vulnerability, even at the cost of
more variability in inflation and output.19
17These measures were constructed from nonconsolidated household balance sheet data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD). The ratio of loans to disposable income fitted
poorly. The United Kingdom and United States stand out
with very high maturity ratios (ratios of long- to shortterm liabilities), but these do not have explanatory power
for house price changes during this period.
18See Taylor (2007 and 2008). Taylor cites Ahrend,
Cournède, and Price (2008) as support for the argument
that policy failures were widespread and not limited to
the U.S. Federal Reserve.
19See, among others, Borio and Lowe (2002b and
2004) and White (2006). A more far-reaching ver-

The Role of Monetary Policy

sion of this criticism is that current implementations
of best-practice monetary policy—especially in formal
inflation-targeting regimes—can themselves raise overall
macroeconomic instability by focusing exclusively on too
narrow a definition of stability—namely, goods market
inflation. A related criticism—the “paradox of credibility”—is that success at lowering and anchoring inflation
expectations may encourage a form of money illusion
(see, for example, Borio and Shim, 2007).
20As in the previous section, these data are presented as
deviations from an eight-year trailing average.
21The rule has weights of 1.5 on deviations of inflation
from its target level and 0.5 on the output gap. See Taylor
(1993).

These criticisms are difficult to answer
conclusively because they require assessing the
counterfactual—what would have happened had
different policy choices been made. However, an
analysis of monetary conditions and asset prices
during the years before the recent asset price
busts sheds some light on the validity of the first
criticism. (The validity of the second is evaluated
in the following section using a model-based
approach.)
Overall, since 1985, monetary policy conditions are generally not a good leading indicator of house price busts. Figure 3.11 tracks two
standard measures of monetary policy stance
in the run-up to house price busts. As in the
previous section, patterns around busts before
1985 and during and after 1985 are examined
separately. The upper panel shows the behavior
of real policy rates,20 and the lower panel shows
the deviation of these rates from a standard
Taylor rule, which takes into account business
cycle developments.21 There is some evidence
of loose monetary policy in the run-up to house
price busts before 1985. One interpretation is
that monetary policy during that period did not
react sufficiently to inflation, such as that generated by the oil shocks.
In the period since 1985, taken as a whole,
real policy rates were typically above trend in
the run-up to a house price bust and high when
compared with those implied by a Taylor rule.
Furthermore, the dynamics of real rates suggest
that, if anything, rates actually increased in the
years leading up to a bust. However, both real
interest rates and residuals from Taylor rules

were negative, on average, one to three years
before the recent busts, followed by a sharp
tightening of monetary conditions during the
year preceding the crash. This may be evidence
of overly loose monetary policy. However, in
most economies, policymakers looking only at
CPI inflation would not have seen obvious signs
of a problem during this period. Figure 3.12
shows that core inflation in the United States,
the euro area, and, on average, the other
advanced economies (with the exception of
Japan) stayed within 1–3 percent throughout the
period during which credit was expanding and
asset prices were booming. One interpretation
advanced at the time—which is addressed in
the next section—is that higher asset prices and
demand for credit reflected expected gains in
productivity.
If monetary policy were the fundamental
cause of house price booms over the past
decade, there would be a systematic relationship
between monetary policy conditions and house
price gains across economies. Certainly, average
real policy rates were low and even negative in
some economies, and Taylor rule residuals were
mostly negative, suggesting that monetary policy
was generally accommodative across economies
during this period. But there is, at best, a weak
association with house price developments
within the euro area (Figure 3.13, blue lines).22
And there is virtually no association between the
measures of monetary policy stance and house
price increases in the full sample (Figure 3.13,
black lines). For example, whereas Ireland and
Spain had low real short-term rates and large
house price rises, Australia, New Zealand, and
the United Kingdom had relatively high real
rates and large house price rises. Moreover, the
association between measures of the monetary
policy stance and real stock price growth is

real policy rate here is constructed by deflating nominal gross policy rates by Consensus Economics
expectations of gross CPI inflation one year forward.

prevented their use in measuring real rates in the previous sections.)

extremely weak, whether assessed during the
global house price boom (2001:Q4–2006:Q3;
not shown) or during a later period, when stock
markets rallied from their troughs (2003:Q1)
through the stock market declines of 2007
(Figure 3.14).
The fairly regular behavior of inflation and
output and the fact that Taylor rule residuals
were not associated with recent asset price rises
across economies in the sample suggest that
monetary policy was not the main or systematic
source of the recent asset price booms.23 At the
same time, evidence outlined in previous sections underscores that the asset price bust that
started in 2007 did not come out of the blue,
in the sense that key macroeconomic variables
showed patterns similar to those ahead of
historical asset price booms and busts. Should
policymakers have reacted to these signals and
alarms, by placing greater emphasis on financial
stability and less emphasis on inflation? This
question is addressed in the next section.

Should Policymakers React to Asset
Market Fluctuations?
This analysis has identified a number of macroeconomic variables that are often associated
with asset price busts, although their predictive ability is not as consistent nor as strong as
policymakers might hope. Those same variables
do reasonably well in explaining the differences
across economies in house price rises leading up
to the current crisis. This suggests that central
bankers should consider reacting more strongly
to indicators other than just output and inflation in order to mitigate damaging asset price
boom-bust cycles. There are three important

23One assumption in this analysis is that monetary
policy decisions in one economy were independent of
those in other economies, which is a common conclusion
given floating exchange rates and a free flow of capital.
Some argue that monetary policy decisions in the United
States have more influence on monetary conditions in
other economies than this assumption allows. This awaits
rigorous empirical testing.

questions to be addressed in assessing the appropriate policy responses:
• What are the potential gains from reacting to
signs of emerging financial vulnerability, such
as excessive credit growth?
• Is monetary policy the appropriate tool for
reacting to such indicators, or should other
policies be used?
• What are the trade-offs between focusing
policy on stabilizing output and CPI inflation
and attempting to reduce the risk of asset
price booms and busts?
This section addresses these questions with
simulations conducted using a model economy
with some of the key features relevant for
examining the potential role of monetary policy
in mitigating the effects of asset price booms.
Because housing wealth is generally more
important than equities for most households,
and because house purchases typically require
bank credit, the focus is on house price booms
rather than stock price booms.24

The model used here has conventional New
Keynesian foundations; in particular, prices
generally do not adjust immediately. This means
that monetary policy has a potential role in
stabilizing the economy because it influences
real interest rates. Consumption and residential investment adjust slowly, and it is costly for
workers to shift from producing consumption
goods to building houses, and vice versa. In
addition, there are a number of modifications to
the standard model with regard to the characterization of households and financial markets,
which create a special role for the housing
market.25 First, households make choices about

24For a model that considers the monetary policy implications of stock price fluctuations, see Christiano, Motto,
and Rostagno (2007). For simplicity, there is no capital
used in production, and the economy is closed.
25The model draws on elements of models by Aoki,
Proudman, and Vlieghe (2004); Cúrdia and Woodford
(2009); Iacoviello (2005); and Monacelli (2009). See also
the April 2008 WEO. The accelerator mechanism goes

back to Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (BGG, 1998);
unlike BGG, the accelerator in this model works through
housing finance rather than firms’ capital. For a detailed
description of the model, see Kannan, Rabanal, and Scott
(forthcoming b).
26We rank policy regimes in terms of the evenly
weighted variances of the output gap and CPI inflation.
The output gap in this model is the difference between
aggregate and potential output (GDP). Potential output
is defined as the level of aggregate production in this
economy when nominal rigidities and financial frictions
are removed—that is, prices are assumed to be flexible in
both sectors, all agents have the same discount factor, and
there is no spread between borrowing and lending rates.
The output gap is an appropriate target, from a welfare

the consumption of nondurable goods and how
much to invest in housing. Housing is an asset
that provides services and is the main vehicle for
accumulating wealth in this economy. Second,
there is a distinction between borrowers and
lenders, creating conditions for leverage. Third,
the lending rate is modeled as a spread over the
policy rate that depends on loan-to-value ratios,
the markup charged over funding (policy)
rates, and, in some cases (discussed later), a
macroprudential instrument. Hence, lending
rates can change for a number of reasons: for
example, a rise in house prices will raise market
valuations of borrowers’ collateral, lower the
average loan-to-value ratio, and therefore lead
to a fall in lending rates even if monetary policy
has not eased. Credit market conditions can
change—because of, say, changes in perceptions
of risk or competitiveness in lending—which
could lead banks to adjust their markups and
therefore alter the lending spread. Both of these
mechanisms help accelerate a rise in residential investment, nondurable consumption, and
prices. In some simulations, policymakers can
affect spreads directly, using a macroprudential
tool, in addition to influencing lending rates via
policy rates. Finally, debt is important for financing the purchase of houses—the loan-to-value
ratio fluctuates around an average over time of
80 percent.
The behavior of the model economy is examined under different policy regimes, following
shocks that produce sustained rises in residential
investment and house prices.26 The objective is

Chapter 3   Lessons for Monetary Policy from Asset Price Fluctuations

to determine which policy regime is better at stabilizing the economy in the face of pressures on
the housing market—policies that can help prevent financial vulnerabilities, rather than help
pick up the pieces after a bust. The conclusions
that can be drawn from this analysis depend
crucially on which shocks drive the house price
boom. To illustrate the importance of correctly
identifying the drivers of the housing boom, we
test the policy regimes with two shocks: a financial shock that prompts a relaxation in lending
standards, and a positive productivity shock.27
Although asset booms can arise from expectations of future capital gains, without any change
in fundamentals, we do not model bubbles or
“irrational exuberance.”28 Similarly, we do not
attempt to model events that trigger house price
crashes.
Policymakers are assumed to have nominal
short-term interest rates and, potentially, the
macroprudential instrument at their disposal.
The macroprudential instrument affects lending
rates—policymakers can directly offset, to some
degree, fluctuations in spreads caused by the
perspective, because GDP is the sum of output of both
consumption and the housing sector. Monetary and regulatory policy should aim to reduce the impact of nominal
and financial distortions in the economy. CPI inflation
is the rate of change of prices for consumption goods
and does not include house price inflation; hence, it is
not fully appropriate as a welfare metric. We deliberately
assess the policies in terms of CPI inflation to facilitate
comparison with most of the monetary policy literature
and conventional goals of central bankers; in general,
assessing policies in terms of house price inflation as well
would strengthen the case for broader policies.
27The financial shock can be thought of as a reduction
in the margin banks charge over funding costs, caused by
an increase in competition and a quest for market share
or by a reduction in perceived lending risk. The productivity increase is modeled as a shock to labor-augmenting
productivity of nondurable consumption goods. Both
shocks are temporary but quite persistent—they follow
AR(1) processes with persistence parameters set at 0.95.
Note that, once the shock hits the economy, we assume
both households and policymakers immediately understand what the shock is and how it will be transmitted
through the economy.
28This is not a comment on the likelihood of bubbles;
it is a reflection of the fact that there are currently no
tractable models of irrational bubbles that can be incorporated into models of this type.

110

changes in collateral values and financial shocks.
This is a simple shortcut intended to mimic the
effects of, say, regulations that require banks to
set aside more capital as asset prices rise, hence
raising the margin that banks have to charge
over funding costs (the policy rate).
The baseline policy regime is a standard
Taylor rule, specified with a weight of 1.5 on CPI
inflation and 0.5 on the output gap. With that
benchmark, we investigate gains to be achieved
by incorporating indicators of potential financial vulnerability. Hence, the second regime
is implemented as an augmented Taylor rule, in
which monetary policy rates react to changes in
nominal credit, in addition to CPI inflation and
the output gap.29 The third regime introduces
a macroprudential rule that specifies the reaction
of a macroprudential instrument (which alters
the spread between the lending and the policy
rate) to lagged nominal credit changes (the
same variable as in the augmented Taylor rule).
Combining the macroprudential instrument
with the augmented Taylor rule produces the
third policy regime.30 The final policy regime is
a variation on the third, in which the weight on
each variable is determined by an optimization
procedure that seeks the best response to the
particular shock being considered. All variables
in these policy rules are lagged.31

29Nominal

credit is defined as real credit multiplied by
the GDP deflator, which is a weighted average of CPI and
house price indices.
30In these three regimes, all monetary policy reactions
are smoothed by imposing a weight of 0.7 on the lagged
nominal interest rate and 0.3 on the policy variables.
(The weight is optimized in the fourth regime.)
31These lags are introduced on the grounds that, in
real life, policymakers have data for the output gap and
inflation only after some delay; data for money aggregates
and credit are available more readily. Including contemporaneous credit in the rules would increase the value of
credit as an indicator and therefore bias the conclusions
in favor of extended frameworks. To avoid this, credit is
also introduced with a lag.

Should Policymakers React to Asset Market Fluctuations?

The Performance of Policy Rules in Reaction to
Financial Shocks
Figure 3.15 shows the response to a financial shock, modeled as a relaxation in lending
standards that immediately reduces lending
rates by 100 basis points in the baseline Taylor
policy regime (black line). Three other paths
are shown, corresponding to the other policy
regimes. In the Taylor policy regime, monetary
policy is guided by the simple Taylor rule with
no macroprudential reaction. The financial
shock causes an immediate increase in residential investment and house prices. Because
banks are assumed to lower lending rates when
collateral rises, the shock feeds on itself: housing demand raises house prices, collateral
values increase, lending rates are lowered,
and households take out more loans. This is
the credit accelerator mechanism at work. In
addition, lower rates lead to higher demand
for nondurable consumption goods, pushing up CPI inflation. Some characteristics of a
house price bust are evident in the aftermath
of this shock: as financial conditions normalize, residential investment—and with it, house
prices—must undershoot for a period to bring the
housing stock back to equilibrium. This process
spills over to the rest of the economy, causing a
temporary recession and raising volatility in all
markets. The reaction of a central bank following a simple Taylor rule is straightforward: to
the extent that the output gap and CPI inflation
are positive following the increase in housing
demand, policy rates are raised. Eventually, output and inflation stabilize.
The second policy regime is the augmented
Taylor rule, under which the central bank reacts
directly to credit in addition to the output gap
and inflation. For illustration, we assume the
central bank puts the same weight (0.5) on
changes in nominal credit as on the output
gap (Table 3.3, upper panel, second row). This
rule produces greater stability across the board
as shown in the figure: the volatility of residential investment is lower, there is a considerable reduction in the volatility of GDP and the

are less volatile (see also the standard deviations
in Table 3.3, lower panel, second row, compared
with those in the first row).32
Macroeconomic stabilization is even better
served under the third policy regime, under
which the central bank complements the augmented Taylor rule with the use of the macroprudential instrument (Table 3.3, lower panel,
third row). For illustration, the growth rate of
nominal credit in the macroprudential rule has
a weight of 0.5, with the other weights maintained as for the augmented Taylor rule. The

volatility of interest rates is lower as well, even
though the policy rule is more aggressive. This is because
a model with fully forward-looking private agents, such
as this one, has very strong expectational effects—households anticipate a stronger reaction from the central
bank and factor it into their decision making. The result
is that monetary policy works through the threat of a
stronger reaction, rather than by actually delivering that
stronger reaction.

macroprudential rule allows policymakers to
directly counter the relaxation of lending standards that induces borrowers to take on more
debt as house prices rise.
To summarize, adding another indicator to the monetary policy reaction function
can improve macroeconomic stability when
the economy is hit by a financial shock. The
responses hint that policy reactions guided by
the standard Taylor rule are too weak in the
face of loosened lending standards and credit
accelerator effects, with the consequence that
housing investment is insufficiently dampened.
But the parameters in the augmented Taylor
and macroprudential rules used here are ad
hoc. In fact, if the objective is simply to stabilize the output gap and inflation, the optimal
weights on the output gap and inflation in the
monetary policy rules under this sort of “microfounded” model are generally much higher
than the Taylor weights (see Woodford, 2001).
This implies that the improvement in stability

Should Policymakers React to Asset Market Fluctuations?

from adding nominal credit to the monetary
policy rule and employing the macroprudential
instrument could simply indicate that, under the
baseline Taylor rule, the reaction to the output
gap and inflation is insufficient.
To address this issue, we also model a policy
regime with the augmented Taylor and macroprudential rules optimized to minimize the
variation in the output gap and in inflation.
As expected, the optimized rules are the most
successful in stabilizing the economy and come
close to producing the efficient reaction—no
output gap at all.33 More interesting are the
optimized weights (Table 3.3, upper panel,
fourth row). Optimal monetary policy is very
aggressive—the weights on the output gap
and inflation are multiples of those in either
the standard Taylor rule or typical estimated
monetary reaction functions, and the optimized
weight on interest rate smoothing is zero. The
weight on nominal credit in setting the policy
rate is zero.34 Crucially, however, the optimal
weight on nominal credit in the macroprudential rule is not zero; in fact, it is slightly more
than the weight used before (0.8). Hence,
macroprudential policy is unambiguously useful
for dealing with financial shocks, even when
the central bank is free to use policy rates very
aggressively. Using the macroprudential tool
is a more efficient reaction to loosening credit
markets than simply raising policy rates, because
it tackles the problem at its root.

The Performance of Policy Rules in Reaction to
Productivity Shocks
Broader and more aggressive policy regimes
can improve stability in the face of financial
33The efficient reaction is desirable from a welfare
point of view but is not possible within this model
because of nominal rigidities and distortions in financial
markets.
34In the augmented Taylor rule, the weight on credit
was positive, and this held even when this rule was combined with a macroprudential instrument. This reflected
lower-than-optimal Taylor rule weights on the output gap
and inflation (0.5 and 1.5, respectively). A similar result is
documented in Iacoviello (2005).

shocks, but they raise the possibility of policy
mistakes in the face of other types of shocks.
This is evident from the second set of simulations, which shows the reactions to an increase
in productivity in the nondurable goods sector that, in the case of the Taylor rule, delivers
an immediate 1 percent increase in output
(Figure 3.16).35 The results of this shock also
resemble a housing boom: residential investment, house prices, and the demand for credit
all rise, just as in response to a financial shock.
However, the prices of consumption goods fall.
Indeed, the fact that CPI inflation was contained
in recent years while asset prices surged led
many policymakers to conclude that asset price
rises were being driven by positive productivity
shocks.
The best policy for dealing with a productivity shock is for the central bank to accommodate the improvement in productivity as much
as possible. Policies to suppress private sector
borrowing would be misguided, as shown in
the figure: following the augmented Taylor and
macroprudential rules, with the same parameter
values as for the financial shock, accentuates
the downward pressure on prices (CPI index)
and output, because of the reaction to credit
growth. The result is that the output gap and
inflation are more volatile, not less (Table 3.4,
lower panel, second and third rows). Among the
first three policy regimes—Taylor, augmented
Taylor, augmented Taylor with macroprudential
instrument—the best is the standard Taylor rule.
The optimized regime has higher weights on
the output gap and inflation, as before, but the
model does not support using the macroprudential tool at all (Table 3.4, upper panel, fourth
row). These results suggest that policy reactions
to indicators of potential financial vulnerability
should be neither automatic nor rigid—policymakers need room for discretion.

35Although the shock is centered on the production of
nondurable consumption goods, households spend more
on residential investment and nondurables consumption
because of expectations for higher income.

In the real world, economies are affected by
multiple shocks of various types. Optimal policy
rules must strike a balance among the optimal
responses to each different type of shock and
must reflect the relative importance of the
shocks in driving the economy. Consequently,
the case for using a macroprudential tool will
depend, among other things, on the mixture of
shocks facing a particular economy. Figure 3.17
shows how the optimal weight on changes in
nominal credit in the macroprudential rule
rises as financial shocks become relatively more
important than productivity shocks.36 When
there are no financial shocks, there is no need
for the macroprudential tool. When there are
only financial shocks, the optimal weight on
nominal credit in the macroprudential rule in
this model is 0.8, as shown above. Ideally, then,
policymakers would be able to use discretion to
deal appropriately with different types of shocks
as they arise, rather than reacting rigidly with
fixed rules.
How do these conclusions compare with
those from other studies? As far as we know, this
is the first time the coordination of monetary
and macroprudential rules has been formally
evaluated using a macroeconomic model of this
type,37 although there is abundant literature on
monetary policy and asset prices. The debate
persists over whether central banks should react
directly to asset prices.38 The analysis here sug-

precisely, the exercise involves specifying a
sequence of variance-covariance matrices in which the
ratio of the variance of the financial shock increases,
while the variance of the productivity shock and the covariance of the two shocks stay fixed at 1 and zero, respectively, then optimizing the weights for all variables in the
augmented Taylor and macroprudential rule regime for
each of the variance-covariance matrices in the sequence.
37Gray and others (forthcoming) find a role for a financial stability indicator in the monetary policy rule. Gruss
and Sgherri (2009) study the welfare implications of procyclical loan-to-value ratios in a two-country model. However, because the model does not have a nominal side,
the reaction of monetary policy cannot be addressed.
38Two well-known examples are Bernanke and Gertler
(2001), who conclude that there is no role for asset
prices in monetary policy rules, and Cecchetti and others

Policy Conclusions

Monetary policymakers in advanced economies with flexible exchange rate regimes have
been guided in recent years by the principle
that stabilizing inflation forms the best policy
for promoting economic growth and welfare. At
the time this approach was gaining favor, it was
suggested that stable inflation would also reduce
risk premiums and increase financial stability.
A number of central banks now have explicit
mandates to target CPI inflation, and they have
been strikingly successful in keeping inflation in
check. But this approach has not been sufficient
to prevent asset price busts; the current crisis
is no exception. Asset price busts have typically
been preceded by rising investment, expanding
credit, and deteriorating current account balances. Again, the current bust is no exception.
Monetary policy does not appear to be the
main cause of recent asset price booms. To the
extent that monetary policymakers bear responsibility for the crisis, it is for acting too narrowly—

gests that policymakers should be concerned
not so much with asset price rises per se as with
other conditions that can be associated with
them: lax lending standards, excessive credit
expansion, overinvestment, and deteriorating
external balances. These conditions give policymakers a strong reason to react.
Nonetheless, the simulations presented here
are highly stylized, and many potentially important factors are omitted. The model captures
some relevant features of the world, but it has
not been adapted to fit any particular economy.
In particular, the characterization of the macroprudential tools is very simple and glosses over
important practical questions about how such
tools would be managed and how effective they
would be in certain financial systems.39 Hence,
the results are only suggestive, and a great deal
more research is required.

paying too little attention to emerging signs of
financial vulnerability—rather than for failing to
control CPI inflation. By accommodating loosening credit conditions and rising debt, monetary
policymakers increased the risks of a bust.
The evidence suggests that policymakers
should react more strongly to signs of increasing
macrofinancial risk. The findings in this chapter do not support the idea that central banks
should react automatically to changes in asset
prices, still less that they should try to determine
some appropriate level for asset prices. But they
should examine what is driving asset price movements and be prepared to act in response. This
applies particularly to housing, which represents
a larger share of wealth than equities for most
households and typically involves significant
levels of debt. One possibility is that central
bank mandates be expanded to include concern
for financial vulnerabilities. In addition, macroprudential tools could be used to help tackle
problems in financial markets, which may help

116

limit the need for aggressive monetary policy
reactions.
However, expectations must be realistic.
Even the best leading indicators of asset price
busts are imperfect—in the process of trying
to reduce the probability of a dangerous bust,
central banks may raise costly false alarms.
Also, rigid reactions to indicators and inflexible use of policy tools will likely lead to policy
mistakes. Discretion is required. Therefore,
implementing a broader framework for monetary policy in order to mitigate macrofinancial
risks further increases the importance of correctly identifying the sources of shocks driving
changes in credit, investment, balance sheets,
and external balances. Central bankers implementing broader policies would need to explain
very carefully the basis for their actions, their
immediate objectives, and how their actions
are consistent with the longer-term objective of
price stability. Moreover, monetary and macroprudential policies need to be coordinated,

requiring greater information exchange and
more consultation among monetary and supervisory authorities. These represent significant
practical issues that must be carefully addressed
before the framework for monetary policy
is broadened or additional instruments are
implemented. And neither a broader mandate
nor additional instruments replace the need
for fiscal and regulatory frameworks that are
designed to make economies as robust as possible to asset price busts and provide policymakers the flexibility to respond to such events with
stimulus policies.

Appendix 3.1. Econometric Methods
The main author of this appendix is Prakash
Kannan.
This appendix addresses two issues. First, in
most cases, the indicators of impending asset
price busts could be highly correlated, such
that the marginal information from some of the
variables is insignificant when the information
from other variables is accounted for. (Table 3.5
shows the thresholds used for the indicators.)
Second, it is not straightforward to compute the
statistical significance of these indicators, making it difficult to state the level of confidence
associated with particular indicators. To remedy
these problems, the analysis is complemented
with a probit model. Probit models are nonlinear regressions that seek to explain binary
variables. In the case of this exercise, the binary
variable in question takes on a value of 1 if there
is an asset price bust between one and three
years in the future and zero otherwise.40
The results from the probit analysis are
shown in Table 3.6. The coefficients represent
the marginal increase in the probability of a
bust evaluated at the mean level of the other
variables.41 For the post-1985 sample, a 10

40Probit

models have been used in the context of
predicting currency crises (Frankel and Rose, 1996, and
Milesi-Ferretti and Razin, 1998).
41Variables are measured as deviations relative to the
eight-quarter trailing moving average, as earlier.

percentage point increase in the credit-to-GDP
ratio relative to an eight-year moving average—
the typical increase in the run-up to a house
price bust—increases the probability of a house
price bust by 4.4 percent, which is roughly onethird higher than the unconditional probability
of about 15 percent. Current account balances
and residential investment are also significant
predictors of house price busts; for example,
a 1½ percentage point deterioration of the
current account relative to its eight-year moving average, a magnitude typically found in the
run-up to a bust, implies a one-third increase
in the probability of a house price bust over the
unconditional probability. Meanwhile, for house
price busts during 1985–2008, output growth
and inflation are not significantly associated
with the likelihood of a bust.
Deviations in residential investment shares
and credit are also found to be significant
predictors of a stock price bust. A 10 percentage point increase in the credit-to-GDP ratio is
associated with an increase in the probability
of a stock price bust of 6.4 percent—roughly
20 percent higher than the unconditional
probability of a stock price bust. The coefficient on current account balances with regard
to stock price busts, however, appears to be of
the wrong sign for the post-1985 portion of the
sample.

What’s the Damage? Medium-Term Output
Dynamics after Financial Crises

T

he global economy is beginning to
recover from the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression
and the deepest recession since World
War II. Global economic activity is starting to
pick up, but financial systems remain impaired
and domestic and external imbalances persist
in many economies. The recovery is expected
to be slow, and there are concerns about the
prospect of long-term damage to the path of
global output, as financial institutions and
markets worldwide struggle to restore their ability to intermediate and unemployment rises to
high levels. In this context, the aftermath of past
financial crises may provide useful insights into
the medium-term prospects for economies now
in the midst of financial crisis and for the global
economy.
This chapter builds on Chapter 3 of the April
2009 World Economic Outlook, which analyzed
the short-term dynamics of output in advanced
economies and found that recessions following financial crises are unusually long, particularly with a global downturn. This chapter
goes beyond the short term to concentrate on
medium-term developments following financial
crises in advanced, emerging, and developing
economies over the past 40 years.
A first glance at several previous crisis episodes illustrates that although financial crises
typically lead to large output losses in the short
term, what happens to output over the medium
term has varied widely (Figure 4.1). Some economies persistently grow at a slower rate than
before, moving further away from their precrisis
trend. Some return to growth at a similar rate
as before but fail to recover the initial output
loss. Some return to their precrisis trend, and

some recover quickly and outperform their
previous trend.
This chapter addresses a number of questions:
• What happens to output over the medium
term following financial crises? Does the path
of output per capita remain below its precrisis
trend? Do growth rates recover? How much
do outcomes vary across crisis episodes?
• What factors account for shifts in mediumterm output dynamics: changes in the factors
of production (capital and labor) or changes
in the efficiency of their use (total factor
productivity)?
• What are the underlying determinants of
medium-term output dynamics? For example,
do different country characteristics and macroeconomic conditions before the crisis affect
medium-term postcrisis outcomes? What can
be said about the role of policies after a crisis?
To explore these issues, this chapter examines
medium-term output performance following 88
banking crises that occurred over the past four
decades across a wide range of economies, as
well as the behavior of world output following
major financial crises going back to the 19th
century. Building on work by Cerra and Saxena
(2008), the main contributions of this analysis
are the focus on medium-term output and its
driving forces (capital, labor, and total factor
productivity) for a broad sample of economies
that experienced banking crises, and the assessment of the underlying determinants of postcrisis performance.1
1A great deal of work has been done on the output
effects of financial crises in the short term (for example,
Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009; Haugh, Ollivaud, and
Turner, 2009; Bordo, 2006; Hutchison and Noy, 2002;
and Gupta, Mishra, and Sahay, 2007, among others).
Until recently, the emphasis on the medium term has
been much more limited, with the notable exceptions
of Boyd, Kwak, and Smith (2005) and Cerra and Saxena
(2008). With the current crisis, interest in the topic has
surged. For instance, Furceri and Mourougane (2009)

Our general approach is to use an eventstudy methodology that compares the mediumterm level of output to the level it would have
reached following the precrisis trend, with the
medium term defined as seven years after the
crisis. Measured this way, the resulting underperformance (“output loss”) is then decomposed
into its underlying components: capital, labor,
and productivity.2 Output losses are also related
to a range of pre- and postcrisis macroeconomic
and policy factors, using both statistical methods and a narrative approach, to explore which
underlying factors may have contributed to different outcomes across crisis episodes.
The main findings of the chapter are as
follows:
• The path of output tends to be depressed
substantially and persistently following banking crises, with no rebound on average to the
precrisis trend over the medium term. Growth
does, however, eventually return to its precrisis rate for most economies.
• The depressed output path tends to result
from long-lasting reductions of roughly equal
proportion in the employment rate, the
capital-to-labor ratio, and total factor productivity. In the short term, the output loss is
mainly accounted for by total factor productivity, but, unlike the employment rate and
capital-to-labor ratio, the level of total factor
productivity recovers somewhat to its precrisis
trend over the medium term. In contrast,
capital and employment suffer enduring
losses relative to trend.

apply the Cerra-Saxena approach, which involves using an
autoregressive model of output growth rates augmented
by crisis dummies, to growth rates of potential output for
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries. Pisani-Ferry and van
Pottelsberghe (2009) also discuss the persistent impact
on output of banking crises using several case studies.
Haugh, Ollivaud, and Turner (2009) analyze the impact
of banking crises on potential growth in Finland, Japan,
Norway, and Sweden.
2Because of data limitations, the decompositions into
factor components are based on a smaller sample of 27
observations.

Does Output Recover over the Medium Term?

• Initial conditions have a strong influence on
the size of the output loss. What happens
to short-term output is also a good predictor of the medium-term outcome, as is the
joint occurrence of a currency and a banking crisis. This is consistent with the notion
that the output drop is especially persistent
following large shocks, carrying over into the
medium term. A high prescrisis investment
share of GDP is a reliable predictor of high
medium-term output losses, because of its
correlation with the dynamics of capital after
the crisis. There is also evidence suggesting
that limited precrisis policy room tends to be
associated with more muted medium-term
recoveries. Interestingly, postcrisis output
losses are not significantly correlated with
the level of income.
• The medium-term output loss is not inevitable. Some economies succeed in avoiding
it, ultimately exceeding the precrisis trajectory. Although postcrisis output dynamics are
hard to predict, the evidence suggests that
economies that apply countercyclical fiscal
and monetary stimulus in the short run to
cushion the downturn after a crisis tend to
have smaller output losses over the medium
run. There is also some evidence that structural reform efforts are associated with better
medium-term outcomes. In addition, a favorable external environment is generally associated with smaller medium-term output losses.
How do these findings relate to shifts in
potential output following financial crises? The
term “potential output” typically refers to the
level of output consistent with stable inflation
and is associated with structural and institutional
factors. If an economy experiences a decline
in output relative to its previous trend over
the medium term, it could reflect a decline in
potential output, but it could also partly reflect
a persistent fall in aggregate demand. The
experience of a number of economies, including Japan, suggests that if output remains below
its precrisis trend over the medium term, then
a substantial part of the shortfall reflects lower
potential. Therefore, to the extent that this

chapter identifies output losses seven years after
a financial crisis, it is likely that lower potential
explains most of those losses. However, attempting to precisely identify shifts in potential output
is beyond the scope of this chapter.
The first section of this chapter describes
key features of medium-term output dynamics
following financial crises based on international
experience over the past 40 years. The second
section decomposes medium-term output losses
into their factor components (capital, labor,
and productivity), as well as their demand-side
drivers (consumption, investment, exports,
and imports). The third section analyzes how
medium-term output performance relates to
country characteristics and macroeconomic
conditions prevailing before the crisis. It also
examines the role of domestic policies and the
external environment after the onset of the
crisis, based on both case studies of successful
medium-term recoveries and statistical analysis.
The last section puts the recent financial crisis
into historical perspective and discusses implications of the analysis for the outlook.

Does Output Recover over the Medium
Term?
This section presents key stylized facts on the
output losses associated with financial crises. We
start with methodological issues and then report
some stylized facts on the estimated output
losses at both the country and the global levels.
The analysis focuses on banking crises,
although currency crises are also considered for
purposes of comparison.3 It uses a comprehensive set of financial crisis events from the early
1970s to 2002. Banking crisis dates are taken
from Laeven and Valencia (2008).4 Currency

3Currency crises seem to be a natural choice for
comparison, given that they represent a different type of
financial crisis.
4The Laeven-Valencia data set is constructed by
combining quantitative indicators measuring banking
sector distress, such as a sharp increase in nonperforming
loans and bank runs, with a subjective assessment of the
situation.

crisis dates are identified based on the methodology of Milesi-Ferretti and Razin (1998). 5 Our
sample includes 88 banking crises and 222 currency crises, distributed across high-, middle-,
and low-income economies (Figure 4.2).6 We
also use a set of major international financial
crises dating to the end of the 19th century to
analyze the impact at the global level (Box 4.1).
We compute the medium-term output loss
for each episode, as illustrated in Figure 4.3.7
The idea is to measure the output loss associated with a crisis as the difference between the
actual level of output and the level that would
have been expected based on the prevailing
precrisis trend. To focus on the medium term,
the postcrisis window is seven years, beyond the
effects of short-term fluctuations in the economy. Estimating the precrisis trend is tricky in
terms of insulating the analysis from the impact
of any immediate precrisis boom or slump, and
there is no well-established method of doing
this. We estimate a linear trend through the
actual output series during a seven-year precrisis period that ends three years before the
onset of the crisis.8 The appeal of this approach
is that it is simple, transparent, and easy to
implement for a large set of economies. Given
its linearity, it also facilitates the decomposition
of output losses into the factors of production,

definition requires (1) a 15 percent minimum
rate of nominal depreciation vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, (2)
a minimum 10 percent increase in the rate of depreciation with respect to the previous year, and (3) a rate
of depreciation of below 10 percentage points in the
previous year. For the rationale behind this definition, see
Milesi-Ferretti and Razin (1998).
6The sample excludes transition economies, because
the output developments in these economies were
strongly related to the shift away from central planning
rather than to financial crises. Countries with populations
of less than 1 million are also dropped.
7See Angkinand (2008) for a literature review of alternative methods for estimating output losses associated
with a crisis.
8In a number of cases, however, the above procedure
yielded negative trend growth rates, implying that output
per capita would decline indefinitely even in the absence
of a crisis. In these cases, the precrisis window was
extended from 10 to 20 years before the crisis and used
instead if it produced a more plausible trend growth rate.

Does Output Recover over the Medium Term?

namely losses in capital, labor, and total factor
productivity. The robustness of the results is
checked by considering alternative approaches
to estimating the precrisis trend.9 The actual
level of output is measured as the logarithm of
real GDP per capita.
The key stylized facts that emerge from the
analysis are as follows:
• Typically, output does not recover to its precrisis trend. On average, output falls steadily
below its precrisis trend until the third year
after the crisis and does not rebound there­
after (Figure 4.4).
• The medium-term output losses following
banking crises are substantial. Seven years
after the crisis, output has declined relative
to trend by close to 10 percent on average.
As indicated by the shaded area measuring
the 90 percent confidence band, the average
decline relative to trend is statistically significant (see Figure 4.4).
• Medium-term growth rates tend to eventually
return to the precrisis rate. As illustrated in
Figure 4.5, the medium-term growth rate is
typically statistically indistinguishable from the
precrisis trend growth rate.10
• The variation in outcomes is substantial. For
example, whereas the change in output relative to trend following banking crises has a
mean of –10 percent, the middle 50 percent
of cases had a range of –26 percent to +6
9Several

robustness checks were performed. First, the
calculations were repeated with the precrisis window
ending one year rather than three years before the crisis.
Second, an alternative approach was applied to computing the trend growth rates, by which a longer precrisis
window from t = –20 (rather than t = –10) to t = –3 was
applied to the lowest and the highest 10 percent of trend
growth rates. Third, the precrisis trend was computed
based solely on the longer precrisis window (from t = –20
to t = –3). Finally, the output losses were recomputed
using real-time medium-term growth projections from
IMF country desk economists as the trend growth rates.
Note, however, that these real-time forecasts were available only after 1989. Overall, the output losses obtained
using the different approaches were highly correlated
(see Appendix 4.1).
10The mean difference with respect to the precrisis
trend growth rate is –0.2 percentage point, with a standard error of 0.4 percentage point.

percent (see Figure 4.4).11 On average, there
is no rebound to the precrisis trend, but in
more than a quarter of cases, output ultimately exceeded this level.
To put the losses associated with banking
crises in perspective, Figure 4.4 also reports the
evolution of output relative to trend following
currency crises. Estimated losses following currency crises are much smaller, about one-third
(3 percent) of the average loss associated with
banking crises.
At the global level, the picture is broadly
similar: major international financial crises during the past 140 years were typically followed
by persistent output losses relative to precrisis
trend, with gradual recoveries in output growth
rates. Medium-term output losses were particularly large for both advanced and nonadvanced
economies following the Great Depression (see
Box 4.1).

Decompositions: Why Does Aggregate
Output Fail to Recover after a Banking
Crisis?
This section decomposes medium-term output losses, in terms of factor inputs and demand
components, to help explain which factors drive
them. Exploring these underlying forces could
provide insights into both the likely trend in
output after the current banking crises and
the types of policies that may help reduce the
ultimate losses.
Before presenting the results, we briefly
re­view the main channels through which banking crises may affect output in the medium
term.

of the variation in outcomes reflects the variation
in the estimates of the country-specific precrisis trends
and not just the heterogeneity of postcrisis output paths.
However, the wide range of outcomes is robust to using
alternative measures of the precrisis trends.

A useful way to examine why output per
capita often fails to recover to its precrisis trend
is to analyze what happens to the key elements
of an economy’s production process, namely
labor inputs (which can be thought of as
depending on the employment rate and labor
force participation), capital inputs, and total factor productivity. From a theoretical perspective,
banking crises may affect these components in
several ways.12
• Impact on labor force participation: In theory,
the medium-term effect of a crisis on this
component of labor input is uncertain. There
are two opposing forces. On the one hand,
grim employment prospects may discourage
jobseekers and prompt employed workers
to leave the labor force, especially if there
are incentives to retire early. On the other
hand, in times of economic hardship, secondincome earners may enter the labor force to
help compensate for a loss in family income
or wealth.13
• Impact on employment rate: The medium-term
employment rate may be adversely affected
if a financial crisis leads to an increase in
the underlying (“structural”) unemployment
rate. Why? The crisis may imply the need
for a substantial reallocation of labor across
sectors, something that may take time and
increase medium-term frictional unemployment. Perhaps more important, the large
initial increase in the actual unemployment
rate induced by the crisis could persist for a
long time if rigid labor market institutions

1Medium-term growth is derived as the five-year average growth starting in the fourth
year after the crisis.

12Changes in these components following a banking
crisis could reflect a deterioration in the economy’s productive potential, as well as a persistent fall in aggregate
demand, although the latter is likely to explain only a
small part of medium-term losses..
13Indeed, there is some evidence suggesting that the
additional worker effect may already be playing a role in
the current crisis, with the female participation rate rising
as the male participation rate has fallen in the United
States (see FRBSF, 2009).

Chapter 4   What’s the Damage? Medium-Term Output Dynamics after Financial Crises

Box 4.1. A Historical Perspective on International Financial Crises
International financial crises have been a feature of the global economy for a very long time.
This box undertakes a historical comparison of
output paths following these crises going back
to 1870.1
Since 1870, global output has grown at an
average rate of about 3 percent a year (first
figure). During this period, the trend in the
pace of global growth has shifted, most notably
in the aftermath of the two world wars and the
Great Depression and in the early 1970s. The
level and the growth rate of global output were
also affected to varying degrees by a number of
international financial crises described below.
Following the literature, it is possible to identify at least eight episodes of major international
financial crisis since 1870 (see first figure).2 In
1873, the German and Austrian stock markets
collapsed, causing declines in capital inflows,
debt servicing problems, and crises throughout
Europe and the Americas. In 1890, a boom
in lending to the Americas came to an end,
leading to debt crises in Latin America, notably Argentina, and to the near failure of the
London-based Baring Brothers bank. In 1907,
a fall in copper prices caused financial panic in
the United States, with spillovers to a number of
countries in Europe, Latin America, and Asia.
In 1929, a stock market crash in the United
States ushered in the Great Depression. Monetary policy tightening during the preceding
year, aimed at stemming speculation, is widely

seen as a key initial cause.3 Debt deflation, bank
runs and failures, and severe recession in the
United States intensified through 1933 amid an
incoherent policy response. The crisis was transmitted worldwide through wealth losses and
declines in trade and capital flows, with monetary policies constrained by the gold standard.
There were another four episodes of major
international financial crisis during the postwar
period. The Latin American crisis began in
1981–82 and set off a nearly decade-long debt
crisis across emerging economies. In 1991–92,
real estate and equity price bubbles burst in
Scandinavia and Japan, while the exchange rate
mechanism (ERM) in Europe came under pressure. In 1997–98, the Asian and Russian crises
led to widespread capital outflows from emerging economies. Finally, in 2007–08, bursting
real estate bubbles and a collapse of securitization in the United States and other advanced
economies marked the beginning of the current
financial crisis.
To compare the output effects of these
international crises, output losses following
each episode are measured in the same way as
in the main text. In short, the precrisis trend
line is calculated by fitting a linear regression
through the output series (in logs) between
10 and 3 years before the onset of the crisis;
then the output loss is defined as the difference
(in logs) between the actual level of output and
its precrisis trend. To focus the discussion, the
comparison is limited to five crises associated
with major global downturns and for which sufficient data are available: the New York panic of
1907; the Great Depression; the Latin American
debt crisis of the early 1980s; the Scandinavian,
Japanese, and ERM crises of the early 1990s;
and the current crisis.4 It is clear that the Great

these crises are selected, given that they are all associated with downturns. For the current crisis, only the
information available to date is used. The Asian and
Russian crises were not associated with major down-

Depression was associated with by far the largest medium-term output losses: 28 percent in
advanced and 21 percent in nonadvanced economies in 1936, seven years after the onset of the
crisis (second figure). Both country groups were
least affected by the New York panic, with output losses close to zero two years after the crisis
and no medium-term consequences.5 Advanced
economies experienced significant losses in

turns at the global level (see Box 1.1 in the April 2009
World Economic Outlook). The data available at the time
of the German stock market crash and the Baring
crisis are not sufficient for the analysis, in part because
of limited coverage of nonadvanced economies.

the 1990s (10 percent as of 1998), whereas the
effects on emerging and developing economies
were relatively short lived. However, emerging
and developing economies experienced large
losses after the 1980s debt crisis (13 percent as
of 1988), whereas advanced economies were not
affected much beyond the short term. In the
current crisis, advanced economies have taken
the greater hit; emerging and developing economies have fared better so far.
In all three crises associated with mediumterm losses in the past—the Great Depression, the 1980s in emerging and developing
economies, and the 1990s in advanced economies—output grew more slowly relative to the
precrisis trend for a number of years. The fastest

turnaround in growth rates occurred after the
Great Depression: growth returned to trend by
1934 in advanced economies and by 1936 in
nonadvanced economies. However, growth rates
remained about 1 percentage point below the
precrisis trend seven years after the onset of
the two more recent crises: the 1980s crisis in

emerging and developing economies and the
1990s crisis in advanced economies. By implication, in none of these three episodes did output
growth accelerate sufficiently in the aftermath
of the crisis to return output to its precrisis
trend. It remains to be seen whether the current crisis will follow a similar pattern.

ous unemployment benefits) complicate the
task of finding a new job. Long spells without
employment may also impair professional and
on-the-job skills, making it even more difficult
for the long-term unemployed to find jobs.14
• Impact on capital accumulation: A financial crisis
may depress investment and slow capital accumulation over a protracted period. As the supply of credit becomes more limited, firms face

tougher financing conditions in the form of
tighter lending standards and higher effective
costs of borrowing, and profit rates are likely
to suffer (see Bernanke and Gertler, 1989 and
1995; and Bernanke and Blinder, 1988). The
ability of firms to borrow and invest may be
hampered further if the crisis leads to lower
asset prices that weaken corporate balance
sheets and erode collateral values (see Kiyo-

are often called “hysteresis effects.” See
Blanchard and Wolfers (2000); Bassanini and Duval
(2006); and Nickell, Nunziata, and Ochel (2005), among

taki and Moore, 1997). Investment may also
suffer if the crisis leads to a sustained increase
in uncertainty and risk premiums.

Decompositions: Why Does Aggregate Output Fail to Recover after a Banking Crisis?

• Impact on total factor productivity: The effect on
total factor productivity is ambiguous, based
on theoretical considerations. On the negative
side, as it recovers from the crisis, the financial system may not be able to allocate loanable funds as productively as before the crisis,
particularly if high-risk but high-return projects
are discouraged by more cautious lending
attitudes.15 In addition, productivity may also
suffer due to less innovation, as research and
development spending tends to be scaled back
in bad times (see Guellec and van Pottelsberghe, 2002). Also, high-productivity firms may
go under for lack of financing. On the positive
side, however, financial crises may have a cleansing effect on the economy by removing inefficient firms and activities and creating incentives
to restructure and improve efficiency.16

What Do the Data Show?
Medium-term output losses following banking
crises are decomposed into underlying components using the following approach. The starting
point is the observation that the logarithm of
output per capita is equal to the weighted sum
of the logarithms of labor force participation,
employment rate, capital-to-labor ratio, and total
factor productivity.17
15In some countries, the efficiency of financial intermediation could be low both before and after a crisis.
16See Caballero and Hammour (1994) and Aghion and
Saint-Paul (1998). The underlying concept of “creative
destruction” was first introduced by Schumpeter (1942).
17The decompositions are based on a Cobb-Douglas
production function of the form Y = AE αK 1–α, where
A denotes total factor productivity, E denotes employment, and K denotes the capital stock. The employment
share α is assumed to be 0.65. Given the assumption of
constant returns to scale, the production function can be
expressed in per capita terms by dividing by population,

Applying the same procedure for estimating
precrisis trends and computing output losses
to their underlying components allows us to
decompose output losses into losses due to
changes in the employment rate, labor force
participation, capital-to-labor ratio, or total factor productivity.18 To complement the analysis,
an analogous decomposition is done for the
demand-side components of output: investment,
consumption, exports, and imports.19
The results for both types of output loss
decompositions are presented in Figures 4.6 and
4.7. For each component of output, the 90 percent confidence bands are reported to indicate
the statistical significance of the estimates. Note
that due to limited data availability, the size of
the sample shrinks from 88 to 27 observations
for these decompositions.
What do the results tell us?
• The measured medium-term losses in GDP
per capita can be attributed to roughly equal
losses in three of the four components of
output, namely, the employment rate, capitalto-labor ratio, and total factor productivity
(see Figure 4.6).20
• After a significant initial decline, total factor
productivity gradually moves closer to the precrisis trend toward the end of the seven-year
horizon. This is consistent with the notion
that labor hoarding decreases over time.
Nevertheless, the medium-term loss in total
factor productivity still accounts for about
one-third of the total output loss. Its magnitude, however, is not statistically significant

rate, and —— is the labor force participation rate.
P
18Specifically, for each output component, the precrisis
trend is estimated over the same precrisis period as the
output trend. This approach ensures that, based on the
assumed Cobb-Douglas production function, the factor
input contributions add up exactly to the total output loss.
19Because the demand components are additive, the
losses of the aggregate demand components do not sum
exactly to the total output loss.
20The contribution of labor force participation is positive, albeit small and statistically insignificant.

seven years after the crisis, although it is in
the short term.
• The initial loss in the employment rate persists into the medium term, whereas capital
losses worsen steadily over time.
The finding of an adverse impact on the capital-to-labor ratio is consistent with demand-side
decompositions that show a large and significant decline in investment of about 30 percent
relative to its precrisis trend (see Figure 4.7).
The consumption loss is also notable and significant, at about 15 percent. These losses are
partially offset by an overall improvement in net
exports relative to trend.
Overall, the decompositions suggest that
higher unemployment rates, slower capital
accumulation, and lower productivity growth
play an important role in explaining mediumterm output losses following banking crises. In
other words, output per capita does not recover
to its precrisis trend because capital per worker,
the unemployment rate, and productivity do not
typically return to their precrisis trends within
seven years after the crisis. This finding suggests
that pre- and postcrisis macroeconomic conditions and policies could play a role in shaping
medium-term output dynamics—an issue examined in the next section.

What Factors Are Associated with
Medium-Term Output Losses?
To explain the substantial variations in
medium-term output losses across banking crises, this section explores how output losses are
related to various macroeconomic, structural,
and policy conditions, both before and after the
crisis.
The analysis uses a broadly similar empirical strategy, which examines the associations of
pre- and postcrisis macroeconomic factors with
medium-run output losses as follows:
• We first present the results of small-scale
ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions that
consider several factors at a time. These smallscale regressions typically include one or two

What Factors Are Associated with Medium-Term Output Losses?

variables of interest in addition to key control
variables.
• We then explore the robustness of the results
using a large-scale OLS regression that
includes all of the factors considered simultaneously and using Bayesian model averaging
(BMA). Unlike the large-scale OLS regression, BMA allows us to examine whether
the associations found for each variable are
robust to including additional controls in
all the possible ways that those additional
controls can be added.21 BMA is particularly
useful in our investigation because theory
is not sufficiently explicit regarding which
variables should be included in the “true”
regression. At the same time, however, BMA
has substantial data requirements that, here,
reduce the number of available observations
by half. This is why we use both the smallscale results (based on a broad sample) and
the larger-scale models (based on a restricted
sample).
• Finally, in the postcrisis analysis, we complement the statistical methods described above
with a more narrative approach based on
country case studies.

Do Precrisis Conditions Help to Predict MediumTerm Output Losses?
What are the precrisis factors that may explain
the magnitude of the eventual output losses?
Our analysis examines the importance of a
range of macroeconomic, structural, and policy
variables:

21The procedure summarizes the results obtained
across all possible specifications using two key statistics:
(1) the average coefficient value obtained for each variable, and (2) the probability that each variable is statistically “effective” and should be used to predict output
losses. A conventional approach in the BMA literature is
to refer to a variable as “effective” if its estimated inclusion probability is greater than 50 percent. For additional
details on BMA, see, for example, Hoeting and others
(1999) and Masanjala and Papageorgiou (2008). We are
grateful to Chris Papageorgiou for providing us with R
programs that implement BMA.

the three years prior to a banking crisis, the level
of output is, on average, below its trend, suggesting that
banking crises are not typically preceded by a precrisis
boom. In the sample of 88 banking crises, the average
deviation is about –3 percent.
23A possible concern about controlling for short-run
crisis severity, proxied by the decline in output in the
crisis year, is that crisis severity could be correlated with
other explanatory variables, potentially complicating the
interpretation of the regression coefficients. For example,
a greater precrisis investment-to-GDP ratio could be
associated with a sharper short-run decline in output. To
address this possible concern, all the regressions are also
implemented while omitting the short-run crisis severity
control variable (see Tables 4.3 and 4.4 in Appendix 4.1),
and the coefficient estimates do not change substantially.
24The precrisis historical average level is based on the
seven-year period ending three years before the crisis.

term output loss (Table 4.1, row 19).22 Based
on these results, the two initial output variables are included as controls in all remaining regressions.23
• Investment: The prominent role of investment
and capital losses suggests that the level and
evolution of precrisis investment would be
good predictors of eventual output losses.
Indeed, regression results provide strong
evidence that economies with high precrisis
investment-to-GDP ratios, measured as the
average investment-to-GDP ratio during the
three years before the crisis, tend to have
large output losses (Table 4.1, row 1; Figure 4.8). In contrast, the investment gap,
defined as the deviation from its historical
average of the investment-to-GDP ratio during
the three years before a crisis, is not statistically significant (Table 4.1, row 2).24 We
return to potential interpretations of these
results later in this section, but it is worth
mentioning that the precrisis investment
share is particularly robust as a leading indicator, even after controlling for the level of the
current account balance. This suggests that
countries that have high investment rates tend
to experience larger output declines following banking crises, irrespective of whether the
investment is financed by foreign or domestic
savings.

• Policy room: By limiting the room for policy
maneuver, the buildup of macroeconomic
imbalances may also imply higher mediumterm output losses after a crisis. We consider
the precrisis levels and dynamics of several
variables—inflation, current account balance,
fiscal balance, real exchange rate, and real
interest rate—that may capture the notion of
macroeconomic imbalances.25 We find mixed
evidence that rising imbalances are associated
with larger output losses, and, by implication,
that more limited policy room that constrains
the ability of countries to run countercyclical macroeconomic policies is associated with
larger output losses. In particular, the results
based on the small-scale regressions suggest
that economies with larger current account
deficits, rising inflation, and a deteriorating
fiscal balance before a crisis experienced
significantly larger output losses (Table 4.1,
rows 3, 6, 8; Figure 4.9). But the results from
the BMA analysis (Table 4.1, column 13) are
less conclusive. Here it is important to bear in
mind that having more policy room does not
necessarily mean using that policy room—an
issue addressed later.26
• Level of income and financial development:
Postcrisis output losses are not significantly
correlated with the level of income (Table 4.1,
row 11). In fact, the evolution of output after
25The dynamics are captured by considering the
deviations of these variables from their country-specific
historical averages during the precrisis period (the
“gaps”). Using country-specific averages allows for the
possibility that different countries may have different
explicit or implicit inflation targets or fiscal rules. For
example, a 3 percent inflation rate may imply less room
for monetary easing in an economy with inflation normally at 1 percent than in an economy with an inflation
norm of 5 percent. For each variable, the “gap” value is
constructed as a deviation of the average precrisis value
(from t = –3 to t = –1) from the country-specific average
value (from t = –10 to t = –3). Using government debt to
measure fiscal room was not possible for the sample of
economies considered here due to data limitations.
26Two other domestic policy variables—the real interest
rate and real exchange rate before the crisis, measured
relative to their historical averages—do not appear to
have predictive power for medium-term output losses
(see Figure 4.1, rows 9, 10).

What Factors Are Associated with Medium-Term Output Losses?

banking crises for upper-income, middleincome, and low-income economies is similar
(Figure 4.10). At the same time, there is weak
evidence that a higher precrisis level of financial development is associated with larger output losses (Table 4.1, row 12; Figure 4.10).27
• Openness, external conditions, and currency crises:
Currency crises that coincide with banking
crises—“twin crises”—are robustly associated
with larger output losses (Table 4.1, row 14,
Figure 4.11). The results for the openness
indicators, on the other hand, are mixed
(Table 4.1, rows 17, 18; Figure 4.11). The
small-scale regression approach suggests that
financial openness is associated with smaller
losses and is consistent with recent work that
finds that deeper financial integration reduces
the risk of a sudden stop in capital flows and
enhances the ability to smooth spending.28
However, the evidence is weaker based on
the broader specification. Evidence for trade
is even weaker. Turning to external conditions, the U.S. Treasury bill rate before the
crisis is not found to be a significant predictor of output losses (Table 4.1, row 15). The
evidence that an adverse external demand
shock occurring at the time of a banking crisis
is correlated with larger output losses is mixed
(Table 4.1, row 16).
• Structural policy environment: The precrisis
levels of various structural policy reform
indicators are not significantly correlated
with medium-run output losses and are not
presented in Table 4.1.29 Nevertheless, one

analysis also considers whether an increase in the
credit-to-GDP ratio relative to each country’s own historical average level (the credit-to-GDP “gap”) plays a role
and finds it to be statistically insignificant. The question
of whether there is a nonlinear link between the level of
financial deepening and output losses is left for further
research.

finding is worth highlighting: countries with
higher precrisis levels of employment protection tend to experience larger postcrisis
employment losses. This link is illustrated
for OECD economies that have experienced
banking crises, using the OECD’s comprehensive measure of employment protection, and
for the broader banking crisis sample using a
cruder measure (Figure 4.12).30 Because this
result is based on a smaller sample, it needs to
be interpreted cautiously.
What do the regression results tell us?
The empirical analysis suggests that the firstyear loss is important in predicting the eventual
output losses following a banking crisis. This is
consistent with the notion that output dynamics
are especially persistent following large shocks.
What could explain this? Some possible candidates include (1) bankruptcies that lead to fire
sales of capital assets that have significant sunk
costs and take time to rebuild, (2) an impaired
financial system that needs time to heal before
it can intermediate financial capital effectively,
and (3) labor and product market rigidities that
impede the necessary reallocation of labor and
capital following a crisis. These explanations
are consistent with the finding that all factors of
production contribute to medium-term output
losses.

capital account liberalization index (which summarizes a
broad set of restrictions), the trade liberalization index
(based on average tariffs), and the fiscal sector reform
index (based on tax rates and the efficiency of revenue
collection and public spending). We also use various
measures of labor market flexibility, including for employment protection, unemployment benefit replacement
ratios, and tax wedges. See IMF (2008) and Giuliano,
Mishra, and Spilimbergo (2009) for more details. The
indices for product market reforms were not used in the
analysis because of insufficient data coverage.
30The OECD employment protection legislation (EPL)
strictness index is produced annually and generally goes
back to the mid-1980s. It is a summary indicator of EPL
strictness, which weights 14 subcomponents (on dismissal
procedures for regular contracts and the use of temporary contracts). For the broader sample, two of the
subcomponents that are used to construct this index are
available (on notice periods required and severance payments involved in employment termination).

Related to the dynamics of capital accumulation, the precrisis investment share is a particularly robust predictor of the postcrisis output
loss. This finding, together with the earlier
result that investment and the capital-to-labor
ratio decline over the medium term following
banking crises, is consistent with a number of
potential interpretations. In some cases, it may
be that the output loss reflects the unwinding of
excessive investment built up over a protracted
period, such as the real estate bubble in the
case of Thailand’s 1997 crisis.31 Corporate sector
indebtedness may also play a role. Figure 4.8
shows a link between the precrisis investmentto-GDP ratio and the level of precrisis corporate
leverage. During the bubble period, when collateral may be valued excessively, some firms issue
debt in order to invest. When the bubble bursts,
these same firms have to delever, which may take
time, leading to a stagnation of investment over
the medium term. For economies affected during the Asian crisis, such as Indonesia, Korea,
and Thailand, there is some firm-level evidence
supporting this hypothesis (Coulibaly and Millar,
2008). Nevertheless, these interpretations may
not fully explain the remarkably strong correlation between the precrisis investment share and
medium-term output losses—an issue that merits
further investigation.
Regarding employment dynamics, there
is some tentative evidence linking eventual
employment losses to the level of employment
protection. Theoretically, employment protection has an ambiguous effect because it reduces
inflows to and outflows from employment.
However, while the effect on the steady-state
employment rate is unclear, many academic
papers argue that stricter employment protection makes the labor market less effective at
re­allocating labor after a shock.32 Specifically,
in the immediate aftermath of a banking crisis,

1The employment rate gap measures the employment rate relative to its precrisis
trend.
2The index is a summary indicator of the OECD employment protection legislation
strictness. Because employment protection legislation index data start in the mid-1980s,
the 1985 observation is used for Spain 1977.
3The index is constructed based on the notice period required to terminate
employment.

31To

the extent that some investment during the precrisis period was wasteful, output losses may have taken
place even without a crisis, albeit gradually.
32See Blanchard and Portugal (2001) and Balakrishnan
and Michelacci (2001), for example.

139

Chapter 4   What’s the Damage? Medium-Term Output Dynamics after Financial Crises

unemployment may rise independently of the
level of protection because firms can more easily
justify layoffs during crises (or are more willing
to pay firing costs) and because the number
of bankruptcies rises. After the crisis, however,
countries with stricter employment protection
may experience lower job creation, explaining
the larger overall employment rate losses.

After the Crisis: Which Policies Are Associated
with Lower Output Losses?
What role do policies play in mitigating the
ultimate output loss after a crisis? It is important
to acknowledge that the following discussion
seeks to identify patterns rather than establish
causality between policies and postcrisis output
trends.33 The discussion focuses on domestic
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms
and on external conditions and policies abroad.
As in the analysis of precrisis factors, we present
the regression results, which are supplemented
by some relevant charts. As before, all regressions control for key initial output variables.
• Macroeconomic policy support: Short-run demand
management policies (monetary and fiscal)
implemented after the beginning of a crisis
may play a role both in reducing the size of
the initial output loss and in aiding the recovery. Dependent on data availability, we measure the monetary policy stance as the change
in real lending rates. To measure changes
in discretionary fiscal policy, we follow the
approach of the April 2009 World Economic
Outlook and use the growth in real government consumption. In both cases, to capture
the short-term response of macroeconomic
policies, the variables are computed for the
33As discussed in the literature, the two-way relationship between postcrisis policies and outcomes complicates
any causal inference. For example, is it that financial
reform during or after a banking crisis leads to increased
financial intermediation and a lower output loss? Or
that a lower output loss leads to higher demand and
thus higher financial intermediation and also gives the
authorities the policy room to implement important
financial sector reforms? These difficult questions cannot
be answered within our regression framework.

140

first year of the crisis and the following three
years. The variables are designed to measure a
notion of stimulus (rather than policy room)
and thus differ from those used in the precrisis analysis. We find that a stronger shortterm fiscal policy response (a larger increase
in government consumption) is significantly
associated with smaller medium-term output
losses (Table 4.2, row 1; Figure 4.13).34 The
evidence on the monetary policy stance is
mixed, possibly reflecting a weaker monetary
policy transmission mechanism after banking crises. A decline in real lending rates is
associated with smaller output losses, but only
in some specifications (Table 4.2, row 2; Figure 4.13). There is also some mixed evidence
that real exchange rate depreciations are associated with smaller output losses (Table 4.2,
row 3).
• Structural reforms: Structural reforms may also
play a role in boosting output during the
postcrisis period. We consider reform efforts
in several areas, such as domestic financial
reform, capital account and trade liberalization, and structural fiscal reform. In each
case, the reform effort is measured as the
change in various indices mentioned earlier
during the postcrisis period (rather than

34The results imply that raising government consumption by 1 percent of GDP is associated with a reduction
in the medium-term output loss of about 1.5 percentage
points. The change in government consumption, rather
than the change in tax revenue or the fiscal balance, is
used as a measure of fiscal stimulus, because it lessens
reverse-causality concerns. Measuring fiscal stimulus
based on the change in tax revenue or the change
in the fiscal balance would be problematic. A larger
deterioration in output implies a greater deterioration
in tax revenue and the fiscal balance, complicating the
interpretation of the regression coefficients. As expected,
repeating the analysis using the change in the fiscal
balance yields a regression coefficient that is statistically
indistinguishable from zero. Exploring the possibility
of “expansionary contractions” associated with cuts in
government spending, or of “crowding-out” effects associated with fiscal stimulus in economies with unsustainable
government debt levels, was complicated by insufficient
data on government debt. Some evidence of such effects
is presented in Chapter 3 of the April 2009 World Economic
Outlook.

the levels, which were used in the precrisis
analysis).35 Overall, there is mixed evidence
that structural reform efforts are significantly
associated with smaller output losses. Liberalization of the capital account is highly
correlated with smaller output losses in
small-scale regressions, although its statistical significance declines when considered
in larger-scale frameworks (Table 4.2, row
4; Figure 4.14). Domestic financial reforms
are also significantly associated with output
losses in small-scale regressions, but less so
in larger-scale frameworks (Table 4.2, row 5;
Figure 4.14). Trade liberalization is not significantly related to output losses (Table 4.2, row
6). Finally, there is some positive evidence
of a link between improvements in government efficiency and output losses, although
the increased significance of this structural
variable in the broader specifications appears
to be partly due to the change in the sample
composition (as the number of observations
drops to 30).
• External conditions: Policies and conditions
abroad may also be important in reducing output losses by improving the external
environment during the postcrisis period. The
results indicate that larger domestic output
losses are significantly related to the occurrence of adverse external demand shocks,
defined as very low partner growth during the
postcrisis period (Table 4.2, row 9). In addition, there is weak evidence that larger output
losses are significantly associated with higher
global short-term interest rates (Table 4.2,
row 8).36
How should we interpret these empirical
findings? Overall, our findings suggest that

1Scatter plots report conditional plots that take into account the effect of several other

controlling variables (as reported in column 11 of Table 4.2). The change in the real
interest rate and the growth of government consumption is measured over the crisis year
and the following three years.

35Regarding labor market liberalization indicators,
data availability is limited for the sample of banking crisis
countries. Moreover, when data are available, there is
often little change after a crisis. For both these reasons,
we do not report results for postcrisis labor market
indicators.
36Unlike in the small-scale regressions, the global
interest rate is significantly related to output losses in the
large-scale OLS regression and has a relatively high probability of inclusion (0.63) in the BMA framework.

expansionary short-term macroeconomic policies are associated with smaller medium-term
output losses. This is consistent with the notion
that countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies
may help cushion the downturn after the crisis,
which would carry over into smaller measured
output losses in the medium term. At the same
time, these results do not imply that counter­
cyclical macroeconomic stimulus is the right
solution for all economies at all times—it is
likely to depend on country-specific characteristics, such as the credibility of fiscal and external
sustainability and borrowing costs. In fact, fiscal
expansions in economies with unsustainable
debt levels could be counterproductive—an
issue that is not explored here because of data
limitations.
The relationship between postcrisis structural
policy reform and output losses is somewhat
weaker. However, this could be the result of wellknown difficulties in measuring the timing, magnitude, and sequencing of structural reforms,37
as well as the possibility that structural reforms
and capacity building may take longer than
seven years to bear fruit in terms of output. At
the same time, the spillover effects of global
conditions may be important, given the association between the external environment and the
eventual output losses.

What about the role of structural policies based on
country experiences?
To gain further insight into the effects of
structural policy reform, we supplement the
regression analysis by looking at the experiences
of several countries. Specifically, we focus on episodes—such as Chile (1981) and Mexico (1994)
in Figure 4.1—that were followed by significant

error in the structural reform indicators will bias the regression coefficients toward zero, making it more difficult to find that the results are statistically
significant. Also, the size of the bias depends directly on
the magnitude of the measurement error, which is likely
to be much larger for unobserved structural reform
indicators (such as labor market flexibility or financial
sector reform) than for macroeconomic variables (such
as government consumption or interest rates).

output gains (based on our measure of mediumterm output losses) and try to identify associated
major policy reforms. The following experiences
are interesting.
• Mexico (1994): Mexico bounced back rapidly
from its banking crisis in 1994 and indeed
registered a significant output gain relative
to precrisis trend (see Figure 4.1). Compared
with most other banking crisis countries,
Mexico had much stronger export growth following its crisis (see Figure 4.14). Yet partner
growth—particularly in the United States—
did not increase notably after 1994, suggesting that the implementation of a major trade
reform—the signing of the North American
Free Trade Agreement in January 1994—
was the key driver of spectacular export

growth, along with the impact of a substantial
exchange rate depreciation during the first
few years following the crisis.38
• Uganda (1994): Uganda had a significant output gain after its banking crisis in 1994. It also
significantly liberalized its capital account,
freeing its exchange rate and then completing
the liberalization of the exchange and payments systems after the crisis. This is reflected
as major capital account reform according to
the structural reform index (see Figure 4.14).
Uganda also implemented other important
reforms, such as divesting or liquidating 115
of 150 public enterprises and liberalizing its
trade regime (IMF, 2006).
38See

for example, Kose, Meredith, and Towe (2004).

Chapter 4   What’s the Damage? Medium-Term Output Dynamics after Financial Crises

• Argentina (1989): After its banking and currency crisis of 1989, Argentina undertook
major liberalization that led to a spectacular
increase in financial intermediation (see Figure 4.14) and investment and imports, which
may be observed as a significant output gain
relative to the precrisis trend seven years after
the crisis. The country implemented major
financial reforms in the early 1990s, introducing capital and reserve requirements and
increasing banking competition by allowing
foreign entry. On the capital account side,
restrictions on the entry and exit of portfolio
and direct investment were lifted and the
convertibility plan was adopted (introduction of the currency board). Trade was also
liberalized, as export taxes were eliminated
and import restrictions/duties lifted (see Pou,
2000).
• Chile (1981): Chile implemented some
important structural reforms in the 1980s,
including major pension and tax reforms, and
registered a significant medium-term output
gain. However, in the aftermath of its major
financial and balance of payments crises
in 1981, Chile also partially reversed major
trade and capital account reforms that were
implemented in the 1970s. During the late
1970s, combined with a fixed exchange rate
and high real indexation, trade and capital
account liberalization facilitated rising current
account deficits, which were financed by large
amounts of foreign lending. The imbalances
continued to grow, which, combined with
high global interest rates and a collapse of
commodity prices, led to faltering confidence,
capital flight, and a major recession. The
authorities reacted by increasing tariffs and
severely restricting capital flows and holdings
of foreign assets by residents. The latter can
be seen as a major reversal of capital account
liberalization relative to how other countries
reacted to banking crises (see Figure 4.14). Of
course, the trade and capital account restrictions imposed after the crisis were gradually
lifted during the 1980s and 1990s (Le Fort,
2005).

144

Overall, the case studies show that there is
certainly no “one size fits all” when it comes
to explaining the factors behind strong performances after banking crises. Big neighbors
and trade agreements can play a role (Mexico),
as can liberalization (Argentina and Uganda).
Nevertheless, it is not easy to draw strong general conclusions about the growth impact of
postcrisis structural reforms. Moreover, there are
countries for which other factors help to explain
the significant output gains relative to precrisis
trend (for example, Zambia after 1995 and El
Salvador after 1989).39

What is the bottom line?
The results suggest that proactive domestic
macroeconomic policies in the short term may
mitigate medium-term output losses. There is
also some evidence of the beneficial role of
structural policy reform and favorable global
conditions. However, there is still much to learn
about the processes and interactions that lead to
strong growth performance.

Implications for the Outlook after the
Current Financial Crisis
This section discusses some tentative implications for output in the wake of the current crisis
and how policy can be used to help mitigate
medium-term output losses.
For the most part, the implications of our
analysis are sobering for the medium-term
output prospects in economies with recent banking crises. The historical evidence suggests that
output in many of these economies may remain
well below precrisis trends in the medium run.
The associated losses in capital, employment,
and total factor productivity could be long-lasting, leaving an enduring imprint on the productive capacity of these economies. Medium-term
39After its banking crisis in 1991, Tunisia also had a significant output gain. In the years following the crisis, the
country ratified the agreement to establish the African
Union, established a free trade zone with the European
Union, and implemented major financial and capital
account reforms (see Figure 4.14).

Appendix 4.1. Data Sources and Methodologies

output dynamics may also be affected at the
global level. The combined output of economies currently in the midst of a banking crisis
comprises close to one-half of real GDP for the
advanced economies and one-quarter of world
GDP. This suggests that real output in advanced
economies is unlikely to rebound to its precrisis
trend, which was the experience of emerging
economies following the 1980s debt crises (see
Box 4.1). The global nature of the current crisis
also implies that external demand is less likely to
play the same role it did in many of the previous
banking crises in mitigating output losses.
For policymakers, the prospects of large
permanent output losses raise major challenges.
The macroeconomic policy response has been
forceful so far, in the form of substantial fiscal
and monetary stimulus. However, it remains
uncertain how much potential output has been
reduced by the recent financial crisis, which
makes it difficult to measure the amount of slack
in the economy, the so-called output gap. This
makes calibrating macroeconomic policy especially challenging. Looking ahead, the timing
for the withdrawal of the extraordinary amount
of monetary and fiscal stimulus that has been
implemented in many countries will be important. On the one hand, a premature exit could
stifle the recovery. On the other hand, delaying
the withdrawal of stimulus could be inflationary.
At the same time, the dramatic increase in
fiscal deficits and government debt levels exacerbates sustainability concerns for a number of
economies. These pressures will worsen if output
losses are permanent and constrain government
revenues in the future. A fall in medium-term
output would also worsen the expected deterioration in government debt dynamics due to
factors related to population aging.
These concerns underscore the importance of implementing reforms to help raise
medium-term output and facilitate the shift of
resources across sectors. On the employment
side, previous crises suggest that medium-term
employment losses will be large, a prediction
seemingly confirmed by recent unemployment
dynamics. As discussed in Chapter 1, this pros-

pect highlights the importance of labor market
policies that facilitate the requisite adjustment
of workers and jobs across sectors within crisishit economies and thereby avert increases in
structural unemployment.

Appendix 4.1. Data Sources and
Methodologies
The main author of this appendix is Daniel Leigh.
This appendix provides details on the data
used in the analysis. It also reports the results of
robustness exercises on measuring output losses
and on the estimation results reported in Tables
4.1 and 4.2.

Data Sources
The main data sources for this chapter are
the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) and
International Financial Statistics (IFS) databases
and the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database. Additional data sources
are listed in the table.
Data on real GDP and its demand components are from the WDI and are spliced with
WEO data for observations after 2007 for which
WDI data are unavailable. The current account
balance, the GDP deflator, and the fiscal balance are also taken from the WEO database;
the exchange rate series are taken from the
IFS database. The domestic real interest rate
is defined as the difference between the nominal lending rate, taken from the IFS, and GDP
deflator inflation.
For the growth accounting exercises, the capital stock data are taken from Bosworth and Collins (2003). For observations not included in the
Bosworth and Collins data set, the capital stock
is constructed using the perpetual inventory
method, with a depreciation rate of 5 percent,
and real investment data. The employment and
labor force data come from the WEO database.
Financial development is measured using the
ratio of bank credit to GDP. Bank credit to the
private nonfinancial sector is taken from the
IFS database. Breaks in these data are identified

The baseline measure of the output loss is
compared with the following four alternative
measures based on different versions of the
precrisis trend.
• Alternative 1: Precrisis window ending one year before crisis. Here, the precrisis trend is computed
as in the baseline, except that the estimation
window for the precrisis trend ends one year
before the crisis, rather than three years before
as it does in the baseline.
• Alternative 2: Longer estimation window application. As in the baseline, an initial estimate of
the precrisis trend is obtained based on the
seven-year sample ending three years before
the crisis. In the baseline approach, initial
estimates that were negative were replaced
with trends based on a longer precrisis window
going back 20 years before the crisis. Here,
the longer precrisis window is applied to the
lowest and the highest 10 percent of the initial
estimates of the trend growth rates. As in the
baseline approach, if the trend estimate based
on the longer sample is unavailable, or even
farther from zero than the initial estimate, the
initial estimate is kept.
• Alternative 3: Longer estimation window applied
to all crises. Here, the estimate of the precrisis
trend is obtained based solely on the longer
precrisis window going back 20 years before the
crisis and ending three years before the crisis.
• Alternative 4: Precrisis trend based on real-time IMF
country desk forecasts. Here, the output losses

were recomputed using the real-time mediumterm growth projections of IMF country desks
prepared for the April 2009 World Economic
Outlook in the year before the crisis. In particular, the precrisis trend growth rate is defined
as the desk forecast for real GDP growth in
year t = 4 made in year t = –1, where t = 0 is
the year of the crisis. The corresponding per
capita growth forecast is obtained by subtracting population growth in year t = – 1. Note that
these real-time forecasts were available only for
the post-1989 period.
As Figure 4.15 illustrates, the output losses
obtained using the different approaches were
highly correlated and all confirm the finding of
large and statistically significant output losses
after banking crises. The 90 percent confidence bands for each measure overlap with the
90 percent confidence band of the baseline
measure. In the case of alternatives 1, 2, and 3,
the overlap is substantial, and the mean output
losses are statistically indistinguishable from
the baseline. In the case of alternative 4, the
average output loss is even greater than in the
baseline. This is because the IMF country desk
forecasts were, on average, more optimistic than
the baseline precrisis trend. Therefore, the
corresponding underperformance relative to
the forecast (output loss) is, on average, significantly greater than in the baseline.

Estimation Results without Controlling for ShortTerm Crisis Severity
The short-term crisis severity variable, measured by the change in output relative to trend
in the crisis year, was found to be a strong predictor of medium-term output losses (Tables 4.1
and 4.2). However, there is a possible concern
that short-term crisis severity may be correlated
with other explanatory variables included in the
regression, potentially complicating the interpretation of the regression coefficients. To address
this concern, the regressions are repeated with
the omission of the short-term crisis severity
variable, and the results are reported in Tables
4.3 and 4.4. Overall, the coefficients are similar.

IMF Executive Board Discussion of the
Outlook,
September 2009
chapter title

The following remarks by the Acting Chair were made at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the
World Economic Outlook on September 16, 2009.

E

xecutive Directors welcomed signs that
the global economy appears to be recovering and that financial conditions have
improved markedly. Decisive and wideranging public interventions in key advanced
economies have allayed concerns about systemic
financial collapse and a global depression,
while stimulative macroeconomic policies have
shored up domestic demand across many other
economies. Directors observed that emerging
and developing countries, notably strong Asian
performance, are leading the global recovery,
supported by accommodative policies and recent
increases in commodity prices.
Directors nevertheless expected the pace
of global recovery to be subdued, with activity
remaining far below precrisis levels. Downside
risks to growth, though receding, remain a concern. First, a key constraint on activity is credit
availability, as bank deleveraging is expected to
limit the supply of credit for some time. Second,
forces driving the current rebound will fade, as
fiscal stimulus diminishes and inventory rebuilding gradually loses impetus. Third, consumption
and investment are muted by the need to repair
balance sheets, as well as rising unemployment,
high excess capacity, and financing constraints.
All these provide grounds to be cautious about
the course of the global recovery.
Directors stressed that the key policy tasks
remain restoring financial sector health, while
maintaining supportive macroeconomic policies
until the recovery is on a firm footing. Directors
agreed that, while it is still too early for an exit
from extraordinary public interventions and
fiscal and monetary stimulus, policymakers need
to begin preparing for the exit. The challenge

is to calibrate the timing for the unwinding of
public support, suited to individual country
circumstances, communicating clear, coordinated exit strategies to the public. A premature
withdrawal could jeopardize achievements in
securing financial stability and economic recovery, while a delayed exit runs the risk of damaging public balance sheets, amplifying inflation
prospects, and distorting incentives. Directors
underscored the importance of international
coordination and the advisory role of the IMF in
the design and timing of exit strategies, recognizing that recovery paths differ from country to
country.
Directors considered that the key issues facing
monetary policymakers are when and how to
unwind accommodative conditions, anticipating
the impact of the withdrawal of fiscal support.
In advanced economies, most central banks can
afford to maintain accommodative conditions
for an extended period so long as output gaps
remain wide. While the rise in central bank
liquidity will largely run off naturally as financial
conditions improve, it could take much longer
to reverse the buildup in illiquid assets on some
central banks’ balance sheets. Directors noted
that central banks have the tools available to
absorb reserves as needed to drain liquidity.
They thought that the need to remove monetary
accommodation is likely to materialize sooner in
emerging economies than in advanced economies, although the situation varies across emerging economies. In some emerging economies,
warding off risks of new asset price bubbles may
also call for greater exchange rate flexibility.
Beyond the short-term horizon, Directors
considered that monetary authorities should

153

ANNEX   IMF Executive Board Discussion of the Outlook, September 2009

regularly monitor asset price movements along
with other economic developments and, where
and when possible, complement changes in
policy rates with macroprudential instruments
under appropriate circumstances. That said,
they recognized that many unresolved practical
issues exist regarding macrofinancial linkages,
and hence it is too early to draw firm operational conclusions for monetary policy.
Notwithstanding already large deficits and
rising public debt in many countries, Directors
generally believed that fiscal stimulus needs to
be sustained until the recovery is firmly established. They broadly felt that support may even
need to be amplified or extended beyond current plans if downside risks to growth materialize, although a few saw very limited fiscal room
in major advanced economies. Directors agreed
that more progress in putting public finances
back on a sustainable path could be achieved by
governments’ committing to large reductions in
deficits and advancing reforms to entitlement
systems. The credibility of such commitments
could usefully be supported with more robust
fiscal frameworks, including suitable fiscal rules
and strong enforcement mechanisms that help
constrain spending pressures in the upswing.
Directors stressed that completing financial
sector repair and reforming prudential frameworks are urgently needed to return to sustained
growth and to fully exit from liquidity and
credit provision. Renewed efforts to increase
bank capital and to cleanse bank balance sheets
would help underpin the recovery. Official
stress tests provide key diagnostics in order to
design appropriate strategies for recapitalization of viable banks and for careful resolution
of nonviable banks. In addition, exit strategies
need to be clearly articulated to help guide bank
restructuring. Public support programs need to
be phased out gradually, using well-designed,
market-based incentives. Moreover, clarity on
new standards for capital regulation, liquidity
risk requirements, provisioning, and accounting,

154

and, where possible, resolution strategies are
necessary in order for banks to decide properly
how to deploy their resources and which business lines are likely to be profitable.
Directors noted that the pace of sustained
medium-term growth depends critically on
addressing the supply disruptions caused by
the crisis and rebalancing the global pattern of
demand. While past banking crises have tended
to result in appreciable permanent output
losses, this need not be the case if appropriate
policies are deployed. Beyond the restructuring of financial firms and repair of markets,
measures to help facilitate the redeployment of
capital and labor are necessary. Countries with
significant impediments to growth need to accelerate structural reforms to lift productivity and
potential output.
To offset likely subdued domestic demand in
deficit economies, many current account surplus
economies will need to rely more on domestic
demand growth, boosting private consumption,
increasing the efficiency of capital allocation,
and allowing greater exchange rate flexibility
where necessary. Deficit countries must also
do their part, tackling impediments to public
and private saving, boosting potential output
through labor and product market reforms,
and improving corporate governance. It will be
important for all countries to avoid trade and
financial protectionism.
Directors cautioned that rising unemployment
will present a major challenge in many advanced
economies, while the crisis has been a setback
to growth, employment, and poverty-alleviation
efforts in many low-income economies. They
underscored the need to help the unemployed
with income support, strong job intermediation
services, education and training, and measures
to buffer the impact of income losses from
lower wages in response to the shocks. Directors
called for continued international support for
low-income countries in their efforts to alleviate
poverty and maintain macroeconomic stability.

Statistical Appendix

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical data, as well as projections. It comprises five sections: Assumptions, What’s
New, Data and Conventions, Classification of Countries, and Statistical Tables.
The assumptions underlying the estimates
and projections for 2009–10 and the mediumterm scenario for 2011–14 are summarized in
the first section. The second section presents
a brief description of changes to the database
and statistical tables. The third section provides
a general description of the data and of the
conventions used for calculating country group
composites. The classification of countries
in the various groups presented in the World
Economic Outlook is summarized in the fourth
section.
The last, and main, section comprises the
statistical tables. Data in these tables have been
compiled on the basis of information available
through mid-September 2009. The figures for
2009 and beyond are shown with the same
degree of precision as the historical figures
solely for convenience; because they are projections, the same degree of accuracy is not to be
inferred.

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced
economies are assumed to remain constant
at their average levels during the period July
30–August 27, 2009. For 2009 and 2010, these
assumptions imply average U.S. dollar/SDR
conversion rates of 1.532 and 1.556, U.S. dollar/
euro conversion rates of 1.373 and 1.409, and
yen/U.S. dollar conversion rates of 94.9 and
93.2, respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average
$61.53 a barrel in 2009 and $76.50 a barrel in
2010.

Established policies of national authorities are
assumed to be maintained. The more specific
policy assumptions underlying the projections
for selected economies are described in Box A1.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that
the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)
on six-month U.S. dollar deposits will average
1.2 percent in 2009 and 1.4 percent in 2010,
that three-month euro deposits will average
1.2 percent in 2009 and 1.6 percent in 2010, and
that six-month yen deposits will average 0.7 percent in 2009 and 0.6 percent in 2010.
With respect to introduction of the euro, on
December 31, 1998, the Council of the European Union decided that, effective January 1,
1999, the irrevocably fixed conversion rates
between the euro and currencies of the member states adopting the euro are as follows.

Statistical Appendix

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions Underlying the Projections for Selected
Economies
Fiscal Policy Assumptions
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used
in the World Economic Outlook (WEO) are based
on officially announced budgets, adjusted for
differences between the national authorities
and the IMF staff regarding macroeconomic
assumptions and projected fiscal outturns. The
medium-term fiscal projections incorporate
policy measures that are judged likely to be
implemented. In cases where the IMF staff has
insufficient information to assess the authorities’ budget intentions and prospects for policy
implementation, an unchanged structural
primary balance is assumed, unless otherwise
indicated. Specific assumptions used in some
of the advanced economies follow (see also
Tables B5–B7 in the Statistical Appendix for
data on fiscal and structural balances).1
Australia. The fiscal projections are based on
the May 2009 budget and IMF staff projections.
Austria. Projections for 2009 and 2010 incorporate two separate fiscal stimulus packages, tax
reform, and other decisions made in Parliament. These measures are estimated to amount
to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2009 and 1.9 percent
of GDP in 2010.
1The output gap is actual less potential output, as
a percent of potential output. Structural balances
are expressed as a percent of potential output. The
structural budget balance is the budgetary position
that would be observed if the level of actual output
coincided with potential output. Changes in the
structural budget balance consequently include effects
of temporary fiscal measures, the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and debt-service costs, and other
noncyclical fluctuations in the budget balance. The
computations of structural budget balances are based
on IMF staff estimates of potential GDP and revenue
and expenditure elasticities (see the October 1993
World Economic Outlook, Annex I). Net debt is defined
as gross debt minus financial assets of the general
government, which include assets held by the social
security insurance system. Estimates of the output gap
and of the structural balance are subject to significant
margins of uncertainty.

156

Belgium. Projections for 2009 are IMF staff
estimates based on the 2009 budgets approved
by the federal, community, and regional parliaments and adjusted for macroeconomic assumptions. Projections for the outer years are IMF
staff estimates, assuming unchanged policies.
Brazil. The 2009 forecasts are based on the
budget law and IMF staff assumptions. For the
outer years, the IMF staff assumes unchanged
policies, with a further increase in public investment in line with the authorities’ intentions.
Canada. Projections use the baseline forecasts
in the 2009 Budget Statement and June 2009
Economic Action Plan—Second Report, and the
September 2009 Update of Economic and Fiscal
Projections. The IMF staff makes some adjustments
to this forecast for differences in macroeconomic
projections. The IMF staff forecast also incorporates the most recent data releases from Statistics
Canada, including provincial and territorial budgetary outturns through the end of 2009:Q2.
China. For 2009–10, the government has
announced a large fiscal stimulus (although
there is a lack of clarity on the precise size,
which complicates analysis). The IMF staff is
assuming a total fiscal stimulus of 4 percent on
budget in 2009 (of which 1.0 percent of GDP
is revenue, 0.5 percent of GDP is automatic
stabilizers, and 2.5 percent of GDP is spending),
as well as 1 percent in support for governmentowned enterprises. For 2010, the assumption is
that the stimulus is not withdrawn.
Denmark. Projections for 2009 and 2010 are
aligned with the latest official budget estimates
and the underlying economic projections,
adjusted where appropriate for the IMF staff’s
macroeconomic assumptions. For 2011–14,
the projections incorporate key features of the
medium-term fiscal plan as embodied in the
authorities’ 2008 Convergence Program submitted to the European Union (EU) and additional
information obtained during the 2008 Article IV
discussions with authorities.
France. Projections for 2009 are IMF staff
estimates based on the 2009 budget and the

Statistical Appendix

two revised budget laws voted by Parliament
and adjusted for macroeconomic assumptions.
Projections for the outer years are IMF staff
estimates based on unchanged policies.
Germany. Projections for 2009 are based
on the 2009 budget, fiscal stimulus measures
announced since the budget was passed, and a
cyclical widening of the deficit. These amount
to a fiscal stimulus of 1.5 percent of GDP in
2009 and an additional fiscal stimulus of 0.5 percent of GDP in 2010. Over the medium term,
the path of health expenditures accelerates as
a result of population aging, and costs increase
because significant health care reform measures
have not been taken.
Greece. Projections are based on the 2009
budget, the latest Stability Program, and other
forecasts and data provided by the authorities.
Hong Kong SAR. Fiscal projections for 2007–10
are consistent with the authorities’ mediumterm strategy as outlined in the fiscal year
2009/10 budget, with projections for 2011–14
based on the assumptions underlying the IMF
staff’s medium-term macroeconomic scenario.
India. Estimates for 2007 are based on budgetary execution data. Projections for 2008 and
beyond are based on available information on
the authorities’ fiscal plans, with some adjustments for the IMF staff’s assumptions. For
2008/09, the fiscal projections incorporate the
estimated provisions under the 2008/09 budget,
as well as the cost of fiscal stimulus measures
in relation to the crisis (about 0.6 percent of
GDP). Beyond 2008/09, the IMF staff projects
that the government will not return to its fiscal
rules target of 3 percent deficit in 2009/10 or
in 2010/11, in order to provide some countercyclical stimulus to sagging economic activity.
However, the central government will remain
relatively prudent in its fiscal management
and will not use all the fiscal room created by
falling commodity prices, taking into account
the slower growth in revenues and worsening
subnational fiscal situation. This fiscal stance
would result in a gradual reduction in the over-

all fiscal deficit and a sustainable medium-term
debt path.
Indonesia. The 2009 fiscal projections are
based on IMF staff estimates of the revised 2009
budget realization. Staff projections are adjusted
for changes in macroeconomic assumptions as
well as the execution of fiscal stimulus measures. For 2010, staff estimates are based on the
assumption that the fiscal stimulus will not be
withdrawn. Because the authorities were still
in the process of finalizing the 2010 budget at
the time of the WEO submission, the following
elements of the additional fiscal stimulus were
identified and reflected in the 2010 projections:
(1) Rp 25 trillion in tax cuts, and (2) Rp 12 trillion in new infrastructure spending. The financing of the budget was based on an assumption
that additional financing costs would be split
between further drawdown of government
deposits and additional bond issues.
Ireland. The fiscal projections are based on
the April 2009 supplementary budget. The
authorities announced their intention to take
steps to bring the deficit down to 2.6 percent of
GDP by 2013, but have yet to implement measures to bring this about.
Italy. The fiscal projections for 2009–10 incorporate the budget estimates as presented in the
government’s 2010–13 Economic and Financial
Planning Document approved by Parliament in
July, including the fiscal stimulus packages, with
further adjustments for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic projections and assumptions. Thereafter, a broadly constant structural primary
balance is assumed.
Japan. The 2009 projections assume that fiscal
stimulus will be implemented as announced by
the government. The medium-term projections
typically assume that expenditure and revenue
of the general government (excluding the social
security fund) are adjusted in line with current
government policies (3 percent cut a year in
public investment).
Korea. The fiscal projections assume that fiscal
stimulus will be implemented in 2009 and 2010,

157

Statistical Appendix

Box A1 (concluded)
as announced by the government. These discretionary stimulus measures amount to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2009 and 1.2 percent of GDP in
2010. Expenditure numbers for 2009 correspond to the budget numbers (original plus
supplementary). Revenue projections reflect
the IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions,
adjusted for the estimated costs of tax measures
included in the stimulus package. The mediumterm projections assume that the government
will resume its consolidation plans and balance
the budget (excluding social security funds)
over the years.
Mexico. Fiscal projections for 2009 are based
on budgeted discretionary spending, with
revenues and nondiscretionary spending driven
by the IMF staff’s macroeconomic projections.
Projections for 2010 and beyond are based
on (1) IMF staff macroeconomic projections,
(2) the modified balanced budget rule under
the Fiscal Responsibility Legislation, and
(3) authorities’ projections of the spending
pressures in pensions and health care and of
the wage bill restraint. A fiscal stimulus package
of about 1 percent of GDP was introduced in
the context of the 2009 budget (effective early
2009). The main elements were (1) an increase
in infrastructure spending (0.4 percent of
GDP), (2) an increase in net lending by development banks (0.2 percent of GDP), and (3) an
increase in current spending on public security,
social transfers, and economic development
(0.3 percent of GDP).
Netherlands. Fiscal projections for 2009–10
are based on the Bureau for Economic Policy
Analysis budget projections, after adjusting for
differences in macroeconomic assumptions. For
the remainder of the projection period, the IMF
staff projection assumes further consolidation
efforts in line with the authorities’ objective of
reducing the sustainability gap.
New Zealand. The fiscal projections are based
on the authorities’ May 2009 budget update
and IMF staff estimates. The New Zealand fiscal

158

accounts switched to new generally accepted
accounting principles beginning in fiscal year
2006/07, with no comparable historical data.
Portugal. For 2008–10, the fiscal projections
take into account the impact of discretionary measures taken so far in response to the
downturn. In addition, automatic stabilizers are
allowed to play fully. For 2011–14, the deficits
are projected to decline gradually, assuming the
government will contain further current spending to achieve structural adjustment of at least
0.5 percent of GDP a year in compliance with
the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact.
Russia. The deficit projection for 2009 is
based on the revised 2009 supplementary budget. Consolidated regional budgets are expected
to be broadly balanced, reflecting strict deficit
and debt limits at the local government level.
For 2010, the projection is based on the IMF
staff’s revenue forecast and the authorities’
nominal expenditures presented in the draft
2010–12 medium-term budget. The deficit projection for 2011–12 is based on the IMF staff’s
revenue projections and the non-oil deficit
implied by the draft 2010–12 medium-term budget. Over the longer term, the overall balance
is assumed to evolve in line with the authorities’
intention to gradually reduce the non-oil deficit
to 4.7 percent of GDP—a target that the IMF
staff assumes will be attained by 2014.
Saudi Arabia. The authorities systematically
underestimate revenues and expenditures in the
budget relative to actual outturns. The WEO
baseline oil prices are discounted by 5 percent,
reflecting the higher sulfur content in Saudi
crude. Regarding non-oil revenues, customs
receipts are assumed to grow in line with
imports, investment income in line with the
London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), and
fees and charges as a function of non-oil GDP.
On the expenditure side, wages are assumed to
rise above the natural rate of increase, reflecting
a salary increase of 15 percent distributed over
2008–10, and goods and services are projected

Statistical Appendix

to grow in line with inflation over the medium
term. Interest payments are projected to decline
in line with the authorities’ policy of repaying
public debt. Capital spending in 2009 is projected to be higher than in the budget by about
40 percent and in line with the authorities’
announcements to maintain spending at current levels. The pace of spending is projected to
slow over the medium term.
Singapore. For fiscal year 2009/10, projections
are based on budget numbers. Medium-term
projections assume that capital gains on fiscal
reserves will be included in investment income.
South Africa. The authorities did not explicitly
enact a stimulus package in response to the weakening economy but instead accelerated the existing public investment program to help support
economic activity. Thus, the IMF staff estimates
of the magnitude of the stimulus rely on the
authorities’ 2009 budget and are derived from a
cyclical adjustment of the public sector borrowing
requirement based on tax-specific elasticities.
Spain. The fiscal projections for 2009 take
into account the impact of discretionary measures taken so far in response to the economic
downturn. In addition, automatic stabilizers are
allowed to operate fully. For 2010–14, the deficit
is projected to decline gradually as spending
declines (the stimulus has sunset clauses) and as
the government contains further current spending to bring the deficit down.
Sweden. For 2009, the fiscal projections take
into account the impact of the stimulus measures
introduced in response to the downturn. No
further measures are assumed for the future,
consistent with the authorities’ projections in the
2009 Spring Bill. The impact of cyclical developments on the fiscal accounts is calculated using
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development’s latest semi-elasticity.
Switzerland. Projections for 2008–14 are based
on IMF staff calculations, which incorporate
measures to restore balance in the federal
accounts and strengthen social security finances.

Turkey. Fiscal projections are based on the
IMF staff’s assessment of the fiscal policies and
measures identified in the authorities’ mediumterm macroeconomic program.
United Kingdom. The projections incorporate
a fiscal stimulus of about 1.5 percent of GDP in
2009 (1.3 percent revenue measures, 0.2 percent expenditure measures).
United States. The fiscal projections are
based on the administration’s budget for fiscal
year 2009 and the U.S. Congressional Budget
Office’s baseline budget outlook for 2009–19.
These projections include the $787 billion
stimulus package under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The projections are adjusted for differences in forecasts
of (1) macroeconomic and financial variables,
(2) the timing of stimulus disbursements,
(3) additional costs to support financial institutions and government-sponsored enterprises,
and (4) the effect of financial sector support on
government-owned financial assets.
Monetary Policy Assumptions
Monetary policy assumptions are based
on the established policy framework in each
country. In most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative stance over the business cycle: official
interest rates will increase when economic indicators suggest that inflation will rise above its
acceptable rate or range, and they will decrease
when indicators suggest that prospective inflation will not exceed the acceptable rate or
range, that prospective output growth is below
its potential rate, and that the margin of slack
in the economy is significant. On this basis,
the LIBOR on six-month U.S. dollar deposits
is assumed to average 1.2 percent in 2009 and
1.4 percent in 2010 (see Table 1.1). The rate on
three-month euro deposits is assumed to average 1.2 percent in 2009 and 1.6 percent in 2010.
The interest rate on six-month Japanese yen
deposits is assumed to average 0.7 percent
in 2009 and 0.6 percent in 2010.

What’s New
Starting with the October 2009 World Economic
Outlook, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei Darussalam,
Eritrea, Iraq, Liberia, Montenegro, Serbia,
and Timor-Leste are included in the regional
and analytical group compositions. Zimbabwe
has been returned to the group compositions
as a result of recent price stabilization, which
facilitates the measurement of macroeconomic
variables and allows for cross-country data
comparisons. Georgia officially withdrew from
the Commonwealth of Independent States on
August 18, 2009, but is included in that group
for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.

Data and Conventions
Data and projections for 182 economies form
the statistical basis for the World Economic Outlook
(the WEO database). The data are maintained
jointly by the IMF’s Research Department and
regional departments, with the latter regularly
updating country projections based on consistent global assumptions.
Although national statistical agencies are
the ultimate providers of historical data and
definitions, international organizations are also
involved in statistical issues, with the objective of
harmonizing methodologies for the compilation
of national statistics, including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions, classifications, and
valuation procedures used in the production of
economic statistics. The WEO database reflects
information from both national source agencies
and international organizations.
The comprehensive revision of the standardized System of National Accounts 1993, the IMF’s
Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition, the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, and the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 represented significant improvements in the standards

160

of economic statistics and analysis.1 The IMF was
actively involved in all these projects, particularly
the Balance of Payments, Monetary and Financial
Statistics, and Government Finance Statistics manuals,
which reflect the IMF’s special interest in countries’ external positions, financial sector stability,
and public sector fiscal positions. The process
of adapting country data to the new definitions began in earnest when the manuals were
released. However, full concordance with the
manuals is ultimately dependent on the provision
by national statistical compilers of revised country
data; hence, the World Economic Outlook estimates
are still only partially adapted to these manuals.
Several countries have phased out their traditional fixed-base-year method of calculating real
macroeconomic variable levels and growth by
switching to a chain-weighted method of computing
aggregate growth, in line with recent improvements in standards for reporting economic statistics. Recent dramatic changes in the structure of
these economies have caused these countries to
revise the way they measure real GDP levels and
growth. Switching to the chain-weighted method
of computing aggregate growth, which uses current price information, allows countries to measure GDP growth more accurately by eliminating
upward biases in new data.2 Currently, real macroeconomic data for Albania, Australia, Austria,
Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus,

land, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia,
Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
the United Kingdom, and the United States are
based on chain-weighted methodology. However,
data before 1994 (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan), 1995
(Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia,
euro area, Ireland, Luxembourg, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Spain), 1996 (Albania, Georgia),
2000 (Greece, Korea, Malta, Singapore), and
2001 (Bulgaria) are based on unrevised national
accounts and are subject to revision in the future.
Composite data for country groups in the World
Economic Outlook are either sums or weighted
averages of data for individual countries. Unless
otherwise indicated, multiyear averages of growth
rates are expressed as compound annual rates
of change.3 Arithmetically weighted averages
are used for all data except inflation and money
growth for the emerging and developing economies group, for which geometric averages are
used. The following conventions apply.
• Country group composites for exchange rates,
interest rates, and growth rates of monetary
aggregates are weighted by GDP converted to
U.S. dollars at market exchange rates (averaged over the preceding three years) as a
share of group GDP.
• Composites for other data relating to the
domestic economy, whether growth rates or
ratios, are weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parity (PPP) as a share of total
world or group GDP.4
• Composites for data relating to the domestic economy for the euro area (16 member
countries throughout the entire period unless
3Averages for real GDP and its components, employment, per capita GDP, inflation, factor productivity,
trade, and commodity prices are calculated based on the
compound annual rate of change, except for the unemployment rate, which is based on the simple arithmetic
average.
4See Box A2 of the April 2004 World Economic Outlook
for a summary of the revised PPP-based weights and
Annex IV of the May 1993 World Economic Outlook. See
also Anne-Marie Gulde and Marianne Schulze-Ghattas,
“Purchasing Power Parity Based Weights for the World
Economic Outlook,” in Staff Studies for the World Economic
Outlook (International Monetary Fund, December 1993),
pp. 106–23.

otherwise noted) are aggregates of national
source data using GDP weights. Annual data
are not adjusted for calendar day effects. For
data prior to 1999, data aggregations apply
1995 European currency unit exchange rates.
• Composite unemployment rates and employment growth are weighted by labor force as a
share of group labor force.
• Composites relating to the external economy
are sums of individual country data after
conversion to U.S. dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated for
balance of payments data and at end-of-year
market exchange rates for debt denominated
in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes and
prices, however, are arithmetic averages of percent changes for individual countries weighted
by the U.S. dollar value of exports or imports
as a share of total world or group exports or
imports (in the preceding year).
All data refer to calendar years, except for the
following countries, which refer to fiscal years:
Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Islamic Republic
of Iran, and Myanmar (April/March); Australia,
Egypt, Ethiopia, Mauritius, Nepal, New Zealand,
Pakistan, Samoa, and Tonga (July/June); and
Haiti (October/September).

Classification of Countries
Summary of the Country Classification
The country classification in the World Economic Outlook divides the world into two major
groups: advanced economies and emerging and
developing economies.5 This classification is not
based on strict criteria, economic or otherwise,
and it has evolved over time. The objective is
to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably
meaningful method for organizing data. Table A
provides an overview of the country classifica-

5As

used here, the term “country” does not in all cases
refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood
by international law and practice. It also covers some territorial entities that are not states, but for which statistical
data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

tion, showing the number of countries in each
group by region and summarizing some key
indicators of their relative size (GDP valued by
purchasing power parity, total exports of goods
and services, and population).
Some countries remain outside the country
classification and therefore are not included in
the analysis. Cuba and the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea are not IMF members, and
their economies therefore are not monitored
by the IMF. San Marino is omitted from the
group of advanced economies for lack of a fully
developed database. Likewise, Aruba, Kosovo,
the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of
Micronesia, Palau, and Somalia are omitted
from the emerging and developing economies
group because of data limitations.

Emerging and Developing Economies
The group of emerging and developing economies (149 countries) includes all countries that
are not classified as advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging and
developing economies—Africa, central and
eastern Europe, Commonwealth of Independent
States, developing Asia, Middle East, and Western
Hemisphere—largely conform to the regional
breakdowns in the IMF’s International Financial
Statistics. In both classifications, Egypt and
Libya are included in the Middle East region
rather than in Africa. In addition, the World
Economic Outlook sometimes refers to the
regional group of Middle East and North African countries, also referred to as the MENA
countries, whose composition straddles the
Africa and Middle East regions. This group is
defined as the Arab League countries plus the
Islamic Republic of Iran (see Table D).
Emerging and developing economies are
also classified according to analytical criteria. The analytical criteria reflect countries’
composition of export earnings and other
income from abroad; exchange rate arrangements; a distinction between net creditor and
net debtor countries; and, for the net debtor

many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. Data for some countries are for fiscal years.
percent changes in 2002 are calculated over a period of 18 months, reflecting a change in the fiscal year cycle (from July–June to January–December).
3The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on IMF staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars.
4Data for some countries refer to real net material product (NMP) or are estimates based on NMP. The figures should be interpreted only as indicative of broad orders of
magnitude because reliable, comparable data are not generally available. In particular, the growth of output of new private enterprises of the informal economy is not fully
reflected in the recent figures.
5Georgia and Mongolia, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in
economic structure.
6Private analysts are of the view that real GDP growth has been lower than the official reports since the last quarter of 2008.

1In accordance with standard practice in the World Economic Outlook, movements in consumer prices are indicated as annual averages rather than as December–December
changes during the year, as is the practice in some countries. For many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. Data for some countries are for fiscal years.
2The percent changes in 2002 are calculated over a period of 18 months, reflecting a change in the fiscal year cycle (from July–June to January–December).
3The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on IMF staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars.
4For many countries, inflation for the earlier years is measured on the basis of a retail price index. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation data with broader and more up-todate coverage are typically used for more recent years.
5Georgia and Mongolia, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in
economic structure.
6Private analysts estimate that CPI inflation has been considerably higher. The authorities have created a board of academic advisors to assess these issues.

1In this table, official holdings of gold are valued at SDR 35 an ounce. This convention results in a marked underestimation of reserves for countries that have substantial
gold holdings.
2Georgia and Mongolia, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in
economic structure.
3Reserves at year-end in percent of imports of goods and services for the year indicated.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as
the sum of the U.S dollar values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook,
where the composites were weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. For many countries, the estimates of national savings are
built up from national accounts data on gross domestic investment and from balance-of-payments-based data on net foreign investment. The latter, which is equivalent to
the current account balance, comprises three components: current transfers, net factor income, and the resource balance. The mixing of data source, which is dictated by
availability, implies that the estimates for national savings that are derived incorporate the statistical discrepancies. Furthermore, errors, omissions, and asymmetries in
balance of payments statistics affect the estimates for net lending; at the global level, net lending, which in theory would be zero, equals the world current account discrepancy.
Despite these statistical shortcomings, flow of funds estimates, such as those presented in these tables, provide a useful framework for analyzing development in savings and
investment, both over time and across regions and countries.
1Calculated from the data of individual euro area countries.
2Georgia and Mongolia, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in
economic structure.
