BIS 82nd Annual Report

82nd Annual Report

submitted to the Annual General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements
held in Basel on 24 June 2012

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to submit to you the 82nd Annual Report of the Bank for
International Settlements for the financial year which ended on 31 March 2012.
The net profit for the year amounted to SDR 758.9 million, compared with
SDR 816.0 million for the preceding year. Details of the results for the
financial year 2011/12 may be found on pages 129–32 of this Report under “Net
profit and its distribution”.
The Board of Directors proposes, in application of Article 51 of the Bank’s
Statutes, that the present General Meeting pay a dividend of SDR 305 per
share, with the four new shareholders receiving a pro rata share of the
dividend. This dividend would total SDR 168.4 million, payable in any
constituent currency of the SDR, or in Swiss francs.
The Board further recommends that SDR 29.5 million be transferred to
the general reserve fund, SDR 6.0 million to the special dividend reserve fund
and the remainder – amounting to SDR 555.0 million – to the free reserve fund.
If these proposals are approved, the Bank’s dividend for the financial year
2011/12 will be payable to shareholders on 29 June 2012.

Overview of the economic chapters

Chapter I: Breaking the vicious cycles
The global economy has yet to overcome the legacies of the financial crisis to
achieve balanced, self-sustaining growth. In different ways, vicious cycles are
hindering the transition for both the advanced and emerging market economies.
After reviewing the past year’s economic developments (Chapter II), the
economic chapters address fundamental aspects of these vicious cycles:
unfinished structural adjustments (Chapter III), risks in the current stances of
monetary (Chapter IV) and fiscal policy (Chapter V), and the ongoing
challenges of financial reform (Chapter VI). Chapter I underscores the themes
and policy conclusions of the latter four chapters, and in a special section
examines them in the context of problems in Europe’s currency union.

Chapter II: The year in retrospect
In the advanced economies, the first months of 2011 seemed to offer the
beginnings of a self-sustaining recovery, a promise that turned out to be a false
dawn. The pattern appears to be repeating itself in 2012, with early signs of
strength gradually fading. The same set of hindrances has been at work in the
past two years. The crisis exposed the weak foundations of government
finances. With budgets in disarray, fiscal authorities have been forced to make
deep budget cuts at the same time as other sectors of the economy continue to
deleverage. In the euro area, the evolution of fiscal strains into a sovereign
debt crisis has severely undermined the confidence of investors and
consumers inside and outside the monetary union. Losses on sovereign bonds
have led many banks to cut lending, thereby further weakening the recovery.
Meanwhile, many emerging market economies have begun to see their
previously vigorous rates of economic activity drop off.

Chapter III: Rebalancing growth
Both advanced and emerging market economies face structural challenges.
Sectoral misallocations that built up during the boom, coupled with high levels
of household and corporate debt, continue to hobble growth in some advanced
economies. These countries must move to repair balance sheets as they
facilitate the rebalancing of resources across sectors. Meanwhile, a number of
other countries, including many emerging market economies, face the risk of
experiencing their own version of the recent boom and bust cycle. Their
rebalancing requires shifting from credit expansion and exports towards
internal sources of growth, especially as growth models that mainly rely on
exports are likely to be less effective than in the past.

Chapter IV: The limits of monetary policy
The major advanced economies are maintaining extraordinarily accommodative
monetary conditions, which are being transmitted to emerging market
economies (EMEs) in the form of undesirable exchange rate and capital flow
volatility. As a consequence of EME efforts to manage these spillovers, the
stance of monetary policy is highly accommodative globally. There is
widespread agreement that, during the crisis, decisive central bank action was
essential to prevent a financial meltdown and that in the aftermath it has been
supporting faltering economies. Central banks have had little choice but to
maintain monetary ease because governments have failed to quickly and
comprehensively address structural impediments to growth. But the need for
prolonged accommodation has to be carefully weighed against the risk of
generating distortions that will later produce financial and price instability.

Chapter V: Restoring fiscal sustainability
Sovereigns under fiscal pressure have been losing their risk-free status – and
the accompanying economic benefits – at an alarming rate. The broad
availability of safe assets aids the operation of financial markets and the
conduct of monetary policy. And a sovereign whose debt is essentially free of
credit risk has ample room to implement countercyclical policies to support
macroeconomic stability. Restoring the supply of risk-free assets requires that
governments convincingly address high deficits as well as projected increases
in their long-term liabilities. Some countries need to take immediate action to
significantly reform their public sectors and remove structural impediments to
growth. All countries need to prevent adverse feedback loops between the
financial sector and the sovereign and build up fiscal buffers in good times.

Chapter VI: Post-crisis evolution of the banking sector
Banks and prudential authorities still face tough challenges in securing financial
stability. Banks need to further strengthen capital and liquidity positions to
regain markets’ confidence. To expedite this process, authorities should ensure
that institutions recapitalise and recognise losses on problematic investments.
Authorities everywhere must complete their consistent and timely
implementation of the agreed Basel III standards and ensure that robust
regulation extends to currently unregulated intermediaries. Meanwhile,
regulators in rapidly growing economies should be aware of the potentially
destabilising risk-taking encouraged by buoyant local markets. The long-term
objective of policy must be to pave the way to a robust business model of
banking featuring strong and transparent balance sheets, self-sustaining
international operations, and stable profits that do not rely on official support.

I. Breaking the vicious cycles

The world is now five years on from the outbreak of the financial crisis, yet the
global economy is still unbalanced and seemingly becoming more so as
interacting weaknesses continue to amplify each other. The goals of balanced
growth, balanced economic policies and a safe financial system still elude us.
In advanced economies at the centre of the financial crisis, high debt loads
continue to drag down recovery; monetary and fiscal policies still lack a
comprehensive solution to short-term needs and long-term dangers; and
despite the international progress on regulation, the condition of the financial
sector still poses a threat to stability. From time to time, encouraging signs
raise hopes – but they are quickly dashed, delivering another blow to the
confidence of consumers and investors.
As many advanced economies have been struggling, emerging market
economies have been rising, in some cases fuelled by rapid credit expansion or
a vast wave of export-led growth. This two-speed recovery generates large and
potentially destabilising current account imbalances and volatile gross capital
flows. The export boom in many emerging markets has crowded out the
development of more durable internal sources of growth, leaving countries
more vulnerable as growth begins to slow down. As the economic
developments of the past year (see Chapter II) have demonstrated, a selfsustaining recovery in the advanced economies and a rebalancing of global
growth remain elusive.
In short, vicious cycles are distorting both advanced and emerging
economies. How can these vicious cycles be turned into virtuous ones? The
ongoing challenges of structural adjustment, monetary and fiscal policy risks,
and financial reform encompass the broad global threats that are still with us.
These four topics, and the steps needed to set the global economy firmly
on the path to sustainable long-term growth, are the focus of Chapters III–VI
in this Report. In the remainder of this chapter, we highlight the policy
recommendations for the global economy. And, before concluding, we also
discuss the particularly vicious cycles currently bedevilling Europe, where the
monetary union faces the above challenges plus those of an incomplete
institutional setup.

Structural challenges persist
The global economy remains unbalanced, as activity in many advanced
economies continues to falter while economies elsewhere are expanding, in
some cases rapidly (Chapter III). This is unlikely to be sustainable.
Economies that were at the centre of the financial crisis must face their
crisis legacies of debt and misallocated resources head-on. The leveragedriven real estate boom left an enormous overhang of debt after the inevitable
implosion. The necessary deleveraging process for households is far from

BIS 82nd Annual Report

1

complete and has been slow by historical standards. Household debt remains
close to 100% of GDP in some countries, including Ireland, Spain and the
United Kingdom; in others, including France and Italy, household and corporate
debt have both increased relative to GDP since 2008.
An important factor slowing the deleveraging process among households
is the simultaneous need for balance sheet repair and deleveraging in the
financial and government sectors. Unusually slow deleveraging in every major
sector of activity partly explains why the recovery in the advanced economies
has been so weak. And given the ongoing need to improve balance sheets, any
effects from stimulative fiscal policy will be limited by overindebted agents
using additional income to repay debt rather than spend more. As a result,
weak growth is likely to continue.
Persistent imbalances across industries are also impeding recovery.
Because labour and capital do not easily shift across industries, the
misallocation of resources during the boom tends to work against recovery in
the aftermath of a crisis. Hence, countries where the sectoral imbalances were
most apparent are facing higher and more protracted unemployment as their
industrial structure only slowly adjusts.
Meanwhile, countries that are growing rapidly confront the problems of
identifying and reacting to the emergence of financial booms and, in many
cases, of shifting away from a reliance on exports. Evidence of overshooting in
some emerging markets is not hard to find. In several cases, prices for real
estate and other assets have been surging while private indebtedness and debt
service costs relative to income have been rising far above long-term trends.
The lessons from the hardships now being endured in the advanced economies
in the wake of similar experiences are not lost on today’s emerging market
policymakers, especially given recent signs of a slowdown in emerging market
economies. But with the prospect of continued slow growth in much of the
world, countries whose success has depended on exports would do well to
speed their efforts to build capacity for internal growth.

Overburdened central banks face risks
Over the past year, central banks in the advanced economies have continued
or even expanded their purchases of government bonds and their support of
liquidity in the banking system. At $18 trillion and counting, the aggregate
assets of all central banks now stand at roughly 30% of global GDP, double the
ratio of a decade ago. And real policy interest rates – nominal rates minus
headline inflation – remain substantially negative in most major advanced
economies. The global economy is certainly better off today because central
banks moved forcefully after the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers and in the
years since. One of the latest examples of such action was the European
Central Bank’s offer of three-year loans to banks in late 2011 and again in early
2012. That E1 trillion programme, which increased the Eurosystem central
bank balance sheet by roughly E500 billion, was perhaps the single most
important factor halting the freeze in banks’ funding markets and, indirectly,
supporting some euro area government bond markets.

2

BIS 82nd Annual Report

The extraordinary persistence of loose monetary policy is largely the result
of insufficient action by governments in addressing structural problems. Simply
put: central banks are being cornered into prolonging monetary stimulus as
governments drag their feet and adjustment is delayed. As we discuss in
Chapter IV, any positive effects of such central bank efforts may be shrinking,
whereas the negative side effects may be growing. Both conventionally and
unconventionally accommodative monetary policies are palliatives and have
their limits. It would be a mistake to think that central bankers can use their
balance sheets to solve every economic and financial problem: they cannot
induce deleveraging, they cannot correct sectoral imbalances, and they cannot
address solvency problems. In fact, near zero policy rates, combined with
abundant and nearly unconditional liquidity support, weaken incentives for the
private sector to repair balance sheets and for fiscal authorities to limit their
borrowing requirements. They distort the financial system and in turn place
added burdens on supervisors.
With nominal interest rates staying as low as they can go and central bank
balance sheets continuing to expand, risks are surely building up. To a large
extent they are the risks of unintended consequences, and they must be
anticipated and managed. These consequences could include the wasteful
support of effectively insolvent borrowers and banks – a phenomenon that
haunted Japan in the 1990s – and artificially inflated asset prices that generate
risks to financial stability down the road. One message of the crisis was that
central banks could do much to avert a collapse. An even more important
lesson is that underlying structural problems must be corrected during the
recovery or we risk creating conditions that will lead rapidly to the next crisis.
In addition, central banks face the risk that, once the time comes to tighten
monetary policy, the sheer size and scale of their unconventional measures will
prevent a timely exit from monetary stimulus, thereby jeopardising price
stability. The result would be a decisive loss of central bank credibility and
possibly even independence.
Although central banks in many advanced economies may have no choice
but to keep monetary policy relatively accommodative for now, they should use
every opportunity to raise the pressure for deleveraging, balance sheet repair
and structural adjustment by other means. They should also be doubly watchful
for the build-up of new imbalances in asset markets.
Fast-growing economies are in a different situation. But there too, central
banks are under pressure. The threats to monetary and financial stability in
many emerging market economies have, as noted above, been in evidence for
some time. Monetary policymakers there will need to continue to search for the
right balance, but the task is being made even more difficult by recent signs of
faltering growth combined with extraordinarily accommodative policies in the
advanced economies.

The abysmal fiscal outlook
Since 2007 – the year the financial crisis began – government debt in the
advanced economies has increased on average from about 75% of GDP to

BIS 82nd Annual Report

3

more than 110%. And average government deficits have ballooned from 1.5%
to 6.5% of GDP. One could be forgiven for thinking that, without the financial
crisis, government fiscal foundations today would be fairly sound. But the
seemingly endless growth of tax receipts during the boom years only
temporarily shored up those foundations. By pushing down tax receipts and
driving up the government’s social safety net costs, the financial crisis created
an explosion of deficits and debt that directed the authorities’ attention with
new force to the underlying menace that no longer seemed so far away: the
gross underfunding of governments’ health care and pension obligations and
an unmanageably large public sector.
In some countries, staggeringly large support programmes for the financial
sector wreaked havoc on government finances. The feedback between the
financial and the government sectors thus made a key contribution to
accelerating fiscal decay; and the connection between banking stress and
market pressures on sovereign credit has tightened considerably in the past
couple of years, especially in Europe.
As we discuss in Chapter V, the fiscal maelstrom has toppled many
sovereigns from their unique perch where the market considered them to be
essentially free of credit risk and, in that sense, riskless. The loss is particularly
worrisome given weak economic conditions and a global banking system still
largely dependent on government support. The shrinking supply of safe assets
is harming the functioning of financial markets and driving up funding costs for
the private sector. And it is helping push banks into risky practices, such as
rehypothecation – that is, the use of the same collateral for multiple obligations.
Over the past year, much of the world has focused on Europe, where
sovereign debt crises have been erupting at an alarming rate. But, as recently
underscored by credit downgrades of the United States and Japan and rating
agency warnings on the United Kingdom, underlying long-term fiscal
imbalances extend far beyond the euro area.
Although debt in emerging markets has on average remained fairly stable
relative to GDP, governments there should take heed: credit and asset price
booms in many cases have been masking underlying weaknesses in their fiscal
accounts, much as they did in advanced economies before the financial crisis.
If recent signs of a slowdown persist, the fiscal horizon of emerging market
economies could darken quickly.
So, governments across the globe need to tackle their fiscal predicaments.
In most advanced economies, the fiscal budget excluding interest payments
would need 20 consecutive years of surpluses exceeding 2% of GDP – starting
now – just to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio back to its pre-crisis level. And every
additional year that budgets continue in deficit makes the recovery period
longer. The question is not whether governments must adjust, but how?
Some say that governments should focus exclusively on resolving the long
term, ignoring the short term. Others say that the only credible consolidation
plan is the one that starts now – anything else risks pushing sovereign
creditworthiness off the cliff.
In choosing some position between these two extremes, a few points are
clear from the outset. The main priority should be forceful and credible long-

4

BIS 82nd Annual Report

term measures, even when it means making painful choices now. Governments
in the advanced economies will have to convincingly show that they will
adequately manage the costs for pensions and health care as their populations
grow older. Spending cuts and revenue increases may be necessary in the
near term as well. Countries in the deepest trouble will need to do much more,
quickly pushing through significant reform of their public sectors. In many
countries, ongoing deleveraging in the private sector weakens near-term
aggregate demand and hampers fiscal reform. In those cases, authorities
should create sufficient room for manoeuvre to support balance sheet repair in
the private sector, including by recapitalising banks as they recognise losses.
But trust lost is never easily regained. The road back to risk-free status for
sovereigns is a long one. Some countries have already run out of options and
will have no choice but to take immediate steps to restore fiscal balance.
Others will need to strike the right balance between long- and short-term
measures to be successful. A key challenge for governments as they strive for
that balance is to avoid losing the confidence of investors.
Economies less affected by the financial crisis should view their current
position of relative strength as an opportunity to put their government finances
on a sustainable long-term path. Doing so sooner rather than later will give
them the flexibility to react when the next crisis inevitably hits. In addition, all
countries will need to stem adverse feedback between the financial sector and
the sovereign. To this end, countries should move swiftly to make their banks
more resilient and make sure that, as conditions improve, they build fiscal
buffers.

The changing financial sphere
While financial institutions struggle to overcome the effects of the crisis, they
also confront a changed market environment and new regulations. In some
places they have made significant progress on recapitalisation but, as we
discuss in Chapter VI, their adjustment to the new conditions has a long way
to go and needs to be pushed ahead. The magnitude of this unfinished
business is clear from investors’ continued distrust of banks: the cost of buying
compensation for a bank default (the spread on bank credit default swaps) is
as high now as it was at the peak of the crisis, and bank equities continue to
lose ground relative to the broad market.
Despite the progress on recapitalisation, many banks remain highly
leveraged, including those that appear well capitalised but in fact have outsize
derivatives positions. Big banks continue to have an interest in driving up their
leverage without enough regard for the consequences of failure: because of
their systemic weight, they expect the public sector to cover the downside.
Another worrying sign is that trading, after a brief crisis-induced squeeze, has
again become a major source of income for large banks.
These conditions are moving the financial sector towards the same highrisk profile it had before the crisis. Recent heavy losses related to derivatives
trading are a reminder of the dangers associated with such a development.
Surely, fundamental progress on the structure of the financial system will be

BIS 82nd Annual Report

5

marked when its largest institutions can fail without the taxpayer having to
respond, and when the overall size of the sector relative to the rest of the
economy stays within tighter limits.
Some mechanisms can help align market participants’ interests with those
of the public. One is the reform of remuneration policies at banks. Another
involves bank bondholders, who together with the public sector are at risk of
picking up the tab if a financial intermediary’s net worth turns negative. The
incentives of bond investors will be better aligned with the public interest if the
investors see more clearly that they will bear losses if banks get into trouble.
This will require some combination of bail-in bonds – in which bondholders’
losses in resolution are known with some certainty beforehand – and improved
resolution powers. Making risks to investors clearer and ending crisis-related
support for banks, including government guarantees on their bonds, will push
investors to better scrutinise the financial health of banks before investing in
them. Greater transparency has a pivotal role to play here: it will increase
bondholders’ ability to monitor the banks because the risks the institutions are
taking will be more visible.
In short, public policy must move banks to adopt business models that
are less risky, more sustainable and more clearly in the public interest.
Governments can give the banking sector a healthy push in this direction if
officials make sure that newly agreed regulations are implemented universally
and without delay. Apart from enhancing transparency, this would also ensure
a level playing field for internationally active banks. Most importantly,
authorities should continue forcing banks to bring leverage down – and keep it
there by preventing them from deploying new instruments and tactics that
would push it back up. But such efforts should not stop with traditional banks.
Prudential authorities everywhere still face the challenge of putting in place
robust regulations that extend to the shadow banking sector.

What now for European monetary union?
The world is watching the crisis gripping the euro area with trepidation for
the spillovers it may have. But at its root the European crisis is a potential
harbinger, a virulent and advanced convergence of the problems to be
expected elsewhere if policy fails to break the vicious cycles generated by the
global weaknesses we describe in this Report – sectoral imbalances, excess
leverage, public overindebtedness and overburdened central banks.
For now, the destructive feedback created by these problems is
concentrated in the euro area, where the fiscal authorities in some countries,
forced to consolidate, can no longer support either their banks or their
economies. The rapid loss of investor confidence in these countries has caused
an equally rapid fragmentation of euro area financial markets. In this
environment, how can the common currency regain its credibility so that
Europe can return to prosperity and continue on the road to further integration?
In part, the euro area crisis involves underlying problems that were
revealed by the financial crisis and are common to many advanced economies.
Likewise, resolving it will require, in part, corrections that are also common:

6

BIS 82nd Annual Report

private sector balance sheet adjustment, sectoral rebalancing, fiscal
consolidation and banking recapitalisation. Europe has made progress on this
agenda: reforming labour markets and social insurance systems and, through
adoption of the fiscal compact, requiring countries to have general government
budgets in balance or in surplus.
But full resolution of the euro area crisis also requires strengthening
the institutional foundations of the currency union itself. To understand the
importance of this issue, recall that the European monetary union integrated
financial markets and created a centralised monetary authority so that capital
could flow freely and easily across the common currency area. Yet while the
region’s borders have become irrelevant for finance and for central banking,
authorities in one country still have only limited responsibilities for actions that
a financial intermediary takes in another country. Hence, the public in one
country of the currency union cannot be expected to financially backstop
actions taken elsewhere in the union. The conclusion is hard to escape that
a pan-European financial market and a pan-European central bank require a
pan-European banking system. Put slightly differently, a currency union that
centralises the lender of last resort for banks must unify its banking system.
Banks in Europe must become European banks.
Recent promising suggestions for movement on the banking front offer
quick progress because they would operate within the existing terms of
the currency union. First, they would unify banking rules now fragmented
along national boundaries. Second, common banking rules would centralise
responsibility in a common regulator, supervisor, deposit insurer and resolution
authority.
If adopted, these measures will break the adverse feedback between the
banks and the sovereign and other destructive links that are making the crisis
so severe. They will revive interbank lending and sovereign access to funding
markets. They will allow the Eurosystem to withdraw from its unconventional
and undesirable role as an intermediary. And they will restore confidence in
the single currency so that both institutional and retail depositors return to the
banks in their local markets. With day-to-day normality attained through a
unified currency and banking system, leaders will have the time they need to
finish building the broader institutional framework that the monetary union
needs for its long-term viability.

Summing up
Moving the global economy to a path of balanced, self-sustaining growth
remains a difficult and unfinished task. As we argue in this Report, a number of
interacting structural weaknesses are hindering the reforms required in
advanced and emerging market economies. Those hoping for quick fixes will
continue to be disappointed – there are none. And central banks – already
overburdened – cannot repair these weaknesses. All of this is understood by
advanced economy consumers who are reducing debts and are reluctant to
spend; it is understood by firms postponing investment and hiring; and it is
understood by investors wary of the weak and risky outlook – why else would

BIS 82nd Annual Report

7

they accept negative real interest rates on government bonds in many
advanced economies?
A look at the economy as a whole shows that three groups need to adjust
(Graph I.1): the financial sector needs to recognise losses and recapitalise;
governments must put fiscal trajectories on a sustainable path; and households
and firms need to deleverage. As things stand, each sector’s burdens and efforts
to adjust are worsening the position of the other two. The financial sector is
putting pressure on the government as well as slowing deleveraging by
households and firms. Governments, with their deteriorating creditworthiness
and need for fiscal consolidation, are hurting the ability of the other sectors
to right themselves. And as households and firms work to reduce their debt
levels, they hamper the recovery of governments and banks. All of these
linkages are creating a variety of vicious cycles.
Central banks find themselves in the middle of all of this, pushed to use
what power they have to contain the damage: pushed to directly fund the
financial sector and pushed to maintain extraordinarily low interest rates to
ease the strains on fiscal authorities, households and firms. This intense
pressure puts at risk the central banks’ price stability objective, their credibility
and, ultimately, their independence.

Vicious cycles and the burden on central banks

Graph I.1

8

BIS 82nd Annual Report

Breaking these vicious cycles, and thereby reducing the pressure on
central banks, is critical. Reaching this goal requires cleaning up and
strengthening banks at the same time as the size and riskiness of the financial
sector are brought under control. As we have urged in previous Reports, banks
must adjust balance sheets to accurately reflect the value of assets; they have
made progress on this score, but policymakers should move them along more
quickly. As they do, they must ensure speedy recapitalisation and see that
banks build capital buffers as conditions improve. More broadly, authorities
must implement agreed financial reforms, extend them to shadow banking
activities, and limit the size and significance of the financial sector so that the
failure of an institution does not ignite a crisis.
In the euro area, the noxious effects of the vicious cycles have reached an
advanced stage that reflects not only weaknesses seen elsewhere but also the
incomplete nature of financial integration in the currency union. Europe will
overcome this crisis if it can address both issues: attain structural adjustment,
fiscal consolidation and bank recapitalisation; and unify the framework for bank
regulation, supervision, deposit insurance and resolution. That approach will
decisively break the damaging feedback between weak sovereigns and weak
banks, delivering the financial normality that will allow time for further
development of the euro area’s institutional framework.
Overall, in Europe and elsewhere, the revitalisation of banks and the
moderation of the financial industry will end their destructive interaction with
the other sectors and clear the way for the next steps – fiscal consolidation and
the deleveraging of the private non-financial parts of the economy. Only then,
when balance sheets across all sectors are repaired, can we hope to move
back to a balanced growth path. Only then will virtuous cycles replace the
vicious ones now gripping the global economy.

II. The year in retrospect

The global economic recovery faltered over the past year. Rising commodity
prices and the intensification of the euro area sovereign debt crisis hit at the
time when unresolved structural weaknesses were still weighing on the global
economy. Increases in commodity prices had boosted inflation pressures in
fast-growing emerging market economies (EMEs), which prompted tighter
policies to moderate demand growth. In slow-growing advanced economies,
which had more spare capacity, higher commodity prices did not generate as
much inflationary pressure, but they undermined discretionary spending, which
was already subdued because households were paying down debts. The
intensification of the euro area crisis led to a global rise in risk aversion,
growing concerns about exposures to sovereign risk and ultimately to banking
sector stress. Following a new round of central bank interventions, there were
signs of stronger global expansion in the first few months of 2012. But with
sectoral and geographical imbalances still present in the world economy,
sustained growth remained elusive.

The global recovery faltered in 2011
The global economic recovery slowed in 2011. For the year as a whole, world
output grew by 3.9%, slightly slower than the average growth rate of the
decade prior to the financial crisis, but down significantly from 5.3% in 2010.
The pace of economic growth in advanced economies halved, to just 1.6%

(Graph II.1, left-hand panel). This reflected a significant weakening of the
economy in the United States and the United Kingdom and a sharp drop in
activity in Japan after the March 2011 earthquake, while growth in the euro
area as a whole was broadly unchanged.
Overall, the economic momentum in advanced economies was too weak
to generate a robust, self-sustaining recovery. The drag on private consumption
persisted. Unemployment remained high, or even increased further (Graph II.1,
centre panel). Falling property prices and high levels of debt continued to weigh
on household balance sheets in the mature economies hit hardest by the
financial crisis (see Chapter III). Household sector weakness also weighed on
business spending. Very weak public sector finances generally left no room for
further fiscal stimulus.
Emerging market economies grew by around 6% in 2011, with the pace of
growth moderating only slightly from 2010 (Graph II.1, left-hand panel).
Emerging Asia grew at 7.8%, led by China (9.2%) and India (7.2%); Latin
America grew at 4.5%. Growth in central and eastern Europe was broadly
unchanged at 5.3% for 2011 as a whole.
During the period under review, rapid growth in EMEs was in many cases
associated with signs of domestic overheating, including rising inflation, strong
credit growth and rising asset prices. Real credit continued to expand rapidly in
emerging Asia and Latin America, and real residential property prices rose
close to or above previous historical highs in major cities in China and Latin
America (Graph II.2). However, house price increases seem to have decelerated
more recently, and in some cases prices have even declined.
Reflecting the two-speed global expansion, external imbalances remained
wide. Although slightly lower than in 2010, global current account imbalances

remained at about 4% of world GDP, which is high by historical standards
(Graph II.1, right-hand panel, red line). Major advanced economies again
recorded sizeable current account deficits, with the notable exceptions of
Germany and Japan. Current account surpluses in emerging Asia, though
shrinking, remained sizeable. Latin America and central and eastern Europe
ran current account deficits. The net private capital flow into EMEs in 2011 was
still one of the strongest on record (Graph II.1, right-hand panel, green line).
Despite this, few emerging market currencies strengthened significantly against
the major currencies, and many depreciated.
The global recovery started to falter in the second quarter of the
year. At that time, indicators of business activity weakened significantly in
the United States, followed by those for EMEs; and in the second half of
2011, they deteriorated relatively sharply in Europe (Graph II.3, left-hand
panel). The prices of many growth-sensitive financial assets declined.
Major equity indices around the world fell, with the prices of cyclical stocks
declining relatively sharply (Graph II.3, centre and right-hand panels).
Corporate bond spreads generally rose, notably for low and sub-investment
grade ratings.
These developments reflected two major shocks which exposed
underlying weakness in the global economy associated with domestic and
external imbalances. First, commodity prices, which had already increased
significantly, remained high against the backdrop of strong demand from EMEs.
This eroded household income in the United States and other advanced
economies at a time of high unemployment and ongoing balance sheet repair.
In contrast, the main effect in a number of EMEs was higher inflation, which led
to policy tightening. Second, financial market investors became increasingly
wary about the credit quality of several euro area governments and the
exposure of European banks to sovereign credit risk. In the second half of the

12

BIS 82nd Annual Report

year, a sharp increase in global risk aversion, fiscal restraint and growing
deleveraging pressure on banks sapped demand.

High commodity prices had differential effects around the world
Commodity prices increased sharply until the end of the first quarter of 2011
(Graph II.4, left-hand panel). From their cyclical trough in mid-2010, agricultural
commodity prices doubled and energy and industrial metals prices rose by
more than 50%. Commodity prices then fell by 20–30% over the following six
months. From the end of the third quarter, however, energy prices rebounded
by around 20%, while agricultural commodity and industrial metals prices
were relatively stable. In 2011, all of these commodity prices remained
significantly above 2009–10 average levels.
A series of negative supply shocks contributed to the strong price
performance. Bad weather and poor harvests lifted agricultural commodity
prices in the second half of 2010 and early 2011. Similarly, political unrest in
the Middle East and North Africa in the early months of 2011 threatened to
disrupt oil supplies and drove up oil prices at that time. Modest increases in
output from the major oil-producing countries were not sufficient to stop this
trend. Oil prices were again driven higher in late 2011 and early 2012 by
geopolitical supply risks, this time related to Iran.
In addition to supply shocks, the pattern of global growth helped
keep commodity prices high. The integration of EMEs into global production
chains and their rapid economic development led to strong demand, especially
for energy and industrial metals, but also for agricultural commodities. As
Graph II.4 (centre panel) shows, GDP growth has outpaced gains in energy
efficiency in major EMEs during the past decade. With limited spare capacity,
the prices of oil and other commodities have been highly sensitive to changes

in growth expectations. In 2011, the associated commodity price movements
tended to act as a brake on the global recovery.
Strong commodity price gains in early 2011 and tight spare capacity lifted
headline inflation later in the year in EMEs. By mid-2011, average inflation in
these economies exceeded 6%, one of the highest rates of the past decade
(Graph II.4, right-hand panel). Inflation pressures were strong, as energy and
food account for a much larger share of consumption than in advanced
economies.
In advanced economies, rising energy prices also lifted headline inflation,
but spare capacity limited second-round effects. High energy prices
undermined the purchasing power of a household sector already burdened by
high unemployment and persistent balance sheet strains. In the United States,
for instance, households spent an additional 2% of their income on fuel. With
the unemployment rate above 9% and house and equity prices falling, US
consumer confidence declined sharply over the summer of 2011.
Partly as a result of these differential effects of commodity prices,
monetary policy responses in EMEs diverged from those in advanced
economies during the second and third quarters of 2011. Many EMEs tightened
monetary policy in response to rising inflation, while central banks in major
advanced economies either reversed previous tightening or loosened further
via extraordinary measures.

The euro area sovereign debt crisis intensified
In mid-2011, the euro area sovereign debt crisis intensified. In the preceding
months, government bond yields in countries on official support programmes –
Greece, Ireland and Portugal – had increased substantially (Graph II.5, lefthand panel), while those elsewhere had been much more stable. But then
yields for Italy and Spain, two much larger debtors, rose sharply and continued
to drift up for much of the second half of the year (Graph II.5, centre panel).
Furthermore, towards the end of 2011, yields on some of the highest-rated
euro area government bonds, including those of Austria, Belgium and France,
also increased, widening relative to those for Germany (Graph II.5, right-hand
panel).
Several factors contributed to this intensification. First, official lenders,
who were considering a second support package for Greece, demanded private
sector involvement in reducing Greece’s debt burden as a condition for
additional loans. This raised uncertainty among bondholders regarding their
treatment in any future euro area support programmes. Second, euro area
growth was beginning to falter, making it harder for governments in the region
to strengthen their financial positions in the near term. Third, the downgrade of
the United States by one rating agency heightened investors’ focus on fiscal
sustainability.
A series of policy initiatives aimed at addressing the crisis followed in the
second half of 2011. The ECB resumed purchasing euro area government
bonds in August. Italian and Spanish sovereign yields initially declined sharply,
but resumed their climb after just a few weeks, reflecting market concerns

about the governments’ ability to implement the fiscal consolidation measures
agreed with European partners. Expansion of the potential uses of the euro
area stabilisation fund in July and of its lending capacity in October appeared
to have even less durable effects on yields. Towards the end of 2011, however,
the fiscal compact to limit structural budget deficits ushered in more significant
and sustained reductions in yields (see Chapter V).
The sovereign debt crisis heightened risk aversion in global financial
markets. Investors adjusted their portfolios in recognition of greater sovereign
risks. For example, when the volatility of portfolios increased in August,
international investors started selling emerging market bonds and equities – a
shift that continued for much of the second half of 2011 (Graph II.6, left-hand
panel). Demand for equities and corporate bonds in advanced economies also
declined, leading to lower prices and higher spreads, especially for lower-rated
bonds (Graph II.6, centre panel).
Some financial assets benefited from safe haven flows. These included
Australian, Canadian, German, Nordic, Swiss, UK and US government bonds,
whose yields dropped to extremely low levels by historical standards during the
second half of 2011 (Graph II.6, right-hand panel). Such was this demand that
yields on some shorter-dated bonds became negative for a time. The yen and
the Swiss franc also appreciated markedly as a result of portfolio adjustments
in favour of safe haven assets. To counter these trends, the Japanese
authorities sold yen in the currency markets, with sales reportedly reaching a
record volume on one day, while the Swiss National Bank capped the value of
the franc against the euro.

Many advanced and emerging economies tightened their fiscal policies
(Graph II.7, left-hand panel). While advanced economies tightened policies
in response to fiscal sustainability concerns, emerging economies did so
rather to contain domestic demand. Euro area countries experienced the
sharpest tightening. In Greece, Ireland and Portugal, official support
programmes also prescribed substantial fiscal tightening that required deficit
cuts of several percentage points of GDP. Large euro area economies such as

France, Italy and Spain also tightened their fiscal stance substantially. Outside
the euro area, the United Kingdom continued to rein in its budget deficit, under
a negative outlook from two of the major rating agencies. The United States
also tightened its fiscal stance somewhat despite the extension of temporary
payroll tax cuts and supplementary unemployment benefits during 2011 and
2012. Japan was the only major advanced economy to loosen its fiscal stance,
in order to implement post-earthquake reconstruction expenditures. A number
of EMEs also tightened fiscal policy moderately in order to contain domestic
demand. However, this fiscal consolidation does not seem to have been
systematically associated with weaker economic growth in 2011 (Graph II.7,
right-hand panel).

European bank funding and credit supply declined
The euro area sovereign debt crisis put European banks under growing
stress in the second half of 2011. This reflected uncertainty about banks’
exposure to sovereign credit risk and questions about governments’ ability
to support weak banks. European banks’ credit default swap (CDS) premia
rose sharply, as their perceived creditworthiness deteriorated (Graph II.8, lefthand panel). Bank equity prices plummeted in countries where the value of
sovereign debt had fallen most, and declined sharply elsewhere in the euro
area (Graph II.8, centre panel). But the crisis also affected banks elsewhere, as
shown by the behaviour of equity prices (Graph II.8, right-hand panel) as well
as of CDS premia.
Euro area bank funding conditions quickly worsened in autumn 2011.
Depositors began to withdraw funds from banks in Spain and, to a lesser
extent, Italy, adding to continued deposit outflows from banks in Greece and
Ireland. Markets for unsecured debt essentially closed for many euro area
banks (Graph II.9, left-hand panel). And the cost of borrowing in the interbank
market increased, significantly for euros, but also for dollars and sterling
(Graph II.9, centre panel). Dollar funding for euro area banks was in short

supply partly because US money market funds cut their exposures (Graph II.9,

Growing deleveraging pressure led to a rising home bias in euro area
bank lending. On balance, euro area banks tightened lending standards for
firms in the final quarter of 2011, more sharply than in the United States
(Graph II.10, left-hand panel). While the growth rate of credit from euro area

panel), their credit to other regions weakened more substantially. Between the
middle and end of 2011, foreign claims of euro area banks on borrowers in
EMEs fell by 12%: 4% in Africa and the Middle East, 20% in Asia and the
Pacific, 13% in emerging Europe and 9% in Latin America and the Caribbean
(Graph II.10, right-hand panel). Cuts were especially sharp for loans with high
risk weights, such as leveraged loans or project finance, and for loans that
often require dollar funding, such as aircraft and ship leases or trade financing.
That said, to a considerable extent, other forms of financing substituted
for euro area bank lending. In some cases, this included loans from other
large international lenders (Graph II.10, right-hand panel). Some Australian,
Japanese and UK banks that already had a focus on emerging Asia increased
lending in the region. Domestic lenders also boosted credit, notably in Latin
America, although less so in emerging Europe, where western European banks
had a large market share. In addition, some larger corporate borrowers turned
to bond markets, where gross issuance increased by almost 30% in the final
quarter of 2011.

Global growth remained fragile in early 2012
Economic weakness and growing strains in global financial markets towards
the end of 2011 triggered a new round of central bank support measures (see
Chapter IV). The Federal Reserve committed to buy an additional $400 billion
of long-dated US Treasury securities, funded by sales of shorter-term notes.
It also announced that it planned to keep its short-term policy rate
at exceptionally low levels until at least the end of 2014. The Bank of Japan
and the Bank of England further increased the size of their asset-buying
programmes. The central banks of Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, the
Philippines and Turkey also loosened monetary policy. In December 2011, the
ECB announced offerings of funding to euro area banks for three years, against
an expanded set of collateral. Major central banks had already agreed to
reduce the prices of currency swap lines between themselves, allowing them to
exchange euros for dollars with banks more cheaply than previously.
These measures triggered significant improvements in bank funding
markets (Graph II.9) and financial markets more broadly. The ECB’s two
auctions of three-year funding in December 2011 and February 2012 allowed
euro area banks to prefund much of their unsecured debt redemptions due by
2014. In addition, banks used some of the cash to purchase assets, including
euro area sovereign bonds. The yields on these securities declined significantly
(Graph II.5). More generally, additional policy support helped to boost a wide
range of asset prices during the first few months of 2012. The completion of an
orderly restructuring of Greek debt in March also removed a downside risk to
asset prices.
Global economic activity seemed to recover somewhat in the first quarter
of 2012. In the United States, the unemployment rate declined, hand in hand
with a significant increase in consumer confidence and spending. In Japan,
machinery orders and corporate investment lifted business activity, as the
economy continued to rebound from the effects of the March 2011 earthquake.

Following a contraction in the last quarter of 2011, GDP in the euro area
stabilised. And activity in several EMEs increased at a faster pace, notably in
Latin America and Southeast Asia.
That said, sustainable economic growth remained elusive, and economic
activity fell in the second quarter. In April and May, a number of economic
indicators for the United States were weaker than expected and employment
growth slowed again. Indicators of activity in China weakened significantly from
the start of 2012, although this partly reflected a response to measures aimed
at bringing growth down to more sustainable levels. Output growth also slowed
markedly in Brazil and India, notably in the agricultural and manufacturing
sectors. In the euro area, output appeared to be contracting again in the
second quarter of 2012.
Financial risks in the euro area also intensified in the second quarter of
2012, driven primarily by concerns about the post-election policy orientation of
Greece. Deposit and other capital outflows increased from countries perceived
as vulnerable to a further deepening of the crisis. In particular, deposit
withdrawals from banks in Greece reportedly accelerated in May. These banks
had already lost around one third of their foreign deposits and one quarter of
their domestic non-financial deposits (Graph II.11, left-hand panel). Foreign
depositors had also withdrawn funds from banks in Ireland, Italy, Portugal and
Spain, while domestic deposits had been more stable (Graph II.11, centre
panel). In contrast, deposits at banks in Germany and the Netherlands
increased significantly in the first quarter of 2012 (Graph II.11, right-hand
panel). Similarly, estimates of overall capital flows show net private outflows
from Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain and inflows into Germany and
the Netherlands (Graph II.11, red lines).

BIS 82nd Annual Report

III. Rebalancing growth

Five years after the onset of the subprime crisis, global economic growth is still
unbalanced. Among the advanced economies still confronting the fallout of
a major credit and housing bust are, most notably, Ireland, Spain, the United
Kingdom and the United States. The slump in the construction and other real
estate-related sectors has been particularly acute in Ireland and Spain. These
sectoral imbalances are likely to have significant and long-lasting effects on
employment. As households and firms struggle to service their debts, the
banking systems of these countries are staggering under a high volume of nonperforming loans. Credit ratios and debt service costs are also rising in several
countries that escaped a housing bust, although the proportion of troubled
loans remains low. Further, some economies that have relied heavily on exportled growth are also likely to face challenges soon.
In this chapter, we first turn to the structural imbalances that must be
corrected before economies can return to a path of steady growth. Then we
focus on private sector debt (see Chapter V for a discussion of public debt)
both in countries that experienced a home-grown financial crisis and in others
that did not. A final section discusses policy implications.

Structural adjustment
Growth models in many countries will need to change. Rising property prices
led to rapid growth in construction and other real estate-related activities in
some countries. These imbalances need to be resolved if these economies are
to grow sustainably. The collapse of the housing sector has also revealed longstanding structural weaknesses, such as rigid labour or product rules, that
seem insignificant in good times but hinder adjustment when the economy is hit
by a shock.
Other economies have specialised in exports to countries that are likely to
grow less rapidly in the future. They face a different set of challenges. Some
are highly competitive, at least in certain individual sectors, but they are
nonetheless vulnerable to a growth slowdown in their trading partners.
Unemployment after the housing bust
Unemployment remains high in many advanced economies, not only those hit
by sovereign debt concerns (see Chapter II). One reason for the persistence of
high unemployment is sectoral imbalances built up pre-crisis, the full extent of
which has only now become apparent.1 During the housing boom, the
construction, real estate and finance sectors strongly outgrew the rest of the
economy. In Ireland, for instance, construction increased its share of total

employment from 8.6% to 13% between 1997 and 2007; in Spain, the share
increased from 10% to 14%. In the United States, by contrast, this measure barely
moved during the same period, inching up from 4.5% to 5.2%. But the overgrown
Irish and Spanish construction sectors unravelled very quickly during the Great
Recession, with their share of employment slumping below 1997 levels. High
unemployment rates in these countries show that the laid-off workers have
generally not found other sources of employment, reflecting how the reallocation
of resources across sectors can be difficult. This can slow the recovery.
Imbalances tend to reveal themselves when times turn bad. A good
measure of the sectoral imbalances that developed during the boom is therefore
the concentration of job and output losses in particular industries during the
subsequent downturn, as industries that have grown beyond a sustainable size
tend to contract most. For instance, job losses after the financial crisis were
much more concentrated in particular sectors in Ireland and Spain than in
Germany or Japan (Graph III.1, left-hand panel), which did not experience
home-grown housing and construction booms but “imported” the crisis through
trade and financial channels. In fact, the job losses experienced by Ireland and
Spain during the Great Recession were much more concentrated in particular
sectors than those of past downturns (the dashed lines across the bar chart
indicate the sample quartiles). The experience of the United States is
somewhere in between that of the two groups of countries.
The concentration of output losses (Graph III.1, right-hand panel) provides
a somewhat different view from that of job losses. Some of the countries
experiencing highly concentrated job losses, such as Ireland, also saw a highly
concentrated drop in output, but others did not. In fact, at less than 0.4, the
correlation between sectoral imbalances computed using employment and
output is quite low. For example, some countries such as Germany or Norway,

where the drop in employment was not particularly concentrated, experienced
a severely unbalanced downturn based on output. Conversely, the output drop
in Spain was more uniformly spread across sectors than were employment
losses.
Large sectoral imbalances frequently entail a steeper rise in unemployment
during the downturn (Graph III.2, left-hand panel). In fact, the sectoral
concentration of job losses explains the increase in unemployment even better
than the magnitude of the output drop (Okun’s law).2 For example, unemployment
increased by 8 percentage points more in Spain than in Japan between 2007
and 2009. According to our estimates, around 70% of this difference, or
5.6 percentage points, can be explained by the more unbalanced pattern of the
downturn in Spain. On average, cross-country differences in sectoral imbalances
account for 60% of cross-country differences in changes in unemployment
during recessions while the decline in GDP accounts for less than 20%.
Large sectoral imbalances lead not only to larger increases in
unemployment during recessions but also to slower declines in unemployment
during the subsequent expansions (Graph III.2, right-hand panel).3 In fact,
unemployment continues to increase in countries with high imbalances even
after GDP starts to recover. This should not come as a surprise, given the
difficulties in reallocating resources across sectors. A high concentration of job
losses during the downturn is followed by a slower reduction in unemployment
in the first two years of the recovery, even after controlling for GDP growth.
For example, Spain, which with Ireland experienced the most concentrated job

2
This result is obtained by estimating a regression for a cross section of OECD countries where the
change in the unemployment rate during the downturn depends on both the change in GDP and the
sectoral concentration of job losses during this period. It suggests that the increase in unemployment
during a downturn depends not so much on the depth of the downturn, but on how unbalanced it is.

We define the expansion period as the two years after the end of a downturn.

losses, also saw the largest increase in unemployment during the subsequent
expansion. These estimates also suggest that, everything else being equal,
unemployment in the United States would have declined 1.3 percentage points
more rapidly in the two years after the recent downturn if the country’s sectoral
balance of job losses had resembled that of Germany.
The impact of sectoral imbalances on unemployment is particularly large
in severe recessions and weak recoveries (Graph III.3). This suggests that
output growth has only an indirect role in explaining unemployment during
recessions, by raising the cost of sectoral imbalances. In expansions, by
contrast, GDP growth has both a direct and an indirect role in explaining
unemployment. Higher GDP growth in expansions leads to a sharper drop in
unemployment even if sectoral imbalances are large. Imbalances matter only
in low-growth expansions, when they slow the reduction in unemployment.
A severe downturn and an unprecedented level of sectoral imbalances
therefore represent the worst possible mix for labour market developments in
the coming years. Unfortunately, this is the prospect that Ireland, Spain and the
United States now face. These countries all experienced an unbalanced
downturn followed by a weak recovery, which helps to explain why
unemployment has remained so high. Looking forward, this combination of
large sectoral imbalances and a tepid recovery could set the scene for a
prolonged period of high unemployment.
Reliance on external demand
Many economies are forecast to grow slowly for some time. As exports to these
economies will not provide the same boost to output as in the past, countries
that have relied on export-driven growth will need to shift to a more domesticoriented model. For instance, the left-hand panel of Graph III.4 shows that only
two of 28 representative emerging and advanced economies can expect their

24

BIS 82nd Annual Report

trading partners to grow more rapidly in 2011–15 than in 2003–07.4 All the
other economies will face a (sometimes significant) deterioration in the growth
of their export markets if growth forecasts prove accurate. Countries such as
Russia or India could experience considerable headwinds if growth slows as
expected in their trading partners (Ukraine and Turkey for Russia, Middle East
markets for India) during 2011–15. These headwinds could also be significant
for most European countries, which trade heavily with each other and where
growth forecasts have been sharply cut back.
The greater an economy’s export dependency, the more it will suffer from
declining growth in its export markets. The right-hand panel of Graph III.4 thus
plots the expected drop in external demand growth (illustrated in the left-hand
panel) against the average share of exports in GDP during 2003–07. Of course,
the impact on economic growth will also depend on the import content of
exports, for which only limited data are available. Two country groupings
emerge from this diagram.
A first group of countries comprises small open economies with a large
share of exports in GDP – more than 60% – that are expected to suffer a large
drop in their trading partners’ growth. This group includes Belgium, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, the Netherlands and Thailand. For example, around one
fifth of Thai exports goes to countries where growth is expected to drop by no
less than 2 percentage points in 2011–15 as compared with 2003–07.

A second group includes countries that should be relatively immune
to external developments, either because they are large economies where
exports represent only a small share of total GDP – such as the United States,
Japan or Brazil – or because growth in their external demand is expected to
fall only moderately – these include Canada, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey. In
particular, Canada, Mexico and the United States could escape many of the ill
effects of sluggish growth elsewhere because they trade significantly with each
other and their own growth is expected by many analysts to be relatively robust.
China and the largest western European countries (France, Germany, Italy
and the United Kingdom) are located somewhere between these two groups.
They are likely to face a significant drop (of around 1 percentage point) in the
growth of their trading partners, but their exports represent no more than
around 40% of their GDP, which will limit the fallout from slower external
demand growth. Among these countries, Germany may be the most vulnerable.

Debt sustainability
Unsustainable debts were ultimately the source of the financial crisis, and there
is little evidence that the situation has become much better since. Measures of
debt sustainability have not improved much in the countries at the heart of the
financial crisis and have worsened in many other economies.
House prices in Ireland, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States
– countries that experienced a housing boom and bust – are well below precrisis levels, and many households and firms are struggling to repay debt
contracted during the boom.5 Aggregate figures suggest that households in
Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States have made some progress
in deleveraging. In Ireland, debt-to-income ratios have remained high, since
sizeable debt repayments have been offset by an equivalent drop in disposable
income. The non-financial corporate sectors in Ireland, Spain and the United
Kingdom have made much less progress in deleveraging. In the United States,
the indebtedness of the non-financial corporate sector remained rather stable
during the housing boom, suggesting that there is no generalised need to
deleverage after the bust.
That said, aggregate debt-to-income ratios may paint too benign a picture.
Finer data for the United States suggest that aggregate deleveraging did not
come about through writedowns of unsustainable debt.6 Rather, it was driven
primarily by a fall in the number of households increasing their mortgage debt
(eg through home equity extraction) and by a sharp reduction in new mortgage
borrowing. Meagre borrowing by first-time buyers entails weak activity in the
housing market, which in turn reflects the overhang of unsold houses. In fact,
the share of households reporting that they were somewhat likely or very likely

5
See BIS, 81st Annual Report, June 2011, pp 24–7, for a discussion of deleveraging in the private nonfinancial sector.
6
Writedowns were large, but they did not translate into a one-to-one reduction in debt because
properties are often remortgaged after being sold off. For this reason, aggregated data do not reveal the
contribution of charge-offs to changes in household debt.

26

BIS 82nd Annual Report

to be unable to meet their mortgage payments over the next year has barely
fallen. This shows that progress in deleveraging has been limited.7 We are not
aware of similar data for Ireland, Spain or the United Kingdom, but the small
number of houses bought and sold suggests that the picture is not too different.
The lower writedowns on household debt in these countries than in the United
States tell a similar story.
While the stock of debt to GDP has fallen in the four countries that
experienced a housing bust together with a financial crisis, debt-to-GDP ratios
have continued to rise in many other economies (Graph III.5, top panel). Credit
has burgeoned in several major emerging market economies in recent years.
For instance, real credit grew by almost 20% annually over the last three
years in China, although it has been slowing recently. Real credit in Turkey,
Argentina, Indonesia and Brazil has also far outpaced GDP, and credit growth
has even accelerated during the past three years. But it is not only in emerging

market economies that credit is growing rapidly. Households in several of
the advanced countries that escaped a housing or credit boom but whose
banking systems are nevertheless under stress (eg France, Italy and Switzerland)
have taken on substantial additional debt, much of it to finance real estate. Only
in Germany have households continued to reduce their debt-to-income ratios.
Rapid credit growth is not necessarily bad. Financial systems in many
emerging economies are still relatively underdeveloped, and many households
and firms are shut out of formal credit markets. Thus, rapid credit expansion
could reflect financial development as much as financial excess. And even in
advanced economies, rapid credit growth need not by itself herald the onset of
financial vulnerabilities.
That said, financial deepening takes time: credit growth that overwhelms
the capacity of financial institutions to screen and process loans may result in
bad lending decisions and financial stress even when the share of credit in
GDP is low. Similarly, a bloated financial sector can also suck in more than its
share of talent, hampering the development of other sectors.8
Unfortunately, there is no conclusive way to distinguish between financial
imbalances and financial deepening involving rapid but sustainable credit
growth. But credit growth that is significantly above its long-term trend, opening
up a so-called credit gap, often foreshadows a financial crisis. At present,
several (but not all) of the countries experiencing rapid credit growth have
credit gaps in excess of 6%, levels that in the past have often presaged serious
financial distress (Graph III.5, bottom panel).9
Asset prices too look increasingly frothy in many emerging economies. In
some important local Brazilian markets, real estate prices have almost doubled
since the onset of the subprime crisis. Appreciation of real estate assets in
China is even more pronounced, with land prices in Beijing and Shanghai
increasing almost fivefold since 2004. Other local markets have not been so
bullish, although prices have risen substantially in many cases (see Chapter II).
In all these emerging markets, imbalances seem to be building up mainly within
certain regions or market segments (eg high-end housing in China). Even so, it
does not necessarily follow that any potential bust will be any less damaging
for the financial system if mortgages are also concentrated in these areas.
Measures of debt service cost also suggest that high debt levels could
be a problem. The fraction of GDP that households and firms in Brazil, China,
India and Turkey are allocating to debt service stands at its highest level since
the late 1990s, or close to it. This measure could move even higher should
interest rates rise from their current low levels (Graph III.6).10 Debt tends to

trend as calculated with a Hodrick-Prescott filter with a high smoothing parameter. For details, see C Borio and

10 Our measures for debt service ratios represent estimates using relatively imprecise information on
loan maturity and average interest rates paid on loans. For countries which do not publish these data, we
multiply the current debt ratio by the weighted average of short-term interest rates. This shortcut is quite
effective in explaining the debt service costs of countries for which better data are available.

or close to, their highest levels in 30 years. Much of the debt in the countries
shown in Graph III.6 has relatively short maturities (the main exceptions
being mortgage debt in the United States and, to a lesser extent, France and
Germany). Thus, debt service costs could rise substantially if interest rates
were to return to the levels seen in recent interest cycles, as indicated by the
dotted lines in Graph III.6.
Rapid credit growth in the emerging markets and advanced economies that
are experiencing a credit boom has not so far resulted in a significant increase
in bad loans. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans in these countries
generally remains around or below the pre-crisis average (Graph III.7). This is
obviously not true for the countries that are facing high spreads, such as Greece,
Ireland, Italy and Spain. Nor does it hold for some countries in emerging
Europe, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Russia. That said,
experience has shown that non-performing loans are, at best, contemporaneous
signs of financial distress; they do not serve as leading indicators.11

Policy challenges
This chapter has discussed three structural issues that seem to be preventing
the global economy from embarking on a path of sustainable growth. The first
is the legacy of sectoral imbalances built up during the pre-crisis housing and
credit booms. The second is an unhealthy dependence on exports to countries
that are likely to grow more slowly over the coming years. And the third is
unsustainable levels of debt, be it in the form of debt overhangs in countries
that experienced a property boom and bust, or of credit and property

11 See C Borio and M Drehmann, “Towards an operational framework for financial stability: ‘fuzzy’
measurement and its consequences”, BIS Working Papers, no 284, June 2009.

30

BIS 82nd Annual Report

expansions in economies that escaped the previous crisis. In this section, we
will discuss the challenges posed by these three factors.
First, housing and credit booms lead to a misallocation of resources that
can take a long time to resolve. Overgrown construction and other propertyrelated sectors need to shrink, which tends to lift unemployment. Propping up
contracting sectors may provide short-run relief but can hamper long-term
growth by slowing the efficient reallocation of resources or adding to public
debt. Identifying which sectors will be the drivers of future growth is hard, if not
impossible, although large current account deficits before the crisis12 suggest
that, in some countries, a rebalancing towards sectors producing tradable
goods or services is desirable. The lifting of restrictions on product and service
markets should help to promote this rebalancing.13 Social safety nets are
important in smoothing the transition, but in many countries they face serious
strains because of rickety public finances (see Chapter V).
Second, the replacement of export-led growth with a more balanced model
requires major structural adjustments that cannot be implemented overnight.
The most promising starting point is to remove any distorted incentives in the
economy that favour exports over production for the domestic market. The most
obvious such distortions are artificially undervalued exchange rates and (direct
or indirect) export subsidies.14 Less obvious, but probably no less important,
are excessive (or simply inefficient) regulations that constrain domestic activity.
However, fuelling credit and asset prices is the wrong way to stimulate
domestic absorption, creating different but equally damaging distortions.
The final challenge is to deal with unsustainable debt. High levels of
problem loans in the countries at the epicentre of the crisis show clearly that
a significant part of the debt burden is unsustainable. This hinders growth
through at least two mechanisms. First, households in the countries that
suffered a housing bust have stepped up their saving rates, which will depress
growth until a new equilibrium is reached. Second, the impaired balance sheets
of financial institutions limit their ability to provide new credit to profitable
projects (see Chapter IV). The challenge is to provide incentives for banks and
other credit suppliers to recognise losses fully and write down debt (see box).
Cleaning up bank balance sheets is also important to ensure a smooth flow of
credit to the economy, especially when a sizeable reallocation of resources is
required across sectors.15 Supporting this process may well call for the use of
public sector balance sheets.
Unsustainable debt could also become problematic in some countries that
are experiencing historically rapid credit growth. Forestalling this will require

12

See BIS, 81st Annual Report, June 2011, Chapter III.

13 See OECD, Economic Policy Reforms: Going for Growth 2012, 2012, for a list of obstacles to the
sectoral reallocation of resources.
14 Needless to say, administrative measures are not the only way to distort exchange rates. Well
intended countercyclical monetary policy may result in equally artificial exchange rates.

Reducing household debt to a sustainable level
We argue in the main text that the recovery cannot become self-sustaining until the debt of households
is brought down to a level that can actually be repaid. Merely waiting for the problem to resolve itself
as the economy recovers would be very costly. In this box, we sketch some ways in which authorities
could encourage the restructuring of mortgage borrowing, which accounts for the bulk of unsustainable
debt.
The first step authorities can take is to induce lenders to recognise losses and revalue loans at
market prices. This will reduce the incentive to evergreen lending by rolling over amounts due, and it
will also cut the additional cost to lenders of debt relief or foreclosure.
The second step is to create incentives for lenders to restructure loans so that borrowers have a
realistic chance of repaying their debt. Experience shows that lenders tend to be reluctant to restructure
loans even if provisions cover all or most of the costs of the associated charge-offs. Instead, they often
prefer to wait until they are forced by the borrower’s delinquency to foreclose on the collateral property.
In the United States, 1.9 million houses were in foreclosure in early 2012, only slightly fewer than the
peak of over 2 million in late 2009. Foreclosure may be optimal from an individual lender’s point of
view, but it entails important social costs. Foreclosed houses tend to sell at a steep discount to the
prices obtained through voluntary sales, in part because of vandalism and other types of degradation
pending foreclosure. Large-scale foreclosures may also drive down house prices in the surrounding
area, thus undermining the viability of loans that would otherwise have been sound.
There are several reasons for lenders’ reluctance to restructure loans and provide debt relief. First,
some loans may recover even after serious delinquency, and this upside is eliminated once the loan is
restructured. This could be an especially significant disincentive to restructuring in legal systems where
the lender has recourse to the borrower’s future income as well as to the mortgaged property. Second,
it is not easy to establish what level of debt is actually sustainable, particularly when the trends of both
property prices and household incomes are uncertain. As a consequence, many restructured loans
subsequently go into default. Third, debt relief may encourage further delinquency in the loan
portfolio if lenders are seen as being soft on problem borrowers. Fourth, the lender’s managers are
obliged to protect the value of the bank’s asset base. Disregarding that fiduciary duty may expose them
to litigation.
Authorities can change the incentives for lenders to restructure loans in several ways. One
frequently used option is to set up an asset management company to buy up loans at attractive prices,
ie slightly above current market valuations. Alternatively, authorities can subsidise lenders or guarantee
the restructured debt when lenders renegotiate loans. In some cases, changes in the legal framework
may be needed to eliminate technical obstacles to debt restructuring.
Inducing lenders to recognise losses and incentivising them to restructure loans will impose
fiscal costs (at least in the short term) and could create moral hazard. For instance, if households that
borrowed heavily are offered better terms than those that were more prudent, this could encourage
reckless borrowing in the future. That concern could be addressed by stricter regulation of mortgage
lending practices. The fiscal costs of helping households to cut their debt burden can be substantial, but
they may represent a productive use of public funds and one that could support self-sustaining growth
over time. Loan restructuring and the provision of debt relief in a way that keeps foreclosures to a minimum
also shore up the banking system, thus helping to break the link from weak banks to the creditworthiness
of the sovereign (see Chapter V). In the long term, the establishment of an asset management company
could even benefit the public purse directly, as has happened in many previous episodes.
 See J Campbell, S Giglio and P Pathak, “Forced sales and house prices”, American Economic Review, no 101(5), 2011,
pp 2108–31.     See M Adelino, K Gerardi and P Willen, “Why don’t lenders renegotiate more home mortgages? Redefaults,
self-cures and securitization”, NBER Working Papers, no 15159, July 2009. By contrast, the securitised status of many US loans
does not appear to be a major obstacle to renegotiation.     See L Laeven and F Valencia, “Systemic banking crises: a new
database”, IMF Working Papers, no WP/08/224, 2008, for examples of asset management companies.     See IMF, World
Economic Outlook, April 2012, Chapter 3: “Dealing with household debt”, for a discussion of some loan restructuring
programmes.

two things. First, the rate of credit growth should be held to a level that does
not overwhelm the banking system’s capacity to undertake proper screening of

32

BIS 82nd Annual Report

creditworthiness. Second, banks and other financial institutions need to be put
on a sound enough footing to withstand temporary upsurges in bad assets. At
a time when interest rates are low in major advanced economies and emerging
markets are experiencing large capital inflows, monetary policy faces a
dilemma. Low interest rates will clearly not slow a credit boom, but high interest
rates may attract even more capital flows and thus fuel a domestic credit boom.
One way out is to accompany higher interest rates with macroprudential
measures such as higher capital ratios or tighter loan-to-value ratios. And,
even if these tools fail to slow credit growth significantly, they should at least
reinforce the financial system against the consequences of a credit bust.
This chapter has discussed structural problems and structural solutions.
We have not touched upon the crisis of confidence that besets many
economies, particularly in the euro area. Fixing structural problems during a
confidence crisis is both more difficult and more important than it is in better
times. It is more difficult because unemployment is already high and public
funding that could mitigate short-term adjustment costs is scarcer. It is more
important because confidence is unlikely to return until authorities have got to
grips with structural weaknesses.

IV. The limits of monetary policy

In the major advanced economies, policy rates remain very low and central
bank balance sheets continue to expand in the wake of new rounds of balance
sheet policy measures. These extraordinarily accommodative monetary
conditions are being transmitted to emerging market economies in the form of
undesirable exchange rate and capital flow volatility. As a consequence, the
stance of monetary policy is accommodative globally.
Central banks’ decisive actions to contain the crisis have played a crucial
role in preventing a financial meltdown and in supporting faltering economies.
But there are limits to what monetary policy can do. It can provide liquidity, but
it cannot solve underlying solvency problems. Failing to appreciate the limits of
monetary policy can lead to central banks being overburdened, with potentially
serious adverse consequences. Prolonged and aggressive monetary
accommodation has side effects that may delay the return to a self-sustaining
recovery and may create risks for financial and price stability globally. The
growing gap between what central banks are expected to deliver and what they
can actually deliver could in the longer term undermine their credibility and
operational autonomy.
This chapter first reviews the main monetary policy measures taken over
the past year by central banks in advanced and emerging market economies
and provides an assessment of the global monetary policy stance. It then
explores the scope and limitations of prolonged and aggressive monetary
accommodation: the implications for effective balance sheet repair in advanced
economies; the consequences of global monetary policy spillovers to emerging
market economies; and the resulting longer-term risks for central banks.

Monetary policy in advanced and emerging market economies
Monetary policy measures taken over the past year
Between June 2011 and the beginning of June 2012, central banks halted or
reversed the tightening of policy rates that had taken place in many advanced
and emerging market economies in the first half of 2011 (Graph IV.1). This
occurred against the backdrop of weakening growth and receding inflationary
pressures. The European Central Bank (ECB) cut its main refinancing rate
back to 1%, while allowing the euro area overnight rate to fall to a level close to
its deposit facility rate, which was reduced to 0.25%. In the other major
advanced economies, policy rates stayed at their effective lower bound. In the
emerging market economies, the Central Bank of Brazil cut rates by 400 basis
points starting in August last year, the Reserve Bank of India lowered policy
rates by 50 basis points in April 2012, and the People’s Bank of China cut its
benchmark one-year loan rate by 25 basis points in early June. Some emerging

market central banks, specifically those of China and India, also reduced
reserve requirements.
As of early June 2012, markets expected further policy rate cuts in the
euro area, China and Brazil and unchanged rates in the United States, United
Kingdom, Japan and India in the course of 2012 (Graph IV.1, dots). Forward
curves indicated that markets were pricing in low policy rates in the major
advanced economies for the next two years (Graph IV.2). These expectations
reflected at least in part central banks’ forward guidance. In its statement in
April 2012, the Federal Open Market Committee said that it expects the federal
funds rate to remain at exceptionally low levels at least until late 2014 given the
macroeconomic outlook.
Central banks in the major advanced economies embarked on new rounds
of balance sheet policy measures during the period under review. The Federal
Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan augmented existing or
launched new large-scale asset purchase programmes aimed at lowering longterm interest rates and financial risk premia more generally in order to bring
about additional monetary easing. In September 2011, the Federal Reserve
launched the Maturity Extension Program (MEP) under which the proceeds
from selling $400 billion of shorter-term Treasury securities by the end of June
2012 are used to buy longer-term Treasury securities. The Bank of England and
the Bank of Japan increased their asset purchase programmes over the period,
by £125 billion and ¥30 trillion, respectively.
The large-scale asset purchases implemented by these three central
banks from late 2008 considerably increased their outright holdings of

longer-term securities, in particular of government bonds (Graph IV.3, first
three panels). This contributed to the fall of long-term interest rates to very
low levels (Graph IV.4, left-hand panel).1
The ECB’s balance sheet policy measures during the period under
review were targeted at addressing disruptions in the euro area’s monetary
transmission mechanism arising from deteriorating government and bank
funding conditions. Following rapid increases in bond yields for some euro area
sovereigns (Graph IV.4, right-hand panel), the ECB reactivated purchases of
government bonds under the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) in August
2011. In order to address rapidly worsening bank funding conditions in euro area
markets, the ECB conducted two three-year longer-term refinancing operations
(LTROs), one in December 2011 and one in February 2012, with full allotment.
At the same time, it widened the range of collateral assets accepted in
refinancing operations and halved the required reserve ratio. All this relieved
funding pressures for banks and sovereigns, but only temporarily. Beginning
in March 2012, intra-euro area strains intensified again (see Chapter II).
As a consequence of these measures, the size and maturity of the assets
on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet increased significantly (Graph IV.3, last
panel). By the end of May 2012, the outright holdings of securities purchased
under the SMP stood at E212 billion, while the outright holdings of covered
bonds purchased under the covered bond purchase programmes were around
E69 billion. The total allotment under the two three-year LTROs was around
E1 trillion, leading to a net increase in the Eurosystem’s balance sheet of

lowered the US 10-year bond yield by more than 150 basis points by the end of 2011.

The Japanese authorities and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) intervened
in foreign exchange markets in response to strong appreciations of
their currencies in the context of safe haven flows. Japan’s foreign
currency reserve holdings increased by $185 billion in 2011, to a total of

exchange reserve holdings surged by more than 25% over the previous
month as pressure on the minimum Swiss franc per euro exchange rate
heightened.
In emerging market economies, specifically in Asia, authorities slowed
down the accumulation of foreign currency reserves during 2011 (Table IV.1).
This reflected in part diminishing upward pressure on exchange rates in the
second half of the year, as rising global risk aversion induced an outflow of
portfolio capital (see Graph II.6, left-hand panel). However, the total foreign
currency reserve holdings in emerging Asia remained very high, amounting to
$5 trillion, or half of the world’s total, in December 2011. At over $3 trillion, a
little under one third of global foreign exchange reserves at that time was held
by China.

constant c is defined as the sum of the average inflation rate and real GDP growth since Q1 2000. π* is computed as the average level
of the inflation rate since Q1 2000. Taylor rules were computed for all combinations of three measures of inflation (headline, core and
consensus headline forecasts) and measures of the output gap obtained from three different ways to compute potential output
(HP filter, linear trend and unobserved components). The graph shows the mean, maximum and minimum Taylor rate of all nine

were around zero globally. They remained firmly negative in the core advanced
economies. In emerging market economies, they rose slightly, but still look very
low against the background of these economies’ trend output growth rate over
the past several years.
Interest rates implied by the Taylor rule, which links policy rates in a
mechanical way to inflation and the output gap, present a very similar picture
(Graph IV.6). True, an assessment based on this benchmark is inevitably
complicated by the high degree of uncertainty about the level and growth
rate of potential output. Even so, taking into account all combinations of
different measures of inflation (headline and core) and alternative output gap
estimates (time-varying and constant linear trend), the level of policy rates
appeared unusually accommodative by the end of 2011 (Graph IV.6, left-hand
panel). This result was driven mainly by the emerging market economies
(Graph IV.6, right-hand panel), reflecting the significant role of external factors,
ie concerns about exchange rate and capital flow volatility, in these economies’
monetary policy conduct. In the advanced economies, policy rates were just
below the range of Taylor rule benchmarks, after falling within this range for
most of the period since the outbreak of the crisis (Graph IV.6, centre panel).
Real interest rates and Taylor rules are of course unable to fully
characterise the stance of monetary policy. Monetary easing might be
overstated to the extent that a number of factors relevant in the current policy
environment are ignored. These include concerns about destabilising capital
inflows, lingering financial headwinds from the crisis and changes in reserve
requirements.
However, the monetary policy stance looks considerably more
accommodative if one also takes into account the unprecedented expansion of
central bank balance sheets. Total assets held by central banks have more
than doubled over the past four years and stood at approximately $18 trillion at
the end of 2011 (Graph IV.7, left-hand panel). In the advanced economies,

40

BIS 82nd Annual Report

central bank assets rose to about 25% of GDP in the wake of balance sheet
policy measures adopted in reaction to the global financial crisis (Graph IV.7,
right-hand panel). This provided additional monetary accommodation, for
instance by contributing to low long-term bond yields.2 In the major emerging
market economies, central bank assets stood at roughly 40% of GDP at the
end of 2011, reflecting the large accumulation of foreign exchange reserves
over the past decade, in particular in emerging Asia. This arguably mitigated
exchange rate appreciation and thereby boosted growth.

Prolonged monetary accommodation: scope and limitations
Decisive action by central banks during the global financial crisis was probably
crucial in preventing a repeat of the experiences of the Great Depression. This
can be tentatively inferred from a comparison of crisis dynamics (Graph IV.8,
right-hand panel) and monetary policy response (Graph IV.8, left-hand panel)
during that period (dashed lines) with those of the recent global financial crisis
(solid lines) in the United States.
However, while there is widespread agreement that aggressive monetary
easing in the core advanced economies was important to prevent a financial
meltdown, the benefits of prolonged easy monetary conditions are more
controversial. In particular, their implications for effective balance sheet repair

as a precondition for sustained growth, the risks for global financial and price
stability, as well as the longer-term consequences for central banks’ credibility
and operational autonomy, are subject to debate.
Monetary easing and balance sheet repair
Accommodative monetary policy can facilitate private and public sector balance
sheet repair in the short term. It buys time for banks and governments to
address solvency problems and thereby helps prevent disorderly deleveraging
and defaults. Furthermore, it can lower debt servicing costs, prop up asset
prices and support output and employment.
At the same time, however, in the recovery from a financial crisis
monetary policy is likely to be less effective in stimulating the economy than
otherwise. Overindebted economic agents do not wish to borrow in order to
spend, and an impaired financial system is less effective in transmitting the
policy stance to the rest of the economy. This means that, in order to have the
same short-term effect on aggregate demand, monetary accommodation will
naturally be pushed further. But this cannot substitute for direct corrective
action to address debt burdens and impaired balance sheets. Ultimately, there
is even the risk that prolonged monetary easing delays balance sheet repair
and the return to a self-sustaining recovery through a number of channels.
First, prolonged unusually accommodative monetary conditions mask
underlying balance sheet problems and reduce incentives to address them
head-on. Necessary fiscal consolidation and structural reform to restore fiscal
sustainability could be delayed. Indeed, as discussed in more detail in
Chapter V, more determined action by sovereigns is needed to restore their
risk-free status, which is essential for both macroeconomic and financial
stability in the longer term.
Similarly, large-scale asset purchases and unconditional liquidity support
together with very low interest rates can undermine the perceived need to deal
with banks’ impaired assets. Banks are indeed still struggling with the legacy
of the global financial crisis and often depend heavily on central bank funding
(see Chapter VI). And low interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of carrying
non-performing loans and may lead banks to overestimate repayment
capacity. All this could perpetuate weak balance sheets and lead to a
misallocation of credit.3 Evidence that deleveraging by US households came
through a reduction in new loans rather than writedowns of unsustainable
debt (see Chapter III) points to the relevance of such mechanisms at the current
juncture. Similarly, the coexistence of depressed market-to-book ratios for
banks, which are generally well below one, with loan loss provisions that are
low despite weak macroeconomic conditions (see Table VI.1) could indicate
evergreening practices.

3
There is evidence of widespread evergreening practices in Japan during the long period of low
nominal interest rates in the 1990s. There is also evidence of evergreening in Italy during the first years
of the global financial crisis. See R Caballero, T Hoshi and A Kashyap, “Zombie lending and depressed
restructuring in Japan”, American Economic Review, vol 98, December 2008, pp 1943–77, and
U Albertazzi and D Marchetti, “Credit supply, flight to quality and evergreening: an analysis of bank-firm
relationships after Lehman”, Bank of Italy, Temi di Discussione (Working Papers), no 756, April 2010.

BIS 82nd Annual Report

Second, monetary easing may over time undermine banks’ profitability.
The level of short-term interest rates and the slope of the yield curve are both
positively associated with banks’ net interest income as a result of their positive
effects on deposit margins and on the returns from maturity transformation,
respectively.4 True, there is evidence from a sample of internationally active
banks that, in the period 2008–10, monetary easing boosted banks’
profitability, supporting the rebuilding of capital bases (see Box IV.A on
page 44). The negative effects associated with the reduction in the short-term
policy rate were more than offset by the steepening in the slope of the yield
curve. However, an environment of protracted low interest rates characterised
by both low short-term interest rates and flattened yield curves would
ultimately lead to an erosion of banks’ interest income. Signs of this happening
are already present, as the more recent flattening of the yield curve in the
United States and United Kingdom has gone hand in hand with a drop in
banks’ net interest margin (see Table VI.1).
Low returns on fixed income assets also create difficulties for life
insurance companies and pension funds. Serious negative profit margin
problems associated with the low interest rate environment contributed to a
number of life insurance company failures in Japan in the late 1990s and early
2000s. Today, insurance companies and pension funds have partly insulated
themselves from these effects, either by hedging interest rate risk, or by
moving towards unit-linked insurance products or defined contribution
schemes.5 These measures, however, eventually shift risks onto households
and other financial institutions.
Third, low short- and long-term interest rates may create risks of renewed
excessive risk-taking. Countering widespread risk aversion was one important
motivation for the exceptional monetary accommodation provided by central
banks in response to the global financial crisis. However, low interest rates can
over time foster the build-up of financial vulnerabilities by triggering a search
for yield in unwelcome segments. There is ample empirical evidence that this
channel played an important role in the run-up to the financial crisis.6 Recent
large trading losses by some financial institutions may indicate pockets of
excessive risk-taking and require scrutiny.
Fourth, aggressive and protracted monetary accommodation may distort
financial markets. Low interest rates and central bank balance sheet policy
measures have changed the dynamics of overnight money markets, which may
complicate the exit from monetary accommodation (see Box IV.B on page 46).

Box IV.A: Monetary policy and bank profitability in 2008–10
This box analyses the link between changes in the interest rate term structure and banks’ profitability
after Lehman Brothers’ default. We use balance sheet information on 107 large international banks
headquartered in 14 major advanced economies active in different jurisdictions. For this reason, we
construct all macroeconomic indicators as a weighted average across the countries in which each bank
operates, using foreign claims data from the BIS consolidated banking statistics.
The table below reports simple cross-section regressions on average values over the period 2008–10
for: (i) the net interest margin (NIM); (ii) the ratio of impaired loans to total assets; and (iii) the return on
assets (ROA). A reduction in the level of the short-term interest rate and in the slope of the yield curve (in
both segments, between 0 and 2 years, and between 2 and 10 years) has a negative impact on banks’
net interest income. However, in 2008–10, for the 14 countries analysed, short-term interest rates
declined, on average, by 2.44 percentage points, while the two segments of the yield curve increased by
0.35 percentage points and 1.33 percentage points, respectively. Overall, these changes contributed
positively to the NIM (0.69 percentage points). Changes in the structure of the yield curve also reduced
the ratio of impaired loans to total assets (0.17 percentage points), containing the deterioration of the
quality of the credit portfolio during the downturn. These results also hold after controlling for the
expansion of central banks’ total assets, business cycle conditions and bank-specific characteristics such
as size, liquidity, incidence of market funding and the inclusion of a specific dummy for those banks that
benefited from rescue packages.

All variables are calculated as simple averages over the period 2008–10. We measure bank size as the logarithm of total assets,
bank liquidity as the ratio of cash and liquidity to total assets, and market funding as the share of assets funded by non-deposit
liabilities. All ratios are expressed in per cent. Coefficients for the dummy variable indicating those banks that benefited from
rescue interventions are not reported. Robust standard errors in parenthesis. The symbols *, ** and *** represent significance

financial market risk spreads, ultimately also dampen market signals. Longterm yields on core government bonds are a key benchmark for financial
intermediation. Their exceptionally low level (Graph IV.4) could therefore lead
to financial mispricing more generally and undermine financial markets’
function of fostering an effective intertemporal allocation of resources.
With policy rates in the core advanced economies at the effective lower
bound for more than three years now and central bank balance sheets
continuing to expand, these possible side effects bear close watching. Indeed,
as discussed in Chapters III, V and VI, the recovery remains fragile due to large
debt overhangs and persistent structural imbalances while measures to ensure
fiscal sustainability and repair balance sheets have not been undertaken with
the necessary vigour.
Global monetary policy spillovers
While prolonged monetary easing probably has only limited potency to rekindle
sustained growth in the advanced economies, its global spillover effects may
be substantial. Persistently large interest rate differentials (Graph IV.1) support
capital and credit flows to fast-growing emerging market economies and have
put upward pressure on their exchange rates. This makes it more difficult for
emerging market central banks to pursue their domestic stabilisation
objectives. Interest rates have been raised only hesitantly in response to
buoyant domestic macroeconomic and financial conditions out of concerns
that this would widen interest rate differentials and further boost capital
inflows. As a result, monetary policy in emerging market economies may be
systematically too loose, as suggested by the large gap between policy rates
and interest rate benchmarks shown in Graph IV.6.
The prevailing loose global monetary conditions have been fuelling credit
and asset price booms in some emerging market economies for quite some
time now (see Chapter III). This creates risks of rising financial imbalances
similar to those seen in advanced economies in the years immediately
preceding the crisis. Their unwinding would have significant negative
repercussions, also globally as a result of the increased weight of emerging
market economies in the world economy and in investment portfolios.
Loose global monetary policy has probably also contributed to the strength
of commodity prices since 2009 (Graph IV.9, left-hand panel). Commodity
prices are set in global auction markets and are very sensitive to global
demand conditions, which are in turn shaped by the global monetary policy
stance. The growing role of financial investors in commodity markets may have
further raised the sensitivity of prices to monetary conditions.7
The effect of higher commodity prices was felt in particular in emerging
market economies. Two bouts of rising inflation in this group of countries since
2006 have been associated with increasing commodity prices (Graph IV.9,
right-hand panel). Inflation rates have dropped since the second half of last
year as commodity prices have declined. As of early 2012, inflation rates in

most emerging market economies were inside central banks’ inflation target
ranges and markets expected them to moderate slightly further in the rest of
the year (Graph IV.9, right-hand panel, dot). However, risks of potential
second-round inflation effects remain, as unit labour costs edged up in the
fourth quarter of 2011 (Graph IV.9, right-hand panel, blue line). Given the
growing importance of emerging market economies in global supply chains,
these developments could also have an impact on inflation in advanced
economies. That said, as of early 2012, price and wage increases in this group

Box IV.B: Developments in overnight money markets
Traditionally, central banks have relied on the unsecured overnight money market to implement monetary
policy. However, the balance sheet policies pursued in many jurisdictions have led to substantial changes
in market dynamics. To the extent that these new dynamics are not well understood or self-reversing,
they may pose challenges for the eventual exit and lead to changes in the operational frameworks.
The expansion of central bank balance sheets has led to a substantial increase in central bank
reserves (Graph IV.B, left-hand panel). These excess reserves have driven overnight interbank rates
towards their lower bounds, ie the rates at which central banks remunerate deposits (Graph IV.B, righthand panel). In other words, central banks have abandoned their usual practice of keeping the overnight
rate close to a target – often the midpoint of the corridor spanned by the rates at which banks can borrow
from and lend to the central bank, respectively. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the
overnight rate has even moved below the rate at which reserves are remunerated. In both instances, the
overnight market includes non-bank entities that do not have direct access to the central bank deposit
facility. Such market segmentation, as well as limits to arbitrage, allows banks (with access) to offer low
bids for funds from these entities and consequently drive reported market rates below the rate the central
bank offers to banks.
In addition, unsecured market volumes are falling as banks have less need to borrow reserves from
one another to offset daily liquidity shocks (Graph IV.B., centre panel). For example, in the United Kingdom
the unsecured trading volumes that form the basis for the SONIA fixing have fallen by more than half since
2008. In the euro area, the EONIA trading volumes have fallen similarly. Moreover, counterparty
concerns and regulatory changes have increased the attractiveness of secured markets. In contrast to the
SONIA, the trading volumes that underlie the secured RONIA fixing in the United Kingdom have, on
average, remained around the levels that prevailed in 2008. Similar trends are reportedly seen in other
jurisdictions as well.
Furthermore, there is evidence that the dynamics of overnight rates are changing. In the United
States, the pass-through from the unsecured overnight rate to secured rates – a crucial link in the
transmission of the monetary policy – has weakened during the period of near zero rates. In Sweden,
the volatility of the overnight rate (tomorrow-next) has been higher than before the crisis since the
Riksbank’s exit from its balance sheet policies.
With a view to controlling the overnight rate in an exit scenario, central banks need to have in place
properly tested tools for controlling reserves. Moreover, they may need to reconsider whether the precrisis practice of targeting a short-term unsecured market rate is still the most effective.
See M Bech and E Klee, “The mechanics of a graceful exit: interest on reserves and segmentation in the federal funds market”,
Journal of Monetary Economics, 58(5), July 2011, pp 415–31.  See Bank of England, Quarterly Bulletin, 2011 Q2. The SONIA
fixing is the weighted average of all unsecured overnight sterling transactions brokered in London by the members of the
Wholesale Markets Brokers’ Association (WMBA).  The EONIA (Euro OverNight Index Average) is computed as a weighted
average of all overnight unsecured lending transactions undertaken in the interbank market, initiated within the euro area by
contributing banks.  The RONIA fixing is the weighted average interest rate of all secured (ie repo) sterling overnight cash

The growing relevance of monetary policy spillovers suggests that central

called for to ensure lasting price and financial stability.8

Graph IV.10

Longer-term risks for central banks
Long-term inflation expectations currently do not signal perceptions of rising
risks to price stability in the major advanced and emerging market economies.
Both market- and survey-based indicators of long-term inflation expectations
(Graph IV.10) have in general remained stable and close to central banks’
inflation goals.
The stability of long-term inflation expectations indicates that central
banks’ credibility remains high. One could interpret this as suggesting that
central banks still have some leeway to provide further monetary stimulus.
However, the credibility of central banks should not be taken for granted. In
the core advanced economies, if the economy remains weak and underlying
solvency and structural problems remain unresolved, central banks may come
under growing pressure to do more. A vicious circle can develop, with
a widening gap between what central banks are expected to deliver and
what they can actually deliver. This would make the eventual exit from
monetary accommodation harder and may ultimately threaten central banks’
credibility. Likewise, in emerging market economies, continued reliance on
export-led growth strategies may raise doubts about central banks’
determination to pursue price stability and exit from large-scale foreign
exchange interventions. Such doubts could over time gradually unanchor
inflation expectations globally.
This concern is reinforced by growing political economy risks. Central
banks’ balance sheet policies have blurred the line between monetary and
fiscal policy. Their effects can be properly assessed only as part of the
consolidated public sector balance sheet. And most of these policies could be
replicated by the government. The very meaning of instrument independence
therefore becomes unclear when central banks engage in large-scale balance
sheet policy measures. As a result, protracted reliance on such measures

48

BIS 82nd Annual Report

raises concerns about possible restrictions on central banks’ operational
autonomy, especially as public debt is on an unsustainable path in many
countries (see Chapter V).
The growing financial risks in the bloated balance sheets of central banks
may furthermore undermine their financial independence. While financial losses
do not per se hamper central banks’ operational capabilities, they may
undermine operational autonomy if the central bank is no longer able to pursue
its policy objectives without recourse to financial resources from the government.9
Against the background of these growing longer-term risks for central
banks, the current stability of long-term inflation expectations is no reason for
complacency. If central banks’ credibility were to be eroded and inflation
expectations were to pick up, it would be very difficult and costly to restore
price stability, as the experience of the 1970s has shown.

Summing up
The global monetary policy stance is unusually accommodative. Policy rates
are well below traditional benchmark measures. At the same time, central bank
balance sheets have reached an unprecedented size and continue to expand.
Against the background of weak growth and high unemployment in many
advanced economies, sustained monetary easing is natural and compelling.
However, there is a growing risk of overburdening monetary policy. By itself,
easy monetary policy cannot solve underlying solvency or deeper structural
problems. It can buy time, but may actually make it easier to waste that time,
thus possibly delaying the return to a self-sustaining recovery. Central banks
need to recognise and communicate the limits of monetary policy, making clear
that it cannot substitute for those policy measures that can address the root
causes of financial fragility and economic weakness.
The combination of weak growth and exceptionally low interest rates in the
core advanced economies, and efforts to manage the spillovers in emerging
market economies, has helped to spread monetary accommodation globally.
The resulting risks of a build-up of financial imbalances and increasing
inflationary pressures in emerging market economies might have significant
negative repercussions on the global economy. This points to the need for
central banks to take better account of the global spillovers from their domestic
monetary policies to ensure lasting financial and price stability.
Finally, central banks need to beware of longer-term risks to their
credibility and operational independence. Failing to appreciate the limits of
monetary policy raises the risk of a widening gap between what central banks
are expected to deliver and what they can actually deliver. This would
complicate the eventual exit from monetary accommodation and may ultimately
threaten central banks’ credibility and operational autonomy. This concern is
reinforced by political economy risks arising from the combination of balance
sheet policies that have blurred the line between monetary and fiscal policies,
on the one hand, and the risk of unsustainable fiscal positions, on the other.

V. Restoring fiscal sustainability

Fiscal positions in many advanced economies were already on an
unsustainable path before the financial crisis. The crisis led to a significant
further deterioration in fiscal sustainability by increasing fiscal deficits and debt.
As a result, financial markets and credit rating agencies took a more critical
view of sovereign credit risk. Government debt and deficits that had been
tolerated before the crisis were no longer considered sustainable.
These developments have led to higher sovereign credit default swap
(CDS) spreads and sovereign credit rating downgrades, most notably in the
cases of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. But downgrades have also
occurred for sovereigns whose risk-free status is rarely challenged, such as the
United States and Japan, and whose borrowing costs have actually declined as
a result of safe haven flows.
This has generated concerns about sovereigns losing their risk-free status
or, more specifically, about their liabilities becoming subject to non-negligible
credit risk. To be sure, even from this narrow perspective, full risk-free status is
an ideal goal rather than a realistic objective. Indeed, the worst possible
outcome is treating an asset as risk-free when, in fact, it is not. Arguably, this
was the case for many sovereigns ahead of the recent crisis, and is still the
case for some of them. Here, we use the term “risk-free” to describe assets
associated with a sufficiently high probability of creditors being repaid to allow
credit risk not to be explicitly taken into account by financial market participants
in investment decisions. The existence of such assets contributes to the
smooth and efficient functioning of the financial system.
A weakening of sovereign creditworthiness adversely affects financial
stability, the conduct and credibility of fiscal and monetary policy, the
functioning of financial markets and private sector borrowing costs. In the
current environment – in which economic growth is anaemic, financial markets
are still fragile and central banks are overextended – sovereigns’ increased
riskiness is particularly worrisome. They must therefore return to sustainable
fiscal positions.
The next section examines the deterioration in the creditworthiness
of sovereigns and its main causes. The subsequent sections discuss the
consequences of that deterioration and draw policy implications.

Why and to what extent have sovereigns lost their risk-free status?
Developments in public finances
Concerns about the sustainability of fiscal positions in advanced economies were
present long before the start of the recent financial crisis. Governments’ explicit
debt levels (debt-to-GDP ratios) in advanced economies had risen steadily between
the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s. Despite levelling off during the following

decade thanks to a mixture of robust global economic growth and fiscal
consolidation efforts in Europe and the United States, they remained quite high.
They then went up sharply in the wake of the global financial crisis (Graph V.1).
But explicit government debt tells only part of the story. The fiscal picture
becomes even gloomier once one accounts for projected increases in public
spending on pensions and health care due to ageing populations.1 In the
developed world, those two categories of government spending are projected to
rise by an average of 7.9 percentage points of GDP between 2010 and 2050.2

Furthermore, credit and asset price booms before the crisis made the fiscal
positions of some advanced economies look better than they actually were. The
governments of some countries, most notably Ireland and Spain, were lulled
into a false sense of security by the rise in tax revenues that turned out to be
driven exclusively by unsustainable financial booms.3 The associated temporary
increases in tax receipts from the financial and real estate sectors gave a one-off
boost to governments’ fiscal balances relative to what normal cyclical economic
expansions could be expected to produce, leading policymakers to overestimate
structural balances (see box).4 This in turn encouraged more relaxed fiscal
policies, which proved dangerous once the financial booms turned to bust.
On the surface, the fiscal situation in emerging market economies (EMEs)
looks much better than that in the advanced economies. Fiscal deficits and
government debt as a share of GDP have generally been much lower in these
economies (Graph V.1), and their public debt-to-GDP ratios have been
declining on average since 2010.
Nevertheless, the underlying fiscal position in EMEs may not be as
uniformly healthy as it appears. As Graph V.1 shows, there is significant
dispersion among their fiscal positions. The government debt-bearing capacity
of EMEs is generally lower than that of advanced economies owing to a variety
of factors, including a history of previous defaults and lower tax-raising
capacity. Just like their advanced economy peers, many emerging market
governments are facing large increases in public spending on pensions and
health care (an average of 7.0 percentage points of GDP between 2010 and
2050) due to ageing populations.5 And the fiscal accounts of a number of EMEs
are being falsely enhanced by potentially unsustainable credit and asset price
booms (see Chapter III).
One measure of fiscal sustainability, the fiscal gap, is the change in cyclically
adjusted primary fiscal balances needed to bring the government debt-to-GDP
ratio back to a sustainable level over a given horizon.6 While views differ as to
the optimal level of the government debt-to-GDP ratio, as an admittedly rough
guide, the existing empirical evidence suggests that ratios above 85% hurt
growth.7 If correct, and given recent experience, this would suggest that ratios
would have to be well below 85% to allow some room for countercyclical fiscal
policy and a rise in public debt during a recession.
Allowing such headroom, and as an indicative exercise, one can take a
benchmark long-term ratio of, say, 50% to be reached by 2050. Using this

The financial cycle, potential output and cyclically adjusted fiscal balances
The calibration of macroeconomic policies relies on estimates of potential or sustainable output, which
allow policymakers to distinguish between cyclical fluctuations and longer-term trends. The difference
between actual and potential output is generally termed the “output gap”. Potential output, however, is
not directly observable. This box explains how information about the financial cycle can be used to derive
such estimates and applies them to the measurement of structural budget balances.
The most common approach for estimating potential output and the corresponding output gap is to
extract the long-term trend from actual output using a purely statistical procedure (eg the HodrickPrescott (HP) filter). This approach is simple, but does not rely on additional information about economic
relationships. Other approaches are more model-based, and differ significantly in terms of the economic
information they include. The most common type of information concerns the relationship between
economic slack and inflation (the Phillips curve), the basic idea being that inflation varies with the size of
the output gap. Some approaches go even further and also include information about the economy’s
production function.
Existing approaches do not embed information about the financial cycle. There are, however, good
reasons to believe that financial market conditions can have a profound effect on output. This is so
especially during periods in which credit and asset prices move beyond sustainable ranges, generating
financial imbalances. These developments can, for instance, go hand in hand with patterns of investment
and consumption that, over time, lead to serious misallocations in output and the capital stock. Such
unsustainable booms, while appearing benign in the short term, can undermine sustainable output over
the longer term. As they proceed, output moves increasingly beyond sustainable levels.
We address this issue by extending the most widely used statistical approach for estimating
potential output (the HP filter) to incorporate information about the financial cycle. To facilitate the
exposition, we only consider information from credit aggregates. Specifically, we use the percentage
change in inflation-adjusted private sector credit relative to its sample average as a general proxy for
financial conditions. We gradually increase the weight on this variable as the credit-to-GDP ratio moves
beyond normal historical ranges, thereby signalling unsustainable developments or the build-up of
financial imbalances.
For illustrative purposes, Graph V.A.1 compares the credit-based output gaps for the United States
and Spain with those obtained by applying the standard HP filter and those reported by the OECD based
on the production function approach. Graph V.A.1 indicates that credit-based estimates of potential
output are comparatively much lower during the unsustainable credit booms that preceded the recent
financial crises in both countries. By contrast, the different approaches yield very similar results during
periods in which credit moved within narrower ranges, thereby playing a less prominent role. This is, for
example, the case during the 1970s in the United States – a period of tighter financial market regulation.
To assess the economic significance of the differences between the output gap estimates, we use
them to cyclically adjust the government budget balances. Constructing such structural budget balances
requires estimates of the elasticity of different tax and government expenditure categories with respect to

the output gap. For this we use OECD estimates. It should be stressed that we do not correct for the
additional effects that asset price booms may have on government revenues. Thus, differences between
the cyclically adjusted budget balances reflect solely those in output gap estimates.
Graph V.A.2 shows the unadjusted budget balances for the United States and Spain along with the
cyclical corrections implied by the different output gap estimates. In this context, a difference of more
than half a percentage point is generally considered to be economically significant. The graph reveals
that the difference between the credit-based estimates and the rest is generally of such a magnitude.
Moreover, the credit-based cyclically adjusted balances are lowest during unsustainable credit booms,
consistent with the view that such booms falsely enhance the fiscal accounts, as subsequent developments
have confirmed.
 A more elaborate analysis would also include information about asset prices, especially property prices (see Chapter III and
M Drehmann, C Borio and K Tsatsaronis, “Characterising the financial cycle: don’t lose sight of the medium term!”, BIS
Working Papers, forthcoming). For technical information about the derivation of the estimates, see C Borio, P Disyatat and

in public spending on pensions and health care, most advanced economies
would need to improve their cyclically adjusted primary balances immediately

gap is particularly large – above 8% of GDP – for Ireland, Japan, the United
Kingdom and the United States. Fiscal gaps for Canada, France and the

does not need to make an adjustment according to this measure. The large
fiscal gaps for many advanced economies show that they will need to make
sizeable adjustments to their government budgets in order to restore fiscal
sustainability.
The vulnerability of fiscal positions depends not only on fiscal and
macroeconomic long-term trends, but also on the distribution of government
bond holdings (Graph V.2). Other things being equal, a higher share of
domestic bond holdings, as in Brazil and Japan, can temporarily support higher

Immediate rise in the underlying primary balance as a percentage of GDP needed to bring gross financial liabilities to 50% of
GDP in 2050; includes health care and long-term care costs and projected increases in pension spending. 2 The contribution of
changes is evaluated as the difference from the fiscal gaps in a baseline simulation where spending on pensions, health care and
long-term care is assumed to remain constant as a share of GDP. A negative contribution implies that the underlying fiscal
position improved or the interest rate paid on government debt fell between 2007 and that projected for 2012. 3 The implied
fiscal gap considers the impact of the prevailing underlying fiscal position, debt levels and interest rates in 2007 on the 2012 fiscal
gap.

debt-to-GDP ratios: there is a lower probability of a serious impact from foreign
capital flight, and interest payments are a smaller drag on domestic income. In
addition, a higher proportion of foreign official investors for a given share of
foreign government debt holdings, as in the United States, may point to more
stable government borrowing costs since foreign official holders are less likely to
react to short-run macroeconomic news or sudden spikes in global risk aversion.
Net international investment positions can also influence fiscal
sustainability. The countries most affected by the euro area sovereign debt
crisis have large negative net international investment positions relative to
GDP. At the end of 2011, the country with the most negative such position was
Portugal, at –108% of GDP, followed by Ireland (–95%), Spain (–86%) and
Greece (–73%). By contrast, the large positive net international investment
position of Japan (51%) helps to lessen the vulnerability of its fiscal position,
even though its government debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 212% in 2011.
The impact of the financial crisis on fiscal positions
The financial crisis caused significant deterioration in the state of public
finances in advanced economies. Virtually all governments in the developed
world became much more indebted than they had been in 2007 (Graph V.1).
And even though their public debt levels did not go up as much, EMEs were not
spared either.

56

BIS 82nd Annual Report

We can assess the marginal impact of the financial crisis and its aftermath
on the sustainability of public finances by examining how fiscal gaps evolved.
In several large advanced economies (eg Japan, the United Kingdom and the
United States), fiscal gaps rose substantially due to swelling of fiscal deficits and
debt triggered by the crisis (Table V.1). Ireland and Spain also saw their fiscal
gaps widen between 2007 and 2012, despite their recent fiscal consolidation
efforts. In both instances, the increases were driven in roughly equal measure by
rises in government debt and in cyclically adjusted primary fiscal deficits.
Several factors drove the large fiscal deficits that governments ran in
response to the crisis. The non-discretionary portions of government budgets
shrank as tax revenues fell and automatic spending rose. Many governments
implemented substantial fiscal stimulus packages to combat the slowdown
in macroeconomic activity. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, many
sovereigns also provided support to financial institutions headquartered in their
jurisdictions in the form of asset purchase programmes, direct equity injections
and debt guarantees. The financial support programmes were often sizeable,
with upfront costs reaching up to 55% of GDP.10 And, as discussed above, in
countries that had experienced credit and asset price booms prior to the crisis,
tax revenues shrank much more than they would have as a result of a cyclical
decline in macroeconomic activity.
The impact of deteriorating sovereign health on the financial system
The crisis has triggered an adverse feedback loop between bank risk and
sovereign risk. Financial system weakness has hurt public finances while the
deterioration in sovereigns’ perceived creditworthiness has damaged the health
of financial institutions.
The decline in sovereigns’ perceived creditworthiness has affected the
financial sector through several channels.11 It has depressed the market value
of banks’ holdings of government debt and reduced the availability of highquality collateral. This has adversely affected banks’ funding conditions (as
discussed in the next section and Chapter VI). Furthermore, the decline in the
perceived ability of the sovereign to provide a backstop to the financial system
has led to increases in the borrowing costs of financial institutions. This
link has been most obvious in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, where the
lessening of perceived official support for banks over the past year has led to a
fall in their all-in ratings.12 Finally, as sovereigns have lost their perceived riskfree status, government debt has become a closer substitute for bank debt in
investors’ portfolios, raising the risk of crowding it out. Even though this effect
applies to all private borrowers, it affects banks more given their sizeable
funding needs.

Market prices clearly reflect the heightened risk of such a negative
feedback loop. Correlations between bank and sovereign CDS spreads
have risen considerably since the start of 2010. This is true not only for
bank/sovereign CDS correlations within the same country, but also for many
cross-country bank/sovereign pairs. For example, the correlation coefficient
between daily changes in French bank and sovereign CDS spreads rose from
0.38 in 2008–09 to 0.79 in 2010–11. Over the same period, bank/sovereign
CDS spread correlation coefficients also increased in Germany (0.33 to 0.66),
Italy (0.53 to 0.78), Spain (0.38 to 0.71) and the United Kingdom (0.34 to 0.71).
Reactions to the deteriorating fiscal health of sovereigns
The long-term borrowing costs of many, but not all, governments in advanced
economies have risen considerably over the past couple of years. Concern
about sovereigns’ creditworthiness has been particularly strong in some euro
area countries. Ten-year government bond yields in Greece, Ireland and
Portugal increased strongly during 2010. Greek and Portuguese yields surged
in 2011 and ended the year at 35.0% and 13.4%, respectively. After being
virtually shut out of markets, each of the three governments concerned asked
for official assistance. The long-term borrowing costs of Italy and Spain, whose
joint government debt in 2011 amounted to around EUR 2.7 trillion, rose to
5.9% and 6.6%, respectively, by end-May 2012. However, 10-year German,
Japanese and US government bond yields fell to 1.2%, 0.8% and 1.6%,
respectively, by end-May 2012 as a result of a flight to safety.
As reflected in the prices of credit derivatives, the increase in sovereign
credit risk was even more widespread. The sovereign CDS spreads of many
advanced economies reached unprecedented levels towards the end of 2011
and, despite declining somewhat in early 2012, remain very high (Graph V.3,
top left-hand panel). Even debt markets that benefited from a flight to safety
and a decline in borrowing costs saw their sovereign CDS spreads rise.
The erosion of advanced economies’ perceived creditworthiness also
resulted in widespread credit rating downgrades (Graph V.3, bottom left-hand
panel). Even the United States, the issuer of the world’s most widely held
international reserve currency, saw Standard & Poor’s cut its sovereign credit
rating in August 2011, as the Congressional Joint Committee on Deficit
Reduction failed to reach agreement on a firm medium-term debt reduction
strategy. As with market prices, the downgrades may have reflected not only
the crisis-induced deterioration in public finances, but also a reappraisal of
sovereign risk, with what had been regarded as sustainable before the crisis
being judged as more risky.
Markets and credit rating agencies have been more positive about
emerging economies. The sovereign CDS spreads of major EMEs were
relatively stable over the past couple of years and, despite rising in the second
half of 2011, remained well below their 2008–09 peaks (Graph V.3, top righthand panel). Furthermore, emerging economies’ credit ratings have trended
upwards over the past decade, leading to some convergence with those of
advanced economies (Graph V.3, bottom right-hand panel). Nevertheless, the
picture is not uniform. The credit ratings of some smaller emerging market

economies were downgraded over the past few years. For others, credit ratings
and borrowing costs remained virtually unchanged despite rapid economic
growth. Finally, for many countries in emerging Asia, credit ratings are
currently lower than prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

Implications of sovereigns’ loss of risk-free status
The deterioration in sovereign creditworthiness has significant undesirable
effects. It undermines financial stability and the credibility of macroeconomic
policies, and it increases private sector borrowing costs.
Sovereigns’ loss of risk-free status undermines financial stability.
Governments whose debt is risky cannot provide a reliable backstop for the
financial system – the ultimate anchor of stability. Moreover, risk-averse private
agents and financial intermediaries are deprived of a valuable and stabilising
wealth preservation option at times of stress, including in the form of collateral.
Indeed, the credit risk profile of the global pool of government bonds has
deteriorated significantly, as indicated by both CDS spreads (Graph V.4, lefthand panel) and credit ratings (right-hand panel). As a result, the global pool
of “safe” government bonds has shrunk just as demand has risen due to a flight

to safety, leading to a major shortage of safe assets in the global financial
system.
The increased riskiness of sovereign debt weakens macroeconomic
stability also through its effect on fiscal and monetary policy. It reduces the
scope for implementing stabilising countercyclical fiscal policies. And it can
undermine the credibility of monetary policy by raising concerns about fiscal
dominance and monetisation of government debt.13 This could unanchor
inflation expectations and destabilise the macroeconomy.
Finally, the deterioration in the perceived creditworthiness of a sovereign
raises the funding costs of virtually all private borrowers in its jurisdiction. The
interest rates on government bonds set an effective floor on the borrowing
costs of the majority of such borrowers.14 They are also highly correlated with
those costs (Graph V.5), especially during crises.15

How can sovereigns become risk-free again?
Governments in many advanced economies will have to significantly improve
their fiscal balances to put their finances on a sustainable path and restore
confidence in their fiscal positions. This is a prerequisite for a return to
sustainable growth. It will require implementing effective fiscal consolidation
and breaking the adverse feedback loop between bank and sovereign risk.

Fiscal consolidation has started in a number of advanced economies
(see Chapter II), but more needs to be done. According to OECD estimates,
cyclically adjusted primary fiscal deficits as a percentage of GDP in advanced
economies fell to an average of 4.1% in 2011, and are expected to decrease
further to 3.1% in 2012 and 2.1% in 2013. The ratio was smaller on average in
emerging economies in 2011 and is expected to decline only slightly in the next
two years.16 Nevertheless, many of the countries that implemented deficit
reduction measures were not able to meet their headline deficit-to-GDP targets.
This reflected a combination of weaker than expected growth and larger than
expected deficits.
Financial markets can both help and hinder the return to fiscal
sustainability. On the one hand, market discipline can provide incentives for
fiscal consolidation. On the other, financial markets can remain complacent
about fiscal problems for too long and react too late. Policymakers should
therefore not wait for market signals to emerge in order to engage in fiscal
consolidation.
Governments should implement pension and health care reforms now.
Doing so would reduce the long-term contingent liabilities of the government
and bolster confidence in the long-term sustainability of public finances.
In many advanced economies, large adjustments in government budgets
and deep reform of the public sector are needed to restore fiscal sustainability.
The specific timing and intensity of these measures will inevitably depend on
country-specific conditions. But delaying fiscal consolidation could weaken
confidence, leading to higher borrowing costs. For some countries, confidence
in the sustainability of public finances has eroded so much that immediate
fiscal consolidation is the only viable policy option. In those cases, it is

necessary to provide a boost to confidence, which is crucial for reviving
economic growth.
Policy recommendations differ as to the best timing of fiscal consolidation.
These differences partly reflect the uncertain size of fiscal multipliers, which
may depend on the state of the economy and the constraints on monetary
policy. Recent work suggests that fiscal multipliers may be larger when output
gaps are negative and monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower
bound, as is currently the case in major advanced economies.17 That said,
fiscal multipliers in a balance sheet recession may be lower than in normal
recessions. In particular, in a balance sheet recession, overly indebted agents
– these days, households typically – are likely to allocate a higher fraction of
each additional unit of income to reducing their debt rather than increasing
discretionary spending.
This also suggests that fiscal consolidation should factor in the potential
use of the available fiscal space to support balance sheet repair of the financial
and non-financial sectors where necessary. In countries where private sector
balance sheet repair is an issue, fiscal space should be made available to
address it, without prejudice to overall fiscal consolidation and debt reduction
(see Chapters III and VI).
It is important for policymakers to manage the expectations of economic
agents and financial markets by encouraging them to look beyond the very
short term. This means communicating clearly about the likely impact of
planned fiscal consolidation measures at various horizons. Research suggests
that the adverse impact of fiscal tightening on economic activity is temporary.18
Increasing the flexibility of the economy can dampen any short-run
adverse effects on output and quicken the return to longer-term sustainable
growth. Structural policies, including product and labour market reform, are
especially important. They can facilitate the reallocation of resources, support
competitiveness and boost productivity growth.
Longer-term, policymakers need to take measures to break the feedback
loop between financial sector and sovereign risk. One key step is encouraging
banks to build capital and liquidity buffers – a priority of the regulatory reforms
under way (see Chapter VI) – which would reduce the probability that
governments would have to bail them out again. Another is for governments
to be especially prudent in good times, building appropriate fiscal buffers, to
be able to provide support for the financial system if needed without denting
their creditworthiness (see the previous section). Finally, the risk weights for
government debt held by banks should be based on a realistic assessment
of sovereign credit risk, as encouraged by the internal ratings-based (IRB)

approach of the Basel standards. This would discourage banks from
concentrating their portfolios excessively in sovereign bonds. In contrast to the
spirit of the approach, many banks and supervisors have assigned zero risk
weights to domestic government bonds, increasing the incentive to hold such
assets.19
Countries less affected by the financial crisis, including many emerging
market economies, could take the opportunity to put their public finances on a
path that is sustainable in the long term. This would better prepare them to deal
with increases in public spending on pensions and health care due to ageing
populations and provide more room for countercyclical fiscal policy in the future.

Summing up
Sovereigns have been losing their risk-free status at an alarming rate. Fiscal
positions were already unsustainable in many advanced economies before
the financial crisis, which in turn led to significant further weakening. The
deterioration of public finances has undermined financial stability, lowered the
credibility of fiscal and monetary policy, impaired the functioning of financial
markets, and increased private sector borrowing costs. Restoring sustainable
fiscal positions will require implementing effective fiscal consolidation,
promoting long-term growth, and breaking the adverse feedback loop between
bank and sovereign risk.

19 For example, an EU directive stipulates such a zero risk weight on member countries’ government
bonds denominated and funded in the domestic currency of the country. See also H Hannoun,
“Sovereign risk in bank regulation and supervision: where do we stand?”, speech delivered at the
Financial Stability Institute High-Level Meeting, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, 26 October 2011.

VI. Post-crisis evolution of the banking sector

The recent financial crisis has conveyed clear messages to market participants
and to regulators entrusted with safeguarding financial stability. One is that
banks had mismanaged their liquidity positions, both domestically and
internationally, and failed to secure stable and diversified sources of income
and to contain costs. Another is that opaque balance sheets significantly
impaired analyses of risk, thus preventing a timely awareness of the weakness
of banks’ capital buffers. And the troubles that beset the banks imposed
material losses on their stakeholders, brought financial intermediation to a halt
and plunged the global economy into recession. The lessons learned from the
crisis have influenced markets’ and analysts’ perception of banks and have led
to new regulatory initiatives that will shape banks’ post-crisis business models.
In the interim, banks have made efforts to strengthen their resilience, but
have not succeeded in putting their troubles behind them. Prices in the equity
and debt markets indicate that, in 2012, the general conditions in the banking
sector are similar to the conditions that prevailed after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers. Faced with negative market assessments and a crisis of confidence
among peer institutions, many banks depend strongly on central bank funding
and are not in a position to promote economic growth.
Policymakers have a role to play in improving the robustness of the
banking sector. An immediate priority is to ensure that banks burdened by
legacy assets repair their balance sheets by recognising losses and
recapitalising. This would help restore confidence in the sector, thus reopening
access to traditional funding markets. In parallel, rigorous, through-the-cycle
assessments should shape regulatory measures in rapidly growing economies
where buoyant markets exaggerate the financial strength of banks and
encourage risk-taking. In the long term, the new regulatory environment should
strengthen banks’ incentives to adopt business models that generate
sustainable profits and reduce reliance on official support and that mitigate the
risk of financial distress spreading across borders.
This chapter reviews the current state of the banking sector and discusses
necessary conditions for the sector’s robust performance in the future. After
reporting market assessments of the sector’s post-crisis evolution, it examines
banks’ balance sheets and sources of profitability. Much of the analysis is
based on a sample of 100 banks, including internationally active institutions
from advanced economies and large banks from emerging markets. The
chapter then recommends policies that public authorities can adopt to help
banks overcome the legacy of the crisis. The chapter concludes with a
discussion of the long-term challenges faced by the banking sector, paying
particular attention to their international dimension.

Market assessments of the banking sector
Markets do not perceive the crisis to be over. Concerns about the banking
sector’s vulnerability continue to depress equity valuations and raise spreads in
debt markets. Official support has provided only a partial reprieve.
Equity market valuations
Up to mid-2012, equity prices still signalled general scepticism about the
banking sector. Relative to a broad index, bank valuations had improved little
and, in certain cases, had even worsened since end-2008 (Graph VI.1, top lefthand panel). In comparison, the insurance sector performed better over the
same period despite very low interest rates that raise the present value of its
liabilities (Graph VI.1, top right-hand panel).
Over a longer time horizon, markets have consistently differentiated
between individual banks, rewarding institutions with a stronger capital base
by lowering the cost of their equity. This is a natural outcome of investors
managing the risk-return trade-off in their portfolios: loss-absorbing capital
improves banks’ resilience and ensures their sustained access to funding

markets. Data since 1990 on 50 actively traded banks reveal that raising the
ratio of total equity to total assets from 2.5% to 5%, while keeping all else the
same, lowers the cost of equity by 80 basis points.1 This relationship persisted
throughout the crisis and, if anything, became slightly stronger.
Debt market valuations
Debt market investors concur with investors in equity markets. Even though
the extraordinary longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) launched by the
Eurosystem at end-2011 have helped to lower credit default swap (CDS)
spreads for euro area lenders, spread levels in the spring of 2012 were similar
to or even higher than those in the aftermath of Lehman’s collapse (Graph VI.1,
bottom left-hand panel). Only the perceptions of relative credit risk have
changed: while US banks were viewed as being riskier at end-2008, euro area
banks have taken their place since 2010.
Rating agencies have also indicated increased concerns about banks’
creditworthiness. These concerns have surfaced in “stand-alone” ratings –
assessments of banks’ financial strength in the absence of official support. Not
only have these ratings deteriorated over the past five years for many banks,
but they also signal the growing disparities between banks in terms of financial
health (Graph VI.1, bottom right-hand panel).

Banks’ profitability and its sources
Markets’ and analysts’ views of the state of the banking sector incorporate
assessments of institutions’ profitability. Of particular value are sustainable
profit streams that can support asset growth, thus providing a shield against
adverse external developments. Securing such profits is a key near-term
challenge for many banks. (See Box VI.A on page 67, for a discussion of
shadow banking.)
The pre-impairment operating profits – ie profits before impairment
charges – of banks headquartered in advanced countries have recovered from
their 2008 troughs (Graph VI.2, left-hand panel). However, the weak earnings
of a number of large banks in the first quarter of 2012 have cast doubt on the
sustainability of profit growth. A key driver of the growth between 2009 and
2011 was trading income, which the crisis exposed as unreliable. By contrast,
net interest income, which had held up during the crisis, barely changed as a
proportion of banks’ assets over the same period.
The strong reliance of emerging market banks on net interest income sets
them apart from their advanced economy counterparts. Such income has
consistently accounted for three quarters of these banks’ pre-impairment
operating profits, compared with one half in the case of banks from advanced
countries. That said, the net interest income of some emerging market banks
may be unsustainably high. For instance, government-imposed floors on net

Box VI.A: Shadow banking
This box provides a brief review of shadow banking, paying particular attention to its increased
importance in financial intermediation and related policy initiatives. While definitions differ, the term
“shadow banking” broadly refers to financial activities carried out by non-bank financial institutions that
create leverage and/or engage in maturity and liquidity transformation. Thus, even though they are
subject to different regulatory frameworks, shadow and traditional banks operate alongside each other.
Shadow banking exists because historical and institutional factors, the rapid pace of financial innovation
and specialisation have all increased the attractiveness of performing certain types of financial
intermediation outside traditional banking. In normal times, shadow banking enhances the resilience of
the broader financial system by offering unique financial products and a range of vehicles for managing
credit, liquidity and maturity risks. But shadow banking also creates risks that can undermine financial
stability in the absence of prudential safeguards.
Shadow banking activity can amplify financial cycles since it tends to grow during booms and
contract during busts. Such was the role of this activity in the global financial crisis as well as in the
crises in Sweden and Japan in the 1990s. At present, intermediation by shadow banks in China is
reportedly feeding the credit and asset price boom there. During booms, shadow banking facilitates
increases in leverage and in liquidity and maturity mismatches, thus contributing to the build-up of
vulnerabilities. Importantly, the risks associated with non-bank financial intermediation are often not on
regulators’ radar screens and are beyond the reach of public policy tools, such as deposit insurance,
bank capital and liquidity requirements, and the provision of central bank funding. These risks may
threaten the traditional banking system, which provides shadow banking with a range of services such
as guarantees, credit lines and the “warehousing” of assets for securitisation. In recent years, some of
the main areas of concern have included the securitisation chain, the repo markets and the activity of
money market funds (MMFs).
As shadow banking grows, so does the proportion of financial intermediation that policymakers
cannot easily assess and control. While data scarcity and inconsistent statistical definitions make it
difficult to gauge the size and scope of shadow banking activity, rough aggregate measures suggest that
it expanded during the years preceding the global financial crisis (Graph VI.A, left-hand panel). According
to data compiled by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), financial assets held by “other financial
intermediaries” in a sample of advanced economies rose from an estimated $23 trillion in 2002, or around
23% of total financial system assets, to more than $50 trillion (or 27%) at the end of 2007. While the
growth of other intermediaries’ assets slowed during the global crisis, driven by a sharp fall in activities
linked to securitisation and repo markets, its level is still high. At end-2010, structured finance vehicles,
finance companies, securities brokers and dealers, and MMFs combined accounted for about a third of

these holdings, and other (non-MMF) investment funds accounted for another third (Graph VI.A, righthand panel).
Given the size of shadow banking and the rapid pace of financial innovation, recent policy initiatives
have focused on regular monitoring and targeted interventions guided by broad principles. Driving these
initiatives is the need to prevent the build-up of leverage and maturity and liquidity mismatches that
could undermine financial stability. The FSB is working to enhance the monitoring of the shadow banking
system, and it is examining the regulation of traditional banks’ securitisation activity and securities
lending as well as their interactions with repo markets, MMFs and other shadow banking entities. Other
policy initiatives seek to improve reporting standards and increase the available information on non-bank
financial intermediation.
The run on MMFs during the crisis, and authorities’ targeted response, show how broad policy
principles can be applied to specific institutional structures. While MMFs are present in many
jurisdictions, they have an especially prominent role in the United States, where corporations and retail
investors use them as vehicles for short-term funding, cash management or investment. In mid-2011,
MMFs’ assets under management amounted to $2.7 trillion in the United States, $1.5 trillion in Europe
and some $400 billion in the rest of the world. Because of the way they are structured, most US and
many European MMFs must maintain a stable net asset value (NAV) – defined as the ratio of the value of
total assets, net of any liabilities, to the number of fund shares outstanding. While such a structure
facilitates cash management, it increases the risk of runs by uninsured investors when falling asset
values threaten to push a fund’s NAV below par. The prospect of a run led several fund sponsors to
provide emergency support to their funds, both before and after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. And
US authorities found it necessary to create a series of emergency facilities after Lehman’s collapse in
order to prevent the problems of the MMF sector from causing further disruption to the financial system.
The risk of runs on MMFs by uninsured investors reflects the underlying mismatch between the
liquidity of fund assets, which are generally short-term but have varying degrees of liquidity, and fund
liabilities, which are highly liquid as most funds promise redemption on demand. In an attempt to
address the risk posed by this mismatch, in 2010 the US Securities and Exchange Commission adopted
rules strengthening liquidity and credit risk standards for MMFs. In addition, European securities
regulators have published harmonised standards for European funds classified as MMFs.
More recently, an FSB workstream led by the International Organization of Securities Commissions
(IOSCO) has examined further options for strengthening the regulation of MMFs. Some of the proposals
under consideration include: mandating that funds have a variable NAV; imposing capital requirements
on funds that need to maintain a constant NAV; and implementing “hold-back” mechanisms that restrict
redemptions in the event of a large number of simultaneous redemption requests. In effect, proposals
such as these, if implemented, would align the regulation of MMFs more closely with that of traditional
banks.
 “Other financial intermediaries” are those not classified as banks, insurers, pension funds or public financial institutions in flow
of funds statistics.  See N Baba, R McCauley and S Ramaswamy, “US dollar money market funds and non-US banks”, BIS
Quarterly Review, March 2009, pp 65–81.

interest margins have boosted the profitability of Chinese banks. Since such
practices depress depositors’ returns, however, banks are vulnerable to a
shrinking deposit base as attractive saving alternatives emerge outside the
banking sector.
Differences between advanced economy and emerging market banks have
also surfaced in loan and credit impairment charges. For European, Japanese
and US banks, these charges dropped from about 30% of pre-impairment
operating profits in 2008–09 to less than 20% a year later. The ratio for
European banks rose again in 2011, to 25%, which suggests that legacy assets
continue to weigh on them. By contrast, the ratio for emerging market banks
remained below 20% amid rapid credit growth between 2006 and 2011
(Graph VI.2, left-hand panel).

Efforts to strengthen balance sheets
The importance of strong capital and liquidity buffers is difficult to overstate. In
the face of losses, better capitalised banks are more likely to remain solvent, to
continue providing financial services and to deliver robust returns to their equity
investors over the long term. And when market confidence evaporates, it is well
managed liquidity positions that support financial intermediation. Even though
liquidity risk is inherent in maturity transformation, banks will be in a better
position to control this risk if they rely more on stable retail funding than they
did prior to the crisis.
Capital base
Banks worldwide have markedly strengthened their capital base in recent years
(Graph VI.3, left-hand panel). Between 2008 and 2011, large European, US and
Japanese banks raised their common equity-to-total assets ratios by 20%,
33% and 15%, respectively. In the case of emerging market banks, this ratio
has trended upwards since 2004.
The drivers of improved capital ratios have differed from one banking
system to another. Japanese banks, for example, have raised their capital
ratios by boosting their common equity by 60% while substantially expanding
their balance sheets, by 20% between 2008 and 2011 (Graph VI.3, centre and
right-hand panels). By contrast, the slower growth of equity capital at US and
European banks has accompanied slower asset expansion at US banks and
a shrinkage of assets at European banks. Even though such balance sheet
developments have generated headwinds for global economic recovery, they
are consistent with a welcome downsizing of the banking sector over the
long term.

Graph VI.3

While the growth of banks from advanced economies has slowed, banks
headquartered in emerging markets have been gaining in importance.
Reporting steadily rising common equity, the average emerging market bank
in a sample of large institutions worldwide is on a par with its US counterpart
in terms of loan volumes; it has also substantially increased its securities
investments (Graph VI.3, right-hand panel). Chinese and Indian banks in
particular expanded their balance sheets by roughly 75% between 2008
and 2011.
Banks’ traditional payout policy, combined with unstable income streams,
undermines their ability to consistently replenish capital cushions out of
earnings. Although retained earnings have been positive since 2008
(Graph VI.2, right-hand panel), this is due largely to trading income, which
tends to disappear at times of financial stress. In addition, banks have
pursued a policy of smoothing dividends, even during the crisis. In 2008, when
their earnings plummeted, banks dug into their already low capital buffers in
order to keep dividend payments at roughly pre-crisis levels (5% of book
equity). This practice could signal that shareholders’ short-term interests were
at odds with the objective to reduce banks’ credit risk. It might also reflect
expectations that official support would be forthcoming if necessary to keep
banks afloat.
Going forward, regulators will encourage large banks to use a wider range
of instruments, such as convertible bonds, in managing their capital base.
These include bail-in bonds, which protect depositors and taxpayers by
absorbing losses if a bank fails, and contingent convertible instruments
(cocos), which convert to equity if a bank is in distress in order to keep it
solvent and active. Several European banks have already issued cocos with
conversion triggers based on regulatory capital ratios. The role such financial
instruments will play in the future will depend to a large extent on whether they

70

BIS 82nd Annual Report

can attract sufficient demand from non-bank investors and whether the
conversion mechanism insulates issuer banks from speculative behaviour.
Liquidity positions
European banks’ reliance on wholesale funding, which proved unstable during
the crisis, remains high. Their ratio of (typically illiquid) loans to (stable) retail
deposits increased to 130% during the crisis and has hardly fallen since
(Graph VI.4, left-hand panel). This is in stark contrast to other banking systems,
which reported a loan-to-deposit ratio of roughly 75% in 2011. The stable funding
ratio – ie the sum of retail and long-term funding as a percentage of total funding –
paints a qualitatively similar picture (Graph VI.4, right-hand panel), suggesting
that maturity transformation on European banks’ balance sheets is substantial.
As the associated liquidity risks materialised in the course of 2011, banks across
the euro area lost access to traditional funding markets, prompting the Eurosystem
to conduct extraordinary LTROs in December 2011 and February 2012.
Individual banks will soon come under regulatory pressure to improve
their liquidity positions. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)
reports that, as of 30 June 2011, around half of the 205 banks included in a
quantitative impact study needed to make adjustments to their business
activities, reduce maturity mismatches or increase their liquid assets or longerterm funding in order to comply with forthcoming changes in liquidity
requirements.2 These banks had shortfalls of E1.76 trillion in liquid assets
(which represented 3% of the total assets in the aggregate sample) or
E2.78 trillion in stable funding. Of course, the different shortfalls should
not simply be added up, as a given action could allow a bank to meet
simultaneously different liquidity requirements.

Asset encumbrance
A crisis of confidence in funding markets has led banks to pledge an increasing
proportion of their assets as collateral for new debt issues. European banks in
particular have thereby offered more protection to creditors unnerved by these
banks’ legacy assets and exposures to troubled sovereigns (Graph VI.5, lefthand panel). This practice, however, encumbers assets in the sense that they
are no longer available to holders of a bank’s unsecured debt in the event the
bank fails. Since this raises the riskiness of unsecured debt, collateralised debt
becomes even more attractive to investors, potentially setting in motion a
vicious cycle. And when private sources of funding withdraw from markets,
banks use collateral to obtain official support, thus further encumbering their
balance sheets.
Industry estimates indicate that 20% of European banks’ assets were
encumbered in 2011. This aggregate number reflects the increased reliance of
some institutions on secured loans from central banks. A case in point is the
Greek banking sector, where the ratio of encumbered to total assets rose
tenfold between 2005 and 2011, to one third. For Irish, Italian and Portuguese
banks, this ratio more than doubled during the same period.
Asset encumbrance also weakens the ability of the system to absorb
shocks. The higher the proportion of its pledged assets, the more vulnerable a
bank is to margin calls in the event of collateral depreciation. And if a systemwide event triggered such calls, many banks would need to replenish their
collateral at the same time. Similar and simultaneous adjustments to banks’
balance sheets would weaken the intermediation capacity of the system.
As banks’ demand for pledgeable collateral has been on the rise, there are
signs that the supply of high-quality primary collateral has been shrinking
(Graph VI.5, right-hand panel; see also Chapter V). This development
strengthens incentives for firms to reuse collateral, pledging the same primary

asset several times so that it helps finance multiple investments by different
institutions (“rehypothecation”). Collateral repledging lubricates financial
transactions but also undermines systemic stability, for instance by reinforcing
the adverse effect of simultaneous margin calls.3

Immediate policy challenges
Restoring the health of the banking sector requires immediate policy actions.
Such actions would seek to rebuild market confidence in troubled banks. In
addition, in rapidly growing economies, regulators should ensure that buoyant
markets do not lead to risk-taking that undermines financial stability.
Many banks have not yet recovered from the crisis and thus have not
regained the trust of investors, as evidenced by debt holders’ increased demand
for collateral (see above). In addition, price-to-book ratios as low as 50% indicate
that equity investors have recently been as concerned about the underlying
value of banks’ assets as they were in the worst phases of the recent crisis.
Banks themselves have lost confidence in their peers, especially in the
euro area. Between end-2008 and end-2011, international interbank lending in
the euro area shrank drastically on a consolidated basis, thereby reversing an
equally dramatic surge between 2003 and 2008 (Graph VI.6, left-hand panel,
solid red line). Since banks from outside the region have not filled the gap
(solid blue line), some euro area banks have resorted to central bank funding
on a massive scale (centre panel).

Sovereign debt holdings are an important drag on banks’ efforts to regain
the trust of their peers and the markets at large. Of these holdings, exposures
to sovereigns on the euro area’s periphery are perceived as carrying
particularly high credit risk (see Chapter V). And for many banks headquartered
in the periphery countries, such exposures are much higher than common
equity (Graph VI.6, right-hand panel). They are also sizeable in the case of
large national banking sectors in other euro area countries. Thus, getting
sovereign finances in order is a key step towards a healthy banking system.
Confidence in the banking sector is also undermined by the opaqueness of
banks’ internal ratings models, which measure asset riskiness and guide banks
in setting their equity capital buffers. In a large cross section of big banks that
use internal ratings models, the end-2011 ratio of total equity to total assets
averaged 7% but was below 4% for one fifth of the institutions (for information
on the sample, see Graph VI.2). Given differences in banks’ balance sheets,
such large disparities in the size of capital buffers could be a sign of efficient
risk management if the internal models are correct. Conversely, they could
be a sign of systemic vulnerability if some models deliver overly optimistic
conclusions in order to justify low capital-to-assets ratios. Since the recent
crisis exposed flaws in internal ratings models, the rigorous assessment of
these models and the harmonisation of their application across jurisdictions
and individual institutions have become priorities for the BCBS.
In order to restore confidence in the banking sector, it is also critical that
policymakers put pressure on institutions to speed up the repair of their
balance sheets, as suggested by the successful resolution of the Nordic crisis
in the 1990s. And public authorities could use fiscal space, where available, to
alleviate the strain on banks. Once banks have recognised losses on troubled
assets and have recapitalised, their balance sheets will become stronger and
more transparent. This will help to reopen banks’ access to private sources of
unsecured funding, thus reducing asset encumbrance.
In addition, the writedown of bad assets would realign banks’ incentives
with the objective of fostering sustainable economic growth. Japan’s banking
crisis in the 1990s revealed that it may be in banks’ short-term interest to carry
problematic loans on their balance sheets in the hope of potential recovery.
Such forbearance often means that banks offer advantageous terms to their
troubled borrowers in order to keep them afloat as long as possible. In the
process, banks earn profits by overcharging strong borrowers. This practice
distorts relative prices and leads to a misallocation of credit. Signs of similar
forbearance emerged in 2011 in the United Kingdom, in an estimated one third
of commercial real estate loans and 5–10% of household loans, as well as in
the euro area (see also Chapter IV).4

For analysis of the Japanese experience, see J Peek and E Rosengren, “Unnatural selection: perverse
incentives and the misallocation of credit in Japan”, American Economic Review, vol 95, no 4, September 2005,

in Japan”, American Economic Review, vol 98, no 5, December 2008, pp 1943–77. For discussions
of forbearance by European banks in 2011, see Bank of England, Financial Stability Report, no 30,

Banks’ stakeholders should bear the burden of losses associated with
balance sheet repair. Such an outcome would improve the credibility of
official commitments to wean banks off government support. In turn, the
loss of government support would strengthen market discipline, as it would
give private investors an incentive to pay closer attention to banks’ inherent
health.
Despite the good performance of banks headquartered in emerging market
countries, there are questions about their underlying strength as well.
Reminiscent of advanced economies on the eve of the recent crisis, some
emerging market economies have been experiencing credit and asset price
booms (see Chapter III) that have inflated local banks’ results. Questions about
the sustainability of these booms naturally lead to questions about the
sustainability of bank performance. The task of authorities in emerging market
economies is thus to ensure that prudential policy reflects rigorous, throughthe-cycle assessments of the banks’ riskiness.

Long-term challenges for banks’ new business model
To enjoy long-term success, banks will need to adapt to a new financial
environment, shaped by the lessons of the recent crisis. A key challenge
will stem from permanently higher demand for assets that can be pledged
as collateral. As the role of central counterparties increases, for instance,
the collateral they demand for financial transactions is likely to encumber a
growing share of banks’ assets, even after the current crisis of confidence
has ended (see above). High asset encumbrance, together with new resolution
frameworks that will impose greater losses on bondholders in the event of
a bank’s failure, will permanently raise banks’ funding costs, all else being
equal.
The rest of this section discusses additional long-term challenges. First, it
assesses another source of upward pressure on banks’ funding costs – ie
the withdrawal of official support. Second, it discusses the scope for banks
to offset higher financing costs by managing their operating costs. The
section concludes with a review of the changing landscape of international
banking.
Official support
The withdrawal of official support for banks is still in the early stages. A number
of sovereigns have made explicit commitments to eliminate guarantees
to bank stakeholders; others, with deteriorating finances, are finding it
increasingly difficult to provide such guarantees (see also Chapter V).
Nevertheless, the perception that banks continue to receive substantial official
support persists.
Rating agencies assess the extent to which official support enhances
banks’ creditworthiness, which in turn lowers banks’ funding costs. Investors in
bank bonds are not directly exposed to borrowers’ inherent riskiness, which is
reflected in stand-alone ratings (Graph VI.1, bottom right-hand panel), because
they enjoy the protection of explicit and implicit government guarantees, which

all-in ratings take into account.5 A comparison of all-in and stand-alone ratings
reveals that rating agencies deem the official support for banks to have
increased substantially between 2007 and 2011 (Graph VI.7, left-hand panel).
At end-2011, such support lowered the spreads that banks had to pay for longterm bonds by an estimated 1–2 percentage points, or by 10 times more than
prior to the crisis (Graph VI.7, right-hand panel).
Likewise, equity investors have consistently accepted lower returns from
institutions perceived to receive more official support. An example of such
institutions is global systemically important banks (GSIBs): if they run into
trouble, public authorities are likely to shore them up in order to avoid a
system-wide fallout. All else being equal, from 1999 to 2009 the average
expected rate of return on GSIBs’ shares was 2 percentage points below that
on non-GSIBs’ shares (Graph VI.7, right-hand panel; see also Yang and
Tsatsaronis (2012), op cit).
By lowering funding costs, official support strengthens equity investors’
short-term preference for greater leverage. The holders of equity stakes in any
company tend to weigh asymmetrically the upside profit potential, from which
they gain fully through higher dividends or stock price appreciation, and
the downside risk of losses, which cannot exceed the size of the original
investment. As leverage increases the volatility of profits, it boosts the potential
gains but has no impact on maximum losses.

Box VI.B: Capital requirements under Basel II and Basel III
The Basel III framework, which covers the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking
sector, is the cornerstone of the G20 regulatory reform agenda. Following a coordinated effort by
27 countries, the BCBS issued the final rules for the Basel III framework in 2011. Basel III is substantially
more comprehensive in scope than its predecessor, Basel II, and it combines micro- and macroprudential
reforms that address both institution- and system-level risks.
Basel III includes new elements to boost banks’ capital base. First, it incorporates a significant
expansion in risk coverage, which increases risk-weighted assets. Specifically, it targets the instruments
and markets that were most problematic during the crisis – that is, trading book exposures, counterparty
credit risk and securitised assets. Second, and critically, Basel III tightens the definition of eligible capital,
with a strong focus on common equity (see Table VI.B). This represents a move away from complex
hybrid capital instruments that have proved to be incapable of absorbing losses in periods of stress.
Moreover, the definition of common equity is more restrictive under Basel III than under Basel II.
Specifically, Basel III calculates common equity after the bank’s balance sheet has been adjusted to
exclude assets that cannot be liquidated when the bank runs into trouble (eg goodwill and deferred tax
assets). In effect, only an estimated 70% of the common equity that banks currently hold and report
under Basel II would qualify as common equity under Basel III. Finally, Basel III also sets restrictions on
leverage (the ratio of equity to total assets), which serve as a backstop to the risk-based framework.
A unique feature of Basel III is the introduction of capital buffers that banks can use without
compromising their solvency, and surcharges, which counter individual banks’ contribution to systemic
risk. First, a conservation buffer is designed to help preserve a bank as a going concern by restricting
discretionary distributions (such as dividends and bonus payments) when the bank’s capital ratio
deteriorates. Second, a countercyclical buffer – capital that accumulates in good times and that can be
drawn down in periods of stress – will help protect banks against risks that evolve over the financial
cycle. Finally, a capital surcharge will be applied to systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), or
banks with large, highly interconnected and complex operations, in order to discourage the concentration
of risk. These international standards impose lower bounds on regulators: some countries may choose to
implement higher standards to address particular risks in their national contexts. This has always been
an option under Basel I and II, and it will remain the case under Basel III.
Combining these elements will significantly increase banks’ capital requirements. For example,
under Basel III a SIFI operating at the peak of the financial cycle could be asked to hold common equity
equal to 12% of its risk-weighted assets. Under Basel II’s less stringent definition of common equity, the
ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets would have had to increase to at least 15% for the same
bank. This means a more than sevenfold increase relative to the Basel II minimum, even without taking
into account the tougher and more comprehensive coverage of risk-weighted assets.
 See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking
systems, Basel, June 2011.  Estimates from the 30 June 2011 BCBS bank monitoring exercise suggest that banks held
common equity (Basel II definition) equal to roughly 10% of risk-weighted assets, equivalent to 7% under the stricter Basel III
definition. The 15% in the text assumes that banks’ non-qualifying capital (3%) remains a constant share of risk-weighted assets.

Buffer that restricts distributions if the capital ratio falls below 7%. 2 SIFIs will be placed in buckets according to their systemic
importance, whereas non-SIFIs will receive a zero surcharge. An empty bucket will be added on top of the highest populated
bucket to provide incentives for banks to avoid becoming more systemically important. If the empty bucket becomes populated
in the future, a new empty bucket will be added with a higher additional loss absorbency level applied. 3 A SIFI operating at the
peak of the financial cycle could be required to hold up to 12% of common equity against risk-weighted assets under Basel III.
Under the Basel II definition of common equity, the ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets would be roughly 15% for the
same bank. 4 Common equity plus additional Tier 1 capital.

As the crisis demonstrated, equity investors’ preference for higher
leverage is myopic. Over the long term, the higher volatility that comes with
higher leverage erodes short-term gains. Moreover, less leveraged banks have
been more resilient and delivered greater long-term value to their shareholders
as well as other stakeholders.6 Thus, a business model based on lower levels
of official support and on a robust capital base would result in sustainable
profits and should be attractive to the buy-and-hold equity investor. The
ongoing reform agenda aims to embed this principle in the regulatory
framework (see Box VI.B).
Going forward, a decrease in official support would contribute to a
healthier banking sector by ensuring that banks factor their inherent financial
strength into business decisions. For one, the withdrawal of government
guarantees would lead to stricter market discipline, giving banks an incentive to
behave more prudently. More generally, lower official support would make it
necessary for banks to improve their inherent risk profile in order to conduct
traditional activities. For instance, banks are viable financial intermediaries only
if they secure lower funding costs than their borrowers, which would otherwise
tap markets directly. As funding costs track credit ratings closely, a hypothetical
withdrawal of official support from European and US banks at end-2011 would
have made it difficult for them to obtain funding more cheaply than potential
borrowers rated A– or above (Graph VI.7, left-hand panel). Likewise, lower
ratings would have made it impossible for some banks to act as counterparties
in repo and derivatives transactions and engage in market-making activities
(see also Box VI.C on page 81).

Cost management
Cost cutting would be a natural post-crisis strategy in any sector. Banks’
modest progress in implementing such a strategy suggests that they have
unexploited potential to support healthy bottom-line profits in the long run.
Between 1997 and 2011, increases in banks’ income were associated with a
roughly one-to-one increase in costs (Graph VI.8, left-hand panel), suggesting
little in the way of efficiency gains (Graph VI.8, centre panel, and Table VI.1).
Banks’ reluctance to aggressively seek efficiency gains, which could
benefit their various stakeholders, is unfortunate. For one, better cost
management goes hand in hand with a more stable return on equity
(Graph VI.8, right-hand panel). In addition, the Nordic experience in the 1990s
has shown that cost cuts lead to a sustained recovery.7 Greater cost efficiency
also underpins a more flexible business model that can respond faster to a
changing risk environment, thus lowering the likelihood of bank failure.8
International banking
Many banks that face pressure to strengthen their capital positions have scaled
back both foreign and domestic activities (see also Chapter III). In addition to
writedowns of cross-border assets during the crisis, more expensive debt and
equity funding also led to reductions in the flow of cross-border credit. As a

result, credit to foreign borrowers has fallen as a share of internationally active
banks’ total assets (Graph VI.9, left-hand panel, red line). Although the share
has declined by only 10 percentage points since early 2008, the retrenchment
represents an estimated $5 trillion in foreign credit up to end-2011.
The contraction in the international portfolios of some European banks has
been particularly noteworthy. For example, Belgian, Dutch, French, German
and Italian banks combined reduced their foreign positions by more than
$6 trillion (43%) between early 2008 and end-2011. While the bulk of this
reduction occurred in the quarters following the collapse of Lehman Brothers,
foreign credit fell by more than $1.3 trillion (14%) in the second half of 2011, as
concerns over exposures to European sovereigns intensified. International
credit contracted faster than domestic lending, thus reorienting these banks’
balance sheets towards home markets (Graph VI.9, left-hand panel, green line).
That said, not all banks have reduced their foreign activities. The
internationally active Australian, Japanese, Spanish and Swedish banks have
stepped in and partially replaced the European banks mentioned above.
Combined, these banks’ foreign positions have grown by more than $850 billion
(18%) since mid-2010, with particularly strong growth of credit to borrowers in
emerging economies. In addition, banks from emerging markets have also
picked up some of the slack. While internationally active emerging market
banks still account for a small share (1.4%) of total foreign credit worldwide,
this share has risen markedly since 2007 (Graph VI.10, left-hand panel). For
example, from 2009 to 2011, these banks extended an estimated $1.1 trillion in
international syndicated loans, representing roughly 10% of the total number
of signings (Graph VI.10, right-hand panel). At the same time, euro area banks’
share of new loan signings dropped below 25%.

Box VI.C: Reforming OTC derivatives markets
Over-the counter (OTC) derivatives markets were not immune to the counterparty credit risk concerns
that crippled the financial system during the crisis. Positions in these markets – where participants
bilaterally trade interest rate, foreign exchange, credit and other derivatives contracts with each other or
with market-making dealers – grew steadily in the years leading up to the crisis (Graph VI.C, left-hand
panel). Yet the lack of information on how market positioning redistributed risk across the financial
system left authorities and market participants flat-footed when the crisis occurred. This box reviews
international initiatives that aim to address two weaknesses inherent in the bilateral nature of OTC
derivatives markets: counterparty credit risk and lack of transparency.
OTC derivatives contracts often involve lengthy commitments during which a position can
potentially generate a substantial counterparty credit exposure. At the same time, derivatives can also
embed leverage in balance sheets: large notional exposures often require a small initial outlay of cash,
but small changes in the value of underlying securities can abruptly expand potential liabilities. Thus,
counterparty credit risk can rise dramatically during times of market turbulence. Greater concentration in
these markets since 2007, when several large dealers either failed or left the market, has only
compounded these risks (Graph VI.C, right-hand panel). And the anticipated ratings downgrade of some
dealers could restrict their ability to make markets, thus leading to even greater concentration in the
future.
OTC derivatives markets are also quite opaque. Prices and quantities are known with certainty only
by the parties to a particular trade. Thus, in the years before the crisis, large concentrations of risk were
able to grow out of participants’ and regulators’ sight. The opacity of these markets also made it
impossible for participants to assess the health of their counterparties when the crisis broke, leading
many to cut back exposures to large dealers, aggravating liquidity shortages.
The centrepiece of the global reform agenda is the mandatory clearing of standardised derivatives
through central counterparties (CCPs). Central clearing of OTC derivatives through CCPs that meet strong
standards for capitalisation and risk management can reduce counterparty credit risk in at least two
ways.
First, a CCP can impose multilateral netting of exposures. Bilateral netting, whereby individual pairs
of counterparties agree to net their bilateral positions, can reduce notional exposures substantially; for
example, for CDS contracts, bilateral netting is estimated to reduce exposures tenfold. Multilateral
netting, whereby participants net all (or most) of their positions with a common counterparty, such as a
CCP, would reduce exposures further. However, a critical mass of gross positions is necessary for the riskreducing impact of multilateral, relative to bilateral, netting to kick in. Moreover, the benefits of
centralised clearing emerge only if contracts are standardised. Differences in terms and conditions across
traded instruments would make it difficult for a CCP to match and net contracts. This argues for a public
sector role in overcoming such collective action problems by mandating standardisation and central
clearing.
Second, a CCP can reduce counterparty credit risk by enforcing collateralisation of exposures. To
date, collateral arrangements in OTC derivatives markets vary and not all exposures are collateralised. In
contrast, CCPs can set standardised, risk-based rules for initial and variation margins. They can also keep
track of the collateral provided and owed by each clearing member, and manage the collateral assets.
A move to CCPs also improves transparency, since CCPs collect data on prices, volumes and
positions for standardised products. This facilitates the monitoring of exposures, enabling the private
and public sectors to track the build-up of certain kinds of risks in the financial system. Disclosure of
information can also aid valuation and price discovery in the markets for non-standardised derivative
products.
Three additional reform elements, applying to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives, complement
the shift of standardised contracts to central clearing. First, in order to stem risk-taking by banks, Basel III
regulation imposes higher capital charges on holdings of non-centrally cleared contracts. Second, the
BCBS and IOSCO are considering more stringent standards on margining for non-centrally cleared
derivatives to strengthen risk management. Finally, authorities are seeking to mandate that all OTC
derivatives contracts be reported to trade repositories.
By design, central clearing concentrates credit and other risks in the CCPs themselves. And, as more
and more trades are transacted through CCPs, the systemic importance of any given CCP will tend to
rise. Managing central counterparty risk requires that standards be put in place to ensure the robustness
and resilience of the CCPs themselves. The CPSS-IOSCO Principles for financial market infrastructures,

BIS 82nd Annual Report

81

published in April 2012, aim to provide these standards. They offer guidelines for ensuring that CCPs are
strongly capitalised, maintain explicit support agreements with their members and conform to strict
international standards for risk management.
Moreover, the FSB is coordinating work on four categories of safeguards, to ensure that global CCPs
do not introduce new systemic risks. First, there is a need to put in place cooperative oversight
arrangements, so that authorities have the information and the tools to assess and address risks to their
home markets. Second, fair and open market access, based on transparent and objective criteria, is
important to ensure a level playing field across dealers, customers and platforms. Only open access,
combined with cooperative oversight, will discourage the emergence of smaller, domestic CCPs that
could contribute to market segmentation without necessarily enhancing efficiency or stability. Third,
CCPs need liquidity backup arrangements, which first and foremost include self-insurance in the form of
a portfolio of liquid assets and prearranged credit lines in all of the currencies of the products they clear.
Finally, robust resolution regimes should be in place to ensure that essential market services are not
disrupted in the event of a CCP failure.
For more information, see CPSS-IOSCO, Principles for financial market infrastructures, April 2012.  Up to end-2011,
progress was uneven across markets. Roughly half of conventional swaps and overnight index swap (OIS) contracts were
centrally cleared, but only about one in 10 CDS was.

These differences in the degree to which banks have pulled back from
foreign markets since the onset of the crisis reflect in part differences across
funding models (Graph VI.9). Persistent differences between these models left
some banks more vulnerable than others to the disruptions in global funding
during the crisis. Indeed, credit that was extended and funded locally, as
opposed to across borders, proved to be more robust, as it was largely
insulated from the disruptions in wholesale funding markets. As a result,
supervisors in many host jurisdictions, who watched cross-border credit
evaporate, are encouraging the establishment of local subsidiaries and are
tightening local funding requirements. Reflecting this policy shift, banks’
tendency to lend to foreign residents from offices in the host country has
become more marked since 2008 at the aggregate level (Graph VI.9, centre
panel). Spanish banks, whose international activities have continued to
expand, extend and fund most of their foreign credit locally. By contrast,

Summing up
In the post-crisis period, the banking sector faces both short-term and longterm challenges. In the short term, banks need to repair their balance sheets.
This will entail writedowns of bad assets, thus imposing losses on banks’
stakeholders, and recapitalisation, which public funds could facilitate. With their
balance sheets repaired, banks will be in a better position to regain markets’
confidence and strengthen their liquidity positions, both domestically and
internationally, by drawing on traditional funding sources. In the long term,
banks should have sufficient inherent financial strength to perform key
intermediation functions without resorting to official support. And since the new
regulatory environment will put pressure on their profitability, banks will need
to adopt more aggressive cost management strategies than in the past.

The BIS: mission, activities, governance and
financial results

The mission of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is to serve central
banks in their pursuit of monetary and financial stability, to foster international
cooperation in those areas and to act as a bank for central banks.
In the light of the Bank’s mission, this chapter reviews the activities of the
BIS, and of the groups it hosts, for the financial year 2011/12; describes the
institutional framework that supports their work; and presents the year’s
financial results.
In broad outline, the BIS pursues its mission by:
•
promoting discussion and facilitating collaboration among central banks;
•
supporting dialogue with other authorities that are responsible for
promoting financial stability;
•
conducting research on policy issues confronting central banks and
financial supervisory authorities;
•
acting as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial
transactions; and
•
serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international financial
operations.
The BIS promotes international cooperation on monetary and financial
policy through its meetings programmes for officials from central banks and
financial sector supervisory authorities and through the Basel Process –
hosting international committees and standard-setting bodies and facilitating
their interaction in an efficient and cost-effective way.
In particular, the BIS hosts the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The BIS
supports the FSB’s objectives, which are to coordinate at the international level
the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting
bodies in order to develop and promote the implementation of effective
regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies and, in collaboration
with the international financial institutions, to address vulnerabilities affecting
financial systems in the interest of global financial stability.
The BIS research and statistics function addresses the needs of monetary
and supervisory authorities for data and policy insight.
The BIS banking function provides prime counterparty, agent and trustee
services appropriate to the BIS mission.

The meetings programmes and the Basel Process
The BIS promotes international financial and monetary cooperation in two
major ways:
•
through hosting bimonthly and other meetings of central bank officials; and
•
through the Basel Process, which facilitates cooperation among the
committees and standard-setting bodies hosted by the BIS in Basel.

BIS 82nd Annual Report

89

Bimonthly meetings and other regular consultations
At bimonthly meetings, normally held in Basel, Governors and other senior
officials of BIS member central banks discuss current developments and the
outlook for the world economy and financial markets. They also exchange
views and experiences on issues of special and topical interest to central
banks. In addition to the bimonthly meetings, the Bank regularly hosts
gatherings that variously include public and private sector representatives and
the academic community.
The two principal bimonthly meetings are the Global Economy Meeting
and the All Governors’ Meeting.
Global Economy Meeting
The Global Economy Meeting (GEM) comprises the Governors from 30 BIS
member central banks in major advanced and emerging market economies
that account for about four fifths of global GDP. Governors from another 19
central banks attend the GEM as observers.1 The GEM has two main roles:
(i) monitoring and assessing developments, risks and opportunities in the
world economy and the global financial system; and (ii) providing guidance to
three Basel-based central bank committees – the Committee on the Global
Financial System, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the
Markets Committee. The GEM also receives reports from the chairs of those
committees and decides on publication.
As the Global Economy Meeting is quite large, it is supported by an
informal group called the Economic Consultative Committee (ECC). Limited to
18 participants, the ECC includes all BIS Board member Governors, the central
bank Governors from India and Brazil, and the BIS General Manager. The ECC
assembles proposals for consideration by the GEM. In addition, the ECC
Chairman initiates recommendations to the GEM on the appointment of chairs
of the three central bank committees mentioned above and on the composition
and organisation of those committees.
Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, was elected by the BIS
Board as Chairman of both the GEM and the ECC with effect from 1 November
2011. He replaced Jean-Claude Trichet, who retired from his post as President
of the ECB with effect from the same date.
All Governors’ Meeting
The All Governors’ Meeting comprises the Governors of the BIS’s 60 member
central banks and is chaired by the BIS Chairman. It convenes during the
bimonthly meetings to discuss selected topics of general interest to its
members. In 2011/12, the topics discussed were:
1
The members of the GEM are the central bank Governors of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil,
Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia,
Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States and also the President of the
European Central Bank and the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Governors
attending as observers are from Algeria, Austria, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland,
Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, the Philippines, Portugal,
Romania and the United Arab Emirates.

increased investment in commodity-related financial products and how
this affects commodity markets;
•
current issues in global liquidity;
•
indebtedness, risks and growth;
•
the economic effects of central bank bond purchase programmes;
•
the policy relevance of central bank finances; and
•
internet-based economic indicators: implications for central banks.
The membership of two other groups – the Central Bank Governance
Group, which also meets during the bimonthly meetings, and the Irving Fisher
Committee on Central Bank Statistics – goes beyond that of the GEM, and
hence, by agreement with the GEM and the BIS Board, the All Governors’
Meeting is responsible for overseeing the work of those two groups.
Other regular consultations
During the bimonthly meetings, Governors of central banks in (i) major
emerging markets and (ii) small open economies gather to discuss themes of
special relevance to their economies.
The Bank hosts regular meetings of the Group of Central Bank Governors
and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), which oversees the work of the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision. The GHOS met twice during the year to
consider the Basel Committee’s proposed measures for global systemically
important banks (G-SIBs) and for assessing implementation of the Basel
regulatory framework. At its June meeting, the GHOS agreed on a set of G-SIB
proposals, including a methodology for assessing systemic importance, the
additional capital G-SIBs will be required to maintain and the arrangements by
which the requirements will be phased in. At its January meeting, the GHOS
endorsed the Basel Committee’s strategy for identifying differences in member
countries’ approaches that could raise prudential or level playing field
concerns. The strategy is to monitor each member country’s adoption of the
globally agreed rules and review members’ compliance with the international
minimum standards.
The Bank regularly arranges informal discussions among public and
private sector representatives that focus on their shared interests in promoting
a sound and well functioning international financial system. In addition, for
senior central bank officials, the Bank organises various meetings to which
other financial authorities, the private financial sector and the academic
community are invited to contribute. These meetings include:
•
the meetings of the working parties on domestic monetary policy, held in
Basel but also hosted at a regional level by a number of central banks in
Asia, central and eastern Europe, and Latin America;
•
the meeting of Deputy Governors of emerging market economies; and
•
the high-level meetings organised by the Financial Stability Institute in
various regions of the world for Governors and Deputy Governors and
heads of supervisory authorities.
Other meetings this year included two that are organised for senior
central bankers on a less frequent basis:
•
a special BIS meeting for Caribbean and Latin American central bank

Governors held in Basel on the occasion of the BIS Annual General
Meeting in June 2011; and
a May 2011 BIS meeting of Governors and senior officials from Africa and
other regions to discuss the monetary and financial stability issues facing
Africa in the wake of the global financial crisis.

The Basel Process
The Basel Process refers to the facilitative role of the BIS in hosting and
supporting the work of the international secretariats engaged in standard
setting and the pursuit of financial stability. A key example of the Basel Process
is the support the BIS provides to the Financial Stability Board, which
coordinates the work of national financial authorities and international
standard-setting bodies and whose work programme has been endorsed by
the G20 heads of state and government. Another aspect of the Basel Process is
the mandate given by the BIS to its own Financial Stability Institute (FSI) to
assist financial sector supervisory authorities worldwide in strengthening
oversight of their financial systems.
Features of the Basel Process
The Basel Process is based on four key features: (i) the synergies of co-location;
(ii) flexibility and openness in the exchange of information; (iii) support from
the economic research expertise and banking experience of the BIS; and
(iv) the dissemination of work.
Synergies. The BIS hosts the secretariats of nine groups, including the FSB,
that contribute to the pursuit of financial stability. These groups have their
own governance arrangements and reporting lines.
Various groupings of central banks and supervisory authorities set the
agendas of the following six:
•
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS): develops global
regulatory standards for banks and addresses supervision at the level of
individual institutions and as it relates to macroprudential supervision;
•
the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS): monitors and
analyses the broad issues relating to financial markets and systems;
•
the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS): analyses
and sets standards for payment, clearing and settlement infrastructures;
•
the Markets Committee: examines the functioning of financial markets;
•
the Central Bank Governance Group: examines issues related to the
design and operation of central banks; and
•
the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC): addresses
statistical issues of concern to central banks, including those relating to
economic, monetary and financial stability.
The remaining three groups hosted at the BIS are:
•
the FSB;
•
the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI); and
•
the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS).

92

BIS 82nd Annual Report

The physical proximity of these nine groups at the BIS creates synergies
that, regardless of the variation in governance arrangements, produce a broad
and fruitful exchange of ideas. In addition, by limiting costs through economies
of scale, the Basel Process represents a prudent use of public funds.
Flexibility. The limited size of these groups leads to flexibility and openness in
the exchange of information, thereby enhancing the coordination of their work
on financial stability issues and avoiding overlaps and gaps in their work
programmes. At the same time, their output is much larger than their limited
size would suggest, as they are able to leverage the expertise of the
international community of central bankers, financial regulators and
supervisors, and other international and national public authorities.
Supportive BIS expertise and experience. The work of the Basel-based
committees is informed by the BIS’s economic research as well as its banking
experience. The latter is derived from the BIS Banking Department’s working
relationships with market participants and its implementation of regulatory
standards and financial controls for the conduct of its banking operations.
Dissemination. The FSI facilitates the dissemination of the standard-setting
bodies’ work to official organisations.

Activities of BIS-hosted groups in 2011/12
The following pages review the year’s principal activities of the nine groups
hosted at the BIS.

Financial Stability Board
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) coordinates the work of national financial
authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops policies to
enhance global financial stability. It closely monitors whether these policies
are implemented fully and consistently.
More specifically, under its mandate from the G20, the FSB:
•
assesses vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system and identifies
and reviews the regulatory, supervisory and related actions needed to
address them, including the outcomes of those actions;
•
promotes coordination and information exchange among authorities
responsible for financial stability;
•
monitors and advises on market developments and their implications for
regulatory policy;
•
monitors and advises on best practice in meeting regulatory standards;
•
undertakes joint strategic reviews of the international standard-setting
bodies to ensure that their policy development work is timely, coordinated
and focused on priorities and that it addresses gaps;
•
supports the establishment of supervisory colleges and sets guidelines
for them;

BIS 82nd Annual Report

93

•

supports contingency planning for cross-border crisis management,
particularly with respect to systemically important firms; and
•
collaborates with the IMF to conduct early warning exercises.
The membership of the FSB consists of senior officials from finance
ministries, central banks and financial regulators and supervisors of 24
countries and territories2 as well as from the ECB and the European
Commission. It also includes representatives of international financial
institutions and of international standard-setting and central bank bodies.3
The FSB was chaired by Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy, until
November 2011, when he became President of the ECB. He was succeeded as
Chair of the FSB by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The FSB
also named a Vice-Chair, Philipp Hildebrand, Chairman of the Swiss National
Bank.4
The FSB operates through Plenary meetings of its membership; the
Plenary names the Chair of the FSB and appoints a Steering Committee. The
FSB also has three standing committees:
•
a Standing Committee on Assessment of Vulnerabilities, chaired by
Jaime Caruana, General Manager of the BIS;
•
a Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation,
chaired by Adair Turner, Chairman of the UK Financial Services Authority;
and
•
a Standing Committee on Standards Implementation, chaired by
Tiff Macklem, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada.
The Plenary has also established various working groups, which currently
cover a number of technical areas. The work of the FSB is supported by a
Secretariat, located at the BIS, comprising a staff of 24.
Plenary meetings were held in April, July and October 2011 and in
January 2012. As detailed below, the FSB was active in a wide range of areas
during the year, and several policy initiatives approved at the Plenary meetings
were endorsed in November at the Cannes Summit of the G20 Leaders.
Early warning exercises
As part of its regular activities, the FSB conducted two early warning exercises
in April and September in collaboration with the IMF. The IMF’s International
Monetary and Financial Committee and the G20 finance ministers and
central bank Governors received a confidential presentation of results and
recommended actions; the FSB focused on vulnerabilities and regulatory
challenges in the financial sector, and the IMF covered macroeconomic and
macro-financial vulnerabilities.

The international financial institutions are the BIS, IMF, OECD and World Bank. The international
standard-setting and central bank bodies are the BCBS, CGFS, CPSS, International Accounting Standards
Board (IASB), IAIS and International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).

Mr Hildebrand resigned as Vice-Chair in January 2012 following his resignation from the Swiss
National Bank. A new Vice-Chair has not been appointed.

Reducing the moral hazard posed by systemically important financial
institutions (SIFIs)
At their 2010 Seoul Summit, the G20 Leaders endorsed the FSB’s framework
to address the systemic and moral hazard risks associated with SIFIs. During
2011, critical policy measures were developed to implement this framework,
and timelines and processes were established to put them into effect.
These key measures include:
•
a new international standard to guide consistent reform of national
resolution regimes so that any failing financial institution can be resolved
without disruptions to the financial system and without exposing the
taxpayer to the risk of loss (the standard was announced by the FSB
on 4 November and published as Key attributes of effective resolution
regimes for financial institutions);
•
a mandatory resolvability assessment and a recovery and resolution plan
for each global SIFI (G-SIFI, an institution that is clearly systemic in a
global context) as well as a cross-border cooperation agreement between
relevant authorities for each G-SIFI;
•
requirements, developed through the BCBS, for global systemically
important banks (G-SIBs) to hold additional common equity capital above
the Basel III minimum standards; and
•
more intensive and effective supervision, including through stronger
mandates, resources and powers, and higher supervisory expectations
for firms’ risk management and data aggregation capabilities.
The international standard set out in Key attributes of effective resolution
regimes addresses deficiencies in existing tools and national legal frameworks
that hinder the resolution of failing systemic firms – including G-SIFIs, which
require cross-border resolution. Implementation will require legislative changes
in many jurisdictions.
On 4 November, in its Policy measures to address systemically important
financial institutions, the FSB published the names of an initial group of
29 G-SIFIs to which the resolution planning requirements will apply beginning
in 2012. The group of G-SIFIs will be updated annually and published each
November.
Improving the OTC and commodity derivatives markets
The G20 has made commitments to improve the functioning, transparency and
oversight of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market by end-2012 by
means of increased standardisation, central clearing, organised platform trading,
and reporting of all trades to trade repositories. The FSB has established two
groups to monitor and advance these reforms: the OTC Derivatives Working
Group (ODWG) and the OTC Derivatives Coordination Group (ODCG). The
ODWG issued reports in April and October 2011 on the progress of
implementation. The FSB has continued to press member jurisdictions to meet
the end-2012 deadline and to ensure the consistency of implementation across
jurisdictions. The FSB established the ODCG in November 2011 to improve the
coordination and consistency of the various international reform workstreams; it
is composed of the chairs of the BCBS, CGFS, CPSS, FSB and IOSCO.

Strengthening the oversight and regulation of shadow banking
The “shadow banking system” – credit intermediation involving entities and
activities outside the regulated banking system – can be a source of systemic
risk both directly and through its interconnectedness with the regular banking
system. Shadow banking can also create opportunities for arbitrage that
might undermine stricter bank regulation and lead to a build-up of additional
leverage and risks in the financial system as a whole.
In 2011, the FSB conducted the first in a projected series of regular
comprehensive monitoring exercises to assess risks from the shadow banking
system. In addition, work was set in train to develop, as needed, regulatory
policy recommendations by end-2012 for five key aspects of shadow banking
oversight:
•
banks’ interactions with shadow banking entities (including consolidated
supervision, risk-based capital for bank exposures and implicit support);
•
money market funds and their susceptibility to runs and other systemic
risks;
•
the regulation of other shadow banking entities;
•
securitisation, including retention requirements and transparency; and
•
securities lending and repurchase agreements (possibly including
measures on margins and haircuts).
Monitoring exchange-traded funds
In April 2011, the FSB published a note on the potential risks to financial
stability arising from the recent rapid growth and innovation in the market for
exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The note encouraged the financial industry to
adapt its risk management practices, disclosure and transparency to the pace
of innovation in the ETF market. The FSB will continue to closely monitor
developments in the ETF market and will consider policy actions as necessary.
Developing macroprudential frameworks and tools
Responding to a request at the November 2010 G20 Summit, the FSB, IMF and
BIS published a joint progress report in October 2011 on macroprudential
policy frameworks and tools. The main message of the report was that
effective macroprudential frameworks require institutional arrangements that
can: (i) ensure an open and frank dialogue among policymakers on policy
choices that have an impact on systemic risk; (ii) resolve conflicts between
policy objectives and instruments; and (iii) mobilise the right tools to limit
systemic risk.
Addressing data gaps
The data gaps initiative is part of the 20 recommendations set out by the IMF
and FSB in their November 2009 report, The financial crisis and information
gaps. In 2010, the FSB set up a group to develop ways to monitor financial
linkages among G-SIFIs and the concentration of exposures in the financial
system.
In an October consultation paper, Understanding financial linkages: a
common data template for global systemically important banks, the FSB

96

BIS 82nd Annual Report

proposed a new data template for G-SIBs that would substantially strengthen
the information on linkages among them by detailing their exposures and
funding dependencies by counterparty as well as by market, sector and
instrument. The new template would be introduced in stages.
Substantive progress has been made in addressing the legal and policy
issues associated with sharing commercially sensitive data. The project’s initial
implementation phase will share data among supervisors only.
Advancing transparency through the legal entity identifier
At their November 2011 Cannes Summit, the G20 Leaders asked the FSB
to recommend a global legal entity identifier (LEI) system for uniquely
identifying parties to financial transactions. The FSB is working towards a
recommendation in time for the G20 Leaders summit in June 2012.
Strengthening accounting standards
The G20 and FSB support the development of a single set of high-quality global
accounting standards. To that end, the FSB continues to encourage the IASB
and the United States’ Financial Accounting Standards Board to complete their
convergence project and is monitoring their progress in implementing specific
G20 and FSB accounting recommendations. The two accounting boards made
progress in 2011, but work remains ongoing in other areas of convergence.
Monitoring implementation and strengthening adherence to international
standards
To enhance its monitoring of agreed G20 and FSB financial reforms, the
FSB in collaboration with the relevant standard-setting bodies established a
Coordination Framework for Implementation Monitoring (CFIM), which was
announced in October and endorsed at the Cannes Summit.
The CFIM agenda is derived from the FSB Plenary, which determines
areas in which implementation of reforms is particularly important for global
financial stability. The CFIM ensures that these areas are subjected to moreintensive monitoring and detailed reporting. Current priority areas are the
Basel II, Basel 2.5 and Basel III frameworks; OTC derivatives market reforms;
compensation practices; policy measures for G-SIFIs; resolution frameworks;
and shadow banking.
The FSB’s most intensive monitoring mechanism is the peer review
programme, undertaken through its Standing Committee on Standards
Implementation, to evaluate member jurisdictions’ adoption of international
financial standards and FSB policies. The FSB previously completed country
peer reviews of Australia, Italy, Mexico and Spain, and in early 2012 it
concluded them for Canada and Switzerland.
The FSB completed a thematic peer review of deposit insurance systems.
The FSB also conducted a follow-up review of compensation practices, after
which the G20 Leaders asked the FSB for: (i) ongoing monitoring and public
reporting on compensation practices; and (ii) a bilateral complaint handling
process among national authorities to address firms’ concerns regarding
competitive fairness.

BIS 82nd Annual Report

97

In March 2010, the FSB began evaluating and encouraging jurisdictions’
adherence to standards for international supervisory and regulatory
cooperation and information exchange. In November 2011, the FSB published
the list of all jurisdictions evaluated, including those identified as noncooperative.
Mortgage underwriting principles
In October, following up on the recommendations of a peer review the
previous March, the FSB issued a consultation paper setting out principles
for sound mortgage underwriting. The final version was scheduled to be
published in April 2012.
Advancing consumer finance protection
An October 2011 FSB report, written in collaboration with the OECD and
other international organisations, covers policy initiatives, new institutional
arrangements and the work of regulators and supervisors in various areas of
consumer finance protection. The report identifies gaps where additional
international work could help advance consumer protection and financial
stability.
Financial stability issues in emerging market and developing economies
In response to a request by the G20, an FSB task force prepared a report on
financial stability issues of particular interest to emerging market and
developing economies. Working with staff members of the IMF and World
Bank and senior policymakers from some of the economies that are not
members of the FSB, the task force set out key issues, which included guidance
in the application of international standards; cross-border supervisory
cooperation; regulating and supervising small-scale non-bank lending and
deposit-taking institutions; managing foreign exchange risks; and developing
domestic capital markets. Endorsed by the G20 Leaders at the Cannes Summit,
the report recommends ways in which national authorities can address these
issues and supportive steps that the international community can take. The
FSB will monitor progress in implementing the recommendations.
Regional consultative groups
To facilitate its interaction with a wider group of countries, the FSB established
six regional consultative groups that bring together FSB members with 64
other jurisdictions in the Americas, Asia, the Commonwealth of Independent
States, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa. The
regional groups discuss vulnerabilities affecting regional and global financial
systems and the financial stability initiatives of the FSB and of the various
jurisdictions. The first meetings of these groups took place in late 2011 and
early 2012.
FSB capacity, resources and governance
The FSB has made improvements to its transparency, public accountability
and internal processes by expanding the information on its website, including

98

BIS 82nd Annual Report

the composition of the Plenary and the Steering and Standing Committees; by
increasing its use of public consultation; and by improving the geographical
and institutional balance in the membership of the Steering Committee.
Addressing a request from the G20 Cannes Summit, the FSB will deliver
proposals at the June 2012 Los Cabos Summit to further strengthen the FSB’s
capacity, resources and governance while maintaining strong links with the BIS.

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) seeks to enhance
supervisory cooperation and improve the quality of banking supervision
worldwide. It supports supervisors by providing a forum for exchanging
information on national supervisory arrangements, improving the
effectiveness of techniques for supervising international banks and setting
minimum supervisory standards.
The Committee, which generally meets four times a year, consists of
senior representatives of bank supervisory authorities and central banks
responsible for banking supervision or financial stability issues in the
Committee’s member countries. The Group of Governors and Heads of
Supervision (GHOS) is the Basel Committee’s governing body and consists of
central bank Governors and non-central bank heads of supervision from
member countries.
The leadership of the GHOS and the Committee changed during 2011. In
November, Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, succeeded JeanClaude Trichet as the Chairman of the GHOS; and in July, Stefan Ingves,
Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, succeeded Nout Wellink as Chairman of the
Committee.
Basel regulatory framework and supervisory issues
The Basel III framework, published by the Committee in December 2010,
comprehensively reforms the regulation, supervision and risk management of
the banking sector. The measures strengthen microprudential (bank-level)
regulation, which will help make individual banking institutions more resilient
to periods of stress; and they strengthen oversight of macroprudential
(system-wide) risks, which can build up across the banking sector and become
amplified by each phase of the business cycle. These two approaches to
supervision are complementary, as greater resilience at the bank level reduces
the risk of system-wide shocks. Since its publication of Basel III, the Committee
has focused on implementation of the framework and the further development
of regulatory standards and guidance.
Global systemically important banks
Addressing the dangers posed by global systemically important banks is part
of the broader effort by the G20 Leaders to respond to the financial crisis. The
Basel Committee’s work on G-SIBs, together with related efforts by the FSB
and others, is meant to reduce the “too big to fail” problem associated with

BIS 82nd Annual Report

99

systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). In November, after a
careful review of public comments, the Committee published final rules that
set out its regulatory framework for G-SIBs. The framework addresses the
methodology for assessing global systemic importance; the magnitude of
additional loss absorbency that G-SIBs should have; and the arrangements by
which the additional loss absorbency will be phased in. The motivation for the
rules was the recognition that cross-border negative externalities created by
G-SIBs needed measures beyond those contained in the Basel III framework.
The rules will enhance the going-concern loss absorbency of G-SIBs and
reduce the probability of their failure.
The assessment methodology for G-SIBs comprises five broad categories:
size, interconnectedness, lack of readily available substitutes or financial
institution infrastructure, global (cross-jurisdictional) activity and complexity.
Under the requirement for additional loss absorbency, G-SIBs must hold
common equity in excess of the minimum amount required under Basel III.
Depending on the assessment of a G-SIB’s systemic importance, it must hold
additional Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1) in the range of 1 to 2.5% of its
risk-weighted assets (in shorthand, 1 to 2.5% CET1). To discourage G-SIBs
from becoming even more systemically important, the rules specify the
imposition of a capital surcharge of up to 3.5% CET1 should the assessment of
their systemic importance grow materially beyond current levels.
The requirements for higher loss absorbency will be introduced between
1 January 2016 and end-2018, becoming fully effective on 1 January 2019, a
schedule that matches the timeline for introduction of the Basel III capital
conservation and countercyclical buffers.
In October, the joint FSB-BCBS Macroeconomic Assessment Group (MAG)
issued the report Assessment of the macroeconomic impact of higher loss
absorbency for global systemically important banks. It concluded that a
stronger capital standard for G-SIBs had a decidedly favourable cost-benefit
trade-off. The standard is likely to have at most a modest, temporary negative
impact on aggregate output during the transition period, whereas it confers a
much larger permanent net benefit by reducing the risk of financial crises,
which can have long-lasting effects on the economy. The MAG estimated that
the Basel III and G-SIB proposals together contribute a permanent annual
benefit of up to 2.5% of GDP – many times the cost of the temporarily slower
annual growth resulting from the reforms.
Liquidity
The central principle of the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is that banks
must have a stock of high-quality liquid assets available to meet their liquidity
needs in times of stress. In January, the GHOS reaffirmed its commitment to
introduce the LCR as a minimum standard in 2015. It also clarified the LCR
rules to emphasise that liquid assets accumulated in normal times are indeed
intended for use in times of stress, and the Committee will develop additional
guidance on the circumstances that would justify the use of those assets.
The GHOS endorsed the Committee’s approach to addressing specific
concerns regarding the assets qualified to meet the LCR and its investigation

100

BIS 82nd Annual Report

of some issues in the calibration of net cash outflows. The Committee will also
further examine the interaction of central banks with banks during periods of
stress to ensure that the workings of the LCR do not interfere with central bank
objectives. Any modifications to address the issues will not materially change
the framework’s underlying approach. The GHOS directed the Committee to
publish its final package by the end of 2012.
Upon the completion of its LCR review, the Committee will turn its
attention to the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). Due to be introduced in 2018
as a minimum standard, the NSFR is intended to limit banks’ overreliance on
short-term wholesale funding and to promote a sustainable maturity structure
for assets and liabilities.
Derivatives
During the year, the Committee addressed bank exposures to central
counterparties (CCPs) and to counterparty credit risk in bilateral trades.
CCP exposures. On 2 November, the Committee proposed capital requirements
for banks’ exposures to CCPs. The objective is to promote greater use of CCPs
for derivatives trades while ensuring that banks are appropriately capitalised
against the exposures they face. In considering public comments on the draft,
the Committee will also consider the broader set of reforms being proposed
by other standard setters to ensure that the collective impact provides
incentives for banks to use CCPs in preference to bilateral trades.
Bilateral counterparty credit risk. Basel II addressed the risk of counterparty
default and credit migration risk but not mark-to-market losses due to the
credit valuation adjustment (CVA). During the financial crisis, however, roughly
two thirds of losses attributed to counterparty credit risk were due to CVA and
only about one third were due to actual defaults. Therefore, in June the
Committee finalised the Basel III capital treatment for counterparty credit risk
in bilateral trades. The revised treatment slightly modifies the CVA, which is
the risk of loss caused by changes in the credit quality of a counterparty (also
referred to as the market value of counterparty credit risk).
The Committee estimates that, with the addition of the CVA risk capital
charge, the capital requirements for counterparty credit risk under Basel III will
approximately double the level required under Basel II (when counterparty
credit risk was capitalised for default risk only).
Own credit risk
The Committee issued a consultative document in December on the
application of own credit risk adjustments to derivatives. The Basel III rules
seek to ensure that deterioration in a bank’s own creditworthiness does not at
the same time lead to an increase in its common equity as a result of a
reduction in the value of the bank’s liabilities. The consultative paper proposed
that debit valuation adjustments (DVAs) for over-the-counter derivatives
transactions and securities financing should be fully deducted in the
calculation of CET1.

Basel III FAQ
After the December 2010 release of Basel III, the Committee issued a set of
frequently asked questions (FAQ) and responses to them. To promote
consistent global implementation of Basel III, the Committee will periodically
update the FAQ and include any necessary technical elaboration and
interpretative guidance in the answers.
Monitoring implementation and international consistency
Through its Standards Implementation Group, the Committee has set up
review systems for the implementation of capital standards for international
consistency and will regularly publish the results. A peer review system will
monitor the timetable for members’ implementation of the Basel regulatory
capital framework, which includes Basel II, Basel 2.5 (related substantially to
trading book exposures) and Basel III. The consistency review will monitor
whether members’ legislation and regulations are consistent with international
minimum standards. Likewise, the Committee will examine the measurement
of risk-weighted assets in both the banking book and the trading book to
ensure that the outcomes of the new rules are consistent in practice across
banks and jurisdictions.
The Committee’s October 2011 Progress report on Basel III implementation
was updated in April 2012, and regular updates will continue. The status
reports reflect the Committee’s intention that member countries fully and
consistently implement Basel II, Basel 2.5 and Basel III within the agreed
timelines.
Core principles
In December, the Committee issued for consultation a revision of its 2006
Core principles for effective banking supervision and the associated
assessment methodology. The revisions address many of the significant risk
management weaknesses and other vulnerabilities highlighted by the global
financial crisis. They also take account of several key trends and developments
in the past few years of market turmoil: the heightened prominence of
systemically important banks and the greater demand they place on
supervisory resources; the need for a system-wide perspective to address
systemic risk; and the increasing attention to measures for crisis management,
recovery and resolution that will reduce both the probability and
consequences of a bank failure.
The proposed revision merges the core principles and the assessment
methodology into a single document. The new document sets the principles in
a more logical structure that highlights the difference between what is
expected of supervisors and what supervisors expect of banks. The Committee
expects to publish the final version in 2012.
Trading book review
The Basel Committee is conducting a fundamental review of the regulatory
capital treatment for trading exposures. Such exposures consist of positions in
financial instruments and commodities held either for trading or to hedge

102

BIS 82nd Annual Report

other trading activities. Through the Committee’s market risk framework,
positions in the trading book are subject to capital charges against interest rate
risk, foreign exchange risk, equity position risk and commodities risk. The
Committee expects to conduct a public consultation on its proposals to revise
the market risk framework in 2012.
Disclosure
Definition of capital. During the financial crisis, deficiencies in the disclosure
of banks’ capital positions worsened uncertainties by hampering market
participants and supervisors in their assessments and cross-jurisdictional
comparisons of capital positions. In a consultative paper issued on
19 December, the Basel Committee proposed disclosure rules to improve the
transparency and comparability of a bank’s capital base and thereby enhance
market discipline.
Remuneration. Ensuring that remuneration is effectively aligned with risk and
performance is an essential element of preventing excessive risk-taking. In
practice, making employee compensation account for the risks that employees
take on behalf of their organisation has proved to be challenging. Additional
Pillar 3 requirements on remuneration were issued on 1 July to promote
market discipline by allowing market participants to assess the quality of a
bank’s compensation practices. These requirements should contribute to
greater consistency of disclosures on remuneration. They update the material
in the supplemental Pillar 2 guidance issued by the Committee in July 2009
and take account of the 2009 FSB statement of compensation principles and
related implementation standards.
In other action on remuneration, the Committee in May 2011 published
Range of methodologies for risk and performance alignment of remuneration,
which focuses on practical and technical issues regarding bonus pools and
compensation schemes. It clarifies the design of risk-adjusted remuneration
and highlights issues that may limit the effectiveness of the risk adjustment
methodologies. Through examples of bank practices and supervisory
experience to date, the report also offers an anecdotal picture of current
remuneration practices in the industry.
Operational risk
The regulatory capital adequacy framework envisages that the operational risk
discipline will continue to mature over time and converge towards a narrower
band of practices for the effective measurement and management of risk.
Towards that end, the Committee in June released two papers. The first,
Principles for the sound management of operational risk, covers three
overarching themes: governance, risk management and disclosure. It
highlights the evolution of industry practice and supervisory experience in
those areas since the release of an earlier version in 2003.
The second paper, Operational risk – supervisory guidelines for the
advanced measurement approaches, sets out supervisory guidelines relating
to governance, data and modelling.

Trade finance
After evaluating the impact of Basel II and Basel III on trade finance involving
low-income countries, the Committee in October adopted two technical
changes to the Basel regulatory capital adequacy framework. The
modifications are intended to facilitate trade with low-income countries by
improving their access to trade finance and by lowering the cost of trade
finance instruments. The Committee conducted its evaluation in consultation
with the World Bank, World Trade Organization and International Chamber of
Commerce.
Audit
In December, the Committee issued revised supervisory guidance for
assessing the effectiveness of the internal audit function in banks. This work
forms part of the Committee’s ongoing effort to encourage sound practices
within banks. The document updates the 2001 Internal audit in banks and the
supervisor’s relationship with auditors, especially in the light of the global
financial crisis.
Resolution
The Committee published a report in July on the status of changes to national
policies needed to establish effective regimes for the cross-border resolution
of SIFIs. The Committee had issued 10 recommendations on the topic in March
2010, and in November 2010 the FSB called for an assessment of progress.
The report found that progress is lacking in many jurisdictions, and it stressed
the need to accelerate reforms.
High-cost credit protection
Supervisors have become concerned about some recent credit protection
transactions and the potential for regulatory capital arbitrage. In December,
the Committee issued a statement intended to alert banks that supervisors
will be closely scrutinising credit risk transfers. It set out the Committee’s
expectation that supervisors will be reviewing those transfers in two contexts:
the Basel securitisation framework rules, and the broader framework of the
Pillar 2 supervisory review process and assessment of capital adequacy.

Committee on the Global Financial System
The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) monitors financial
market developments and analyses their implications for financial stability.
The CGFS is chaired by William C Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, who succeeded Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of
Canada, on 1 January 2012. Committee members consist of the Deputy
Governors and other senior officials from the central banks of 23 advanced
and emerging market economies and the Economic Adviser of the BIS.
During the year, assessments of the recent sovereign debt problems in
the euro area shaped much of the Committee’s discussions, which included

104

BIS 82nd Annual Report

the analysis of policy initiatives that could stop contagion among sovereigns
and break the link between sovereign risk and bank funding problems.
Committee members also examined the global implications of bank
deleveraging in the advanced economies, including the risk of spillovers to
emerging market economies. The economic and financial implications of the
earthquake disaster in Japan and potential disruptions from the realisation of
other risks were additional important topics.
To deepen its understanding of current policy issues and investigate
possible policy responses by central banks, the Committee commissioned a
number of in-depth analyses carried out by working groups of central bank
experts. The topics included:
•
sovereign credit risk and bank funding conditions;
•
the effects of regulatory and accounting changes on the fixed income
strategies of institutional investors; and
•
the macro-financial implications of alternative configurations for access
to CCPs in over-the-counter derivatives markets.
The Committee also contributed to ongoing discussions in other policy
forums. For example, for the G20 it helped to shape the evolving debate on
global liquidity with a report that developed a central bank view on relevant
concepts and policy responses. In addition, the CGFS further pursued its plans
to close gaps in statistical data with an agreement on major enhancements to
the BIS international banking statistics, for which it serves as the governing
body. These enhancements will help close the remaining gaps in the data
currently reported as well as improve the usefulness of the statistics in several
key areas:
•
monitoring the credit exposures of national banking systems;
•
tracking developments in the supply of bank credit and banks’ funding
patterns; and
•
measuring bank funding risk.

Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems
The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) contributes to
the strengthening of financial market infrastructures by promoting safe and
efficient payment, clearing and settlement arrangements. Comprising senior
officials from 25 central banks, the CPSS is a recognised international standard
setter in this area. The Committee has been chaired by Paul Tucker, the Bank of
England’s Deputy Governor, Financial Stability, since March 2012; the previous
chairman was William C Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York.
New standards
The CPSS and the International Organization of Securities Commissions
(IOSCO) scheduled for April 2012 the joint release of the final version
of Principles for financial market infrastructures, which had been issued
for public comment in March 2011. The document sets out new

BIS 82nd Annual Report

105

international standards to govern systemically important financial market
infrastructures (FMIs) – payment systems, central securities depositories,
securities settlement systems, CCPs and trade repositories. The 24 principles
reflect the lessons learned from the recent financial crisis as well as
the experience gained from applying existing standards during the past
decade.
The principles replace the three previous sets of CPSS and CPSSIOSCO standards, namely the Core principles for systemically important
payment systems (2001); the Recommendations for securities settlement
systems (2001); and the Recommendations for central counterparties
(2004). The CPSS and IOSCO believe that a single set of principles will
provide greater consistency in the oversight and regulation of FMIs
worldwide.
Compared with the existing standards, the new principles introduce a
more demanding regime for FMIs. Perhaps the four most crucial areas where
this is the case are the financial resources and risk management procedures
that an FMI uses to cope with the default of a participant; the mitigation of
operational risk; the links and other interdependencies among FMIs through
which operational and financial risks can spread; and the need for participation
criteria that are risk-based and permit fair and open access. Moreover, the new
principles address issues that are not covered by the existing standards,
including segregation and portability, tiered participation and general business
risk.
The report also contains a set of five responsibilities for the central banks
and other authorities that oversee or regulate the FMIs implementing the
principles. These duties include effective cooperation between authorities
where more than one has responsibility.
The CPSS and IOSCO have also scheduled two other documents to be
released for consultation. One is a framework for public disclosures by an FMI
that will give participants and others an accurate understanding of the risks
and costs of using it. The other document is an assessment methodology that
can be used to judge an FMI’s observance of the principles and a relevant
authority’s observance of responsibilities.
Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives data reporting and aggregation
In January 2012, the CPSS and IOSCO jointly released the final version of
OTC derivatives data reporting and aggregation requirements, which had
been issued for public comment in August 2011. The report discusses
data necessary for monitoring the impact of OTC derivatives markets
on financial stability. It specifies minimum requirements for reporting
transaction data to trade repositories, including the acceptable types of
data formats, and discusses access to data by authorities, reporting entities
and the public. The report also addresses tools such as legal entity
identifiers (LEIs), which are needed to aggregate data in a meaningful way.
Finally, it discusses the collection of certain additional data, such as master
agreement details, to help fill data gaps that hinder the assessment of
systemic risk.

Guidance on foreign exchange settlement risk
The Committee is working with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
to provide new guidance to supervisors on how banks should manage the
risks relating to settling foreign exchange transactions.
Other activities
In September 2011, the Committee published Payment, clearing and
settlement systems in the CPSS countries, the first of two volumes of a
reference work describing FMIs in member countries. In January 2012, the
Committee published the annual statistical update Statistics on payment,
clearing and settlement systems in the CPSS countries.

Markets Committee
The Markets Committee, chaired by Hiroshi Nakaso, Assistant Governor of the
Bank of Japan, is a forum for senior central bank officials to jointly monitor
developments in financial markets and assess their implications for central
banks’ liquidity management operations. Currently, 21 central banks are
represented on the Committee.
Mounting concerns over sovereign debt and a weakening global
economic outlook shaped the Committee’s discussions during the year. The
Committee closely monitored developments in euro area sovereign debt
markets and examined their impact on the ability of banks to obtain market
funding. A recurring topic was central bank actions to provide liquidity – both
in euros and in US dollars – and to broaden the availability of eligible collateral.
The deterioration in investor confidence in the third quarter of 2011 drew the
Committee’s attention to the heightened volatility in the foreign exchange
market and the related policy responses. And as major central banks rolled out
another round of quantitative and credit easing, the Committee examined its
effects on financial markets and the challenges of communicating policy
commitment in an unconventional policy environment.
In addition to its regular meetings, the Committee convened the third
meeting of the Working Party on Markets in Latin America in July 2011.
Hosted this time by the Bank of Mexico, the meeting brought together senior
officials in the market operations area of major central banks in Latin America
and their counterparts from outside the region. The agenda covered three
broad topics: (i) recent market developments; (ii) trends in capital flows, their
impact on markets and perspectives on policy responses; and (iii) technical
and policy issues related to the various uses of debt securities in central bank
operations.
The Committee undertook two projects during the year. One was a factfinding study on high-frequency trading to better understand how it has
influenced the structure and functioning of the foreign exchange market in
recent years. The results were presented to Governors and released as a
Markets Committee publication in September 2011. Its second project was part
of the preparation of the 2013 BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign

BIS 82nd Annual Report

107

Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity. The Committee established a
technical experts group to: (i) develop a number of refinements to the survey’s
counterparty and execution method categories; and (ii) improve the global
coverage of major emerging market currencies, which are increasingly traded
offshore.

Central Bank Governance
The Central Bank Governance Group, comprising representatives from
nine central banks and chaired by Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank
of Israel, serves as a venue for the exchange of views on the design and
operation of central banks as public policy institutions. In addition, it
prioritises the work on this topic that is carried out through the BIS and the
more than 50 central banks that make up the Central Bank Governance
Network. During the past year, the Governance Group addressed the
evolving circumstances of central banks in several ways. It completed a
report on the implications of their new financial stability responsibilities, it
initiated a round of discussions on the challenges arising from changing
mandates and circumstances more broadly, and it conducted work on the
financial strength that central banks need in order to be effective in the postcrisis world.

Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics
The Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC) is a forum for
central bank economists and statisticians to address statistical topics related
to monetary and financial stability. During the year, the IFC:
•
conducted a workshop on data issues and related policy implications in
the real estate sector, in cooperation with the Central Bank of Chile, in
April 2011 in Santiago;
•
co-sponsored a seminar with the Central Bank of Ireland on bridging data
gaps, in August 2011 in Dublin;
•
organised more than 10 sessions at the 58th World Congress of the
International Statistical Institute, in August 2011 in Dublin; and
•
surveyed the IFC membership in summer 2011 regarding existing and
new data collections by central banks as well as actions taken to improve
data collection and dissemination.
In its report to the BIS All Governors’ Meeting in November 2011, the
Committee conveyed two key messages:
•
there is an urgent need to improve data-sharing between organisations at
the national and international level and to overcome confidentiality
constraints and obstacles to the exchange of data; and
•
central banks, individually and collectively, are useful as a catalyst for
change in a wide range of economic and financial statistics.
Muhammad Ibrahim, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia,
became the Chairman of the IFC in November 2011. During the year, the

International Association of Deposit Insurers
The International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) provides a forum for
deposit insurers, central banks and international organisations to enhance the
effectiveness of deposit insurance and bank resolution systems and cooperate
on related financial stability issues. Currently, 83 organisations, including 64
deposit insurers, are members of IADI or are affiliated with it as participants.
IADI provides guidance on the establishment or enhancement of effective
deposit insurance systems as well as on training, outreach, educational
programmes and research.
Core principles
IADI representatives participated in an FSB peer review of the deposit insurance
systems of FSB members to assess their alignment with the IADI-BCBS Core
principles for effective deposit insurance systems, which is a document on the
FSB list of key standards for sound financial systems. The IADI representatives
provided valuable input from the practitioners’ perspective. The IMF and World
Bank intend to assess compliance with the core principles in their joint
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and in their joint Reports on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC). In consultation with the BCBS
and other international bodies in this context, IADI will produce a set of papers
to update the core principles and develop new guidance as needed to achieve
compliance and advance best practices for deposit insurance systems.
Initiatives for enhancing deposit insurance systems worldwide
In collaboration with the IMF, the World Bank and the European Forum of Deposit
Insurers (EFDI), IADI presented workshops in Albania and Nigeria during 2011 to
train IADI and EFDI members to assess compliance with the core principles.
IADI and the FSI continue to collaborate on the creation of in-person and
online training programmes and seminars for deposit insurers, financial sector
supervisors, finance ministries and central banks worldwide. This year, IADI
held seven in-person programmes, including “Core principles assessment
methodology for deposit insurance”, a seminar conducted with the FSI at the
BIS. IADI and the FSI also completed a tutorial on the core principles, and a
tutorial being developed will cover bank resolutions from a deposit insurer’s
perspective. For ease of access to these online training programmes, each IADI
member receives a subscription to FSI’s online resource, FSI Connect.
IADI conducts research through its Research and Guidance Committee
and jointly with the IMF. IADI work in process covers deposit insurance fund
sufficiency, Islamic deposit insurance, the payout process, early detection and
timely intervention, and the handling of systemic crises. In addition, IADI has
recently completed research papers on deposit insurance mandates and on
claims and recoveries.

BIS 82nd Annual Report

109

In 2010, IADI created a Financial Inclusion and Innovation Subcommittee
(FIIS) within its Research and Guidance Committee to provide a vehicle
for IADI to engage with the G20 and other standard-setting bodies and
international entities on issues related to financial inclusion and deposit
insurance. The FIIS is currently studying ways that issues related to financial
inclusion may interact with IADI’s mandate, and it is documenting IADI
members’ financial inclusion practices.
Meetings, seminars and conferences
IADI’s October 2011 Annual General Meeting and Conference and an Executive
Council Meeting were hosted in Warsaw by the Bank Guarantee Fund of
Poland. More than 200 participants from over 50 countries attended the
conference, which focused on the issue of strengthening financial stability
frameworks. Executive Council meetings and Standing Committee meetings
were also hosted by the BIS, in June 2011 in Basel; and by the Savings Deposit
Insurance Fund of Turkey, in February 2012 in Istanbul.
In addition, IADI’s eight regional committees and 12 partner organisations
sponsored regional events throughout the year relating to deposit insurance
as a safety net during financial crises. Topics included compliance with, and
assessment of, the core principles; public awareness training; integrated
deposit insurance systems; Islamic deposit insurance; resolution of problem
banks; and purchase-and-assumption arrangements.

International Association of Insurance Supervisors
The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is the
international standard-setting body for prudential supervision of the insurance
industry. The mission of the IAIS is to promote effective and globally consistent
regulation and supervision of the insurance industry in order to develop and
maintain fair, safe and stable insurance markets for the benefit of policyholders;
and to contribute to global financial stability.
Financial stability
The IAIS is actively assessing the regulatory reforms recommended by the
FSB, including the development of indicators for assessing the systemic
importance of insurers and devising potential related policy measures. The IAIS
made a proposal to the FSB on an assessment methodology for systemically
important insurers, and public consultations have been scheduled. In addition,
the IAIS now monitors the insurance sector’s macroeconomic and financial
market environment. It is developing a framework for macroprudential
surveillance of the insurance sector that differentiates the scope for potential
supervisory action from the powers of central banks. The framework may
include macroeconomic stress testing in the insurance sector.
On 15 November 2011, the IAIS published a paper, Insurance and
financial stability, showing that insurance underwriting risks are in most
cases not correlated with the business cycle or with financial market

110

BIS 82nd Annual Report

risks. The paper also explains that the magnitude of insurance
liabilities is, in very broad terms, not affected by financial market losses. For
example, although the financial crisis affected insurers, those engaged in
traditional insurance activities were not a concern in terms of systemic risk.
The main concern relates to those insurers engaged in significant nontraditional and non-insurance activities that in a crisis could generate
systemic effects.
Insurance core principles
At its general meeting on 1 October 2011, the IAIS adopted revisions to its
Insurance core principles, standards, guidance and assessment methodology.
The revised insurance core principles (ICPs) incorporate lessons of the
financial crisis, address FSB recommendations and reflect the evolution
of supervisory and industry practices. The revised document organises
the supervisory material into a hierarchy, with ICPs at the top, standards
for implementation of the ICPs at the next level, and guidance at the third
level.
Accounting
The IAIS has a strong interest in ensuring high-quality financial reporting that
offers a meaningful and economically sound portrayal of insurers’ financial
health. It closely monitors the international financial reporting developments
that will most influence the overall accounting model for regulated insurance
enterprises. The IAIS regularly meets with the IASB to provide input on the
development of rules relating to insurance contracts and other standards of
importance to insurers.
Supervisory Forum
In June 2011, the IAIS established the Supervisory Forum to provide a platform
for insurance supervisors to exchange information on supervisory practices.
The participants, who focus on large insurers and insurance groups, discuss
existing and emerging trends and risks; share ideas and experience
on supervisory methodologies; and evaluate the potential impact of
macroeconomic stress scenarios on large or complex insurers and insurance
groups. The Supervisory Forum also collaborates with other IAIS committees
and provides practical input to IAIS projects.
Internationally active insurance groups
The IAIS continues to develop the Common Framework for the Supervision of
Internationally Active Insurance Groups (ComFrame). ComFrame should lead
to more consistency regarding each jurisdiction’s supervision of internationally
active insurance groups (IAIG). On 1 July 2011, the IAIS circulated its
ComFrame concept paper, inviting comments from IAIS members and
observers about the proposed direction. The IAIS will issue a draft ComFrame
document for comment in mid-2012. The IAIS plans to conclude its
development of ComFrame in 2013, after which it will undertake an impact
assessment and a calibration phase.

Reinsurance and IAIS market reports
In December 2011, the IAIS published the last issue of the Global reinsurance
market report. The report discussed stress testing in insurance and reinsurance
supervision and identified emerging trends, common practices and next steps.
Global reinsurers – firms that, for a fee or premium, agree to indemnify
an insurer against losses on one or more insurance contracts – are important
for the efficient functioning of sound insurance markets. Reinsurers bolster the
ultimate security of insurers, thereby protecting customers and contributing to
overall financial stability.
In 2012, the IAIS will introduce the Global insurance market report, which
will cover key developments in both reinsurance and global insurance. The
unified analysis underscores the fact that insurance and reinsurance are two
sides of the same coin.
Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding
The IAIS Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMoU), which became
operational in June 2009, is a framework for cooperation and exchange of
information that aims to improve the effectiveness of cross-border supervision
of insurance companies. It is also expected to contribute to the global efforts
to enhance the regulation of systemically important financial institutions.
This year, participation in the MMoU grew to 22 signatories, and another
22 applications were being validated.
Standards observance
The IAIS Standards Observance Subcommittee, created in October 2010, is in
the process of conducting assessments and coordinating peer reviews on the
implementation of the revised ICPs; it is beginning with the ICPs on Mandate
and Supervisory Powers and on Group-wide Supervision.
More broadly, the IAIS organises regional seminars and workshops to
assist insurance supervisors in implementing IAIS principles, standards and
guidance in collaboration with the FSI, national insurance supervisory
authorities and other bodies.
IAIS: www.iaisweb.org

Financial Stability Institute
The mandate of the Financial Stability Institute (FSI) is to assist financial sector
supervisory authorities worldwide in strengthening oversight of their financial
systems. Over the past year, as national authorities began implementing rules
recently developed by the global standard setters for supervision of the
banking and insurance sectors, the FSI intensified its work in assisting them
with the implementation of the new regulatory standards.
Meetings, seminars and conferences
The first main area of FSI outreach is the well established series of high-level
meetings, seminars and conferences targeted at banking and insurance sector
supervisors and central bank financial stability experts. In 2011, the FSI

112

BIS 82nd Annual Report

organised 51 such events at venues around the world, many of which were
held in partnership with regional groups of supervisors. The high-level
meetings for Governors and Deputy Governors of central banks and heads of
supervisory authorities took place in Africa, Asia, central and eastern Europe,
Latin America and the Middle East. The meetings focused on financial stability,
macroprudential tools and policies, regulatory priorities and other key
supervisory issues. As in 2010, the seminars programme focused on financial
regulatory reform. Many of the seminars used the extensive case study
developed by the FSI that implements a range of supervisory concepts
highlighted in Basel III. Approximately 2,000 representatives of central banks
and banking and insurance supervisory authorities participated in FSI events
during 2011.
FSI Connect
The second main area of FSI outreach is FSI Connect, an online information
resource and learning tool for financial sector supervisors at all levels of
experience and expertise. It now includes more than 220 tutorials covering
a wide range of topics. More than 9,000 users from approximately
230 subscribing central banks and supervisory authorities have access to FSI
Connect. In 2011, the FSI expanded to more than 30 the number of tutorials it
offers on insurance sector supervision. It also initiated an extensive two-year
project to update all tutorials that were affected by Basel III.

Research and statistics
Through its research function, the BIS addresses economic and financial
issues important to central banks and financial supervisory authorities. Most
of the resulting research and analysis is published through the Bank’s principal
outlets – the Annual Report, the BIS Quarterly Review, BIS Papers, BIS Working
Papers and the Bank’s website (www.bis.org) – as well as in external
professional publications. In addition, the research function collects, analyses
and disseminates statistical information for central banks and the general
public on key elements of the international financial system. The research
function also supports the BIS mission by developing background material for
meetings of senior central bankers, and it provides secretariat and analytical
services to the various groups hosted by the BIS in Basel.

Research focus
In line with the Bank’s mission, the focus of BIS research is on monetary and
financial stability. As in previous years, a principal theme of the work was the
policy implications of the morphing global financial crisis.
One strand of work explored the nexus between the international
monetary and financial system and the performance of the global economy. At
issue were the concept, measurement and policy implications of global
liquidity and its relationship with imbalances in the current account. Making
extensive use of the BIS’s unique international financial statistics, the research

BIS 82nd Annual Report

113

included detailed studies on international banking and on segments of the
foreign exchange market.
A second element of work examined the link between the macroeconomy
and public and private balance sheets. The investigation included in-depth
analysis of the financial cycle and its relationship with the business cycle, and
it explored the interplay between the financial health of the sovereign and that
of the banking sector.
A third component focused on prudential and structural policies designed
to make the financial system more resilient. The analysis examined strengths
and weaknesses of macroprudential policy instruments such as countercyclical
capital buffers and macro stress tests, and it considered key aspects of the
financial infrastructure, including the architecture of central counterparties.
The fourth component studied the evolution of monetary policy in the
wake of the global financial crisis. It analysed the effectiveness and limitations
of balance sheet policies at central banks, such as large-scale asset purchases
and the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, and it assessed changes
in the transmission mechanism of policy.
The BIS research function annually organises a number of conferences
and workshops in which participation bridges the worlds of policy, research
and business. The leading event is the BIS Annual Conference. In June 2011,
the 10th BIS Annual Conference addressed the implications of fiscal policy
for macroeconomic, monetary and financial stability. In February 2012,
the BIS and the ECB jointly organised a workshop on global liquidity in
the international monetary and financial system.

International statistical initiatives
The BIS has been collecting and disseminating data on cross-border claims
and liabilities of internationally active banks for several decades. This year, it
focused on a multistage process of improving these data according to the
recommendations of a CGFS task force. In the first stage of the process, central
banks will enhance the reporting of residency-based cross-border data by
providing more currency detail, decomposing counterparty data by nationality
of the reporting bank, and introducing positions on residents in domestic
currency. The BIS expects the new data to be initially reported as of the second
quarter of 2012. In the second stage, central banks will report a more detailed
sectoral breakdown in both the locational and consolidated banking statistics.
The latter will also be extended to include the liability positions of banks,
including capital. The target for the second stage of data is as of the fourth
quarter of 2013.
In June 2011, the BIS began publishing its international banking statistics
via its Webstats online search and retrieval facility. Users can now interactively
search for data and download them in various formats, including SDMX.
The BIS co-sponsors the SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange)
programme, which produces and maintains technical standards and contentoriented guidelines for the exchange of statistical information. Webstats:
http://stats.bis.org; SDMX: www.sdmx.org

114

BIS 82nd Annual Report

Through its public website, the BIS continued to improve the
dissemination of residential and commercial property price indices that it
collects in its Data Bank from national sources. The Data Bank contains key
economic indicators reported by almost all BIS shareholding central banks,
additional detailed macroeconomic series from major advanced and emerging
economies, and data collected by various BIS-hosted groups. More thought is
being given to using the Data Bank for calculating long series of important
economic variables.
The BIS is represented in a number of other international committees
focused on statistics, including the Inter-Agency Group on Economic and
Financial Statistics (IAG).5 During the year, these committees addressed the
information gaps revealed by the financial crisis, with much of the effort
concentrated on the recommendations to the G20 made by the FSB and the
IMF. Also, the Working Group on Securities Databases, which consists of the
BIS, ECB and IMF, developed the third part of the Handbook on securities
statistics, covering the issuance and holdings of equity securities.
A long-term BIS project to improve the compilation of international
and domestic statistics on debt securities is nearing completion. The project
envisages three changes: (i) define an “international issue” as a debt security
issued outside the market in which the borrower resides; (ii) align published
breakdowns with the recommendations in the Handbook on securities
statistics; and (iii) make greater use of statistics reported by central banks
to compile data on domestic and total debt securities. The BIS intends to
disseminate improved data on securities issues on its website and to facilitate
the release of additional data from national sources as they become available.

Other central bank initiatives to which the BIS lends support
The BIS contributes to the activities of regional central banks. During the past
year, it supported the events sponsored by the following organisations:
•
CEMLA   (Center for Latin American Monetary Studies) – banking,
macroprudential policy, monetary policy, payment and settlement
systems;
•
the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN) Research and Training
Centre – central bank communications, financial stability and supervision,
monetary policy, payment and settlement systems;
•
the Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute of Eastern
and Southern Africa – payment and settlement systems, portfolio
management, risk management.
BIS experts also contributed to events organised by the Bank of France’s
International Banking and Finance Institute, the Bank of England’s Centre for
Central Banking Studies and the Bank of Japan.

In addition to the BIS, the IAG comprises the ECB, Eurostat, IMF, OECD, United Nations and World
Bank.

Financial services of the Bank
The BIS offers a wide range of financial services designed specifically to assist
central banks and other official monetary authorities in the management of
their foreign reserves. Some 140 such institutions, as well as a number of
international organisations, make active use of these services.
Safety and liquidity are the key features of the BIS’s credit intermediation
services, which are supported by a rigorous internal risk management
framework. Independent control units reporting directly to the BIS Deputy
General Manager monitor and control the related risks. A compliance and
operational risk unit monitors operational risk, while a risk control unit controls
the Bank’s financial risks, ie credit, liquidity and market risks. The risk control
unit is also responsible for coordinating activities in order to provide an
integrated approach to risk management.
BIS financial services are provided from two linked trading rooms: one in
Basel, at the Bank’s head office; and one in Hong Kong SAR, at its Asian Office.

Scope of services
In response to the diverse and constantly evolving needs of central banks, the
BIS offers an extensive array of investment possibilities in terms of currency
denomination, maturity and liquidity. The Bank offers tradable instruments in
maturities ranging from one week to five years – Fixed-Rate Investments at the
BIS (FIXBIS) and Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs); structured products with
embedded optionality; and traditional money market placements, such as
sight/notice accounts and fixed-term deposits. In addition, the Bank provides
short-term liquidity facilities and extends credit to central banks, usually on a
collateralised basis. The Bank also acts as trustee and collateral agent.
The Bank transacts foreign exchange and gold on behalf of its customers,
providing access to a large liquidity base in the context of, for example, regular
rebalancing of reserve portfolios or major changes in reserve currency
allocation. The foreign exchange services of the Bank encompass spot
transactions in major currencies and Special Drawing Rights (SDR) as well as
swaps, outright forwards, options and dual currency deposits (DCDs). In
addition, the Bank provides gold services such as sight accounts, fixed-term
deposits, earmarked accounts, upgrading and refining, and location exchanges.
The BIS provides asset management services in sovereign securities and
high-grade credit fixed income instruments. These may take the form of a
dedicated portfolio mandate negotiated between the BIS and a customer; or the
services may be supplied through an open-end fund structure – the BIS
Investment Pool (BISIP) – that allows customers to invest in a common pool of
assets. Both investment structures are offered as either single currency or
multicurrency mandates in the world’s major reserve currencies: the US dollar,
euro, sterling and yen. For multicurrency mandates, the investor can choose from
portfolios that are either hedged back into the base currency or left unhedged.
Dedicated mandates are designed according to each customer’s
preferences with regard to investment guidelines and benchmarks. In contrast,
BISIPs are similar to mutual funds or unit funds but specifically cater to the

116

BIS 82nd Annual Report

investment criteria typical of central banks and international institutions.
Separately, EMEAP (Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks)
has mandated the BIS to administer the two Asian Bond Funds, ABF1 and
ABF2, under the BISIP umbrella: ABF1 is managed by the BIS and ABF2 by a
group of external fund managers.
The BIS, in cooperation with a group of advising central banks, has
established a BISIP in US inflation-protected government securities. The
management of this pool of assets is conducted by a group of external
investment firms, while the administration is performed by the BIS.
The BIS Banking Department also hosts global and regional meetings,
seminars and workshops on reserve management issues. These meetings
facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience among reserve managers
and promote the development of investment and risk management capabilities
in central banks and international organisations.

Financial operations in 2011/12
In 2011/12, financial markets were largely driven by the evolution of the euro
area sovereign debt crisis, tighter funding conditions in credit markets and
periods of high volatility. Against this background, the Bank’s balance sheet
total fluctuated between SDR 280 billion and SDR 230 billion. For the year, it
decreased by SDR 5.4 billion, following a marginal increase of SDR 2.2 billion
in the previous year. As a result, the balance sheet total at 31 March 2012 was
SDR 255.7 billion.
Liabilities
Customer placements constitute the largest share of total liabilities (see
graph). On 31 March 2012, customer placements (excluding repurchase
agreements) amounted to SDR 215.4 billion, compared with SDR 228.4 billion
at the end of 2010/11. This net decrease resulted from the contraction of both
customer currency and gold placements.
About 91% of customer placements are denominated in currencies, with
the remainder in gold. Currency deposits decreased from SDR 207.1 billion a
year ago to SDR 195.8 billion at end-March 2012. That balance represents
some 2.7% of the world’s total foreign exchange reserves – which totalled
nearly SDR 6.6 trillion at end-March 2012, up from SDR 6.4 trillion at endMarch 2011.6 The share of currency placements denominated in US dollars
was 70%, while euro- and sterling-denominated funds accounted for 14% and
7% respectively.
The net decrease in customer currency placements resulted mainly from
a contraction of 26% in fixed-term deposits, which was partially offset by an
increase of 41% in sight and notice deposit accounts and of 6% in MTIs.
Gold deposits amounted to SDR 19.6 billion at end-March 2012, a
decrease of SDR 1.6 billion for the financial year.

Assets
As in the previous financial year, most of the assets held by the BIS consist
of government and quasi-government securities plus investments (including
reverse repurchase agreements) with highly rated commercial banks of
international standing. In addition, the Bank owned 116 tonnes of fine gold
at 31 March 2012. The Bank’s credit exposure is managed in a conservative
manner, with almost all of it rated no lower than A– at 31 March 2012 (see note 3,
“Credit risk”, in the “Risk management” section of the financial statements).
The Bank’s holdings of currency assets totalled SDR 200.2 billion on
31 March 2012, down from SDR 209.3 billion at the end of the previous financial
year (see note 5, “Currency assets”, in “Notes to the financial statements”).
The Bank uses various derivative instruments to manage its assets and
liabilities efficiently (see note 7, “Derivative financial instruments”, in “Notes
to the financial statements”).

Representative Offices
The BIS has a Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific (the Asian Office),
located in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s
Republic of China; and a Representative Office for the Americas (the Americas
Office), located in Mexico City. The Representative Offices promote
cooperation within each region by organising meetings, conducting policy
research and fostering the exchange of information and data. The Asian Office
also provides banking services to the region’s monetary authorities.

The Asian Office
With strong support from the BIS shareholding central banks in the AsiaPacific region, economists in the Asian Office continued to pursue a policy-

118

BIS 82nd Annual Report

oriented research agenda. The Office likewise maintained its programme of
helping to organise high-level regional meetings and, through its Regional
Treasury, continued to offer specialised banking services.
The Asian Consultative Council
The Asian Consultative Council (ACC), comprising the Governors of the 12 BIS
shareholding central banks in the region,7 guides the activities of the Asian
Office. ACC chair Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan, presided
over the Council’s meetings and reported to the BIS Board on the Office’s
activities. At its June 2011 semiannual meeting in Basel, the ACC supported
the continuation of the four regular Governor-level meetings organised by the
BIS in the region. At its meeting in February in Hong Kong, the ACC endorsed
a topic to serve as the new research focus of the monetary group for the next
two years: “Globalisation and inflation dynamics in Asia and the Pacific”.
Research
Economists in the Asian Office, along with those in Basel, produced research
on two themes – chosen in 2010 – that are highly relevant to ACC central
banks: on the monetary side, the role of central bank balance sheets in
monetary policy and exchange rate issues; and on the financial side, property
prices. A workshop hosted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in
September helped sharpen the focus of the research on property prices. A
research conference hosted by the Bank of Thailand in Chiang Mai in
December marked the completion of the focus on central bank balance sheets.
The economists continued to engage in collaborative research with most
BIS shareholding central banks in the region as well as with regional
organisations of central banks. The work has fed into numerous central bank
meetings and has yielded several articles in refereed journals and major BIS
publications.
The Special Governors’ Meeting and other high-level meetings
The Asian Office helped organise 10 high-level BIS policy meetings in the
region during the period. Each meeting was held jointly with a central bank in
the region or with a regional body of central banks, such as the Executives’
Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) or the South East Asian
Central Banks (SEACEN) Research and Training Centre.
The annual Special Governors’ Meeting gathers the Governors of the
major central banks in the region together with other Governors from around
the world to address issues of common concern. This year’s meeting was
organised jointly with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and held in Hong
Kong in February. For the second time, the event included a meeting with the
chief executive officers of large financial institutions active in the region to
discuss the challenges and threats faced by financial systems in Asia and the
Pacific.

Other high-level events were a meeting in June of the Working Party on
Monetary Policy in Asia, co-hosted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in
Hong Kong; in November, the Seventh High-Level Seminar on Financial
Markets, co-hosted by the Bank of Japan in Yokohama; and in January, the
SEACEN-BIS Exco Seminar, co-hosted by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in
Colombo.
Banking activity and the Asian Bond Funds
Against the background of ongoing concerns about the global economic
and financial environment, central banks in the region maintained a rather
conservative stance in their reserve portfolio operations with the BIS, relying
mainly on short-term liquid instruments. On balance, placements by central
banks from the region in the 2011/12 financial year were down slightly from
those in 2010/11.
As fund administrator, the BIS continued to support the second Asian
Bond Fund (ABF2), an EMEAP initiative to foster the development of local
currency bond markets. At the end of March 2012, the combined size of the
funds stood at $4.8 billion, an increase of about 21% since the end of March
2011. The total return on the Pan-Asia Bond Index Fund (PAIF) from its
inception on 7 July 2005 to end-March 2012 was 59%, which compared
favourably with the 44% return on a US Treasury index of similar duration.

The Americas Office
The Americas Office, together with the BIS head office, is currently studying
the way capital inflows may be influencing regional monetary policy; also
under review are the local effects of recent recommendations to enhance key
supervisory standards and strengthen financial stability. Within the region, the
Office is disseminating BIS research and analysis on these and related topics
and is assisting Basel-based departments and groupings in their outreach
efforts and analysis.
The Office’s work with BIS member banks, other central banks, regulatory
authorities and the academic community generated several papers on
economic topics this year. Most of the papers are available on the Americas
Office pages of the BIS website.
The Office supported meetings at regional central banks. These included
the October 2011 meeting of the Working Party on Monetary Policy in Latin
America, convened at the Central Bank of Argentina, and the July 2011
gathering of the Markets Committee Working Party on Markets in Latin
America, hosted by the Bank of Mexico. The Americas Office also supported
several training events organised by the FSI in cooperation with regional
groupings of supervisors.
The Office provided speakers to, or participated in, various other
conferences and meetings convened by regional central banks and
international organisations and groupings. For example, it supported the
November 2011 annual meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean
Economic Association (LACEA). In December 2011, it hosted, together

120

BIS 82nd Annual Report

with the Bank of Mexico and CEMLA (Center for Latin American Monetary
Studies), a roundtable on external factors and monetary policy. And in March
2012, the Office contributed to a joint meeting on international banking after
the crisis, convened at the Central Reserve Bank of Peru in cooperation with
CEMLA.
The Consultative Council for the Americas
The Office serves as the secretariat to the Consultative Council for the
Americas (CCA). The CCA, which comprises the Governors of the eight BIS
member central banks in the Americas,8 was established in May 2008 as an
advisory committee to the BIS Board of Directors. CCA members are regularly
informed of the work of the BIS and the Americas Office in the region and
provide guidance on current and possible future work at the BIS of interest
to the Americas. It is currently sponsoring cooperative efforts in economic
research among its member central banks, including a series of research
conferences. The second such conference was held at the Bank of Canada in
May 2011.
José de Gregorio chaired the CCA from January 2011 until December
2011, the end of his term as Governor of the Central Bank of Chile. In January
2012, the BIS Board appointed Agustín Carstens, Governor of the Bank of
Mexico, to a two-year term as chair beginning 10 January.

Governance and management of the BIS
The governance and management of the Bank are conducted at three principal
levels:
•
the General Meeting of BIS member central banks;
•
the BIS Board of Directors; and
•
BIS Management.
The BIS has its head office in Basel, Switzerland. At the end of the 2011/12
financial year, the BIS employed 616 staff members from 54 countries.

Membership expansion
With a view to further strengthening central bank cooperation, the Board of
Directors decided on 26 June 2011 to invite an additional four central banks
to become members of the Bank in accordance with Article 8.3 of the BIS
Statutes. The Bank of the Republic (Colombia), the Central Bank of
Luxembourg, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru and the Central Bank of the
United Arab Emirates were each invited to subscribe 3,000 shares of the third
tranche of the capital of the BIS. By the close of the subscription period at end2011, all four central banks had taken up the Board’s offer to become members
of the BIS.
At its meeting in June 2011, the Board fixed the issue price per share at
SDR 21,904. As the Bank’s authorised nominal capital of SDR 5,000 per share is

paid up by members to the extent of 25%, or SDR 1,250 per share, the issue
price of SDR 21,904 included a premium of SDR 20,654 per share. At 31 March
2012, following the subscription by the four new members totalling 12,000
shares, the number of the Bank’s issued shares rose to 559,125, and the paidup capital of the Bank in the balance sheet increased by SDR 15 million (at
SDR 1,250 per share) to SDR 699 million. The aggregate premium received
from the four new central bank members amounted to SDR 247.8 million, of
which SDR 1.5 million was allocated to the legal reserve fund and SDR 246.3
million to the general reserve fund.

The General Meeting of BIS member central banks
Sixty central banks and monetary authorities are currently members of the BIS
and have rights of voting and representation at General Meetings. The Annual
General Meeting (AGM) is held no later than four months after 31 March, the
end of the BIS financial year. The AGM decides the distribution of the dividend
and profit of the BIS, approves the annual report and the accounts of the Bank,
makes adjustments in the allowances paid to Board members and selects the
Bank’s external auditor.

The BIS Board of Directors
Consisting of 19 members, the Board of Directors is assisted by four committees
of Board members: the Administrative Committee, the Audit Committee, the
Banking and Risk Management Committee, and the Nomination Committee.
The main responsibilities of the Board are determining the strategic and policy
direction of the BIS and supervising the Bank’s Management.
Nout Wellink retired as President of the Netherlands Bank at the end of
June 2011 and therefore stepped down as a member of the BIS Board. He had
been a member of the Board since 1997 and had served as its Chairman from
March 2002 to February 2006. Mr Wellink’s successor as President of the
Netherlands Bank, Klaas Knot, was elected by the Board at its meeting in
September 2011 to fill the remainder of Mr Wellink’s BIS Board term, which
ends on 30 June 2012.
Jean-Claude Trichet retired as President of the ECB, and therefore as a
member of the BIS Board, at the end of October 2011. With effect from
1 November 2011, Mario Draghi stepped down as Governor of the Bank of Italy,
thereby vacating his seat on the Board, to take up his new position as President
of the ECB. Ignazio Visco succeeded Mr Draghi at the Bank of Italy and became
an ex officio member of the Board. At its September 2011 meeting, the BIS
Board elected Mario Draghi to fill the remainder of Mr Trichet’s BIS Board
term, which ends on 30 June 2012.
Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor, Financial Stability, of the Bank of England,
stepped down as a member of the Board at the end of December 2011.
With effect from 1 January 2012, Jens Weidmann, President of the
Deutsche Bundesbank, appointed Andreas Dombret, of the Executive Board of
the Deutsche Bundesbank, to the BIS Board.

122

BIS 82nd Annual Report

Following the retirement of Jean-Pierre Landau from the Board, Christian
Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, appointed Anne Le Lorier, First Deputy
Governor of the Bank of France, to the BIS Board with effect from 1 January
2012.
On 9 January 2012, Philipp Hildebrand resigned as Chairman of the
Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and therefore also from the BIS
Board and as Chairman of its Administrative Committee. His successor at the
Swiss National Bank, Thomas Jordan, was elected to the BIS Board of
Directors on 7 May 2012 for the remainder of Mr Hildebrand’s term, which
ends on 31 March 2013. Agustín Carstens, Governor of the Bank of Mexico,
was elected to succeed Mr Hildebrand as Chairman of the Administrative
Committee with effect from 5 March 2012.

BIS Management
BIS Management is under the overall direction of the General Manager, who is
responsible to the Board of Directors for the conduct of the Bank. The General
Manager is advised by the Executive Committee of the BIS, which consists of
six members: the General Manager as chair; the Deputy General Manager; the
Heads of the three BIS departments – the General Secretariat, the Monetary
and Economic Department and the Banking Department – and the General
Counsel.
Other senior officials are the Deputy Heads of the departments and the
Chairman of the Financial Stability Institute.

Bank budget policy
The process of formulating the Bank’s expenditure budget for the next financial
year starts about six months in advance with the setting by Management of a
broad business orientation and financial framework. Within this context,
business areas specify their plans and the corresponding resource
requirements. The process of reconciling detailed business plans, objectives
and overall resource availability culminates in a draft financial budget, which
must be approved by the Board before the start of the financial year.
The budget distinguishes between administrative and capital
expenditures. In common with organisations similar to the BIS, Management
and staff expenditure – including remuneration, pensions, and health and
accident insurance – amounts to around 70% of administrative expenditure.
The other major expenditure categories, each accounting for about 10% of
administrative spending, are information technology (IT), buildings and

126

BIS 82nd Annual Report

equipment, and general operational costs. Capital spending, relating mainly to
buildings and IT investment, can vary significantly from year to year depending
on the projects in progress.
Administrative and capital expenditure for 2011/12 reflected the Bank’s
priority of responding to the global financial crisis. Additional staff positions
were allocated to the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Committee on Payment and Settlement
Systems (CPSS) and the Financial Stability Institute (FSI). At the same time,
IT projects were undertaken to enhance statistical and research systems as
well as to improve the dissemination of the Basel III package. In addition,
the Banking Department completed work on improving the IT infrastructure
for its asset management activities, which involved enhancements to data
management, compliance checking, portfolio analysis, order management and
trade processing.
For the financial year 2011/12, overall administrative expenditure on
the Bank’s budget basis of accounting10 amounted to CHF 255.0 million, or
CHF 13.5 million (5.0%) lower than the budget. It was CHF 1.3 million (0.5%)
above actual administrative expenditure in 2010/11.
Capital expenditure was CHF 26.2 million, or CHF 0.4 million (1.5%) below
the budget. It was CHF 4.5 million (20.7%) above actual capital expenditure in
2010/11.
Total expenditure was CHF 281.2 million, or CHF 13.9 million (4.7%) below
budget. It was CHF 5.8 million (2.1%) above the actual expenditure in 2010/11.
For 2012/13, the Bank’s business plan builds on the achievements in
2011/12, continuing to give priority to further enhancing financial stability
activities. It allocates additional human and financial resources to deal with the
expanding financial stability workload, particularly in the FSB, the BCBS and
the statistical and long-term research sections of the Monetary and Economic
Department. The additional work includes disseminating the Basel III package
to the global community of central banks and financial supervisors and
enhancing the Bank’s statistical capacity for the monitoring of financial
markets and institutions. Strengthening the resilience of BIS banking activities,
based on appropriate levels of profitability and financial risk over the medium
term, will continue to be the main priority of the Banking Department and the
Risk Control, Finance and Compliance units. Additional resources were also
made available in the budget to upgrade the Banking Department’s main
IT system.
In March 2012, the Board approved a 3.5% increase in the administrative
budget for the financial year 2012/13, to CHF 277.4 million. It also approved a
capital budget of CHF 23.3 million. The total budget of CHF 300.7 million is
CHF 5.6 million (1.9%) higher than in 2011/12.

10 The Bank’s budget excludes financial accounting adjustments relating to post-employment benefit
obligations for pensions and health and accident insurance. The expense for the next financial year
depends on the actuarial valuations as at 31 March each year, which are not finalised until April, after the
budget has been set by the Board. For similar reasons, certain extraordinary items are also excluded
from the budget. These additional factors are included under “Operating expense” in the profit and loss
account (see “Net profit and its distribution”).

BIS 82nd Annual Report

Bank remuneration policy
The jobs performed by BIS staff members are assessed on the basis of a
number of objective criteria, including qualifications, experience and
responsibilities, and classified into distinct job grades. The job grades are
associated with a structure of salary ranges. Salaries of individual staff
members move within the ranges of the salary structure on the basis of
performance. Every three years, a comprehensive survey benchmarks BIS
salaries (in Swiss francs) against compensation in comparable institutions
and market segments. In benchmarking, the Bank focuses on the upper half
of market compensation in order to attract highly qualified staff. The analysis
takes into account differences in the taxation of compensation at the surveyed
institutions. In the most recent survey, which took place in the second half of
2010, the benchmark data reflected the comparator market as of 1 July 2010.
As of 1 July 2011, the midpoints of the Bank’s salary ranges were aligned with
those observed market benchmarks and with the estimated change in external
market salaries in the preceding year. The latter adjustment, based on the rate
of inflation in Switzerland and the weighted average change in real wages in
advanced economies, amounted to an increase of 1.4%.
Through the Bank, BIS staff members have access to a contributory health
insurance plan and a contributory defined benefit pension plan. Non-locally
hired, non-Swiss staff members recruited for a position at the Bank’s
headquarters, including senior officials, are entitled to an expatriation
allowance. The allowance currently amounts to 14% of annual salary for
unmarried staff members and 18% for married staff members, subject to a
ceiling. Expatriate staff members are also entitled to receive an education
allowance for their children, subject to certain conditions. In the Representative
Offices, the BIS makes a distinction between staff members on an international
assignment from the headquarters and staff members recruited directly for a
position in a Representative Office. The employment conditions of the former
are determined in accordance with the Bank’s international assignment policy.
For staff recruited directly, employment conditions are aligned with those in
the market in which the Office is located, but they include access to the same
health insurance and pension plans available to staff employed at the Bank’s
headquarters.
The salaries of senior officials are regularly benchmarked against
compensation in comparable institutions and market segments. As with the
survey for other staff, the most recent executive compensation survey took
place in the second half of 2010. The results confirmed the appropriateness of
the current practice of annually adjusting the salaries of senior officials for the
rate of Swiss inflation.
As of 1 July 2011, the annual remuneration of senior officials, before
expatriation allowances, is based on the salary structure (in Swiss francs) of
763,930 for the General Manager;11 646,400 for the Deputy General Manager;
and 587,640 for Heads of Department.

11 In addition to the basic salary, the General Manager receives an annual representation allowance and
enhanced pension rights.

128

BIS 82nd Annual Report

The Annual General Meeting approves the remuneration of members
of the Board of Directors, with adjustments taking place at regular intervals.
The total fixed annual remuneration paid to the Board of Directors was
1,049,520 Swiss francs as of 1 April 2012. In addition, Board members receive
an attendance fee for each Board meeting in which they participate. Assuming
the full Board is represented in all Board meetings, the annual total of these
attendance fees amounts to 973,788 Swiss francs.

Net profit and its distribution
The Bank recorded a net profit of SDR 758.9 million for its 82nd financial year,
ended 31 March 2012. This result is 7% lower than the previous year, reflecting
a lower average balance sheet as well as the difficult market conditions that
prevailed for most of the year.

Principal factors behind the 2011/12 profit
The financial year 2011/12 included periods of rising and falling market
tension. The first half of the financial year saw a challenging combination of
widening credit spreads, heightened distortions in money markets and risk
aversion among investors. Market conditions improved slightly in October
before deteriorating sharply in November. The last four months of the financial
year then saw narrowing credit spreads together with relative stability in
foreign exchange and money markets.
Against this backdrop, net interest income amounted to SDR 1,458.1
million in 2011/12, compared with SDR 1,465.4 million in the preceding
financial year. This reflected an almost unchanged average volume of currency
deposits from customers.
Net valuation losses amounted to SDR 590.3 million, compared with a
loss of SDR 509.2 million in the preceding financial year. These losses were
mainly attributable to widening credit spreads on euro area debt instruments
held in the Bank’s credit portfolios.
Operating expenses amounted to SDR 226.7 million, 10.6% above the
2010/11 figure of SDR 205.0 million.12
After taking into account the above factors, the Bank’s operating
profit amounted to SDR 655.5 million, which was SDR 83 million below the
SDR 738.5 million recorded in 2010/11.
The Bank’s available for sale portfolios, one for investment securities and
one for gold, hold positions for which valuation gains are recognised in the
profit and loss account only on disposal. During 2011/12, the Bank continued to
manage its portfolio of available for sale investment securities with a benchmark
duration of three years, with disposals in this portfolio realising a net gain of
12 See the earlier section “Bank budget policy” for details on this year’s BIS budget, including the
treatment of operating expenses. Because most of the Bank’s administrative and capital expenditure is
incurred in Swiss francs, the budget is expressed and controlled in that currency. As the Bank’s financial
statements are presented in SDR, they include the effect of the 11% appreciation of the Swiss franc
against the SDR during the year.

SDR 24.7 million (2010/11: net gain of SDR 55.7 million). The Bank also realised
a gain of SDR 78.7 million on the sale of 3 tonnes of its gold investment assets.
This compares with a gain of SDR 21.8 million on the sale of 1 tonne in 2010/11.
As a result of these factors, the net profit for 2011/12 amounted to
SDR 758.9 million, SDR 57.1 million below the SDR 816.0 million recorded in
2010/11.

Movements in equity
The unrealised gains on the Bank’s available for sale portfolios, one for
investment securities and one for gold, are included in revaluation accounts in
the Bank’s equity.
The securities revaluation account increased by SDR 296.5 million from
net unrealised gains (2010/11: loss of SDR 197.3 million), mainly the result of
falling interest yields over the year. The gold revaluation account increased by
SDR 551.8 million (2010/11: gain of SDR 650.4 million), which was attributable
primarily to the 18% appreciation of the gold price during the year.
After these gains are taken into account, the Bank’s total comprehensive
income for 2011/12 was SDR 1,607.2 million. This represented a return of 9.2%
on average equity of SDR 17,562 million. In 2010/11, the total return was
SDR 1,269.1 million, or 7.8%, on average equity of SDR 16,238 million. Taking
into account the dividend for 2010/11 of SDR 374.1 million that was paid during
2011/12 and the issue of new shares for SDR 262.9 million, the Bank’s equity
increased by SDR 1,709.0 million during the year ended 31 March 2012.

Proposed dividend
The Board’s review of the BIS dividend policy in 2009/10 took into consideration
the Bank’s capital needs and the interests of BIS shareholders in obtaining a
fair and sustainable return on their investments in BIS shares. In framing the
dividend policy, the Board adopted a number of governing principles, which are:
•
First, the need for the Bank to maintain a strong capital base at all times,
including during financial stress.
•
Second, the dividend should be relatively stable, set at a sustainable level
and changing in a predictable manner each year.
•
Third, while the Bank’s dividend policy should provide guidance for the
medium term, the dividend should continue to reflect the prevailing
financial circumstances of the Bank, and the Board’s proposal to the AGM
should remain an annual decision.
The dividend policy takes into account the Bank’s capital adequacy and
leverage ratio requirements. The policy, which is due to be reviewed again in
2014/15, incorporates:
•
a normal sustainable dividend, decided ex ante in conformity with the
medium-term dividend policy, which would increase by SDR 10 per share
per annum; and
•
a supplementary dividend, which would be decided ex post, while
keeping leverage and economic capital within desired ranges.

130

BIS 82nd Annual Report

The policy ensures that earnings are retained to augment the Bank’s
capital at a rate sufficient to support the Bank’s business and maintain its
capital position relative to the size of the balance sheet and its economic
capital requirements. In normal circumstances, it results in a steady
progression in annual dividends while retaining the flexibility to be operable in
years of low or high profits. In addition, the final approval of the dividend
coincides with the outcome of the annual economic capital allocation process
(see note 2 of the capital adequacy section of the financial statements),
enabling the Board to set an appropriate dividend while ensuring that the
Bank’s capital base remains strong.
Consistent with this dividend policy, the Board proposes for the financial
year 2011/12 to declare a normal dividend of SDR 305 per share, SDR 10 per
share above the normal dividend for 2010/11. No supplementary dividend is
proposed for 2011/12.
At 31 March 2012, there were 559,125 issued and paid-up shares (2011:
547,125); this includes the 1,000 shares of the Albanian issue that are
suspended and held in treasury. During 2011/12, 12,000 shares were issued to
new members.
A full normal dividend will be paid on 546,125 shares, while the 12,000
shares issued during the year will receive a pro rata amount calculated from
the date of subscription. No dividend will be paid on the 1,000 shares held in
treasury.
The resulting total proposed dividend of SDR 168.4 million would be paid
out on 29 June 2012 in any constituent currency of the SDR, or in Swiss francs,
according to the instructions of each shareholder named in the Bank’s share
register at 31 March 2012.

Proposed distribution and allocation of net profit for the year
On the basis of Article 51 of the Bank’s Statutes, the Board of Directors
recommends to the Annual General Meeting that the net profit for the year of
SDR 758.9 million be applied by the General Meeting in the following manner:
(a) SDR 168.4 million to be paid as a normal dividend of SDR 305 per share;
(b) SDR 29.5 million to be transferred to the general reserve fund;13
(c) SDR 6.0 million to be transferred to the special dividend reserve fund; and
(d) SDR 555.0 million, representing the remainder of the available profit, to
be transferred to the free reserve fund.

Report of the auditor
The Bank’s financial statements have been duly audited by Deloitte AG, who
have confirmed that they give a true and fair view of the Bank’s financial
position at 31 March 2012 and the results of its operations for the year then

13 The general reserve fund exceeded five times the Bank’s paid-up capital at 31 March 2012. As such,
under Article 51 of the Statutes, 5% of net profit, after accounting for the proposed dividend, should be
allocated to the general reserve fund.

ended. The Deloitte report is to be found immediately following the financial
statements.
Auditor rotation
In line with the Board policy on auditor rotation, Deloitte AG will resign as
auditor after the year-end, having served for a term of seven years. A selection
process involving the Bank’s Management and the Audit Committee having
been concluded, it is intended that Ernst & Young will become the Bank’s new
auditor; a resolution to appoint them for 2012/13 will be presented to the
Annual General Meeting.

Accounting policies

The accounting policies set out below have been applied
to both of the financial years presented unless otherwise
stated.

assets and liabilities are recorded in SDR at the exchange
rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Profits and
losses are translated into SDR at an average rate. Exchange
differences arising from the retranslation of monetary
assets and liabilities and from the settlement of transactions
are included as net foreign exchange gains or losses in the
profit and loss account.

1. Scope of the financial statements
These financial statements contain all assets and liabilities
that are controlled by the Bank and in respect of which the
economic benefits as well as the rights and obligations lie
with the Bank.
Assets and liabilities in the name of but not controlled by
the Bank and in respect of which the economic benefits as
well as the rights and obligations do not lie with the Bank
are not included in these financial statements. Information
on off-balance sheet assets and liabilities is disclosed in
note 31.

4. Designation of financial instruments
Upon initial recognition the Bank allocates each financial
instrument to one of the following categories:

•
•

Loans and receivables

•
•

Available for sale financial assets

Financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair
value through profit and loss
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

The allocation to these categories is dependent on the
nature of the financial instrument and the purpose for
which it was entered into, as described in Section 5 below.

2. Functional and presentation currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Bank is the
Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
The SDR is calculated from a basket of major trading
currencies according to Rule O–1 as adopted by the
Executive Board of the IMF on 30 December 2010 and
effective 1 January 2011. As currently calculated, one
SDR is equivalent to the sum of USD 0.660, EUR 0.423,
JPY 12.1 and GBP 0.111. Prior to 1 January 2011, one
SDR was equivalent to the sum of USD 0.632, EUR 0.410,
JPY 18.4 and GBP 0.0903. The change in the composition
of the SDR basket was such that the values of the SDR
under the old and new baskets were equivalent at
31 December 2010 and no significant gains or losses
resulted from the change in the weights of the currencies.
The composition of the SDR currency basket is subject to
review every five years by the IMF; the next review is due
to be undertaken in December 2015.
All figures in these financial statements are presented in
SDR millions unless otherwise stated.

3. Currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into SDR at
the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Other

BIS 82nd Annual Report

The resulting designation of each financial instrument
determines the accounting methodology that is applied, as
described in the accounting policies below. Where the
financial instrument is designated as held at fair value
through profit and loss, the Bank does not subsequently
change this designation.

5. Asset and liability structure
Assets and liabilities are organised into two sets of
portfolios:

A. Banking portfolios
These comprise currency and gold deposit liabilities and
related banking assets and derivatives.
The Bank operates a banking business in currency and
gold on behalf of its customers. In this business the Bank
takes limited gold price, interest rate and foreign currency
risk.
The Bank designates all currency financial instruments in
its banking portfolios (other than cash and sight and notice
accounts with banks, and sight and notice deposit account
liabilities) as held at fair value through profit and loss. The
use of fair values in the currency banking portfolios is
described in Section 9 below.

141

All gold financial assets in these portfolios are designated
as loans and receivables and all gold financial liabilities are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised
cost.

8. Sight and notice deposit account liabilities

B. Investment portfolios

Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments
are designated as financial liabilities measured at
amortised cost. They are included in the balance sheet at
their principal value plus accrued interest. Interest is
included in interest expense on an accruals basis.

These comprise assets, liabilities and derivatives relating
principally to the investment of the Bank’s equity.
The Bank holds most of its equity in financial instruments
denominated in the constituent currencies of the SDR,
which are managed using a fixed duration benchmark of
bonds.
Except for the currency assets described in the next
paragraph, currency assets (other than cash and sight and
notice accounts with banks) are designated as available
for sale. Related securities sold under repurchase
agreements are designated as financial liabilities
measured at amortised cost.
In addition, the Bank maintains some of its equity in more
actively traded portfolios. The currency investment assets
in these portfolios are trading assets and as such are
designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
The remainder of the Bank’s equity is held in gold. The
Bank’s own gold holdings are designated as available for
sale.

6. Cash and sight accounts with banks
Cash and sight accounts with banks are included in the
balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued interest
where applicable.

Sight and notice deposit accounts are short-term monetary
liabilities. They typically have notice periods of three days
or less and are included under the balance sheet heading
“Currency deposits”.

9. Use of fair values in the currency banking
portfolios
In operating its currency banking business, the Bank acts
as a market-maker in certain of its currency deposit
liabilities. As a result of this activity the Bank incurs
realised profits and losses on these liabilities.
In accordance with the Bank’s risk management policies,
the market risk inherent in this activity is managed on an
overall fair value basis, combining all the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios.
The realised and unrealised profits or losses on currency
deposit liabilities are thus largely offset by realised and
unrealised losses or profits on the related currency
banking assets and derivatives, or on other currency
deposit liabilities.
To reduce the accounting inconsistency that would arise
from recognising realised and unrealised gains and losses
on different bases, the Bank designates the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios
as held at fair value through profit and loss.

7. Notice accounts

10. Currency deposit liabilities held at fair value
through profit and loss

Notice accounts are short-term monetary assets. They
typically have notice periods of three days or less and are
included under the balance sheet heading “Loans and
advances”. They are considered to be cash equivalents for
the purposes of the cash flow statement.

As described above, all currency deposit liabilities, with
the exception of sight and notice deposit account liabilities,
are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.

Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments
are designated as loans and receivables. They are included
in the balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued
interest. Interest is included in interest income on an
accruals basis.

These currency deposit liabilities are initially included in
the balance sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The
subsequent accrual of interest to be paid and amortisation
of premiums received and discounts paid are included
under the profit and loss account heading “Interest
expense” on an effective interest rate basis.
After trade date, the currency deposit liabilities are
revalued to fair value, with all realised and unrealised
movements in fair value included under “Net valuation
movement”.

142

BIS 82nd Annual Report

11. Currency assets held at fair value through
profit and loss
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and
government and other securities.
As described above, the Bank designates all of the relevant
assets in its currency banking portfolios as held at fair
value through profit and loss. In addition, the Bank
maintains certain actively traded investment portfolios.
The currency investment assets in these portfolios are
trading assets and as such are designated as held at fair
value through profit and loss.
These currency assets are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The subsequent
accrual of interest and amortisation of premiums paid and
discounts received are included in the profit and loss
account under “Interest income” on an effective interest
rate basis.
After trade date, the currency assets are revalued to fair
value, with all realised and unrealised movements in fair
value included under “Net valuation movement”.

12. Currency investment assets available
for sale
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and
government and other securities.
As described above, the Bank designates as available for
sale all of the relevant assets in its currency investment
portfolios, except for those assets in the Bank’s more
actively traded investment portfolios.
These currency investment assets are initially included in
the balance sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The
subsequent accrual of interest and amortisation of
premiums paid and discounts received are included in the
profit and loss account under “Interest income” on an
effective interest rate basis.
After trade date, the currency investment assets are
revalued to fair value, with unrealised gains or losses
included in the securities revaluation account, which is
reported under the balance sheet heading “Other equity
accounts”. The movement in fair value is included in the
statement of comprehensive income under the heading
“Unrealised gain / (loss) on securities available for sale”.
Realised profits on disposal are included in the profit and
loss account under “Net gain on sales of securities
available for sale”.

13. Short positions in currency assets
Short positions in currency assets are included in the
balance sheet under the heading “Other liabilities” at fair
value on a trade date basis.

14. Gold
Gold comprises gold bar assets held in custody at central
banks and sight accounts denominated in gold. Gold is
considered by the Bank to be a financial instrument.
Gold is included in the balance sheet at its weight in gold
(translated at the gold market price and USD exchange
rate into SDR). Purchases and sales of gold are accounted
for on a settlement date basis. Forward purchases or sales
of gold are treated as derivatives prior to the settlement
date.
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses
on gold is described in Section 17 below.

15. Gold loans
Gold loans comprise fixed-term gold loans. Gold loans are
included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis at
their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price
and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest.
Accrued interest on gold loans is included in the profit and
loss account under “Interest income” on an effective
interest rate basis.

16. Gold deposits
Gold deposits comprise unallocated sight and fixed-term
deposits of gold from central banks.
Unallocated gold deposits provide customers with a
general claim on the Bank for delivery of gold of the same
weight and quality as that delivered by the customer to the
Bank, but do not provide the right to specific gold bars.
Unallocated gold deposits are included in the balance sheet
on a trade date basis at their weight in gold (translated at
the gold market price and USD exchange rate into SDR)
plus accrued interest. Accrued interest on gold deposits is
included in the profit and loss account under “Interest
expense” on an effective interest rate basis.
Allocated (or “earmarked”) gold deposits provide
depositors with a claim for delivery of the specific gold
bars deposited by the customer with the Bank on a
custody basis. Beneficial ownership and risk remain with
the customer. As such, allocated gold deposit liabilities

BIS 82nd Annual Report

143

and the related gold bar assets are not included on the
Bank’s balance sheet. They are disclosed as off-balance
sheet items (see note 31).

17. Realised and unrealised gains or losses
on gold

18. Securities sold under repurchase agreements
Where these liabilities are associated with the
management of currency assets held at fair value through
profit and loss, they are designated as financial
instruments held at fair value through profit and loss.
Where these liabilities are associated with currency assets
available for sale, they are designated as financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost.

The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses
on gold depends on the designation as described below:

They are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of interest is
included in the profit and loss account under “Interest
expense” on an effective interest rate basis.

A. Banking portfolios, comprising gold deposits and
related gold banking assets

After trade date, those liabilities that are designated as
held at fair value through profit and loss are revalued to
fair value, with unrealised gains or losses included under
“Net valuation movement”.

The Bank designates gold loans in its banking portfolios
as loans and receivables and gold deposits as financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost. The gold derivatives
included in the portfolios are designated as held at fair
value through profit and loss.

19. Derivatives

Gains or losses on these transactions in gold are included
in the profit and loss account under “Net foreign exchange
gain / (loss)” as net transaction gains or losses.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the net position in
gold in the banking portfolios are included under “Net
foreign exchange gain / (loss)” as net translation gains or
losses.

B. Investment portfolios, comprising gold
investment assets
The Bank’s own holdings of gold are designated and
accounted for as available for sale assets.
Unrealised gains or losses on the Bank’s gold investment
assets over their deemed cost are taken to the gold
revaluation account in equity, which is reported under
the balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”. The
movement in fair value is included in the statement of
comprehensive income under the heading “Unrealised
gain on gold investment assets”.
For gold investment assets held on 31 March 2003 (when
the Bank changed its functional and presentation currency
from the gold franc to the SDR) the deemed cost is
approximately SDR 151 per ounce, based on the value of
USD 208 that was applied from 1979 to 2003 following a
decision by the Bank’s Board of Directors, translated at the
31 March 2003 exchange rate.
Realised gains or losses on disposal of gold investment
assets are included in the profit and loss account as “Net
gain on sales of gold investment assets”.

Derivatives are used either to manage the Bank’s market
risk or for trading purposes. They are designated as
financial instruments held at fair value through profit and
loss.
Derivatives are initially included in the balance sheet on a
trade date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of
interest and amortisation of premiums paid and discounts
received are included in the profit and loss account under
“Interest income” on an effective interest rate basis.
After trade date, derivatives are revalued to fair value,
with all realised and unrealised movements in value
included under “Net valuation movement”.
Derivatives are included as either assets or liabilities,
depending on whether the contract has a positive or a
negative fair value for the Bank.
Where a derivative contract is embedded within a host
contract which is not accounted for as held at fair value
through profit and loss, it is separated from the host
contract for accounting purposes and treated as though it
were a standalone derivative as described above.

20. Valuation policy
The Bank’s valuation policy has been approved by the
Board of Directors. In this policy the Bank defines how
financial instruments are designated, which determines
their valuation basis and accounting treatment. This policy
is supplemented with detailed valuation procedures.
The majority of the financial instruments on the balance
sheet are included at fair value. The Bank defines the fair
value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable,
willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.

144

BIS 82nd Annual Report

The use of fair values ensures that the financial reporting
to the Board and shareholders reflects the way in which
the banking business is managed and is consistent with
the risk management and economic performance figures
reported to Management.
The Bank considers published price quotations in active
markets as the best evidence of fair value. Where no
published price quotations exist, the Bank determines fair
values using a valuation technique appropriate to the
particular financial instrument. Such valuation techniques
may involve using market prices of recent arm’s length
market transactions in similar instruments or may make
use of financial models. Where financial models are used,
the Bank aims at making maximum use of observable
market inputs (eg interest rates and volatilities) as
appropriate, and relies as little as possible on its own
estimates. Such valuation models comprise discounted
cash flow analyses and option pricing models.
Where valuation techniques are used to determine fair
values, the valuation models are subject to initial approval
and periodic review in line with the requirements of the
Bank’s model validation policy.

22. Accounts receivable and accounts payable
Accounts receivable and accounts payable are principally
very short-term amounts relating to the settlement of
financial transactions. They are initially recognised at fair
value and subsequently included in the balance sheet at
amortised cost.

23. Land, buildings and equipment
The cost of the Bank’s buildings and equipment is
capitalised and depreciated on a straight line basis over
the estimated useful lives of the assets concerned, as
follows:

•
•
•
•

Buildings – 50 years
Building installations and machinery – 15 years
Information technology equipment – up to 4 years
Other equipment – 4 to 10 years

The Bank has an independent valuation control function
which periodically reviews the value of its financial
instruments, taking into account both the accuracy of the
valuations and the valuation methodologies used. Other
valuation controls include the review and analysis of daily
profit and loss.

The Bank’s land is not depreciated. The Bank undertakes
an annual review of impairment of land, buildings and
equipment. Where the carrying amount of an asset is
greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written
down to that amount.

The Bank values its assets at the bid price and its
liabilities at the offer price. Derivative financial instruments
are valued on a bid-offer basis, with valuation reserves,
where necessary, included in derivative financial liabilities.
Financial assets and liabilities that are not valued at fair
value are included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.

24. Provisions

21. Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those designated as held at
fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for
indications of impairment at each balance sheet date. A
financial asset is impaired when there is objective evidence
that the estimated future cash flows of the asset have been
reduced as a result of one or more events that occurred
after the initial recognition of the asset. Evidence of
impairment could include significant financial difficulty,
default, or probable bankruptcy / financial reorganisation
of the counterparty or issuer.
Impairment losses are recognised to the extent that a
decline in fair value below amortised cost is considered
other than temporary. Impairment of currency assets is
included in the profit and loss account under “Net valuation
movement”, with impairment of gold loans included under
“Interest income”. If the amount of the impairment loss
decreases in a subsequent period, the previously recognised
impairment loss is reversed through profit and loss to the
extent that the carrying amount of the investment does not
exceed that which it would have been had the impairment
not been recognised.

BIS 82nd Annual Report

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present
legal or constructive obligation as a result of events arising
before the balance sheet date and it is probable that
economic resources will be required to settle the obligation,
provided that a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation. Best estimates and assumptions
are used when determining the amount to be recognised
as a provision.

25. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment benefit
arrangements for staff pensions, Directors’ pensions, and
health and accident insurance for current and former staff
members. An independent actuarial valuation is performed
annually for each arrangement.

A. Staff pensions
The Bank provides a final salary defined benefit pension
arrangement for its staff, based on a fund without separate
legal personality, out of which benefits are paid. The fund

145

assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of
current and former members of staff who participate in the
arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all
benefits due under the arrangement.
The liability in respect of the staff pension fund is based on
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the
balance sheet date, less the fair value of the fund assets at
the balance sheet date, together with adjustments for
unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and past service
costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated using
the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined from the estimated
future cash outflows. The rate used to discount the cash
flows is determined by the Bank based on the market yield
of highly rated corporate debt securities in Swiss francs
which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of
the related liability.

the corridor is amortised over the expected remaining
service period of the staff concerned.

26. Cash flow statement
The Bank’s cash flow statement is prepared using an
indirect method. It is based on the movements in the
Bank’s balance sheet, adjusted for changes in financial
transactions awaiting settlement.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and sight and
notice accounts with banks, which are very short-term
financial assets that typically have notice periods of three
days or less.

The amount charged to the profit and loss account
represents the sum of the current service cost of the
benefits accruing for the year under the scheme, and
interest at the discount rate on the defined benefit
obligation. In addition, actuarial gains and losses arising
from experience adjustments (where the actual outcome is
different from the actuarial assumptions previously made),
changes in actuarial assumptions and amendments to the
pension fund regulations are charged to the profit and loss
account over the service period of staff concerned in
accordance with the “corridor accounting” methodology
described below. The resulting liabilities are included
under the heading “Other liabilities” in the balance sheet.

B. Directors’ pensions
The Bank provides an unfunded defined benefit
arrangement for Directors’ pensions. The liability, defined
benefit obligation and amount charged to the profit and loss
account in respect of the Directors’ pension arrangement
are calculated on a similar basis to that used for the staff
pension fund.

C. Post-employment health and accident benefits
The Bank provides an unfunded post-employment health
and accident benefit arrangement for its staff. The liability,
benefit obligation and amount charged to the profit and
loss account in respect of the health and accident benefit
arrangement are calculated on a similar basis to that used
for the staff pension fund.

D. Corridor accounting
Actuarial gains or losses arise from experience
adjustments (where the actual outcome is different from
the actuarial assumptions previously made), changes in
actuarial assumptions and amendments to the pension
fund regulations. Where the cumulative unrecognised
actuarial gains or losses exceed the higher of the benefit
obligation or any assets used to fund the obligation by
more than a corridor of 10%, the resulting excess outside

Notes to the financial statements

1. Introduction
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS, “the Bank”) is an international financial institution which was established pursuant
to the Hague Agreements of 20 January 1930, the Bank’s Constituent Charter and its Statutes. The headquarters of the Bank are
at Centralbahnplatz 2, 4002 Basel, Switzerland. The Bank maintains representative offices in Hong Kong, Special Administrative
Region of the People’s Republic of China (for Asia and the Pacific) and in Mexico City, Mexico (for the Americas).
The objectives of the BIS, as laid down in Article 3 of its Statutes, are to promote cooperation among central banks, to provide
additional facilities for international financial operations and to act as trustee or agent for international financial settlements. Sixty
central banks are currently members of the Bank. Rights of representation and voting at General Meetings are exercised in
proportion to the number of BIS shares issued in the respective countries. The Board of Directors of the BIS is composed of the
Governors and appointed Directors from the Bank’s founding central banks, being those of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the
United Kingdom and the United States of America, as well as the Governors of the central banks of Canada, China, Japan, Mexico,
the Netherlands and Sweden, and the President of the European Central Bank.

2. Use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the Bank’s Management to make some estimates in arriving at the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of income and expenses during the financial year. To arrive at these estimates, Management uses available
information, makes assumptions and exercises judgment.
Assumptions include forward-looking estimates, for example relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities, the assessment of
post-employment benefit obligations and the assessment of provisions and contingent liabilities.
Judgment is exercised when selecting and applying the Bank’s accounting policies. The judgments relating to the designation and
valuation of financial instruments are another key element in the preparation of these financial statements. In particular, the
valuation of derivative financial instruments involves a significant amount of judgment over the discount curve to be used and
the adjustments necessary to allow for credit risk and collateral.
Subsequent actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

A. The valuation of financial assets and liabilities
There is no active secondary market for certain of the Bank’s financial assets and financial liabilities. Such assets and liabilities
are valued using valuation techniques which require judgment to determine appropriate valuation parameters. Changes in
assumptions about these parameters could materially affect the reported fair values. The valuation impact of a 1 basis point
change in spread assumptions is shown in the table below:

B. Impairment provision on financial assets
The Bank conducts an annual review for impairment at the date of each balance sheet. At 31 March 2012 the Bank did not have
any financial assets that were considered to be impaired (31 March 2011: SDR 29.0 million).

C. Actuarial assumptions
The valuation of the Bank’s pension fund and health care arrangements relies on actuarial assumptions which include expectations
of inflation, interest rates, medical cost inflation and retirement age and life expectancy of participants. Changes to these
assumptions have an impact on the valuation of the Bank’s pension fund liabilities and the amounts recognised in the financial
statements.

3. Cash and sight accounts with banks
Cash and sight accounts with banks consist of cash balances with central banks and commercial banks that are available to the
Bank on demand.

Included in “Gold” is SDR 12,262.8 million (355 tonnes) of gold (2011: SDR 11,940.5 million; 409 tonnes) that the Bank holds in
connection with its gold swap contracts. Under such contracts the Bank exchanges currencies for physical gold, and has an
obligation to return the gold at the end of the contract. See note 7 for more details on gold swap transactions.

B. Gold investment assets
The Bank’s gold investment assets are included in the balance sheet at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price
and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest. The excess of this value over the deemed cost value is included in the
gold revaluation account, which is reported under the balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”; the movement in this value
is included in the statement of comprehensive income under the heading “Unrealised gain on gold investment assets”. Realised
gains or losses on the disposal of gold investment assets are recognised in the profit and loss account under the heading “Net
gain on sales of gold investment assets”.

At 31 March 2011 the Bank’s gold and gold loans included an impairment provision of SDR 29.0 million. This provision was
released when the related gold loans were repaid in full during the financial year ended 31 March 2012. The gain of SDR 5.7
million between 31 March 2011 and the release date was due to changes in gold prices and exchange rates.
At 31 March 2012 the Bank’s gold investment assets amounted to 116 tonnes of fine gold (2011: 119 tonnes).

5. Currency assets
A. Total holdings
Currency assets comprise treasury bills, securities purchased under resale agreements, fixed-term loans and advances, and
government and other securities.
Currency assets held at fair value through profit and loss comprise those currency banking assets that represent the reinvestment
of currency deposit liabilities along with currency investment assets that are part of more actively traded portfolios. The remaining
part of the Bank’s currency investment assets are categorised as available for sale and, together with the gold investment assets,
largely represent the investment of the Bank’s equity.
Treasury bills are short-term debt securities issued by governments on a discount basis.
Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse repurchase agreements”) are usually short-term transactions under
which the Bank makes a fixed-term loan to a counterparty which provides collateral in the form of securities. The rate on the loan
is fixed at the beginning of the transaction, and there is an irrevocable commitment to return the equivalent securities subject to
the repayment of the loan. During the term of the agreement the Bank monitors the fair value of the collateral securities and may
call for additional collateral or be required to return collateral based on the movement in its market value.
Fixed-term loans are primarily investments made with commercial banks. Also included in this category are investments made
with central banks, international institutions and other public sector organisations. This includes advances made as part of
committed and uncommitted standby facilities. These loans are recognised in the balance sheet total “Loans and advances”,
which also includes notice accounts (see note 6).
Government and other securities are debt securities issued by governments, international institutions, other public sector
institutions, commercial banks and corporates. They include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, fixed and floating rate
bonds, covered bonds and asset-backed securities.

Loans and advances comprise fixed-term loans to commercial banks, advances and notice accounts. Advances relate to committed
and uncommitted standby facilities which the Bank provides for its customers. Notice accounts are very short-term financial
assets, typically having a notice period of three days or less.
Fixed-term loans and advances are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss. Notice accounts are designated as
loans and receivables and are included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.

The amount of the change in fair value recognised in the profit and loss account on fixed-term loans and advances is SDR –1.7
million (2011: SDR 12.3 million).

7. Derivative financial instruments
The Bank uses the following types of derivative instruments for economic hedging and trading purposes.
Interest rate and bond futures are contractual agreements to receive or pay a net amount based on changes in interest rates or
bond prices on a future date. Futures contracts are settled daily with the exchange. Associated margin payments are settled by
cash or marketable securities.
Currency and gold options are contractual agreements under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation,
to either buy (call option) or sell (put option), by or on a set date, a specific amount of a currency or gold at a predetermined
price. In consideration, the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.

BIS 82nd Annual Report

151

Currency and gold swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps are bilateral contractual agreements to
exchange cash flows related to currencies, gold or interest rates (for example, fixed rate for floating rate). Cross-currency interest
rate swaps involve the exchange of cash flows related to a combination of interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Except for
certain currency and gold swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, no exchange of principal takes place.
Currency and gold forwards are bilateral contractual agreements involving the exchange of foreign currencies or gold at a future
date. This includes undelivered spot transactions.
Forward rate agreements are bilateral interest rate forward contracts that result in cash settlement at a future date for the
difference between a contracted rate of interest and the prevailing market rate.
Swaptions are bilateral options under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a
currency or interest rate swap at a predetermined price by or on a set date. In consideration, the seller receives a premium from
the purchaser.
In addition, the Bank sells products to its customers which contain embedded derivatives (see note 10). Where the host contract
is not accounted for as held at fair value, embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract for accounting purposes
and treated as though they are regular derivatives. As such, the gold currency options embedded in gold dual currency deposits
are included within derivatives as currency and gold options.

Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs) are fixed rate investments at the BIS for quarterly maturities of up to 10 years.
Callable MTIs are MTIs that are callable at the option of the Bank at an exercise price of par, with call dates between September
2012 and March 2013 (2011: June 2011 and December 2011). The balance sheet total for callable MTIs includes the fair value of
the embedded interest rate option.
FIXBIS are fixed rate investments at the Bank for any maturities between one week and one year.
FRIBIS are floating rate investments at the Bank with maturities of one year or longer for which the interest rate is reset in line
with prevailing market conditions.
Fixed-term deposits are fixed rate investments at the BIS, typically with a maturity of less than one year.
Dual Currency Deposits (DCDs) are fixed-term deposits that are repayable on the maturity date either in the original currency or
at a fixed amount in a different currency at the option of the Bank. The balance sheet total for DCDs includes the fair value of the
embedded foreign exchange option. These deposits all mature in April 2012 or May 2012 (2011: in April 2011 or May 2011).
Sight and notice deposit accounts are very short-term financial liabilities, typically having a notice period of three days or less.
They are designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
The Bank acts as the sole market-maker in certain of its currency deposit liabilities and has undertaken to repay some of these
financial instruments at fair value, in whole or in part, at one to two business days’ notice.

A. Valuation of currency deposits
Currency deposits (other than sight and notice deposit accounts) are included in the balance sheet at fair value. This value differs
from the amount that the Bank is contractually obliged to pay at maturity to the holder of the deposit. The amount the Bank is
contractually obliged to pay at maturity in respect of its total currency deposits (including accrued interest to 31 March 2012) is
SDR 194,313.6 million (2011: SDR 206,432.4 million).
The Bank uses valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of its currency deposits. These valuation techniques comprise
discounted cash flow models and option pricing models. The discounted cash flow models value the expected cash flows of
financial instruments using discount factors that are partly derived from quoted interest rates (eg Libor and swap rates) and partly
based on assumptions about spreads at which each product is offered to and repurchased from customers.

154

BIS 82nd Annual Report

The spread assumptions are based on recent market transactions in each product. Where the product series has been closed to
new investors (and thus there are no recent market transactions) the Bank uses the latest quoted spread for the series as the basis
for determining the appropriate model inputs.
The option pricing models include assumptions about volatilities that are derived from market quotes.

B. Impact of changes in the Bank’s creditworthiness
The fair value of the Bank’s liabilities would be affected by any change in its creditworthiness. If the Bank’s creditworthiness
deteriorated, the value of its liabilities would decrease, and the change in value would be reflected as a valuation movement in
the profit and loss account. The Bank regularly assesses its creditworthiness as part of its risk management processes. The Bank’s
assessment of its creditworthiness did not indicate a change which could have had an impact on the fair value of the Bank’s
liabilities during the period under review.

11. Gold deposits
Gold deposits placed with the Bank originate entirely from central banks. They are all designated as financial liabilities measured
at amortised cost.

12. Accounts payable
Accounts payable consist of financial transactions awaiting settlement, relating to short-term payables (typically payable within
three days or less) where transactions have been effected but cash has not yet been transferred. This includes assets that have
been purchased and liabilities that have been repurchased.

13. Other liabilities

15. Statutory reserves
The Bank’s Statutes provide for application of the Bank’s annual net profit by the Annual General Meeting on the proposal of the
Board of Directors to three specific reserve funds: the legal reserve fund, the general reserve fund and the special dividend
reserve fund; the remainder of the net profit after payment of any dividend is generally allocated to the free reserve fund.
Legal reserve fund. This fund is currently fully funded at 10% of the Bank’s paid-up capital.
General reserve fund. After payment of any dividend, 5% of the remainder of the Bank’s annual net profit currently must be
allocated to the general reserve fund.
Special dividend reserve fund. A portion of the remainder of the annual net profit may be allocated to the special dividend reserve
fund, which shall be available, in case of need, for paying the whole or any part of a declared dividend. Dividends are normally
paid out of the Bank’s net profit.
Free reserve fund. After the above allocations have been made, any remaining unallocated net profit is generally transferred to
the free reserve fund.
Receipts from the subscription of the Bank’s shares are allocated to the legal reserve fund as necessary to keep it fully funded,
with the remainder being credited to the general reserve fund.
The free reserve fund, general reserve fund and legal reserve fund are available, in that order, to meet any losses incurred by the
Bank. In the event of liquidation of the Bank, the balances of the reserve funds (after the discharge of the liabilities of the Bank
and the costs of liquidation) would be divided among the Bank’s shareholders.

18. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment arrangements:
1. A final salary defined benefit pension arrangement for its staff. The pension arrangement is based on a fund without separate
legal personality, out of which benefits are paid. The fund assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of current and
former members of staff who participate in the arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all benefits due under the
arrangement.
2. An unfunded defined benefit arrangement for its Directors, whose entitlement is based on a minimum service period of four
years.
3. An unfunded post-employment health and accident benefit arrangement for its staff. Entitlement to this arrangement is based
in principle on the employee remaining in service up to 50 years of age and the completion of a minimum service period of 10
years.
All arrangements are valued annually by independent actuaries.

Long-term medical cost inflation assumption

The assumed increases in staff salaries, Directors’ pensionable remuneration and pensions payable incorporate an inflation
assumption of 1.5% at 31 March 2012 (2011: 1.5%).
The expected rate of return on fund assets is based on long-term expectations for inflation, interest rates, risk premia and asset
allocations. The estimate takes into consideration historical returns and is determined in conjunction with the fund’s independent
actuaries.
The assumption for medical inflation has a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the profit and loss account. A 1%
change in the assumption for medical inflation compared to that used for the 2011/12 calculation would have the following effects:

The above table includes the nominal value of securities held under safe custody and collateral pledge arrangements, and the net
asset value of portfolio management mandates. Portfolio management mandates include BIS Investment Pools (BISIPs), which
are collective investment arrangements for central banks, and dedicated mandates for single central bank investors.
Gold bars held under earmark comprise specific gold bars which have been deposited with the Bank on a custody basis. They are
included at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and the USD exchange rate into SDR). At 31 March 2012 gold
bars held under earmark amounted to 323 tonnes of fine gold (2011: 297 tonnes).
The financial instruments listed above are deposited with external custodians, either central banks or commercial institutions.
In addition to the off-balance sheet items listed above, the Bank also manages portfolios of BIS currency deposits on behalf of its
customers. These totalled SDR 6,253.2 million at 31 March 2012 (2011: SDR 5,776.7 million). The assets in these portfolios are
included in the balance sheet under the heading “Currency deposits”.

32. Commitments
The Bank provides a number of committed standby facilities for its customers on a collateralised or uncollateralised basis. As at
31 March 2012 the outstanding commitments to extend credit under these committed standby facilities amounted to
SDR 2,570.6 million (2011: SDR 2,287.7 million), of which SDR 193.8 million was uncollateralised (2011: SDR 189.4 million).

33. The fair value hierarchy
The Bank categorises its financial instrument fair value measurements using a hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs
used in measuring fair value. The valuation is categorised at the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement in its entirety. The fair value hierarchy used by the Bank comprises the following levels:
Level 1 – inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
Level 2 – inputs, other than those listed in level 1, are observable for the financial instrument either directly (ie as a price) or
indirectly (ie derived from prices for similar financial instruments). This includes observable interest rates, spreads and volatilities.
Level 3 – inputs are not observable in financial markets.

The Bank considers published price quotations in active markets as the best evidence of fair value. The financial instruments
using active market quote inputs are categorised as level 1.
Where reliable published price quotations are not available for a financial instrument, the Bank determines fair value by using
market standard valuation techniques. These valuation techniques include the use of discounted cash flow models as well as
other standard market valuation methods. Where financial models are used, the Bank aims at making maximum use of observable
market inputs. The financial instruments valued in this manner are categorised as level 2.
A small percentage of the Bank’s financial instruments valuations are produced using valuation techniques that utilise significant
unobservable inputs. The financial instruments valued in this manner are categorised as level 3. The financial instruments
categorised as level 3 at 31 March 2012 and at 31 March 2011 comprise illiquid bonds.
The accuracy of the Bank’s valuations is ensured through an independent price verification exercise performed by the valuation
control function.

The Bank assesses its capital adequacy continuously. The assessment is supported by an annual capital and business planning
process.
The Bank has implemented a risk framework that is consistent with the revised International Convergence of Capital Measurement
and Capital Standards (Basel II Framework) issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in June 2006. The
implementation includes all three pillars of the Framework, and takes the particular scope and nature of the Bank’s activities into
account. Since the Bank is not subject to national banking supervisory regulation, the application of Pillar 2 is limited to the Bank’s
own assessment of capital adequacy. This assessment is based primarily on an economic capital methodology which is more
comprehensive and geared to a substantially higher solvency level than the minimum Pillar 1 capital level required by the
Basel II Framework.

2. Economic capital
The Bank’s own assessment of its capital adequacy is performed on the basis of its economic capital frameworks for market risk,
credit risk, operational risk and other risks. These are designed to determine the amount of equity needed to absorb losses arising
from its exposures to a statistical level of confidence consistent with the objective of maintaining superior credit quality. The
Bank’s economic capital frameworks measure economic capital to a 99.995% confidence level assuming a one-year horizon,
except for settlement risk (included in the utilisation for credit risk) and other risks. The amount of economic capital set aside for
settlement risk and other risks, ie risks which are not, or not fully, reflected in the Bank’s economic capital calculations, is based
on an assessment by Management.
The following table summarises the Bank’s economic capital utilisation for credit risk, market risk, operational risk and other risks:

For credit risk, the Bank has adopted the advanced internal ratings-based approach for the majority of its exposures. Under this
approach, the risk weighting for a transaction is determined by the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own
estimates for key inputs. For certain exposures, the Bank has adopted the standardised approach. Under this approach, risk
weightings are mapped to exposure types.
Risk-weighted assets for market risk are derived following an internal models approach. For operational risk, the advanced
measurement approach is used. Both these approaches rely on value-at-risk (VaR) methodologies. The minimum capital
requirements are derived from the VaR figures and are translated into risk-weighted assets taking into account the 8% minimum
capital requirement.
More details on the assumptions underlying the calculations are provided in the sections on credit risk, market risk and operational
risk.

4. Tier 1 capital ratio
The capital ratio measures capital adequacy by comparing the Bank’s Tier 1 capital with its risk-weighted assets. The table below

As required by the Basel II Framework, expected loss is calculated for credit risk exposures subject to the advanced internal
ratings-based approach. The expected loss is calculated at the balance sheet date taking into account any impairment provision
which is reflected in the Bank’s financial statements. At 31 March 2011 the Bank had an impairment provision of SDR 29.0 million
relating to gold loan assets. The Bank had no impaired financial assets at 31 March 2012. Note 2B to the financial statements
provides details of the impairment provision that was recorded at 31 March 2011. In accordance with the requirements of the
Basel II Framework, the expected loss is compared with the impairment provision and any shortfall is deducted from the Bank’s
Tier 1 capital.
The Bank maintains a very high creditworthiness and performs a comprehensive capital assessment considering its specific
characteristics. As such, it maintains a capital position substantially in excess of the minimum requirement.

Risk management

1. Risks faced by the Bank
The Bank supports its customers, predominantly central banks, monetary authorities and international financial institutions, in the
management of their reserves and related financial activities.
Banking activities form an essential element of meeting the Bank’s objectives and ensure its financial strength and independence.
The BIS engages in banking activities that are customer-related as well as activities that are related to the investment of its equity,
each of which may give rise to financial risk comprising credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The Bank is also exposed to
operational risk.
Within the risk framework defined by the Board of Directors, the Management of the Bank has established risk management
policies designed to ensure that risks are identified, appropriately measured and controlled as well as monitored and reported.

2. Risk management approach and organisation
The Bank maintains superior credit quality and adopts a prudent approach to financial risk-taking, by:

•
•
•
•

maintaining an exceptionally strong capital position;

•

maintaining a high level of liquidity.

investing its assets predominantly in high credit quality financial instruments;
seeking to diversify its assets across a range of sectors;
adopting a conservative approach to its tactical market risk-taking and carefully managing market risk associated with the
Bank’s strategic positions, which include its gold holdings; and

A. Organisation
Under Article 39 of the Bank’s Statutes, the General Manager is responsible to the Board for the management of the Bank, and is
assisted by the Deputy General Manager. The Deputy General Manager is responsible for the Bank’s independent risk control and
compliance functions. The General Manager and the Deputy General Manager are supported by senior management advisory
committees.
The key advisory committees are the Executive Committee, the Finance Committee and the Compliance and Operational Risk
Committee. The first two committees are chaired by the General Manager and the third by the Deputy General Manager, and all
include other senior members of the Bank’s Management. The Executive Committee advises the General Manager primarily on
the Bank’s strategic planning and the allocation of resources, as well as on decisions related to the broad financial objectives for
the banking activities and operational risk management. The Finance Committee advises the General Manager on the financial
management and policy issues related to the banking business, including the allocation of economic capital to risk categories.
The Compliance and Operational Risk Committee acts as an advisory committee to the Deputy General Manager and ensures the
coordination of compliance matters and operational risk management throughout the Bank.
The independent risk control function for financial risks is performed by the Risk Control unit. The independent operational risk
control function is shared between Risk Control, which maintains the operational risk quantification, and the Compliance and
Operational Risk Unit. Both units report directly to the Deputy General Manager.
The Bank’s compliance function is performed by the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit. The objective of this function is to
provide reasonable assurance that the activities of the Bank and its staff conform to applicable laws and regulations, the BIS
Statutes, the Bank’s Code of Conduct and other internal rules, policies and relevant standards of sound practice.
The Compliance and Operational Risk Unit identifies and assesses compliance risks and guides and educates staff on compliance
issues. The Head of the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit also has a direct reporting line to the Audit Committee, which is
an advisory committee to the Board of Directors.
The Finance unit and the Legal Service complement the Bank’s risk management. The Finance unit operates an independent
valuation control function, produces the Bank’s financial statements and controls the Bank’s expenditure by setting and monitoring
the annual budget. The objective of the independent valuation control function is to ensure that the Bank’s valuations comply with
its valuation policy and procedures, and that the processes and procedures which influence the Bank’s valuations conform to best
practice guidelines. The Finance unit reports to the Deputy General Manager and the Secretary General.

BIS 82nd Annual Report

179

The Legal Service provides legal advice and support covering a wide range of issues relating to the Bank’s activities. The Legal
Service has a direct reporting line to the General Manager.
The Internal Audit function reviews internal control procedures and reports on how they comply with internal standards and
industry best practices. The scope of internal audit work includes the review of risk management procedures, internal control
systems, information systems and governance processes. Internal Audit has a direct reporting line to the Audit Committee and is
responsible to the General Manager and the Deputy General Manager.

B. Risk monitoring and reporting
The Bank’s financial and operational risk profile, position and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis by the relevant
units. Financial risk and compliance reports aimed at various management levels are regularly provided to enable Management
to adequately assess the Bank’s risk profile and financial condition.
Management reports financial and risk information to the Board of Directors on a monthly and a quarterly basis. Furthermore,
the Audit Committee receives regular reports from Internal Audit, the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit and the Finance unit.
The Banking and Risk Management Committee, another advisory committee to the Board, receives an annual report from the Risk
Control unit. The preparation of reports is subject to comprehensive policies and procedures, thus ensuring strong controls.

C. Risk methodologies
The Bank revalues virtually all of its financial assets to fair value on a daily basis and reviews its valuations monthly, taking into
account necessary adjustments for impairment. It uses a comprehensive range of quantitative methodologies for valuing financial
instruments and for measuring risk to its net profit and equity. The Bank reassesses its quantitative methodologies in the light of
its changing risk environment and evolving best practice.
The Bank’s model validation policy defines the roles and responsibilities and processes related to the implementation of new or
materially changed risk models.
A key methodology used by the Bank to measure and manage risk is the calculation of economic capital based on value-at-risk
(VaR) techniques. VaR expresses the statistical estimate of the maximum potential loss on the current positions of the Bank
measured to a specified level of confidence and a specified time horizon.
The Bank’s economic capital calculation is designed to measure the amount of equity needed to absorb losses arising from its
exposures to a statistical level of confidence determined by the Bank’s aim to remain of the highest creditworthiness.
The Bank assesses its capital adequacy on the basis of economic capital frameworks for market risk, credit risk, operational risk
and other risks, supplemented by sensitivity and risk factor analyses. The Bank’s economic capital frameworks measure economic
capital to a 99.995% confidence interval assuming a one-year holding period.
The Bank allocates economic capital to the above risk categories. An additional amount of economic capital is set aside based on
Management’s assessment of risks which are not, or not fully, reflected in the economic capital calculations.
A comprehensive stress testing framework complements the Bank’s risk assessment including its VaR and economic capital
calculations for financial risk. The Bank’s key market risk factors and credit exposures are stress-tested. The stress testing includes
the analysis of severe historical and adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, as well as sensitivity tests of extreme but
still plausible movements of the key risk factors identified. The Bank also performs stress tests related to liquidity risk.

BIS 82nd Annual Report

3. Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to meet its obligations in accordance with the agreed contractual terms and
conditions. A financial asset is considered past due when a counterparty fails to make a payment on the contractual due date.
The Bank manages credit risk within a framework and policies set by the Board of Directors and Management. These are
complemented by more detailed guidelines and procedures at the level of the independent risk control function.

A. Credit risk assessment
Credit risk is continuously controlled at both a counterparty and an aggregated level. As part of the independent risk control
function, individual counterparty credit assessments are performed subject to a well defined internal rating process, involving 18
rating grades. As part of this process, counterparty financial statements and market information are analysed. The rating
methodologies depend on the nature of the counterparty. Based on the internal rating and specific counterparty features, the Bank
sets a series of credit limits covering individual counterparties and countries. Internal ratings are assigned to all counterparties.
In principle, the ratings and related limits are reviewed at least annually. The main assessment criterion in these reviews is the
ability of the counterparties to meet interest and principal repayment obligations in a timely manner.
Credit risk limits at the counterparty level are approved by the Bank’s Management and fit within a framework set by the Board
of Directors.
On an aggregated level credit risk, including default and country transfer risk, is measured, monitored and controlled based on
the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit risk. To calculate economic capital for credit risk, the Bank uses a portfolio VaR
model. Management limits the Bank’s overall exposure to credit risk by allocating an amount of economic capital to credit risk.

B. Default risk
The following tables show the exposure of the Bank to default risk, without taking into account any collateral held or other credit
enhancements available to the Bank. Credit risk is further mitigated through the use of collateral and legally enforceable netting
or setoff agreements. The corresponding assets and liabilities are not offset on the balance sheet.
The exposures set out in the tables below are based on the carrying value of the assets on the balance sheet as categorised by
sector, geographical region and credit quality. The carrying value is the fair value of the financial instruments, including derivatives,
except in the case of very short-term financial instruments (sight and notice accounts) and gold, which are shown at amortised
cost net of any impairment charge. Commitments are reported at their notional amounts. Gold and gold loans exclude gold bar
assets held in custody, and accounts receivable do not include unsettled liability issues, because these items do not represent
credit exposures of the Bank.
The vast majority of the Bank’s assets are invested in securities issued by G10 governments and financial institutions rated A– or
above by at least one of the major external credit assessment institutions. Limitations on the number of high-quality counterparties
in these sectors mean that the Bank is exposed to single-name concentration risk.
The Bank conducts an annual review for impairment at the date of each balance sheet. At 31 March 2012 the Bank did not have
any financial assets that were considered to be impaired (31 March 2011: SDR 29.0 million). As at 31 March 2012 no financial
assets were considered past due (31 March 2011: nil). During the period under review, the Bank recorded a credit loss of
SDR 31.9 million (2011: nil) due to a sovereign debt restructuring.

C. Credit risk mitigation
Credit risk is mitigated through the use of collateral and legally enforceable netting or setoff agreements. The corresponding
assets and liabilities are not offset on the balance sheet.
The Bank requires counterparties to provide collateral, under reverse repurchase agreements, some derivative financial instrument
contracts and certain drawn-down facility agreements, to mitigate counterparty default risk in accordance with the respective
policies and procedures. During the term of the agreement, the Bank monitors the fair value of the collateral securities and may
call for further collateral or be required to return collateral based on the movement in its market value.
The Bank mitigates settlement risk by using established clearing centres and by settling transactions where possible through a
delivery versus payment settlement mechanism. Daily settlement risk limits are monitored on a continuous basis.
The table below shows the collateral obtained by the Bank. It excludes transactions which have yet to settle (on which neither
cash nor collateral has been exchanged).

The Bank is allowed to sell or pledge collateral obtained, but must deliver equivalent financial instruments upon expiry of the
contract. The Bank accepts sovereign securities and cash as collateral for derivatives. Eligible collateral for reverse repurchase
agreements comprises sovereign and supranational debt as well as state agency securities. Eligible collateral for loans and
advances includes currency deposits with the Bank as well as units in the BIS Investment Pools (BISIPs) and securities in portfolios
managed by the BIS.

BIS 82nd Annual Report

185

As at 31 March 2012 the total amount of undrawn facilities which could be drawn down subject to collateralisation by the
counterparty was SDR 2,376.8 million (2011: SDR 2,098.3 million).
The Bank did not provide collateral on any of its financial instrument contracts as at 31 March 2012 (2011: nil).

D. Economic capital for credit risk
The Bank determines economic capital for credit risk using a VaR methodology on the basis of a portfolio VaR model, assuming
a one-year time horizon and a 99.995% confidence interval, except for settlement risk (included in the utilisation for credit risk
since July 2011). The amount of economic capital set aside for settlement risk reflected in the Bank’s economic capital calculations
is based on an assessment by Management.

E. Minimum capital requirements for credit risk
Exposure to sovereigns, banks and corporates
For the calculation of risk-weighted assets for exposures to banks, sovereigns and corporates, the Bank has adopted an approach
that is consistent with the advanced internal ratings-based approach.
As a general rule, under this approach risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying the credit risk exposures with risk
weights derived from the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs. These estimates for
key inputs are also relevant to the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit risk.
The credit risk exposure for a transaction or position is referred to as the exposure at default (EAD). The Bank determines the EAD
as the notional amount of all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures, except derivative contracts and certain collateralised
exposures. The EAD for derivatives is calculated using an approach consistent with the internal models method proposed under
the Basel II Framework. In line with this methodology, the Bank calculates effective expected positive exposures that are then
multiplied by a factor alpha as set out in the Framework.
Key inputs to the risk weight function are a counterparty’s estimated one-year probability of default (PD) as well as the estimated
loss-given-default (LGD) and maturity for each transaction.
Due to the high credit quality of the Bank’s investments and the conservative credit risk management process at the BIS, the Bank
is not in a position to estimate PDs and LGDs based on its own default experience. The Bank calibrates counterparty PD estimates
through a mapping of internal rating grades to external credit assessments taking external default data into account. Similarly,
LGD estimates are derived from external data. Where appropriate, these estimates are adjusted to reflect the risk-reducing effects
of collateral obtained giving consideration to market price volatility, remargining and revaluation frequency. The recognition of
the risk-reducing effects of collateral obtained for derivative contracts, reverse repurchase agreements and collateralised advances
is accounted for in calculating the EAD.
The table below details the calculation of risk-weighted assets. The exposures are measured taking netting and collateral benefits
into account. The total amount of exposures reported in the table as at 31 March 2012 includes SDR 421.4 million for interest rate
contracts (31 March 2011: SDR 463.0 million) and SDR 726.5 million for FX and gold contracts (31 March 2011: SDR 287.5 million).

F. Securitisation exposures
The Bank invests in highly rated securitisation exposures based on traditional, ie non-synthetic, securitisation structures. Given
the scope of the Bank’s activities, risk-weighted assets under the Basel II Framework are determined according to the standardised
approach for securitisation. Under this approach, external credit assessments of the securities are used to determine the relevant
risk weights. External credit assessment institutions used for this purpose are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and
Fitch Ratings. Risk-weighted assets are then derived as the product of the notional amounts of the exposures and the associated
risk weights.
The following table shows the Bank’s investments in securitisation analysed by type of securitised assets:

4. Market risk
The Bank is exposed to market risk through adverse movements in market prices. The main components of the Bank’s market risk
are gold price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The Bank measures market risk and calculates economic capital
based on a VaR methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Risk factor volatilities and correlations are estimated
using a one-year observation period. Furthermore, the Bank computes sensitivities to certain market risk factors.
In line with the Bank’s objective of maintaining its superior credit quality, economic capital is measured at the 99.995% confidence
interval assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank’s Management manages market risk economic capital usage within a
framework set by the Board of Directors. VaR limits are supplemented by operating limits.
VaR models depend on statistical assumptions and the quality of available market data and, while forward-looking, they extrapolate
from past events.
To ensure that models provide a reliable measure of potential losses over the one-year time horizon, the Bank has established a
comprehensive regular backtesting framework, comparing daily performance with corresponding VaR estimates. The results are
analysed and reported to Management.
The Bank also supplements its market risk measurement based on VaR modelling and related economic capital calculations with
a series of stress tests. These include severe historical scenarios, adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios and sensitivity
tests of gold price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements.

A. Gold price risk
Gold price risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in the price of gold.
The Bank is exposed to gold price risk principally through its holdings of gold investment assets, which amount to 116 tonnes
(2011: 119 tonnes). These gold investment assets are held in custody or placed on deposit with commercial banks. At 31 March
2012 the Bank’s net gold investment assets amounted to SDR 4,018.2 million (2011: SDR 3,451.2 million), approximately 22% of
its equity (2011: 21%). The Bank sometimes also has small exposures to gold price risk arising from its banking activities with
central and commercial banks. Gold price risk is measured within the Bank’s VaR methodology, including its economic capital
framework and stress tests.

B. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates including credit spreads.
The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk through the interest bearing assets relating to the management of its equity held in its
investment portfolios and investments relating to its banking portfolios. The investment portfolios are managed using a fixed
duration benchmark of bonds.
The Bank measures and monitors interest rate risk using a VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses taking into account
movements in relevant money market rates, government bonds, swap rates and credit spreads.
The tables below show the impact on the Bank’s equity of a 1% upward shift in the relevant yield curve per time band:

risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in exchange rates. The Bank is exposed to foreign
exchange risk primarily through the assets relating to the management of its equity. The Bank is also exposed to foreign exchange
risk through managing its customer deposits and through acting as an intermediary in foreign exchange transactions between
central and commercial banks. The Bank reduces its foreign exchange exposures by matching the relevant assets to the constituent
currencies of the SDR on a regular basis, and by limiting currency exposures arising from customer deposits and foreign exchange
transaction intermediation.
Foreign exchange risk is measured and monitored based on the Bank’s VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses considering
movements in key foreign exchange rates.
The following tables show the Bank’s assets and liabilities by currency and gold exposure. The net foreign exchange and gold
position in these tables therefore includes the Bank’s gold investments. To determine the Bank’s net foreign exchange exposure,
the gold amounts need to be removed. The SDR-neutral position is then deducted from the net foreign exchange position
excluding gold to arrive at the net currency exposure of the Bank on an SDR-neutral basis.

D. Economic capital for market risk
The Bank measures market risk based on a VaR methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique taking correlations
between risk factors into account. Economic capital for market risk is also calculated following this methodology measured to the
99.995% confidence interval and assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank measures its gold price risk relative to changes
in the USD value of gold. The foreign exchange risk component, resulting from changes in the USD exchange rate versus the
SDR, is included in the measurement of foreign exchange risk. The table below shows the key figures of the Bank’s exposure to
market risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years.

E. Minimum capital requirements for market risk
For the calculation of minimum capital requirements for market risk under the Basel II Framework, the Bank has adopted a
banking book approach consistent with the scope and nature of its business activities. Consequently, market risk-weighted assets
are determined for gold price risk and foreign exchange risk, but not interest rate risk. The related minimum capital requirement
is derived using the VaR-based internal models method. Under this method, VaR calculations are performed using the Bank’s VaR
methodology, assuming a 99% confidence interval, a 10-day holding period and a one-year historical observation period.
The actual minimum capital requirement is derived as the higher of the VaR on the calculation date and the average of the daily
VaR measures on each of the preceding 60 business days (including the calculation date) subject to a multiplication factor of three
plus a potential add-on depending on backtesting results. For the period under consideration, the number of backtesting outliers
observed remained within the range where no add-on is required. The table below summarises the market risk development
relevant to the calculation of minimum capital requirements and the related risk-weighted assets over the reporting period.

5. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises when the Bank may not be able to meet expected or unexpected current or future cash flows and collateral
needs without affecting its daily operations or its financial condition.
Outstanding balances in the currency and gold deposits from central banks, international organisations and other public
institutions are the key drivers of the size of the Bank’s balance sheet. The Bank has undertaken to repurchase at fair value certain
of its currency deposit instruments at one or two business days’ notice. The Bank has developed a liquidity management
framework based on a statistical model underpinned by conservative assumptions with regard to cash inflows and the liquidity
of liabilities. Within this framework, the Board of Directors has set a limit for the Bank’s liquidity ratio which requires liquid assets
to be at least 100% of the potential liquidity requirement. In addition, liquidity stress tests assuming extreme withdrawal scenarios
are performed. These stress tests specify additional liquidity requirements to be met by holdings of liquid assets. The Bank’s
liquidity has consistently been materially above its minimum liquidity ratio and the requirements of its stress tests.
The Bank’s currency and gold deposits, principally from central banks and international institutions, comprise 91% (2011: 93%) of
its total liabilities. At 31 March 2012 currency and gold deposits originated from 172 depositors (2011: 171). Within these deposits,
there are significant individual customer concentrations, with five customers each contributing in excess of 5% of the total on a
settlement date basis (2011: four customers).
The following tables show the maturity profile of cash flows for assets and liabilities. The amounts disclosed are the undiscounted
cash flows to which the Bank is committed.

6. Operational risk
Operational risk is defined by the Bank as the risk of financial loss, or damage to the Bank’s reputation, or both, resulting from
one or more risk causes, as outlined below:

•

Human factors: insufficient personnel, lack of requisite knowledge, skills or experience, inadequate training and development,
inadequate supervision, loss of key personnel, inadequate succession planning, or lack of integrity or ethical standards.

•

Failed or inadequate processes: a process is poorly designed or unsuitable, or is not properly documented, understood,
implemented, followed or enforced.

•
•

Failed or inadequate systems: a system is poorly designed, unsuitable or unavailable, or does not operate as intended.
External events: the occurrence of an event having an adverse impact on the Bank but outside its control.

Operational risk includes legal risk, but excludes strategic risk.
The Bank’s operational risk management framework, policies and procedures comprise the management and measurement of
operational risk, including the determination of the relevant key parameters and inputs, business continuity planning and the
monitoring of key risk indicators.
The Bank has established a procedure of immediate reporting for operational risk-related incidents. The Compliance and
Operational Risk Unit develops action plans with the respective units and follows up on their implementation on a regular basis.
For the measurement of operational risk economic capital and operational risk-weighted assets, the Bank has adopted a VaR
approach using a Monte Carlo simulation technique that is consistent with the advanced measurement approach proposed under
the Basel II Framework. In line with the assumptions of the Basel II Framework, the quantification of operational risk does not take
reputational risk into account. Internal and external loss data, scenario estimates and control self-assessments to reflect changes
in the business and control environment of the Bank are key inputs in the calculations. In quantifying its operational risk, the Bank
does not take potential protection it may obtain from insurance into account.

A. Economic capital for operational risk
Consistent with the parameters used in the calculation of economic capital for financial risk, the Bank measures economic capital
for operational risk to the 99.995% confidence interval assuming a one-year holding period. The table below shows the key figures
of the Bank’s exposure to operational risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years.

Independent auditor’s report
to the Board of Directors and to the General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements, Basel
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Bank for International Settlements,
which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 March 2012, and the profit and loss account, the
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies
and other explanatory information.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements
in accordance with the Statutes and with the principles of valuation described under significant
accounting policies in the notes, and for such internal control as management determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal
control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the
Bank for International Settlements as at 31 March 2012 and of its financial performance and its
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the accounting principles described in the
notes to the financial statements and the Statutes of the Bank.
