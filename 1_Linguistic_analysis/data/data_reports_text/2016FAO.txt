FOREWORD

Following last year’s historic Paris
Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development – marking a path
towards a more sustainable future – 2016 is
about putting commitments into action. The
rapid change in the world’s climate is
translating into more extreme and frequent
weather events, heat waves, droughts and
sea-level rise.

change threatens all dimensions of food
securit y. It will expose both urban and rural
poor to higher and more volatile food prices.
It will also affect food availabilit y by
reducing the productivit y of crops, livestock
and fisheries, and hinder access to food by
disrupting the livelihoods of millions of
rural people who depend on agriculture for
their incomes.

The impacts of climate change on
agriculture and the implications for food
securit y are already alarming – they are the
subjects of this report. A major finding is
that there is an urgent need to support
smallholders in adapting to climate change.
Farmers, pastoralists, fisherfolk and
communit y foresters depend on activities
that are intimately and inextricably linked to
climate – and these groups are also the most
v ulnerable to climate change. They will
require far greater access to technologies,
markets, information and credit for
investment to adjust their production
systems and practices to climate change.

Hunger, povert y and climate change need to
be tackled together. This is, not least, a
moral imperative as those who are now
suffering most have contributed least to the
changing climate. The report describes ways
of adapting smallholder production to
climate change and making the livelihoods
of rural populations more resilient.
Diversification and better integration of food
production systems into complex ecological
processes create synergies with the natural
habitat instead of depleting natural
resources. Agroecolog y and sustainable
intensification are examples of approaches
that improve yields and build resilience
through practices such as green manuring,
nitrogen-fixing cover crops and sustainable
soil management, and integration with
agroforestr y and animal production.

Unless action is taken now to make
agriculture more sustainable, productive and
resilient, climate change impacts will seriously
compromise food production in countries and
regions that are already highly food-insecure.
These impacts will jeopardize progress
towards the key Sustainable Development
Goals of ending hunger and povert y by 2030;
beyond 2030, their increasingly negative
impacts on agriculture will be widespread.

More resilient agriculture sectors and
intelligent investments into smallholder
farmers can deliver transformative change,
and enhance the prospects and incomes of
the world’s poorest while buffering them
against the impacts of climate change. This
report shows how the benefits of adaptation
outweigh the costs of inaction by ver y wide
margins. For this transformation towards

gases. Appropriate land use and soil
management lead to improved soil qualit y
and fertilit y and can help mitigate the rise of
atmospheric CO 2 .

sustainable and more equitable agriculture,
access to adequate extension advice and
markets must improve, while insecurit y of
tenure, high transaction costs, and lower
resource endowments, especially among
rural women, are barriers that will need to
be overcome.

It is essential that national commitments –
the countr y pledges that form the basis of
the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate
change – turn into action. The Conference of
the Parties that will be held in November
2016 in Morocco will have a clear focus on
implementation in the agriculture sectors.
This report identifies strategies, financing
opportunities and data and information
needs, and describes transformative policies
and institutions that can overcome barriers
to implementation. As countries revise and,
hopefully, ramp up their national plans,
success in implementing their
commitments – particularly in the
agriculture sectors – will be vital to creating
a virtuous circle of higher ambition.

Livelihood diversification can also help rural
households manage climate risks by
combining on-farm activities with seasonal
work, in agriculture and in other sectors. In
all cases, social protection programmes will
need to play an important role – in helping
smallholders better manage risk, reducing
v ulnerabilit y to food price volatilit y, and
enhancing the employment prospects of
rural people who leave the land.
In order to keep the increase in global
temperature below the crucial ceiling of 2 °C,
emissions will have to be reduced by as much
as 70 percent by 2050. Keeping climate
change within manageable levels can only be
achieved with the contribution of the
agriculture sectors. They now account for at
least one-fifth of total emissions, mainly from
the conversion of forests to farmland as well
as from livestock and crop production. The
challenge is to reduce those emissions while
meeting unprecedented demand for food.

Climate change is a cornerstone of the work
undertaken by FAO. To assist its Members, we
have invested in areas that promote food
securit y hand in hand with climate change
adaptation and mitigation. FAO is helping to
reorient food and agricultural systems in
countries most exposed to climate risks, with a
clear focus on supporting smallholder farmers.

The agriculture sectors can substantially
contribute to balancing the global carbon
cycle. Similarly, in the forestr y sector,
avoiding deforestation, increasing the area
under forest, and adopting sustained-yield
management in timber production can bind
large amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide

agriculture, forestr y and fisheries to adopt
climate-friendly practices. This will
determine whether humanit y succeeds in
eradicating hunger and povert y by 2030 and
producing food for all. “Business as usual” is
not an option. Agriculture has always been
the interface between natural resources and
human activit y. Today it holds the key to
solving the two greatest challenges facing
humanit y: eradicating povert y, and
maintaining the stable climatic corridor in
which civilization can thrive.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
THE WORLD FACES AN UNPRECEDENTED
DOUBLE CHALLENGE: TO ERADICATE
HUNGER AND POVERTY AND TO
STABILIZE THE GLOBAL CLIMATE BEFORE
IT IS TOO LATE

A broad-based transformation of food and
agriculture systems is needed, therefore, to ensure
global food security, provide economic and social
opportunities for all, protect the ecosystem
services on which agriculture depends, and build
resilience to climate change. Without adaptation
to climate change, it will not be possible to achieve
food security for all and eradicate hunger,
malnutrition and poverty.

In adopting the goals of the 2030 Agenda on
Sustainable Development and the Paris
Agreement on Climate Change, the international
communit y took responsibilit y for building a
sustainable future. But meeting the goals of
eradicating hunger and povert y by 2030, while
addressing the threat of climate change, will
require a profound transformation of food and
agriculture systems worldwide.

BECAUSE ADVERSE IMPACTS WILL
WORSEN WITH TIME, A GLOBAL
TRANSFORMATION TO SUSTAINABLE
FOOD AND AGRICULTURE MUST
BEGIN NOW

Achieving the transformation to sustainable
agriculture is a major challenge. Changes will
need to be made in a way that does not jeopardize
the capacity of the agriculture sectors – crops,
livestock, fisheries and forestry – to meet the
world’s food needs. Global food demand in 2050 is
projected to increase by at least 60 percent above
2006 levels, driven by population and income
growth, as well as rapid urbanization. In the
coming decades, population increases will be
concentrated in regions with the highest
prevalence of undernourishment and high
vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. At
the same time, efforts by the agriculture sectors to
contribute to a carbon-neutral world are leading to
competing demands on water and land used to
produce food and energ y, and to forest
conservation initiatives that reduce greenhouse
gas emissions but limit land available for crop and
livestock production.

The effects of climate change on agricultural
production and livelihoods are expected to
intensif y over time, and to var y across countries
and regions. Beyond 2030, the negative impacts
of climate change on the productivit y of crops,
livestock, fisheries and forestr y will become
increasingly severe in all regions.
Productivit y declines would have serious
implications for food securit y. Food supply
shortfalls would lead to major increases in food
prices, while increased climate variabilit y would
accentuate price volatilit y. Since the areas most
affected would be those with already high rates
of hunger and povert y, food price increases would
directly affect millions of low-income people.
Among the most v ulnerable will be those who
depend on agriculture for their livelihood and
income, particularly smallholder producers in
developing countries.

The transformation will also need to involve
millions of food producers in adapting to climate
change impacts, which are already being felt in the
agricultural sectors and especially so in tropical
regions, which are home to most of the poor and
food insecure. It must also reverse the widespread
degradation of agriculture’s natural resource base –
from soil to forests to fisheries – which threatens
the very sustainability of food production.

While climate change is but one driver of poverty
and food insecurity, its impacts are expected to be
substantial. In the absence of climate change, and
with continuing economic progress, most regions
are projected to see a decline in the number of
people at risk of hunger by 2050. With climate
change, however, the population living in poverty
could increase by between 35 and 122 million by

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

2030 relative to a future without climate change,
largely due to its negative impacts on incomes in
the agricultural sector. The increase in the number
of poor would be biggest in sub-Saharan Africa,
partly because its population is more reliant on
agriculture.

barriers on the path to sustainable agriculture,
such as limited access to markets, credit,
extension advice, weather information, risk
management tools and social protection. Women,
who make up around 43 percent of the
agricultural labour force in developing countries,
are especially disadvantaged, with fewer
endowments and entitlements than men, even
more limited access to information and ser vices,
gender-determined household responsibilities,
and increasingly heav y agricultural workloads
owing to male out-migration.

Food and agriculture must be central to global
efforts to adapt to climate change, through policies
and actions that address vulnerabilities and risks
and promote agricultural systems that are resilient
and sustainable. This action must begin now – with
the increasing intensity of climate change impacts,
building resilience will become ever more difficult.
Delaying the transformation of the agricultural
sectors will force poorer countries to fight poverty,
hunger and climate change at the same time.

There is no simple “technological fix”. What is
needed is a reorientation of agricultural and rural
development policies that resets incentives and
lowers the barriers to the transformation of food
and agricultural systems. Particular attention
should be given to supporting low-income
smallholder farmers in strengthening their
capacit y to manage risks and adopt effective
climate change adaptation strategies.

ECONOMICALLY VIABLE AND SUSTAINABLE
FARMING PRACTICES ARE AVAILABLE,
BUT BARRIERS TO THEIR ADOPTION MUST
BE OVERCOME

MOVING BEYOND FARMING PRACTICES:
SMALLHOLDERS’ ADAPTATION TO
CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS WILL BE CRITICAL
FOR GLOBAL POVERTY REDUCTION AND
FOOD SECURITY

Significant improvements in food security, as well
as resilience to climate change can be achieved
with the introduction of sustainable agricultural
practices. Wide adoption of practices such as the
use of nitrogen-efficient and heat-tolerant crop
varieties, zero-tillage and integrated soil fertility
management would boost productivity and
farmers’ incomes, and help lower food prices. By
one estimate, the number of people at risk of
undernourishment in developing countries in 2050
could be reduced by more than 120 million
through widespread use of nitrogen-efficient crop
varieties alone.

The sheer number of smallholder farm families in
developing countries – some 475 million –
justifies a specific focus on the threat posed by
climate change to their livelihoods and the
urgent need to transform those livelihoods along
sustainable pathways. It will be difficult, if not
impossible, to eradicate global povert y and end
hunger without building resilience to climate
change in smallholder agriculture through the
widespread adoption of sustainable land, water,
fisheries and forestr y management practices.
With other enabling factors in place – such as
adequate access to credit and markets, but also
action to eliminate legal, socio-cultural and
mobilit y constraints on rural women – those
practices have been found to yield significant

Despite this potential, the adoption by farmers of
improved practices is still ver y limited. Often,
adoption is hampered by policies, such as input
subsidies, that perpetuate unsustainable
production practices rather than those that
promote resource-use efficiency, soil
conser vation and the reduction in the intensit y of
agriculture’s own greenhouse gas emissions.
Smallholders, especially, face a broad range of

a global responsibilit y and requires all economic
sectors to shift to low emission intensit y.

productivit y improvements. However, improved
management practices may not be enough to
sustain farmer incomes.
Farmers can further enhance their resilience
through diversification, which can reduce the
impact of climate shocks on income and provide
households with a broader range of options when
managing future risks. One form of
diversification is to integrate production of crops,
livestock and trees – for example, some
agroforestr y systems use the leaves of nitrogenfixing leg uminous trees to feed cattle, use
manure to fertilize the soil, and grow pulses to
provide extra protein during periods of seasonal
food insecurit y.

Agriculture, and the food sector at large, have an
important responsibilit y in climate change
mitigation. Taken together, agriculture, forestr y
and land-use change account for about one-fifth
of global GHG emissions. Carbon dioxide
emissions from agriculture are mainly
attributable to losses of above and below ground
organic matter, through changes in land use,
such as conversion of forests to pasture or
cropland, and land degradation such as caused by
over-grazing. The bulk of direct emissions of
methane and nitrous oxide, two potent GHGs,
are the result of enteric fermentation in livestock,
rice production in f looded fields, and the
application of nitrogen fertilizer and manure, all
of which can be reduced through the
implementation of better management practices.

For farm households with limited options for
on-farm diversification, livelihood diversification
through non-farm rural employment or migration
to cities may be essential. Adaptation through
sustainable intensification and agricultural
diversification may have to be combined, therefore,
with the creation of off-farm opportunities, both
locally and through strengthened rural-urban
linkages. Gender issues may need to be addressed –
social norms often prevent women from pursuing
off-farm activities. Social protection, education and
active labour market policies are needed to mitigate
many of the risks associated with diversification
and migration.

The share of the food system as a whole in total
global GHG emissions is even greater – further
emissions are generated by the manufacture of
agrochemicals, by fossil energ y use in farm
operations, and in post-production
transportation, processing and retailing.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

As agricultural production increases to meet
demand, so too will its emissions. Major
improvements in the management of the carbon
and nitrogen cycles in agriculture would be
needed to achieve a reduction in emission
intensities – or emissions per unit of agricultural
output – to counterbalance the tendency of the
agriculture sectors to emit more as they produce
more. Hence, achieving the mitigation potential
in the agriculture sectors will not be easy – not
only because of the major transformations needed
in agriculture for broader adoption of improved
practices, but also because of projected increases
in demand for agricultural products.

access to credit, and social insurance, which are
at the heart of rural development, need to go
hand in hand in order to foster the adoption of
improved practices and the diversification of
rural livelihoods.
Available estimates suggest that the aggregate
cost of adaptation and making farm systems more
resilient are only a fraction of the costs of
inaction. Adaptation efforts make good economic
sense and also have considerable potential to
reduce the GHG emissions generated by
agriculture, forestr y and land-use change.
Increasing resource-use efficiency, cutting the
use of fossil fuels and avoiding direct
environmental degradation will save farmers
money, enhance productivit y sustainably and
reduce dependence on external inputs.

Not all mitigation options can be seen as
adaptation measures with important mitigation
co-benefits. Other initiatives are intrinsically
driven by a mitigation motive. For example,
putting a halt to deforestation and forest
degradation arg uably has the largest potential for
emission reduction in the agriculture sectors.
This should be a top priorit y, but will require
accepting trade-offs: reducing deforestation often
comes at a cost to the farmer. Efforts in this
direction are under way through the REDD+
initiative, under the umbrella of the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC). Although emissions from the
conversion of forests have declined significantly
over the past two decades, the trade-offs involved
make these gains fragile. Unlike other economic
sectors where adaptation and mitigation actions
are generally independent of each other, in the
agriculture sectors the objectives of food securit y,
adaptation and mitigation, are interlinked.

Multiple concrete examples exist of how efforts at
adaptation and mitigation can go hand in hand.
Improvements in crop production and fertilizer
management appear to offer the greatest
potential for reducing nitrous oxide emissions,
while also reducing input costs. Increasing stocks
of soil organic carbon improves crop yields and
builds resilience to drought and flooding, but
also sequesters carbon. Alternate wetting and
drying of rice fields reduces methane emissions
from paddies by 45 percent, while saving water
and producing yields similar to those of fully
flooded rice. In both temperate and tropical
regions, farming system diversification and croplivestock-tree integration could increase farmscale efficiency, reduce emissions intensity and
raise productivity. In the livestock sector, the
general adoption of sustainable practices could
cut livestock methane emissions by up to
41 percent while also increasing productivity
through better animal feeding, animal health
and herd structure management. However, the
uptake of these practices is often low in many
areas. Efforts to foster their adoption by
smallholders need to be informed by a thorough
understanding of the existing financial,
institutional and policy barriers.

Even the widespread adoption of climate-smart,
sustainable agriculture may fall short of what is
needed to meet global climate targets. Big
adjustments are required in food systems at large.
About one-third of all food produced in the world
is lost or wasted post-har vest. Reducing food
losses and waste would not only improve the
efficiency of the food system, but would also
reduce both pressure on natural resources and

emissions of greenhouse gases. The energ y use
and emission-intensit y of food processing,
conser vation and transportation are high and
increasing. Reducing emission intensit y along the
entire food chain will require significant changes
in consumer awareness, as well as price
incentives that favour food items with much
smaller environmental footprints. Rebalancing
diets towards less animal-sourced foods would
make an important contribution in this direction,
with probable co-benefits for human health.

Many countries have designed broad climate
change policies and strategies, which establish
global objectives and targets. However, few have
spelled out the details of action plans to achieve
climate targets. The INDCs are a first step in a
much broader process of rethinking agricultural
and rural development under climate change. The
UNFCCC has already established meaningful
mechanisms, such as National Adaptation Plans,
to underpin concerted actions to address climate
change. In line with the policy recommendations
of this report, those mechanisms should be
integrated into broader agricultural and food
securit y and nutrition policies, and vice-versa.

PARIS AGREEMENT COMMITMENTS NEED
TO UNDERPIN SYSTEM-WIDE ACTION IN
FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
Transformative change in agriculture and food
systems appears to be economically and
technically feasible. However, change will only
come about if supported by appropriate policies,
institutional frameworks and investment finance
mechanisms. These enabling factors are
important for agricultural development in
general, but are made even more necessar y by
climate change. Policy frameworks need to be
drastically modified to align agricultural
development, food securit y and nutrition, and
climate stabilit y objectives.

POLICIES ON CLIMATE, AGRICULTURE,
FOOD AND NUTRITION SHOULD BE
REALIGNED AND INTEGRATED
Policies, market forces and environmental
constraints drive the use of inputs and other
resources in agriculture, inf luencing productivit y
and the degree of conser vation or depletion of
natural resources. Policy-making for agriculture
under climate change should start from an
understanding of those drivers and their impacts
on farmers’ livelihoods and the environment.
This is a complex task and win-win solutions
may not always be possible. Drivers var y
significantly between countries and regions –
smallholder farmers do not have the same
capacit y as global agribusinesses to respond to
policy and market signals.

The Intended Nationally Determined
Contributions (INDCs), which formed the basis
of the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate
Change, are now to become Nationally
Determined Contributions (NDCs) to global
climate objectives, through policies and actions.
The agriculture sectors feature prominently in
the INDCs, with 94 percent of all countries
including them in their mitigation and/or
adaptation contributions. Developing countries
highlight the importance of agriculture and
food securit y for adaptation; often, they also
include the agriculture sectors as contributing
to their mitigation targets. Around one-third of
all countries refer in their INDCs to the
potential co-benefits between mitigation and
adaptation in agriculture. There is a clear

Policymakers must recognize the need to manage
trade-offs, and set out concrete measures for
better aligning multiple objectives and incentive

problems and increase the risks of their

and international cooperation will be needed to
facilitate information and knowledge sharing, to
manage common resources such as fish stocks,
and to conser ve and utilize agrobiodiversit y.
Cooperation is also needed to close gaps in our
knowledge of climate change impacts on
agriculture, food securit y and nutrition, to
evaluate the scalabilit y and economic viabilit y of
sustainable farming practices, and to assess the
ecological footprint of food systems at large.

potential for policy realignment is the redesign of
agricultural support measures in a way that
facilitates, rather than impedes, the transition to
sustainable agriculture. In 2015, developed and
major developing countries spent more than
US$560 billion on agricultural production
support, including subsidies on inputs and direct
payments to farmers. Some measures, such as
input subsidies, may induce inefficient use of
agrochemicals and increase the emissions
intensit y of production. Making support
conditional upon the adoption of practices that
lower emissions and conser ve natural resources
is one way of aligning agricultural development
and climate goals.

AGRICULTURAL AND CLIMATE FINANCE
NEED TO BE LINKED AND LEVERAGED TO
INDUCE TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE IN
AGRICULTURE

Policies on nutrition, food consumption, food
price support, natural resources management,
infrastructure development, energ y and so on,
may similarly need to be re-set. To address tradeoffs, the process must ensure greater
inclusiveness and transparency in decisionmaking, as well as incentives that provide longterm public and collective benefits. For example,
experience shows that forests can be well
managed and degradation reversed by involving
local communities, supported by legitimate
decentralized institutional arrangements
developed through consultative processes.

More climate financing and agricultural
investments are need to facilitate the transition to
sustainable agricultural practices. However,
available finance for investment in agriculture falls
well short of needs. Smallholder producers in
developing countries face major hurdles in
accessing credit for investing in new technologies
and practices, and female farmers even more so.
The shortfall in finance limits investment in
agriculture and food security and, with it, the
capacity of smallholders to adapt to climate change.

Climate change brings new risks. Managing them
requires enhanced forms of collective action and
systems that assess risks, v ulnerabilities and
adaptation options. Well-designed social
protection programmes, which g uarantee
minimum incomes or access to food, have an
important role to play, but should be aligned with
other forms of climate risk management. Instead
of simply responding to extreme events, disaster
risk reduction should be embedded in broader
strategies for climate change adaptation.

More climate finance needs to f low to
agriculture to fund the investment cost
associated with the required large-scale
transformation of its sectors and the
development of climate-smart food production
systems. Additional finance from public sources,
as well as customized financial products, will be
needed in two areas of financing.
First, more upfront support is necessary for
increasing farmers’ productivity, building capacity
to adapt to climate change and reducing the
emissions intensity of production. This will
require a significant increase in the amount of
finance available, and more flexible conditions,
such as repayment schedules adjusted to cash

In responding to climate change, international
cooperation and multi-stakeholder partnerships
and alliances are essential. For example, climate
change will lead to new pests and disease
| xvi |

Climate finance could help address the funding
gap by demonstrating the viabilit y of climatesmart agricultural investments, and designing
and piloting innovative mechanisms to leverage
additional sources of investment. Climate funds –
if used strategically to build the enabling
environment essential for climate-smart
agricultural development, to ensure that public
agricultural investment is climate-smart, and to
leverage private finance – could become an
important catalyst for climate change adaptation
and mitigation.

flows. This approach would allow farmers to make
the investments that maintain current yields using
fewer resources, and apply climate-smart practices
and technologies that increase resilience while
reducing emissions. However, for this to be
successful, a second area requires financing –
building capacity through appropriate institutions
and policies, so that farmers are enabled to
undertake transformational changes. Improving
the enabling environment is especially needed for
the vast majority of smallholder farmers, who are
effectively disenfranchised from climate financing
and denied opportunities for investing in
productive activities that would improve their
livelihoods, productivity and incomes.

By filling the financing gap and catalysing
investment, climate finance can strengthen risk
management mechanisms, foster development of
appropriate financial products, and address the
capacit y constraints of lenders and borrowers. It
is crucial, therefore, to strengthen the enabling
environment for climate-smart agricultural
investments, mainstream climate change
considerations in domestic budget allocations and
implementation, and unlock private capital for
climate-smart agricultural development. Until
that happens, the climate financing needed for
investment in smallholder agriculture will
continue to be inadequate, with serious
consequences in terms of loss of livelihoods and
increased food insecurit y.

Although more climate finance is needed for the
transformation envisioned by this report,
additional funding will also require improving
countries’ capacit y to make things happen on the
ground. Systemic capacit y constraints currently
hamper developing countr y access to and
effective use of climate finance for agriculture.
This “capacit y gap” in policy-making and
institutional development, which can manifest
itself at both funding and receiving ends, hinders
support for the transition to sustainable
agriculture. Closing these capacit y gaps should
be made a priorit y by funders and countries alike,
so that climate finance – if countries ramp up
funding as planned – can ser ve its transformative
role for food and agriculture.

The time to invest in agriculture and rural
development is now. The challenge is garnering
diverse financing sources, aligning their objectives
to the extent possible, and creating the right policy
and institutional environments to bring about the
transformational change needed to eradicate
poverty, adapt to climate change and contribute to
limiting greenhouse gas emissions. n

Climate finance can also act as a catalyst to
leverage larger f lows of public and private
funding for sustainable agriculture, provided
policies and institutional frameworks that
promote transformative change are in place.

CHAPTER 1

HUNGER, POVERTY
AND CLIMATE CHANGE:
THE CHALLENGES TODAY
AND TOMORROW
Through its impacts on agriculture, climate
change will exacerbate the negative effects of all
those trends, and will make it even more
difficult to meet the key Sustainable
Development Goals of ending hunger, achieving
year-round food securit y, and ensuring
sustainable food production systems by 2030. In
the longer term, the magnitude and speed of
climate change, and the effectiveness of
economy-wide mitigation efforts and of
adaptation in agriculture, will be critical to the
future of large segments of the world’s
population and, possibly, to humanit y at large. n

Climate change poses a major and growing
threat to global food securit y. The expected
effects of climate change – higher temperatures,
more frequent extreme weather events, water
shortages, rising sea levels, ocean acidification,
land degradation, the disruption of ecosystems
and the loss of biodiversit y – could seriously
compromise agriculture’s abilit y to feed the
most v ulnerable, impeding progress towards the
eradication of hunger, malnutrition and povert y.
Action is urgently needed, therefore, to prepare
crop and livestock production, fisheries and
forestr y for the prospect of rapidly changing
environmental conditions and to reduce
agriculture’s own contribution to the
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions responsible
for global warming.

COMPLEX
INTERACTIONS AND
INEXTRICABLE LINKS

Even without climate change, world
agriculture and food securit y face daunting
challenges. Population growth and rising
incomes in much of the developing world have
pushed demand for food and other
agricultural products to unprecedented levels.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
has estimated that in order to meet the
demand for food in 2050, annual world
production of crops and livestock will need to
be 60 percent higher than it was in 2006.
About 80 percent of the required increase will
need to come from higher yields and
10 percent from increases in the number of
cropping seasons per year (Alexandratos and
Bruinsma, 2012). However, widespread land
degradation and increasing water scarcit y
limit the potential for yield increases. Without
heightened efforts to reduce povert y, and to
make the transition to an agriculture that is
both productive and sustainable, many lowincome countries will find it difficult to ensure
access to adequate quantities of food for all of
their populations.

The agriculture sectors – crops, livestock,
fisheries, aquaculture and forestr y – have unique
characteristics that place them at the centre of
global efforts to adapt to climate change. First,
agriculture is essential to our food supply and,
therefore, to meeting the most basic of human
needs. Further, food production depends directly
on natural resources – including biodiversit y,
land, vegetation, rainfall and sunlight – which
are, in turn, intimately and inextricably linked to
climate and weather conditions. Since agriculture
also provides livelihoods for almost two-thirds of
the world’s extremely poor, or some 750 million
people, climate change impacts on agriculture
directly affect already v ulnerable rural
populations, with far-reaching implications for
their food securit y.
The agriculture sectors are also a major
contributor to the greenhouse gas emissions that

climates and increased levels of atmospheric
carbon dioxide (CO 2). More extreme
temperatures, combined with decreasing rainfall,
can prevent crops from growing at all.

cause global warming and associated climate
change. The agriculture sectors are, therefore,
also unique in their potential contribution to
stabilizing the world’s climate, through better
management of crops, land and livestock, in a
way that reduces emissions and increases carbon
sequestration in plant biomass and soils.

Heat waves, which are projected to become more
common under climate change, directly threaten
livestock. Over time, heat stress increases
animals’ v ulnerabilit y to disease, thereby
reducing fertilit y and meat and milk production.
Climate change will also modif y the prevalence
of livestock parasites and diseases. In areas
where rainfall increases, moisture-reliant
pathogens are expected to thrive. Climate change
also threatens the carr ying capacit y of grasslands
and rangelands as well as feed production for
non-grazing systems.

How climate change
affects agriculture
In many regions, agricultural production is
already being adversely affected by rising
temperatures, increased temperature variabilit y,
changes in levels and frequency of precipitation,
a greater frequency of dr y spells and droughts,
the increasing intensit y of extreme weather
events, rising sea levels, and the salinization of
arable land and freshwater. As climate change
impacts on agriculture intensif y, it will become
increasingly difficult to grow crops, raise
animals, manage forests and catch fish in the
same ways and in the same places as we have
done in the past.

Fisheries and aquaculture – which provide at
least 50 percent of animal protein to millions of
people in low-income countries – are already
under multiple stresses, including overfishing,
habitat loss and water pollution (FAO, 2012).
Climate change will exacerbate those stresses.
Warmer water temperatures are likely to cause
the extinction of some fish species, a shift in
the habitat ranges of others, and increased risks
of disease throughout the production chain.
The world’s oceans are becoming more acidic
owing to increases in levels of atmospheric
CO 2 , with particularly severe consequences for
fisheries depending on shellfish and squid,
mangroves and coral reef systems. The
increased frequency and intensit y of storms,
hurricanes and cyclones will harm aquaculture,
mangroves and coastal fisheries.

The crops that we grow for food, fibre and energ y
need specific conditions in order to thrive,
including optimal temperature and sufficient
water. Up to a certain point, warmer
temperatures may benefit the growth of certain
crops in some parts of the world. However, if
temperatures exceed a crop’s optimal level, or if
sufficient water and nutrients are not available,
yields are likely to fall. An increased frequency of
extreme events, especially f loods and droughts,
also harms crops and reduces yields. Dealing
with drought could become a major challenge in
areas where average temperatures are projected
to increase and precipitation is projected to
decrease. Many weeds, insect pests and diseases

How agriculture contributes
to climate change

biodiversit y, and provide food, medicines, fuel
and critical ecosystem ser vices. Climate change
and increased climate variabilit y have both direct
and indirect effects on forests and on the people
who depend on them, and limit the capacit y of
forests to provide these crucial goods and
ser vices. While some forests will benefit from
higher concentrations of atmospheric carbon
dioxide, higher temperatures and changes in
precipitation, most will experience losses of
important species, a decline in yields and an
increase in the frequency and intensit y of storms
and other disturbances (FAO, 2013).

Agriculture is not only affected by climate
change. It also contributes directly and indirectly
to significant emissions of the three major
greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane and
nitrous oxide. Annual anthropogenic GHG
emissions that are classified in IPCC reports as
originating in “agriculture, forestr y and other
land use” (A FOLU) are caused mainly by
deforestation, livestock production and soil and
nutrient management. They have been estimated
at 21 percent of total global emissions (Fig ure 2).
While this was less than the 27 percent recorded
during the 1990s, the apparent reduction is due to
the fact that emissions have grown more rapidly
in other sectors.

While the precise impacts of climate change on
agriculture are extremely difficult to predict,
most studies indicate that they will change over
time and will differ across locations. A review of
studies conducted for the Fifth Assessment
Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) suggests that while
positive and negative projections of impacts on
crop yields counterbalance each other at global
level until about 2030, the balance after that
becomes increasingly negative (Porter et al., 2014;
see also Chapter 2).

Emissions from agriculture and those from net
forest conversion contributed broadly comparable
amounts of greenhouse gases in the 1990s;
however, since the turn of the centur y, emissions
from forest conversion have declined, while
agricultural emissions have increased. Crop and
livestock production, in particular, release
significant amounts of methane and nitrous
oxide, two potent GHGs. Methane is produced by
ruminant livestock during digestion and also
escapes from stored manure and organic waste.
Nitrous oxide emissions are an indirect product
of organic and mineral nitrogen fertilizers after
they have been applied to cropland.

Impacts will also var y strongly across crops and
regions. Fig ure 1 shows this variabilit y in cereal
yields projected for 2050 under different
pathways of global warming; it assumes a
“middle-of-the-road” pathway for economic
and population growth as well as limited
adaptation, and does not include “CO 2
fertilization”, i.e. the stimulator y effect of
increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide
on plant growth. As their growing seasons
lengthen, higher latitudes tend to see smaller
yield losses, or even yield gains, for some crops,
compared to those expected without climate
change. Yield losses in lower latitude regions
are generally greater. Maize yields would
decline in most regions under most climate
scenarios, with progressively greater losses
under more extreme scenarios. While impacts
on wheat yields are small at the global level,
they are considerable in South Asia and subSaharan Africa.

Unaccounted for in the A FOLU categor y are
greenhouse gases that are produced in the preand post-production stages of modern food
supply chains but classified in IPCC reporting as
originating in other sectors, mainly industr y,
energ y generation and transportation. They
include the production of inputs such as synthetic
fertilizers, which, unlike organic fertilizer
production, is an energ y intensive process;
emissions resulting from fossil energ y use (e.g.
for powering farm machiner y); and postproduction transportation, processing and
retailing (Smith et al., 2014). At ever y stage, food
provisioning adds to the buildup of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere. If emissions caused by »

chain were included, the A FOLU share of total
greenhouse emissions would increase by onethird (FAO, 2011).
The contribution of food systems to total GHG
emissions varies among countries and regions,
according to the structure of local supply chains.
Estimates by the Consultative Group for
International Agricultural Research (CGIA R)
indicate that in high-income countries emissions
from the pre- and post-production stages equal
those from production. In contrast, agricultural
production is still the dominant stage in terms of
GHG emissions in developing countries
( Vermeulen, Campbell and Ingram, 2012).

Changes in the utilization of food will impact the
nutrition status of the poor and v ulnerable. For
example, because higher temperatures favour the
development of pathogens, and water scarcit y
affects water qualit y and hygiene habits, climate
impacts could increase the burden of diarrhoea
by up to 10 percent by 2030 in some regions.
Again, the most severely affected would be the
poor, and especially poor children ( W HO, 2003).
Climate change will affect nutrition status in
many others ways, from reductions in caregiving
and the nutrient content of staple food crops, to
higher risk of food contamination (Box 2).

The implications for
food security
Through its impacts on agriculture, climate
change will have negative effects on food securit y
in all of its dimensions (Box 1). While food
securit y will be affected through other channels
– for example, by extreme weather events that
reduce urban dwellers’ incomes and thus access
to food – agriculture is a key channel through
which climate change affects food securit y, and is
the focus of this report.

Finally, climate variabilit y and a higher frequency
and intensit y of extreme events will affect the
stability of food availabilit y, access and utilization
through changes in seasonalit y, more pronounced
f luctuations in ecosystem productivit y, increased
supply risks and reduced supply predictabilit y.
This will be a major problem especially for
landlocked countries and small island states,
which are more v ulnerable to both food supply
disruptions and damage caused by extreme and
climate events.

Climate change affects food availability through
its increasingly adverse impacts on crop yields,
fish stocks and animal health and productivit y,
especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia,
where most of today’s food insecure live. It limits
access to food through negative impacts on rural
incomes and livelihoods. Along with a more
volatile climate, there is expected to be an
increase in the intensit y and frequency of
climate-related natural disasters. Poor people,
including many smallholder farmers and
agricultural workers, are more v ulnerable to the
impacts of such disasters. Severe droughts or
f loods can sharply reduce incomes and cause
asset losses that erode future income earning
capacit y. In addition, to the extent that food
supply is reduced by climate change, food prices
will increase. Both urban and rural poor would be

Climate change is just one of several drivers now
shaping trends in povert y and food securit y.
Those two trends, and the severit y of climate
change impacts on them, will be determined
largely by future socio-economic development. A
recent World Bank study (Hallegatte et al., 2016)
estimated that, in the absence of economic
growth, high impact climate change would
increase the projected number of extremely poor
in 2030 by 122 million people; in a scenario of
prosperit y, the increase would be just 16 million.
In a similar exercise, using the International
Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural
Commodities (IMPACT), developed by the
International Food Policy Research Institute
(IFPRI), it was estimated that by 2050 about
50 million more people could be at risk of
undernourishment because of climate change.

FOUR DIMENSIONS OF FOOD SECURITY
 Access by individuals to adequate
resources (also called entitlements)
for acquiring appropriate foods for
a nutritious diet.
 Utilization of food through adequate diet,
clean water, sanitation and health care to
reach a state of nutritional well-being
where all physiological needs are met.
 Stability in the availability of and access to
food, regardless of sudden shocks (e.g. an
economic or climatic crisis) or cyclical
events (e.g. seasonal food scarcity).

The 1996 World Food Summit agreed on
the following definition of food security,
which is used by FAO: “Food security exists
when all people, at all times, have physical
and economic access to sufficient safe and
nutritious food that meets their dietary
needs and food preferences for an active
and healthy life”. The definition
encompasses four dimensions:
 Availability of sufficient quantities of food of
appropriate quality, supplied through domestic
production or imports (including food aid).

CLIMATE CHANGE AND NUTRITION
estimated that when grown under the high levels
of CO2 expected by 2050, wheat grain had 9
percent less zinc, 5 percent less iron, and 6
percent less protein, while losses in rice were 3
percent, 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively,
compared to expected yields without climate
change. Maize would suffer similar losses of
nutrients; soybeans would not lose protein but
would contain less zinc and iron.
Food safety may be compromised by an increase
in food-borne pathogens, as well as
contamination or chemical changes that increase
the prevalence of toxic compounds in food. For
example, upsurges in algal surface blooms
contaminate drinking water and shellfish with
cyanotoxins (Paerl and Huisman, 2009), while
higher temperatures and humidity increase the
risk of mycotoxin contamination of stored cereals
and pulses (Paterson and Lim, 2010). In
addition, changes in patterns of plant and
animal diseases may lead to increased use of
potentially harmful agricultural chemicals.

Climate change affects nutrition status and
dietary choices through its impacts on food
security, diseases, water safety, sanitation,
livelihoods and caregiving. In turn, people’s
capacity to adapt to, or mitigate, climate change
is also affected (IFPRI, 2015).
Climate change amplifies the impact of droughts,
floods and storms and exposes large numbers of
people – especially the poor and most vulnerable
– to the risk of undernutrition following extreme
climate events (Confalonieri et al., 2007).
Seasonal patterns of inadequate food availability
and access, a major cause of undernutrition
among poor rural communities, are accentuated
by climate change, which has impacts also on
livelihood security and on intra-family food
distribution, affecting in turn the nutrition status
of children and women in particular (WijesinhaBettoni et al., 2013).
Some studies indicate that the nutritional quality
of key food crops could suffer under climate
change. A study by Myers et al. (2014)

during the period up to 2050 is smaller than that
of the other drivers, such as growth in population
and incomes (see Chapter 2). n

THE URGENCY OF
CONCERTED GLOBAL
ACTION NOW

Urgent action must be taken to address the
potential impacts of climate change on
agriculture and food securit y. Uncertaint y does
not justif y delays in implementing climate change
adaptation and mitigation. The urgency derives
from two main concerns. Firstly, impacts of
climate change are already evident, will become
larger over time and could become ver y large
indeed. Secondly, both drivers and responses to
climate change involve long time lags. Today’s
GHG emissions are pushing our planet towards
irreversible global warming, with impacts that
will be felt decades from now. These long-term
risks are the main reason why the international
communit y is committed to the goal of stabilizing
the Earth’s climate.

All available evidence confirms that the climate
is changing and that the changes are unlikely to
be halted or reversed in the immediate future.
There is also no doubt that climate change will
affect the agriculture sectors and food securit y
and that its negative impact will become more
severe as it accelerates. In some particularly
v ulnerable places, such as small islands or in
areas affected by large-scale extreme weather and
climate events, the impact could be catastrophic.
Much will depend on the speed of climate change
and the magnitude of its impacts. In a best-case
scenario, changes would progress at a pace and
magnitude that allow the agriculture sectors to
adapt through relatively simple means, at least in the
medium term. Declines in productivity, if any, would
be relatively minor and gradual, with no or few
instances of abrupt non-linear effects. In that case,
impacts on food security globally would be modest.

Societies at large need to take decisive action,
today, to mitigate climate change in order to avoid
the risk of serious food insecurit y. The
possibilit y that climate change may make it
impossible to feed humanit y at some unknown,
more or less distant, point in the future cannot
be discarded. Even with a shorter time horizon,
food securit y impacts in some locations may be
severe. Agriculture and forestr y have a large
potential to reduce GHG emissions, but future
food securit y will depend to a large extent on
emission reductions achieved in other economic
sectors. Changes will also be needed on the
consumption side – reducing demand for
emission- and resource-intensive food products
will help to accelerate the transition towards
sustainable agriculture, as well as promoting
climate change mitigation.

A quite different, but plausible, scenario would
see – even in the medium term – widespread
instances of abrupt non-linear changes, making
adequate adaptation by the agriculture sectors
almost impossible in many locations, and
causing drastic declines in productivit y. The
impacts on productivit y would be, if not global,
at least extremely widespread both
geographically and in terms of the size of
affected populations. The impacts on food
securit y would be ver y significant. Supply
shortfalls would lead to major increases in food
prices, while increased climate variabilit y would
result in increased food price volatilit y. Climate
variabilit y would also affect the stabilit y of rural
household incomes in areas already subject to

At the same time, the agriculture sectors and the
populations who depend on them need to adapt to
current or expected climate changes, in a way that
minimizes their harmful effects or takes
advantage of the opportunities they may create.

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2016

Under 2 °C warming, the risks posed by extreme
heat to crop yields in tropical regions of Africa
and South and Southeast Asia become
particularly critical, given projected trends in
their population growth. Other important
benefits of limiting temperature increases to
1.5 °C include a significant reduction in areas of
coral reefs at risk of severe degradation, and a
30 percent reduction in sea level rise
(Schleussner et al., 2016). In fact, a key message
of the UNFCCC’s structured expert dialog ue,
concluded in 2015, was that an increase in the
global temperature1 of 2 °C above pre-industrial
levels is “an upper limit, a defence line that
needs to be stringently defended, while less
warming would be preferable” (UNFCCC, 2015).
The IPCC will present in 2017 the findings of an
assessment of the differences between 2 °C and
1.5 °C scenarios.

Resilience to climate change needs to be
strengthened across biophysical, economic and
social spheres, worldwide. To some degree,
adaptation in agriculture will be a spontaneous
response by farmers, fisherfolk and foresters;
however, many of them, and especially smallscale producers, may face both a lack of feasible
options and constraints to adopting appropriate
solutions. An enabling environment that
facilitates adaptation, therefore, is critical.
In the short term, adaptation at the level of the
production unit or farm household, where
possible, may be sufficient. However, longer-term
adaptation is necessar y in order to cope with the
changes already “locked in” by past and ongoing
increases in the concentration of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere. That will require more
systemic changes, such as major shifts in the loci
of production of specific products and species,
compensated by changes in both trading and
consumption patterns.

The UNFCCC’s Paris Agreement of December
2015 has set the long-term goal of holding the
increase in global average temperature to
“well below 2 °C” above pre-industrial levels
and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature
increase to 1.5 °C, recognizing that this
would significantly reduce the risks and
impacts of climate change. The IPCC reports
that scenarios consistent with keeping
temperature increase below 2 °C include
substantial cuts in anthropogenic GHG
emissions by mid-centur y, through largescale changes in energ y systems and,
potentially, in land use. Scenarios that do not
exceed the 2 °C limit set global GHG
emission levels in 2050 at 40 to 70 percent
lower than those in 2010, and near zero or
below in 2100 (IPCC, 2014). If the growth in
agriculture that is needed to ensure world
food securit y in the future is attained with
emissions growth similar to that of the recent
past, the goal of keeping global temperature
increase under 2 °C will be ver y difficult to
achieve (see also, Searchinger et al., 2015;
Wollenberg et al., 2016).

However, adaptation by itself is insufficient –
mitigation is essential for ensuring the long-term
food securit y of the world’s population. There is a
fundamental difference between adaptation and
mitigation and the incentives needed to promote
them. Adaptation is something ever yone will
want to do in their own interest. Mitigation is
something that has to be done together, in the
interests of ever yone. It is a global public good
and a social responsibilit y to which the
agriculture sectors must also contribute.
The urgency – and benefits – of a concerted and
effective global response to climate change is
underscored by the very significant differences in
impacts between even small temperature increases.
A recent meta-analysis has found that reductions in
water availability and increases in the length of dry
spells accelerate between 1.5 °C and 2 °C for several
sub-tropical regions, particularly the Mediterranean,
Central America, the Caribbean, South Africa and
Australia. In tropical regions, agricultural production
is projected to be strongly affected if temperature
increases beyond 1.5 °C (Table 1), and even more so
if other factors – such as nitrogen and phosphorus
limitations or heat stress – constrain the positive
effects of CO2 fertilization.

1 Note: “Global temperature” is an average for the whole planet for a
whole year. The Arctic region will warm more rapidly than the global
mean, and mean warming over land will be larger than over the ocean.
There will be more frequent episodes of high temperature extremes over
most land areas (IPCC, 2014).

AGRICULTURE IS PROMINENT IN GUIDES TO
COUNTRY-LEVEL ACTION
The analysis also shows that the agriculture
sectors are expected to provide the greatest
number of opportunities for adaptationmitigation synergies, as well as socioeconomic and environmental co-benefits.
Around one third of all countries acknowledge
(and in some cases prioritize) actions that
would create synergies between mitigation
and adaptation in agriculture. Almost 30
percent of countries mention social, economic
and environmental co-benefits, particularly
rural development and health, poverty
reduction and job creation, and the
conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity.
With regard to gender equality, agriculture is
highlighted as a sector which – more than any
other – provides diverse opportunities for
empowering women as well as reducing their
vulnerability to climate change.

Adaptation and mitigation objectives in
agriculture, land use, land-use change and
forestry figure prominently in the Intended
Nationally Determined Contributions
(INDCs) which, under the Paris Agreement
of December 2015, will guide country-level
action on climate change in the coming
years. They include not only targets, but
also concrete strategies for addressing the
causes of climate change and responding to
its consequences.
An FAO analysis of the INDCs shows that,
in all regions, agriculture will play a
pivotal role in accomplishing the goals
related to climate change by 2030. Of the
188 countries that submitted INDCs, more
than 90 percent included agriculture as a
sector considered for mitigation and
adaptation initiatives.

» Decisions taken today will determine the kind

The v ulnerabilit y of agriculture to climate change
has not always received the attention it deser ves.
Assessments of climate change impacts, using
mainly global economic models, have tended to
overlook the impacts on agriculture because of its
declining contribution, globally, to gross
domestic product (GDP). Today, the importance
of an agriculture response to climate change is
widely recognized. This awareness is ref lected
clearly in the Intended Nationally Determined
Contributions (INDCs) submitted by countries in
the lead-up to the 21st Conference of Parties to
the UNFCCC in Paris in 2015 (Box 3). The INDCs
are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.

of world we will live in 15 years from now, and
beyond. The agriculture sectors must respond,
therefore, by building resilience to the impacts
of climate change, while contributing to the
extent possible to mitigation efforts. Responses
must be designed in line with the national
development objectives and priorities of
different countries, and must not in themselves
jeopardize efforts to reduce food insecurit y. In
this context, it is important to note that, unlike
other economic sectors where adaptation and
mitigation actions are generally independent of
each other, in the agriculture sectors there are
synergies – but also a need to accept trade-offs
– among the objectives of food securit y,
adaptation and mitigation. n

There is also increasing recognition that
agriculture has a special role to play in climate
change mitigation. Scenarios indicate that
limiting the global temperature increase to 2 °C
can only be achieved by reducing GHG emissions
from energ y, industr y and transport to zero, and
limiting emissions from agriculture, land use and
land-use change. The agriculture sectors can
contribute to mitigation, first, by reducing their
emission intensit y (or the quantit y of emissions
per unit of product), and avoiding the further loss
of carbon stored principally in forests and soil.
This effort can be complemented by actions
aimed at reducing food losses and waste, and
changing food consumption patterns. In addition,
the agriculture sectors have a unique potential to
act as carbon sinks, which capture carbon dioxide
and sequester carbon in biomass and soils,
through forestr y and land restoration (see
Chapter 4).

THE SPECIAL ROLE
AND RESPONSIBILITY
OF AGRICULTURE
An agricultural response to
climate change
Implementing an effective, sustained
response to climate change in ag riculture –
in terms of both adaptation and mitigation –
w ill be far more difficult than in most, if not
all, other sectors, ow to its dependence on
biophysical processes and the enormous
range of ag ro-ecolog ical and socio-economic
conditions. A f urther complicating factor is
the large number of actors involved –
hundreds of millions of farmers, fisherfolk
and forest-dependent populations, many of
whom are poorly linked to markets,
information and public ser v ices. This
diversit y calls for different and often
extremely context-specific solutions. The
ag riculture sectors are likely, therefore, to be
slower than others in adjusting, and a
sig nificant deg ree of inertia in the system is
to be expected. This only adds to the urgenc y
of taking action now.

A key challenge in framing climate change
responses is to ensure that they do not jeopardize
food securit y or progress in povert y reduction,
particularly in countries with persistent, high
levels of hunger and povert y. This is recognized
in the preamble to the UNFCCC, which affirms
that “responses to climate change should be
coordinated with social and economic
development in an integrated manner with a view
to avoiding adverse impacts on the latter, taking
into full account the legitimate priorit y needs of
developing countries for the achievement of
sustained economic growth and the eradication
of povert y” (UNFCCC, 1992). Similarly, the
| 13 |

CHAPTER 1 HUNGER, POVERTY AND CLIMATE CHANGE: THE CHALLENGES TODAY AND TOMORROW

intensification strategies on food securit y,
adaptation and mitigation in specific locations.
This is particularly important in developing
countries, where agricultural growth is generally
a top priorit y. Often, but not always, practices
with strong adaptation and food securit y benefits
can also lead to reduced GHG emissions or
increased carbon sequestration. However,
implementation of these synergistic practices may
entail higher costs, particularly for up-front
financing. Therefore, CSA programmes include
capacit y development for local stakeholders to
assist them in tapping into sources of funding for
agricultural and climate-related investment. Not
ever y practice applied in ever y location will, can
or even should generate “triple wins”; but all
three objectives must be considered in order to
arrive at locally acceptable solutions that ref lect
local or national priorities.

preamble to the Paris Agreement, concluded in
December 2015, recognizes “the fundamental
priorit y of safeg uarding food securit y and ending
hunger, and particular v ulnerabilities of food
production systems to the adverse impacts of
climate change” (UNFCCC, 2015).

Climate-smart agriculture
The responses to climate change that are to be applied
in different countries must be seen in the broader
context of sustainable agricultural development, and
will reflect countries’ individual priorities for
achieving it. The FAO approach to sustainable food
and agriculture recognizes that countries will pursue
multiple objectives across the economic, social and
environmental dimensions of sustainability, and will
need to balance trade-offs between objectives and
between short-term and long-term needs (Box 4).
Such trade-offs will differ among countries,
depending on natural resource endowments, socioeconomic characteristics, political systems and stages
of development. Similarly, countries will have
different priorities, according to their specific
circumstances, which need to be taken into account
when designing climate change responses.

The point of departure for the CSA analysis is
the technologies and practices that countries
have already prioritized in their agricultural
policy and planning. Information on recent and
near-term projected climate change trends is
used to assess the food securit y and adaptation
potential of these technologies and practices
under site-specific climate change conditions,
and to determine what adjustments may be
needed. Examples of such adjustments include:
modif ying planting times and adopting varieties
resistant to heat and drought; developing new
cultivars; changing the farm portfolio of crops
and livestock; improving soil and water
management practices, including conser vation
agriculture; integrating the use of climate
forecasts into cropping decisions; expanding the
use of irrigation; increasing regional farm
diversit y; and shifting to non-farm livelihood
sources (Asfaw et al., 2014; Branca et al., 2011;
FAO, 2010; FAO, 2013).

More specifically for managing agriculture for
food securit y under the changing realities of
global warming, FAO has developed the
“climate-smart agriculture” (CSA) approach,
which it presented in 2010 at The Hag ue
Conference on Agriculture, Food Securit y and
Climate Change (FAO, 2010). The principles of
CSA implicitly underpin and g uide this report as
well as the responses to climate change
envisaged for the food and agriculture sectors.
The CSA approach has three objectives:
sustainably increasing agricultural productivit y
to support equitable increases in incomes, food
securit y and development; increasing adaptive
capacit y and resilience to shocks at multiple
levels, from farm to national; and reducing
greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon
sequestration where possible.

Since the introduction of climate-smart
agriculture, there has been growing support at
international and national levels for adoption of
the approach. In their INDCs, more than 30
countries, most prominently in sub-Saharan
Africa, specifically refer to CSA (see Chapter 5). n

Since local conditions var y, an essential feature
of CSA is to identif y the impacts of agricultural

STRUCTURE OF THIS REPORT
This year’s edition of The State of Food and Agriculture explores in-depth the relationships between
climate change, agriculture and food security and describes how the agriculture sectors can respond
effectively to climate change through both adaptation and mitigation. The whole food supply chain, from
producer to consumer, is affected by – and contributes to – climate change, sometimes to a larger extent
than primary agriculture itself. However, the main focus of this report will be on the primary agriculture
sectors: crops, livestock, fisheries and forestry. The remainder of this report is organized as follows:
CHAPTER 2 reviews the empirical
evidence of the current and expected
future impacts of climate change on the
agriculture sectors, food securit y and
nutrition in different parts of the world
under different global warming scenarios.
It further assesses how and to what extent
current agricultural production and
food systems are contributing to
climate change.

CHAPTER 4 discusses how the agriculture sectors
can respond to climate change to the benefit of
both food securit y and climate stabilization. Key
responses aim at reducing emission-intensit y in
agriculture and food systems, and maximizing
co-benefits from adaptation and mitigation
efforts, through better management of carbon
and nitrogen cycles, increased resource-use
efficiency, the conser vation of carbon-rich
landscapes, measures to strengthen resilience
and – on the demand side – a reduction in food
losses and improvements in diets.

CHAPTER 3 looks at the special challenge
of adaptation to climate change in smallscale family farming and small-scale
production systems. It suggests feasible
pathways for farm households and others
dependent on such systems to build
greater resilience through adaptation and
diversification strategies that also
improve their livelihoods and, therefore,
contribute to ending hunger and
rural povert y.

CHAPTER 5 discusses the design of policies to
ensure an effective climate change response by
governments and agricultural sector
stakeholders.
CHAPTER 6 presents ways of leveraging
climate finance – and, more broadly,
development finance – to support adaptation
and mitigation objectives in agriculture.

UNTIL ABOUT 2030, GLOBAL WARMING IS EXPECTED TO LEAD
TO BOTH GAINS AND LOSSES in the productivity of crops,
livestock, fisheries and forestry, depending on places and
conditions.

BEYOND 2030, THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
ON AGRICULTURAL YIELDS will become increasingly severe in
all regions.

IN TROPICAL DEVELOPING REGIONS, adverse impacts are
already affecting the livelihoods and food security of
vulnerable households and communities.

BECAUSE AGRICULTURE, LAND-USE AND FORESTRY make a

CHAPTER 2

CLIMATE, AGRICULTURE
AND FOOD SECURITY:
A CLOSER LOOK
AT THE CONNECTIONS
This chapter examines in detail the linkages
between climate change, agriculture and food
securit y. It discusses the biophysical impacts of
climate change on the agriculture sectors and
how they translate into socio-economic
impacts with consequences for food securit y
and nutrition. It also reviews how greenhouse
gas emissions and removals from the
agriculture sectors contribute to climate
change. The implication is that the agriculture
sectors need to both adapt to climate change
by building resilience and contribute to climate
change mitigation. n

Climate change profoundly affects the
conditions under which agricultural activities
are conducted. In ever y region of the world,
plants, animals and ecosystems have adapted to
prevailing climatic conditions. As those
conditions change, they will be affected in ways
that are difficult to predict precisely. Several
studies document the biophysical impacts of the
expected changes specifically on
agroecosystems (Box 5). The impacts range from
yield reductions and increased yield variabilit y
to displacement of crops and the loss of
agrobiodiversit y and ecosystem ser vices. Most,
but not all, of the impacts of climate change on
agriculture are expected to be negative. All the
agriculture sectors – crops, livestock, fisheries
and forestr y – will be affected in different ways.

CASCADING
IMPACTS FROM
CLIMATE TO PEOPLE

Climate change already affects the agriculture
sectors in many parts of the world, and its
impacts will be amplified in the years and
decades ahead. A large body of evidence points
to a prevalence of negative outcomes, with many
agricultural systems becoming less productive
and some plant and animal species
disappearing. Those changes will have direct
effects on agricultural production, which will
have economic and social consequences and
finally impacts on food securit y (Fig ure 3). The
impacts will be transmitted through different
channels and will affect food securit y in all four
of its dimensions: access, availabilit y, utilization
and stabilit y. At each stage of the transmission
chain, the severit y of impact will be determined
by both the shock itself and by the v ulnerabilit y
of the system or population group under stress
(FAO, 2016a). n

The IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report confirms
the main findings of its previous reports on the
evolution of the world’s climate, the expected
changes – such as increases in temperature,
rainfall variabilit y and extreme weather events –
and the main biophysical impacts of global
warming, such as sea-level rise, ocean
acidification, reductions in the extent of
glaciers, the degradation of ecosystems,
increased risks of fires and insect pest upsurges.
As well as providing a better understanding of
potential changes in precipitation, the report
uses improvements in modelling and data
collection to make better medium-term
projections. Accordingly, the cascading impacts
of climate change can now be attributed along
chains of evidence from physical climate
through to intermediate systems and then to
people (Kirtman et al., 2014).

IMPACTS ON
AGRICULTURE

Widely cited estimates show that over the period
1980 to 2008 there was a 5.5 percent drop in
wheat yields and a 3.8 percent drop in maize
yields globally, compared to what they would
have been had climate remained stable (Lobell,
Schlenker and Costa-Roberts, 2011).

Climate change affects the agriculture sectors in a
multitude of ways, which vary from region to
region (Table 2). For example, it increases
temperature and precipitation variability, reduces
the predictability of seasonal weather patterns and
increases the frequency and intensity of severe
weather-related events such as floods, cyclones
and hurricanes. Some regions are expected to face
prolonged drought and water shortages. The
widespread melting of glaciers and snow cover in
major mountain ranges, particularly in Asia, will
affect the volume and timing of water flows,
ultimately reducing the availability of irrigation
water downstream. Increasing temperatures lead
to changes in the location and incidence of pest
and disease outbreaks. Even slight warming will
decrease yields in low-latitude regions. Greater
frequency and intensity of extreme weather
events, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation,
will increasingly affect climate patterns and food
production (Box 6).

The precise future effects of climate change on
crop yields are ver y difficult to predict and will
depend on many parameters. These include:
physical ones, such as temperature, precipitation
patterns and CO 2 fertilization; changes in
agroecosystems (e.g. through loss of pollinators
and increased incidence of pest and diseases);
and the adaptive responses of human systems.
Effects of temperature changes are generally well
understood up to the optimum temperature for
crop development; however, beyond these
optimum temperatures, effects are much less
known. Recent results have confirmed the
damaging effects of elevated tropospheric ozone
on yields, with estimates of losses for soybean,
wheat and maize in 2000 ranging from 8.5 to 14
percent, 3.9 to 15 percent, and 2.2 to 5.5 percent
respectively (Porter et al., 2014). Several other
possible impacts of climate change on the
functioning of ecosystems – such as the balance
between crops and pests, and effects on
pollinators – are difficult to assess and are
generally not taken into account by the models
used to make projections of crop yields.

Crops
Climate change impacts on the yields of major
crops is probably the food security related issue on
which there are the most studies. A wide literature
on observed and projected impacts on yields
includes more than two decades of work since the
global assessment by Rosenzweig and Parry (1994)
of the potential impact of climate change on world
food supply; some other key studies are Parry,
Rosenzweig and Livermore (2005), Cline (2007),
World Bank (2010), and Rosenzweig et al. (2014).
Most studies are limited to major crops, and the
effects of climate change on many other important
crops are much less known.

Within certain limits, a changing climate could
have both positive and negative effects on crops.
Indeed, increases in temperatures and levels of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may be
beneficial for some crops in some places. Yields of
wheat and soybeans, for example, could increase
with increased CO 2 concentrations under optimal
temperatures. However, while projections of
future yields var y according to the scenario,
model and time-scale used, there is consistency
in the main expected directions of change: yields
suffer more in tropical regions than at higher
latitudes and impacts are more severe with
increased warming (Porter et al., 2014).

The obser ved effects of past climate trends on
crop production are evident in several regions of
the world (Porter et al., 2014), with negative
impacts being more common than positive ones.
There is evidence that climate change has already
negatively affected wheat and maize yields.

Importantly, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report
provides new evidence that crop yields are
expected to decline in areas that already suffer
| 22 |

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2016

food insecurit y. It presents projected estimates of
changes in crop yields owing to climate change
over the 21st centur y (Fig ure 4). The data used
include results from 91 studies with 1 722
estimates of changes in crop yields by Challinor
et al., 2014. There are wide variations among the
studies, in terms of time-frame, crop coverage,
crop and climate models, and emission levels.
Some studies include the effects of adaptation
measures, but others do not. The scales and
geographical coverage also var y, with some
estimates being for localities while others are
national, regional or global.

Other estimates of the impact of climate change
on crop yields are provided by the recent
consolidated study conducted in the framework
of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and
Improvement Project (AgMIP) and the InterSectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project.
Both point to dramatic long-term impacts,
compared to a world without climate change and
in the absence of climate change mitigation. 3 The
impact on yields by the year 2100 under highemission climate scenarios ranges between -20
and -45 percent for maize, between -5 and
-50 percent for wheat, between -20 and
-30 percent for rice, and between -30 and
-60 percent for soybean (Rosenzweig et al., 2013).
Assuming the full effectiveness of CO 2
fertilization, climate change impacts on yields
are reduced to a range of between -10 and
-35 percent for maize, between +5 and
-15 percent for wheat, between -5 and -20 percent
for rice, and between 0 and -30 percent for
soybean. If limits on access to nitrogen are
explicitly considered, crops benefit less from CO 2
fertilization and negative climate impacts are
amplified (Müller and Elliott, 2015).

In spite of the heterogeneit y of the studies, their
long-term projections clearly point to a
prevalence of negative outcomes. They show that
in the medium term – that is, until about 2030 –
the positive and negative effects on yields could
offset each other at the global level, the balance
after this date would be increasingly negative as
climate change accelerates. The data also show
that projected impacts of climate change on
yields of maize, wheat and rice in the second half
of the 21st centur y are more often negative for
tropical regions than for temperate regions.
However, in many locations in temperate regions,
as well, crop yields may decrease (Porter et al.,
2014 and Challinor et al., 2014).

Livestock
Climate change affects livestock production in
multiple ways, both directly and indirectly
(Table 2). The most important impacts are on
animal productivit y, animal health and
biodiversit y, the qualit y and amount of feed
supply, and the carr ying capacit y of pastures.
Increasing variabilit y in rainfall leads to
shortages of drinking water, an increased
incidence of livestock pests and diseases, and
changes in their distribution and transmission.
It also affects the species composition of
pastures, pasture yields and forage qualit y.

Further analysis of the same data, undertaken by
FAO for this report, reveals quite distinct
patterns for developing and developed countries.
For the developing countries, most estimates for
crop yield impacts are negative, with the share of
negative estimates increasing the further into the
future the study projects (Fig ure 5). Compared
with developing countries, estimates for
developed countries show a much larger share of
potential positive changes (Fig ure 6). 2
2 In the datasets analysed, more estimates are available for developing
countries than developed countries. Among the developing regions, the largest
number of estimates is for locations in sub-Saharan Africa, followed by East
Asia and the Pacific, and South Asia. A smaller share of estimates is provided
for locations in Latin America and the Caribbean, North Africa and West Asia.
In terms of crops, most estimates are for maize or wheat yields, followed by
rice and soybean. For most country groups, the number of projections for
2090–2109 is very limited: only five for the developed countries and 16 for
developing countries; all of the 16 projections for developing countries refer to
sub-Saharan Africa, and all suggest declines in crop yields of more than 10
percent. However, they are derived from only two studies.

3 The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project is a
framework linking climate, crops, livestock and economics. It provides
analyses at field-to-regional scales and includes simulations with guided
climate sensitivity tests and climate change scenarios. Protocols of AgMIP
have helped to narrow the uncertainty and understand the reasons for
differences in modelling outcomes and projections of climate change
impacts on food security.

THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME CLIMATE EVENTS
the food security and nutrition of 60 million people
(FAO, 2016b).
Extreme weather events are of major significance to
agriculture. An FAO study estimated that, between
2003 and 2013, some 25 percent of the total
economic impact of climate-related disasters in
developing countries was felt in agriculture; when only
drought is considered, the share rises to 84 percent
(FAO, 2015). The types of hazard vary widely by
region (see Figure).

The El Niño-Southern Oscillation is an increase in
surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean,
which occurs roughly every two to seven years and
lasts from six to 24 months. Its effects can include huge
increases in rainfall, tropical cyclones, drought, forest
fires, floods and other extreme weather events
worldwide. The current El Niño has been one of the
most intense and widespread of the past 100 years. It
has harmed crop and livestock production, and
agricultural livelihoods around the globe, threatening

Higher temperatures cause heat stress in animals,
which has a range of negative impacts: reduced
feed intake and productivit y, lower rates of
reproduction and higher mortalit y rates. Heat
stress also lowers animals’ resistance to
pathogens, parasites and vectors (Thornton et al.,
2009; Niang et al., 2014). Multiple stressors
greatly affect animal production, reproduction
and immune status. Research in India found that
a combination of climate-related stresses on
sheep – for example, excessive heat and lower
nutritional intake – had severe impacts on the
animals’ biological coping mechanisms (Sejian et
al., 2012).

tropical, less developed and economically poor
regions are particularly v ulnerable to climate
change impacts (Porter et al., 2014). Fisheries and
aquaculture systems are likely to suffer from
higher impacts such as water temperatures,
ox ygen deficit, sea-level rise, decreased pH and
changes in productivit y patterns.
Various fish species are already migrating
towards the poles. Models based on predicted
changes in environmental conditions, habitat
t y pes and phytoplankton primar y production
forecast a large-scale redistribution of global
marine fish catch potential, with an average 30 to
70 percent increase in high-latitude regions and a
drop of up to 40 percent in the tropics (Cheung et
al., 2010).The production from inland fisheries
and aquaculture is threatened by changes in
precipitation and water management, increased
stress on freshwater resources, and the frequency
and intensit y of extreme climate events (Brander,
2007; Porter et al., 2014).

The effects of higher temperatures may be
reduced in intensive cattle, pig and poultr y
production units, through climate control
(Thornton et al., 2009), provided appropriate
housing and energ y are available. However,
projected drier conditions in the extensive
rangelands of southern Africa would increase
water scarcit y; in Botswana, the costs of pumping
water from boreholes increases 23 percent by
2050. In the Near East, declining forage qualit y,
soil erosion and water scarcit y will most likely be
exacerbated in the semi-arid rangelands (Turral,
Burke and Faurès, 2011).
Impacts of climate change on animal health are
also documented, especially for vector-borne
diseases, with rising temperatures favouring the
winter sur vival of vectors and pathogens. In
Europe, global warming is likely to increase
sheep tick activit y, and the risk of tick-borne
diseases, in the autumn and winter months (Gray
et al., 2009). Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in East
Africa are associated with increased rainfall and
f looding due to El Niño-Southern Oscillation
events (Lancelot, de La Rocque and Chevalier,
2008; Rosenthal, 2009; Porter et al., 2014).

Coral reef systems, which sustain one out of
four marine species, will be at increased risk
owing to the dual pressure of rising
temperatures and ocean acidification. Sea
surface temperature f luctuations caused mass
coral bleaching and mortalit y around Kiribati’s
Phoenix Islands in 2002–2003, leading to a
decline in coral cover of about 60 percent
(Alling et al., 2007; Obura and Mang ubhai,
2011). In October 2015, the United States
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration declared the third global coral
reef bleaching event; the previous two took
place in 1998 and 2010. These global shocks,
brought on by climate change, and coupled with
events such as the El Niño phenomenon are the
largest and most per vasive threats to coral reefs
around the world (NOA A, 2015).

Climate change, climate variabilit y and extreme

IMPACTS ON INCOMES
AND LIVELIHOODS

erosion and land degradation, provision or
enhancement of the habitats of aquatic and
terrestrial animals, provision of a range of wood
and non-wood products for household use or sale,
and the generation of employment.

The effect of climate change on the production
and productivit y of the agriculture sectors will
translate into mostly negative economic and
social impacts, with implications for all four
dimensions of food securit y. Climate change can
reduce incomes at both the household and
national levels. Given the high dependency on
agriculture of hundreds of millions of poor and
food-insecure rural people, the potential impacts
on agricultural incomes – with economy-wide
ramifications in low-income countries that are
highly dependent on agriculture – are a major
concern. By exacerbating povert y, climate change
would have severe negative repercussions on
food securit y.

Recent studies suggest that, in a wide range
of forest systems, higher temperatures and
changes in precipitation are increasing tree
mortalit y through heat stress, drought stress
and pest outbreaks (Allen et al., 2010). Many
areas of boreal forests have experienced
biomass productivit y declines that have been
attributed to warming-induced drought
( Williams et al., 2013). Warming and dr ying,
coupled with productivit y decline, insect
disturbance and associated tree mortalit y,
also favour greater fire disturbance (Settele et
al., 2014).
The overall trend for temperate forests has until
recently been an increase in growth rates, due to
a combination of increases in the length of the
growing season, higher atmospheric CO 2 and
nitrogen deposition, and forest management
(Ciais et al., 2008). Models predict that the
potential climatic space for most tree species will
shift towards higher latitudes and altitudes, at a
faster rate than natural migration.

Much uncertaint y surrounds the future
evolution of climate change, its precise impacts
and the possible responses. The implications for
the environment and societ y depend not only
on the response of the Earth system to changes
in atmospheric composition, but also on the
forces driving those changes and on human
responses, such as changes in technolog y,
economies and lifest yle.

For tropical forests, a key uncertaint y is the
impact of direct CO 2 effects on
photosynthesis and transpiration. Moist
tropical forests have many species that are
v ulnerable to drought- and fire-induced
mortalit y. In addition, there is evidence that
in many forests, including those of the
Amazon, forest fire frequency and severit y
are increasing, due to a combination of land
use change and drought. Climate change,
deforestation, fragmentation, fire and human
pressure place virtually all dr y tropical forests
at risk of replacement or degradation (Miles et
al., 2006). In Southeast Asia, increased interannual variabilit y in forest fires owing to El
Niño-induced droughts increases health risks,
and the loss of biodiversit y and ecosystem
ser vices (Marlier et al., 2013). n

Assessing climate change impacts on agriculture
requires integrated use of climate, crop, and
economic models to take into account the
reaction to changing conditions in the sector,
including management decisions, land-use
choices, international trade and prices, as well as
consumers. For this reason, the climate research
communit y has developed over the past two
decades sets of scenarios that describe plausible
future trajectories and represent many of the
major driving forces that are important for
informing climate change policy.
A variet y of those scenarios have been used to
analyse the impacts of climate change on
agroecosystems, the agriculture sectors, socioeconomic trends and ultimately food securit y. In
order to ensure a better and more consistent
analysis of future climate and its impacts, the
| 29 |

CHAPTER 2 CLIMATE, AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY: A CLOSER LOOK AT THE CONNECTIONS

IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report adopted a set of
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs),
which are hypothetical climate scenarios based
on the magnitude of global annual greenhouse
gas emissions. The IPCC also helped catalyse the
development of Shared Socio-economic Pathways
(SSPs), which describe alternative development
futures, to be used alongside the RCPs to analyse
feedback between climate change and socioeconomic factors (Box 7).

change, was confirmed in a World Bank study,
which compared worst-case and more optimistic
scenarios with a scenario of no climate change
(Hallegatte et al., 2015). A scenario with highimpact climate change, rapid population growth
and a stagnant economy indicated that an
additional 122 million people would be living in
extreme povert y by 2030 (Table 3). With the
same level of climate change impacts, but with
universal access to basic ser vices, reduced
inequalit y and extreme povert y affecting less
than 3 percent of the world’s population, the
number of additional poor is projected to be just
16 million (Rozenberg and Hallegatte, 2015).
Under the worst-case scenario, much of the
forecast increase in the number of poor occurs in
Africa (43 million) and South Asia (62 million).
Reduced income in the agricultural sector
explains the largest share of increased povert y as
a result of climate change. This is because the
most severe reductions in food production and
increases in food prices occur in Africa and
India, which account for a large share of the
world’s poor. The second most important factor
leading to increased povert y is health impacts,
followed by the impacts of higher temperatures
on labour productivit y.

Nelson et al. (2014a) have designed a common
protocol to compare results of a set of nine
climate, crop, and economic models under the
scenario RCP 8.5 (global annual GHG emissions
continuing to rise throughout the 21st centur y),
without accounting for CO 2 fertilization of crops.
The authors compare the effects of the exogenous
climate change shock on yields of four crop
aggregates – coarse grains, oil seeds, wheat and
rice – which account for about 70 percent of the
global crop har vested area. The mean biophysical
effect of the climate change shock on yields is a
17 percent decline. The economic models transfer
the shock effect to the response variables.
Producers respond to the price increases
associated with the shock by both intensif ying
management practices, which leads to a final
mean yield change of -11 percent, and increasing
the cropping area by a mean of 11 percent.

Recent FAO studies of adaptation to climate
changes in smallholder agriculture systems in
sub-Saharan Africa show how dr y spells, the late
onset of rains and high temperatures affect
incomes at the farm level. 4 In all cases, climate
shocks reduced productivit y or har vest value
significantly and, in turn, reduced access to food.
The shocks impinge on physical capital, when
assets are destroyed – for example, through the
death of livestock – or when farmers are forced to
sell productive capital, such as cattle, to absorb
the income shock. They also reduce farmers’
capacit y to invest, with negative consequences for
future food securit y.

The combined yield decline and area increase
result in a mean decline in production of only
2 percent. Consumption declines slightly, with a
mean decline of 3 percent. Changes in trade
shares cancel out across regions, but the share of
global trade in world production increases by
1 percent on average. Average producer prices
increase by 20 percent. The direction of responses
is common to all models, but the magnitude of
responses varies significantly across models,
crops and regions. Although the average
consumption decline is relatively small, the price
increases caused by the inelastic nature of global
demand are likely to increase food costs
significantly for the poor.

PROJECTING CLIMATE CHANGE:
RCPS AND SSPS
SSP3: Regional rivalry. Rapid population growth,
moderate economic growth and slow technological
change in the energy sector. High inequality leads to
reduced trade flows, leaving many parts of the world
vulnerable, and with low adaptive capacity.
SSP4: Inequality. Rapid development of low carbon
energy technologies in key GHG emitting regions
leads to relatively large mitigative capacity, but in
other regions development is slow, inequality high,
and adaptive capacity limited.
SSP5: Fossil-fuelled development. High GDP
growth using conventional energy technologies,
associated with continuing high emissions. But because
growth is relatively equitable, the world is better able
to adapt to climate impacts.

Representative Concentration Pathways are four
hypothetical greenhouse gas concentration trajectories
during the 21st century (Moss et al., 2008) adopted
by the IPCC for its Fifth Assessment Report. The RCPs
represent a wide range of possible changes in future
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions*:
RCP 2.6 – emissions peak between 2010 and 2020
and decline substantially thereafter.
RCP 4.5 – emissions peak around 2040 and
then decline.
RCP 6.0 – emissions peak around 2080 and
then decline.
RCP 8.5 – emissions continue to rise throughout the
21st century.
The RCP 2.6 pathway is consistent with the aim of
keeping global warming at less than 2 °C above preindustrial levels. Scenarios in which no additional
efforts are made to mitigate emissions lead to
pathways between RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5.

FIVE SHARED SOCIO-ECONOMIC PATHWAYS

Shared socio-economic pathways describe plausible
alternative trends in the evolution of society and
ecosystems over the 21st century. The SSPs are being
used alongside the RCPs to analyse feedback between
climate change and factors such as world population
growth, economic development and technological
progress. They are based on storylines for possible
futures which present different challenges to
adaptation and mitigation (O’Neill et al., 2014; Van
der Mensbrugghe, 2015):

America. While there is a wide degree of
variation among models and scenarios, projected
impacts are generally found to be negative across
a wide range of locations. Table 4 shows selected
results from countries in South America as well
as for the region as a whole.

Increased trade is expected to play an important
role in adjusting to the shifts in agricultural and
food production patterns resulting from climate
change (Nelson et al., 2010; Chomo and De
Young, 2015).The adaptive role of trade is
addressed in a study by Valenzuela and Anderson
(2011), which finds that climate change could
cause a substantial decline in the food selfsufficiency ratio of developing countries of about
12 percent by 2050. While trade can help in
adaptation to climate change and to shifting
international patterns of production, ultimately
global markets will only be accessible to those
countries and segments of population that have
sufficient purchasing power. This makes inclusive
economic growth an essential precondition for
stable food securit y.

At the national level, reduced production due to
climate change can trigger an increase in the
prices of food and feed, negatively affecting the
socio-economic status of the whole population
and its food securit y. Such impacts are
particularly critical in countries where an
important part of the household budget is spent
on food. They can be accompanied by major
macro-economic effects where agriculture makes
an important contribution to national GDP and/
or employment.
Lam et al. (2012) modelled the economic and
social implications of climate-change induced
modifications in the availabilit y of marine
fisheries species in 14 countries in West Africa,
by 2050. Using the high range IPCC Special
Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1B
scenario, they project a decrease in landed fish
value of 21 percent, a total annual loss of
US$311 million compared to values for 2000, and
a loss in fisheries-related jobs of almost
50 percent, with Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Liberia,
Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo suffering the
most severe impacts.

Climate change may also lead to changes in
investment patterns that would lead to reductions
in the long-term productivit y and resilience of
agricultural systems at household and national
levels. Uncertaint y discourages investment in
agricultural production, potentially offsetting the
benefit to food producers of higher prices. This is
particularly true for poor smallholders with
limited or no access to credit and insurance.
Greater exposure to risk, in the absence of wellfunctioning insurance markets, can lead to
greater emphasis on low-risk/low-return
subsistence crops, a lower likelihood of applying
purchased inputs such as fertilizer and adopting
new technologies, and reduced levels of
investment (Antle and Crissman, 1990; Dercon
and Christiaensen, 2011; Fafchamps, 1992; Feder,
Just and Zilberman, 1985; Heltberg and Tarp,
2002; Kassie et al., 2008; Roe and GrahamTomasi, 1986; Sadoulet and de Janvr y, 1995;
Skees, Hazell and Miranda, 1999). All of these
responses generally lead to both lower current
and future farm profits (Hurley, 2010;
Rosenzweig and Binswanger, 1993). n

Most projections of the food price impacts of
climate change point to increases, although the
magnitude and locations var y considerably across
models and climate scenarios. A study that
coupled scenarios for population growth and
income growth with climate change scenarios
looked at the potential impacts under 15 different
combinations. Using an optimistic scenario of
low population growth and high income growth,
and the mean results from four climate change
scenarios, it plotted mean projected price
increases by 2050, compared to 2010 levels, of
87 percent for maize, 31 percent for rice and
44 percent for wheat (Nelson et al., 2010).
Another potential impact of climate change is
food price volatilit y (Porter et al., 2014), although

CHAPTER 2 CLIMATE, AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY: A CLOSER LOOK AT THE CONNECTIONS

MILLIONS MORE AT
RISK OF HUNGER

The International Food Policy Research Institute
(IFPRI) and several other global economic
modelling groups, collaborating as part of the
Agricultural Model Intercomparison and
Improvement Project, and building on the earlier
work by Nelson et al. (2014b), used different
combinations of RCPs and SSPs to explore the
possible effects of climate change – together with
other socio-economic changes – on production,
yields, cultivated area, prices and trade of major
crops ( Wiebe et al., 2015).

Although climate change poses concrete threats
to future food securit y, the likely impacts will
differ by region, countr y and location and will
affect different population groups according to
their v ulnerabilit y. Future food securit y trends
will also be inf luenced by overall socio-economic
conditions, which, in turn, have implications for
the v ulnerabilit y of countries and populations
around the world.

The results show that by 2050, relative to a world
with no climate change, global average crop
yields will decline by between 5 and 7 percent,
depending on assumptions about rates of socioeconomic and climate change, while the area
har vested will increase by around 4 percent
(Fig ure 7). The impact of climate change on total
production will be relatively small. However,
both the area har vested and staple food prices
will increase at about twice the rate projected in
the absence of climate change, with potentially
significant impacts on both the environment and
food securit y.

The IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report estimated
that, depending on the climate change scenario
and socio-economic development path, from
34 million to 600 million more people could
suffer from hunger by 2080 (Yohe et al., 2007;
Parr y, Rosenzweig and Livermore, 2005). Arnell
et al. (2002) projected that, with no climate
change, 312 million people globally would be at
risk of hunger in the 2050s, and 300 million
people in the 2080s. Without climate change
mitigation, those numbers would grow to
321 million in the 2050s and 391 million in the
2080s. Among the developing regions, Southern
Asia and Africa would be the most exposed to an
increased risk of hunger as a result of climate
change. The ver y broad range of estimates of the
number of people at risk of hunger owing to
climate change points to uncertainties concerning
some of the processes, both biophysical and
socio-economic; however, the numbers indicate
that the impact should not be underestimated.

Impacts will var y according to crop and region
and rate of climate change. Higher latitudes will
see smaller losses in yields, and even some
gains as growing seasons lengthen. Losses in
lower latitude regions will be greater. Maize
yields decline in most regions under most
scenarios. Impacts on wheat are small at the
global level, since losses in South Asia and subSaharan Africa are offset by increases elsewhere
(see Fig ure 1).
In a related analysis, IFPRI found that in the
absence of climate change, most regions would
see declining numbers of people at risk of
hunger between 2010 and 2050. However,
climate change will partly offset those gains.
Results from IFPRI’s IMPACT model suggest
that, by the year 2050, under a high emissions
scenario (RCP 8.5), more than 40 million more
people could be at risk of undernourishment
than there would be in the absence of climate
change. While the increase due to climate
change is smaller than the projected global
reduction in the number of undernourished,

When analysing the possible future impact of
climate change on food securit y, it is important
to bear in mind that food and agriculture will be
affected by a range of other drivers of change,
including growth in population and income. This
is illustrated by an analysis of climate change
impacts based on 15 scenarios – three economic
development and five climate change scenarios
combined – which found that up to 2050,
economic growth will have a much greater effect
on global food securit y than climate change,
although climate change does aggravate negative
impacts (Nelson et al., 2009).

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2016

thanks to economic growth and development, it
is a significant number. It is also likely to be a
conser vative estimate because it is based on the
SSP2 “business-as-usual” assumption of
economic growth, and does not account for the
impacts of extreme events, sea-level rise, melting
glaciers, changes in pest and disease patterns,
and other factors that are expected to change
with climate, especially after 2050.

The v ulnerabilit y of populations in subSaharan Africa, as well as in parts of South
Asia, to food insecurit y resulting from climate
change also emerges in projections by the
World Food Programme and the Met Office
Hadley Centre (United Kingdom). Their joint
work largely follows methods used by
Krishnamurthy, Lewis and Choularton (2014),
with v ulnerabilit y defined by a composite
index based on measures of exposure,
sensitivit y and adaptive capacit y. Projections
of future levels of v ulnerabilit y were made for
two time periods: 2050 and 2080. Three climate
change scenarios were considered: low
emissions (RCP 2.6), medium emissions (RCP
4.5) and high emissions (RCP 8.5). Each
scenario was projected using twelve different
climate models, and the median result was
taken as the value for the respective drought
and f lood indicators. Scenarios of no
adaptation as well as low and high adaptation
were taken into consideration.

Under the RCP 8.5 high emissions scenario, most
of the expected slow-down in the reduction in the
number of people at risk of hunger is in subSaharan Africa (Fig ure 8). The loss is
concentrated in that region partly because other
regions benefit from some production in higher
latitude areas, and partly because other regions
are less reliant on agriculture for incomes and
food securit y.
However, it must be remembered that climate
change is not the only driver of future trends in
povert y and food insecurit y. How climate change
is projected to affect the global risk of hunger
over time, for a range of climate change impacts
and the SSP2 “middle-of-the-road” socioeconomic scenario, is shown in Fig ure 9. The
declining trend in the number of undernourished
with or without climate change indicates that the
overall impact of climate change during the
period until 2050 is smaller than that of the other
drivers embedded in the socio-economic
scenario, particularly income growth. In the
absence of climate change, most regions are
projected to see declining numbers of people at
risk of hunger. These improvements are partially
reduced by climate change, especially in subSaharan Africa.

Fig ure 10 illustrates v ulnerabilit y today and in
2050 under two different scenarios: a worst
case scenario, with high emissions (RCP 8.5)
and no adaptation, and a best case scenario
with low emissions (RCP 2.6) and high levels of
adaptation. The greatest v ulnerabilities are
seen in areas of sub-Saharan Africa and South
and South East Asia, where millions of people
are likely to face greater risk of food insecurit y
as a result of climate change by the 2050s. The
increase in v ulnerabilit y is dramatic under the
worst-case scenario. Under a best case scenario,
v ulnerabilities are greatly reduced, and for
some countries actually decrease from presentday levels. n

SECTORS’ ROLE IN
CLIMATE CHANGE

sub-Saharan Africa, but are less significant in other
regions. The contribution of forest sinks is important
in countries in developed regions as well as in Latin
America and the Caribbean, but less so elsewhere.
Agricultural emissions make up a significant share of
total AFOLU emissions in all regions, and represent
more than half of emissions in all regions except subSaharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean,
where net forest conversion is the major source.
Different emission patterns have been recorded at
regional level over the last two decades. For example,
there has been a sharp reduction in the positive
contribution of forest sinks in Southeast, Eastern and
Southern Asia, and an opposite trend in Europe.
Other regions report more stable trends (FAO, 2016d).

By FAO estimates (Table 5), emissions from
agriculture, forest and other land use (A FOLU)
stood at 10.6 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide
equivalent in the year 2014. The sector emits
three t ypes of anthropogenic greenhouse gases:
carbon dioxide (CO 2), the hydrocarbon methane
(CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). The main sources
of those emissions are deforestation, enteric
fermentation in livestock, manure left on fields,
applied chemical fertilizers and rice cultivation
practices. Deforestation and land degradation
have also reduced the sector’s capacit y to absorb
(or sequester) carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere. Carbon dioxide and methane
account for 49 and 30 percent, respectively, of the
emissions generated by agriculture, forestr y and
land use. This represents 14 percent of total
anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and
42 percent of all methane emissions. The share of
nitrous oxide in total A FOLU emissions is small,
but accounts for as much as 75 percent of global
anthropogenic emissions of the gas.

Of the sources of specific GHG emissions from
agriculture, the most significant contribution at the
global level – amounting to 40 percent in CO 2
equivalent – comes from enteric fermentation in
ruminants, which is a major source of methane
emissions (Figure 13). In terms of the magnitude of
emissions, this is followed by manure left on
pasture (16 percent), the use of synthetic fertilizers
(12 percent) and rice cultivation (10 percent).
Enteric fermentation is the largest source of
emissions from agriculture in all regions except
Oceania and Eastern and Southeast Asia, with
the share of total emissions ranging from
58 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean to
37 percent in countries in developed regions
(Table 6). The importance of other emission
sources varies at regional level. Rice cultivation is
the most important source of agricultural
emissions in Eastern and Southeast Asia (at
26 percent), while in Oceania the cultivation of
organic soils is the source of 59 percent of
agricultural emissions. The second main source
is manure left on pastures in sub-Saharan Africa,
Northern Africa and Western Asia, and Latin
America and the Caribbean; rice cultivation in
Southern Asia; and synthetic fertilizers in
countries in developed regions.

Agriculture accounts for the largest share of
emissions from AFOLU, followed by net conversion
of forest land; since the 1990s, emissions from
forest conversion have decreased while agricultural
emissions have increased (Figure 11). Organic soils
(those with a high concentration of organic matter,
such as peatlands) and the burning of biomass (e.g.
savanna fires) account for relatively smaller
amounts of emissions. Forests also mitigate climate
change by removing GHG from the atmosphere
through forest growth, as seen in the negative
values. However, the average contribution of forests
to carbon sequestration has fallen from 2.8 Gt
annually in the 1990s to 2.3 Gt in the 2000s, and is
estimated at 1.8 Gt in 2014.

Agriculture must contribute to mitigation if global
temperature increase is to be kept below 2 °C
(Wollenberg et al., 2016). It needs to be recognized,
however, that the source of some 75 percent of
global GHG emissions is fossil fuel used for energy

Across regions, AFOLU emission levels and sources
are starkly different (Figure 12). Emissions from net
forest conversion represent the largest share of GHG
emissions in Latin America and the Caribbean and

production, while only 21 percent is linked to the
agriculture sectors. Emissions from the energy
sector could be reduced, even to zero, through
greater energy use efficiency and a transition to
renewable energy sources. If that were to happen,
emissions from agriculture would represent a
progressively larger part of total emissions, for
three reasons: (1) because emissions from other
sectors would decrease; (2) because food production
is increasing and, with it, the tendency towards
higher emissions; and (3) because reducing
agriculture’s emissions is far more challenging
owing to the enormous diversity in its sectors and
the complex biophysical processes involved.
The agriculture sectors can contribute to climate
change mitigation by decoupling emissions

increases from production increases. However,
they also have the unique capacity to sequester
carbon. At the present state of technolog y, one of
the main means of extracting CO 2 from the
atmosphere is through forestry and the
rehabilitation of degraded land. Transforming this
theoretical potential into an actual sink depends
on biophysical conditions, as well as on the
available technical options and appropriate
institutions and policies. Emissions from
agriculture, as well as sinks, are part of the global
carbon and nitrogen cycles. Optimizing the
mitigation potential of the agriculture sectors
requires, therefore, an understanding of these
cycles and of how agricultural activities interact
with them. Some – but not all – of the options for
enhanced mitigation also carry co-benefits in
terms of adaptation (see Chapter 4). n

CONCLUSIONS
This chapter has traced the potential impacts of
climate change on agriculture, socio-economic
development and, ultimately, food security. Among
the main impacts on agriculture are the increased
incidence of drought and extreme weather events,
more intense pest and disease pressures and the
loss of biodiversity. Long-term projections point to
negative effects on food production that will become
increasingly severe after 2030. Reductions in crop
yields and the productivity of livestock, fisheries
and forestry are more likely in tropical developing
regions than in temperate, developed countries.
As the impact of climate change on agricultural
production and productivity deepens, an increase
in both international food prices and the number of
people at risk of food insecurity is expected. While

socioeconomic and technological development will
be a stronger driver of food security trends than
climate change until 2050, climate change impacts
on agriculture and food security should not be
underestimated, especially at the regional level –
the socio-economic knock-on effects will be felt
most by low-income rural populations and by
countries with a high dependency on agriculture.
The following chapter examines how the agriculture
sectors can adapt to current or expected changes, in
a way that minimizes their harmful effects and
takes advantage of opportunities, with a focus on
smallholders and small-scale production systems.
The potential for climate change mitigation and the
potential co-benefits of adaptation and mitigation
measures will be addressed in Chapter 4.

GLOBAL POVERTY CANNOT BE ERADICATED WITHOUT
STRENGTHENING the resilience of smallholder agriculture
to climate change impacts.

SMALLHOLDER AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS CAN ADAPT TO
CLIMATE CHANGE by adopting climate-smart practices,
diversifying on-farm agricultural production and
diversifying into off-farm income and employment.

SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES
will be key for adaptation to climate change and to ensure
food security.

IMPROVEMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, EXTENSION, CLIMATE
INFORMATION, MARKET ACCESS, CREDIT AND SOCIAL

CHAPTER 3

ADAPTING TO
CLIMATE CHANGE
IN SMALLHOLDER
AGRICULTURE
Most of the world’s poor and hungr y are rural
people who earn meagre livings from agriculture.
In 2010, some 900 million of the estimated
1.2 billion extremely poor lived in rural areas.
About 750 million of them worked in agriculture,
usually as smallholder family farmers (Olinto et
al., 2013). While 200 million rural poor may
migrate to towns and cities over the next 15
years, most will remain in the countr yside. In
that period, the rural population in less
developed regions is projected to increase slightly
(UN-DESA, 2012), and an estimated 700 million
rural people would be living in povert y. Without
concerted action to improve rural livelihoods, the
eradication of povert y by 2030 will be impossible.

recent decades, povert y reduction across a wide
range of countries and conditions has been
associated with growth in the value of
agricultural production, increased rural-urban
migration and a shift away from economies
highly dependent on agriculture to more
diversified sources of income and employment. In
ever y countr y that has seen rapid povert y
reduction, growth in agricultural labour
productivit y, and consequently rural wages, has
been a feature (Timmer, 2014). Rwanda and
Ethiopia, for example, have achieved ver y
significant productivit y growth and
correspondingly large reductions in rural povert y.
However, the opportunities and challenges for
agricultural productivit y growth today are
markedly different from those of the past.
Growth in markets for food and agricultural
products creates opportunities for smallholders,
but sometimes also barriers which lead to their
exclusion. Growth in the private sector’s share of
agricultural technolog y development and
dissemination has opened up new opportunities
but has also changed the terms under which
those technologies are accessed.

The sheer number of smallholder farm families
worldwide justifies a specific focus on the threats
posed by climate change to their livelihoods and
the urgent need to transform those livelihoods
along sustainable pathways. This chapter explores
the key vulnerabilities of smallholder farming
systems to climate change risks, and assesses the
options for minimizing vulnerabilities through
sustainable intensification, diversification and risk
management strategies. After assessing the
available evidence of the cost of adaptation, it
concludes that the costs of inaction exceed by far
the cost of interventions that would make
smallholder farming systems resilient, sustainable
and more prosperous. n

Facing different constraints and opportunities,
rural populations across the world have different
possible pathways out of povert y ( Wiggins, 2016).
Those with good linkages to rapidly expanding
markets have a different set of opportunities to
those in more remote areas. Demography also
matters. In sub-Saharan Africa, the future
agricultural population will be young, with
smaller areas of land to farm; in parts of Asia, the
population is likely to be older and farm sizes
bigger. In some cases, farmland consolidation
will be needed to facilitate access to high value
market chains (Masters et al., 2013). Other
possible pathways are diversification into nonfarm sources of income through migration of

exposure, sensitivit y and adaptive capacit y
(IPCC, 2001).
Chapter 2 summarized the nature of climate
change risks to agricultural systems globally.
Overall, the extent of exposure to risks is diverse
and changes over time. For most developing
countries, the impacts of climate change on crop
and livestock productivit y tend to be adverse and
increasing. Localized weather shocks and
emerging pests and diseases are already
compromising the stabilit y of crop production,
highlighting the urgent need for immediate,
adaptable management responses (FAO, 2016a).

Climate change is projected to have mainly
negative impacts on food and agricultural
production in large areas of the developing
world. The success of efforts to develop rural
economies and eradicate rural povert y will also
depend crucially, therefore, on building
resilience to climate change in agricultural
systems – especially those managed by
smallholders – and the widespread adoption of
land, water, fisheries and forestr y management
practices that are environmentally, socially and
economically sustainable. n

Recent FAO studies on the impact of climate
shocks on smallholder agriculture in subSaharan Africa (summarized in Table 7) found
that yields rise significantly with more rainfall in
most cases, but suffer when rainfall is below
average and more variable; likewise, aboveaverage temperatures reduce productivit y
significantly. However, specific weather
anomalies affect yields in some countries but not
in others. Knowing what weather variables
constrain yields is the first step to addressing
such constraints, and there is no recipe that
applies across countries. Rainfall variabilit y is
highly significant in Malawi and Niger, but not
in Uganda and Zambia. Although average
rainfall and temperatures appear to be
significant across a broader set of countries,
variabilit y can be a key constraining factor in
some regions, even if it is not associated with an
extreme event.

KEY VULNERABILITIES
TO CLIMATE CHANGE
RISKS
Smallholder agriculture producers in developing
countries are considered to be highly v ulnerable
to climate change and stand to gain the most
from increased resilience. Vulnerabilit y is defined
by the IPCC as the extent to which a natural or
social system is susceptible to sustaining damage
from climate change impacts, and is a function of

CHAPTER 3 ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN SMALLHOLDER AGRICULTURE

The consequences of exposure to climate hazards
depend on sensitivity, i.e. the degree to which
an agro-ecological or socio-economic system
responds, both positively and negatively, to a
given change. Increasing scarcit y and
degradation of natural resources heighten the
sensitivit y of smallholder agriculture to climate
hazards, because degraded resources are less
capable of maintaining productivit y under
climate stresses (FAO, 2012). For example, while
there is sufficient water to satisf y the demand for
food at the global level, an increasing number of
regions face growing water scarcit y, which will
impact rural and urban livelihoods, food securit y
and economic activities (FAO, 2011a; FAO and
World Water Council, 2015). Further degradation
of water qualit y and quantit y under climate
change reduces the supply of water for food
production, affecting food availabilit y, stabilit y,
access and utilization, especially in the arid and
semi-arid tropics and in Asian and African
mega-deltas (Bates et al., 2008). Rationalizing
water use in agriculture will greatly facilitate
adaptation to climate change in smallholder
production systems.

aversion also impact rural financial markets
and supply chains in ways that f urther reduce
opportunities and deepen farm-level povert y
traps (Barrett and Swallow, 2006; Kelly,
Adesina and Gordon, 2003; Poulton, Kydd and
Dor ward, 2006).
In smallholder agriculture, adaptive capacity – or
the abilit y to identif y and implement effective
actions in response to changing circumstances –
is limited by barriers to the adoption of improved,
climate-smart technologies and practices. For
example, the lack of access to credit for
investment affects, particularly, the poorest
households, which are usually unable to provide
collateral for loans, and female producers, who
often have no formal title to assets. Other
barriers include lack of land tenure securit y, ver y
limited access to information, extension advice
and markets, a lack of safet y nets to protect
livelihoods against shocks, and gender-bias in all
of those institutions.
Most of the inter ventions needed to improve
smallholders’ capacit y to adapt to climate change
are the same as those required for general rural
development, but with a stronger focus on
climate risks. For example, extension packages
need to take into account site-specific climate
change projections; investments in the breeding
of improved crop varieties and animal breeds
should consider not only high yield but also
resistance to shocks expected in specific locations
(Box 9). Investments are urgently needed in
irrigation and other water management
infrastructure. These issues are taken up in more
detail in the following sections. n

Rural women are especially sensitive to climate
hazards, owing to their gender-determined
household responsibilities (such as collecting
wood and water) and the increasing agricultural
workloads they bear because of male outmigration (see e.g. Jost et al., 2015; Ag wu and
Okhimamwe, 2009; Goh, 2012; Wright and
Chandani, 2014). Increases in the incidence of
drought and water shortages add to their
workloads, affecting both agricultural
productivit y and household welfare (UNDP,
2010). See also Box 8.

TOWARDS RESILIENT
PRODUCTION SYSTEMS
AND LIVELIHOODS

The limited capacit y of smallholders to manage
risks is another source of sensitiv it y to climate
hazards. During extreme events, they adopt
precautionar y strateg ies – for example, selling
cattle – which may protect them against
catastrophic losses but undermine long-term
livelihood opportunities and can trap them in
chronic povert y (Carter and Barrett, 2006;
Dercon, 1996; Dercon and Christiaensen, 2007;
Fafchamps, 2003; Morduch, 1994; Kebede, 1992;
Simtowe, 2006). Climate uncertainties and risk

The v ulnerabilit y of smallholders to climate
change adds to the more general difficulties they
face in enhancing their productivit y and
improving their livelihoods. Consequently,

RURAL WOMEN ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE
information and services, and are less mobile
(FAO, 2007; Nelson, 2011). The gendered
nature of resource entitlements means that
women tend to rely more on resources and
technologies that are sensitive to climate
hazards (Dankelman, 2008; Huynh and
Resurrección, 2014; Nelson and Stathers,
2009; Nelson, 2011). The nature and intensity
of poverty and vulnerability to risks is also
gender-specific (Holmes and Jones, 2009).
To ensure that interventions aimed at increasing
productivity and reducing risks linked to climate
change are effective and sustainable, it is
important to address gender inequalities and
discrimination in access to productive resources,
services and employment opportunities, so that
men and women can benefit equally.

Rural women represent a quarter of the world’s
population. They make up around 43 percent of
the agricultural labour force in developing
countries. In South Asia more than two out of
every three employed women work in
agriculture (FAO, 2011a). Globally, with few
exceptions, every gender and development
indicator for which data are available reveals
that rural women fare worse than rural men and
urban women, and that they disproportionately
experience poverty, exclusion and the effects of
climate change (United Nations, 2010).
Smallholder women farmers are more exposed
than men to climate risks, and for many of the
same reasons that female farmers’ productivity is
lower than men’s – they have fewer endowments
and entitlements, have more limited access to

and livestock breeds and to collect and
conserve the wild relatives of important food
crops. Maintenance of on-site farm diversity
allows for evolution in step with environmental
changes, while regional and global gene banks
provide backup collections of genetic material
that can be drawn upon to support climate
change adaptation measures. Given that all
countries depend on genetic diversity from
other countries and regions, international
cooperation and exchange is crucial. The
International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources
for Food and Agriculture allows researchers
and breeders to access genetic resources from
other countries.

FAO has published Voluntary guidelines to
support the integration of genetic diversity into
national climate change adaptation planning. If
properly conserved and used in breeding
programmes, genetic diversity can provide crop
varieties that are more tolerant to increased
aridity, frost, flooding and soil salinity, and
livestock breeds that are both highly productive
and tolerant to harsh production environments.
Policies that anticipate future needs, and plan the
management of genetic resources as a pivotal
reservoir and tool, can help build resilient
agricultural production systems.
Greater efforts are needed to conserve and
support the sustainable use of plant varieties

» responses aimed at reducing v ulnerabilit y need

Innovations that strengthen the resilience of
smallholder farming systems to climate change
include enhanced resource-use efficiency through
sustainable intensification of production, and the
adoption of agroecological production systems.
Improving water resource management is another
area where innovation can be effective in
addressing climate change impacts. All of these
approaches improve carbon and nitrogen
management (see below and Chapter 4).

to go hand in hand with policies for broader
agricultural and rural development. Such an
approach creates conditions that help to reduce
exposure and sensitivit y to weather shocks, while
building adaptive capacit y in ways that can
provide new opportunities for improving rural
livelihoods and food securit y.
Resilient livelihoods imply conditions, such as
adequate income and food securit y, which allow
people to withstand, recover from and adapt to
the climate risks they are exposed to. Since
smallholders’ circumstances and opportunities
differ greatly across locations, pathways for
adaptation and building resilience must be
designed specifically for each context, taking into
account the degree of exposure to climate shocks
as well as adaptation capacit y. This section
identifies the main features of possible pathways
to reduced v ulnerabilit y to climate change for
smallholder systems and the populations that
depend on them. It addresses two dimensions:
ways to increase the resilience of agricultural
production systems and ways to enhance the
resilience of v ulnerable populations’ livelihoods.

Biotechnologies, both low- and high-tech, can
help small-scale producers in particular to be
more resilient and to adapt better to climate
change. While the subsections that follow focus
mainly on innovation through management
practices, some practices may depend on the
outcomes of biotechnolog y, such as improved seed.

Sustainable intensification
Sustainable intensification raises productivit y,
lowers production costs and increases the level
and stabilit y of returns from production, while
conser ving natural resources, reducing negative
impacts on the environment and enhancing the
f low of ecosystem ser vices (FAO, 2011b). The
nature of sustainable intensification strategies
varies across different t y pes of farming systems
and locations. However, one of the core principles
is increasing the efficiency of resource use.

Innovation: the key to
farming system adaptation

FAO’s approach to sustainable crop production
intensification is the “Save and Grow” model.
Save and Grow promotes a productive agriculture
that conser ves and enhances natural resources. It
uses an ecosystem approach that draws on
nature’s contribution to crop growth, such as soil
organic matter, water f low reg ulation, pollination
and natural predation of pests. It applies
appropriate external inputs at the right time and
in the right amount to improved crop varieties
that are resilient to climate change and use
nutrients, water and external inputs more
efficiently. Increasing resource use efficiency,
cutting the use of fossil fuels and reducing direct
environmental degradation are key components
of the approach, saving money for farmers and
preventing the negative effects of overusing
particular inputs. This approach has been
extended to other agriculture sectors.

Addressing the new challenges posed by climate
change will require innovations in farming
systems. Innovation happens when individuals
and groups adopt new ideas, technologies or
processes which, when successful, spread
through communities and societies. The process
is complex, involving many actors, and it cannot
function in a vacuum. It is furthered by the
presence of an effective innovation system. An
agricultural innovation system includes the
general enabling, economic and institutional
environment required by all farmers. Other key
components are research and advisor y ser vices
and effective agricultural producers’
organizations. Innovation often builds on and
adjusts local knowledge and traditional systems,
in combination with new sources of knowledge
from formal research systems (FAO, 2014a).
| 50 |

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2016

Agroecolog y builds on the local and traditional
knowledge of farmers to create solutions based
on farmers’ needs. For example, Swiderska (2011)
found that access to diverse traditional crop
varieties was essential for climate change
adaptation and sur vival among poor farmers in
China, Bolivia and Kenya. In China, farmers who
grew four different mixtures of rice varieties
suffered 44 percent less blast incidence and
achieved 89 percent higher yields, when
compared to single-variet y fields, and without
the need to use fungicides (Zhu et al., 2000).
Agroecological diversification contributes to yield
stabilit y under climatic variabilit y. Polycultures
exhibit greater yield stabilit y and suffer fewer
productivit y declines during a drought than
monocultures (Altieri et al., 2015).

Through better management of carbon and
nitrogen cycles (see below), sustainable
agricultural intensification also builds greater
resilience to climate change impacts and
contributes to reducing GHG emissions (Burney
et al., 2010; Wollenberg et al., 2016).

Efficient water management
As climate change alters rainfall and water
availabilit y patterns, the capacit y to deal with
water scarcit y or water excess will be crucial in
efforts to sustainably improve productivit y. The
areas with the highest potential for water
productivit y improvements are those with a high
incidence of povert y, including many parts of
sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin
America, as well as areas where competition for
water is intense, such as the Indus Basin and
Yellow River (HLPE, 2015).

 enhance biological interactions and synergies
among the components of agrobiodiversit y,
thereby promoting key ecological processes
and ser vices.

Increasing water use efficiency in agricultural
systems under climate change may require action
in the fields of policy, investment and water
management, and institutional and technical
changes applied at different scales: on fields and
farms, in irrigation schemes, in watersheds or
aquifers, in river basins and at the national level
(FAO, 2013a). As a first step towards adaptation
to longer-term climate change impacts,
information about current climate variabilit y
needs to be incorporated into water management
(Sadoff and Muller, 2009; Bates et al., 2008 as
cited in Pinca, 2016).
In rainfed systems, which account for 95 percent
of farmland in sub-Saharan Africa, better
management of rainwater and soil moisture is the
key to raising productivit y and reducing yield

retention of crop residues. On grazing lands,
improved pasture management, reducing or
eliminating the occurrence of fires, and
introducing improved fodder grasses or leg umes
are important means of improving carbon
management. Mixed farming systems enhance
resilience and reverse soil degradation by
controlling erosion, providing nitrogen-rich
residues and increasing soil organic matter. For
example, drought-tolerant mixed farming systems
practised in Ethiopia and the United Republic of
Tanzania include a multipurpose leg ume, such as
pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), and Faidherbia albida,
an indigenous nitrogen-fixing leg uminous tree
which provides pods palatable to livestock and
leaves used as organic fertilizer. Higher
production of pulses helps to diversif y diets and
provides extra protein during periods of seasonal

rainfall. Supplemental irrigation, using water
har vesting or shallow groundwater resources, is
an important but underused strateg y for
increasing water productivit y in rainfed
agriculture (HLPE 2015; Oweis, 2014).
In irrigated systems, water use efficiency can be
promoted through institutional changes, such as
the creation of water users’ associations, and
infrastructural improvements, such as lining
canals, more efficient drainage networks and
wastewater reuse. Water-efficient irrigation
technologies, such as drip emitters, and better
maintenance of irrigation infrastructure,
combined with appropriate training to build
farmers’ technical knowledge, can be effective in
dealing with climate change impacts on water
availabilit y and food securit y (Box 10). However,
some technologies that improve water use
efficiency, such as drip irrigation, require energ y.
More broadly, there are often trade-offs and
possible synergies in the use of water, energ y and
land for food production. The “water-energ y-food
nexus” approach is a useful concept when
planning the use of these resources in agrifood
chains (FAO, 2014b).

Context-specific climatic conditions will
inf luence smallholders’ choice of the carbon and
nitrogen management options that are the most
effective in improving their livelihood. For
example, the application of mineral fertilizer may
generate higher yields under average climatic
conditions, but lower yields under conditions of
high rainfall variabilit y or the delayed onset of
rainfall. Conversely, crop rotation may produce
lower yields under average climatic conditions,
but higher yields and a lower probabilit y of yield
loss under conditions of high rainfall variabilit y
(Table 8).

Carbon and nitrogen management options
The Earth’s carbon and nitrogen cycles are
affected by the t ypes of soil, nutrient and water
management practices farmers adopt, by the
extent of agro-forestr y practised, and by the
expansion of agriculture onto non-agricultural
land (see also Chapter 4). Smallholders, in
particular, can benefit from practices that help
restore soil productivit y in areas where
unsustainable land management has depleted soil
organic carbon, natural soil fertilit y and soil
qualit y, resulting in reduced productivit y and
increased v ulnerabilit y to climate hazards such
as drought, f looding, and conditions that favour
pests and diseases (Stocking, 2003; Lal, 2004;
Cassman, 1999; FAO, 2007).

Improvements in the use of nitrogen fertilizer are
critical to the sustainabilit y of many smallholder
farming systems. Indicators of nitrogen fertilizer
use show that application rates and cereal yields
are much higher in East Asia, but the additional
amount of production obtained from fertilizer
input is significantly higher in sub-Saharan
Africa (Table 9). Also significantly higher is the
partial nutrient balance – in sub-Saharan Africa,
more nutrients are removed with the har vested
crop than applied in fertilizer or manure,
indicating unsustainable soil nutrient depletion.
In East Asia, the opposite is the case.

On cropland, levels of soil organic carbon (SOC)
and plant-useable soil nitrogen can be improved
through the adoption of practices such as
agroforestr y, improved fallows, green manuring,
nitrogen-fixing cover crops, integrated nutrient
management, minimum soil disturbance and the

Overuse of mineral fertilizer is clearly a problem

and cooperatives and undertook a variety of research,
experimental and demonstration activities. The focus
was on adaptation measures and water-saving
technologies, which were subsequently put into
practice by farmers. Some 1.3 million farm families
saw benefits in the form of reduced irrigation costs,
less groundwater depletion and higher water
productivity.

China’s Huang-Huai-Hai Plain is critical to the
country’s agricultural economy and national food
security. Productivity is threatened by climate changes,
including a significant overall increase in temperature
and declining levels of humidity and precipitation over
the past half-century (Yang et al., 2015; Hijioka et al.,
2014).
In five of the region’s provinces, a World Bankfinanced project has promoted water-saving
technologies and other improved practices – such as
the use of drought-resistant crop varieties – with the
goal of improving water management on some
500 000 ha of farmland. Irrigation facilities

environmental harm, in the form of ground and
surface water contamination, and greenhouse gas
emissions. In East Asia, therefore, reducing
mineral fertilizer use and ensuring the correct
amount, timing and placement is an important
part of sustainable intensification.

The results assume standalone introduction of
the indicated practices, and that the practices are
adapted to the specific socio-economic and agroecological contexts where adoption is projected to
occur. Under the climate-smart agriculture
approach, an evidence base is developed to
identif y practices that are actually adapted to the
local context. They are not determined a priori
but based on a process of building evidence and
dialog ue. There is no standard list of climate
smart agriculture practices that can be
universally applied: in some cases zero-till
agriculture does provide significant adaptation
benefits, while in others it does not (Arslan et al.,
2015). It is also important to recognize that there
is a wide range of combinations of practices that
farmers may adopt to suit their specific needs.

In sub-Saharan Africa, on the other hand,
increasing the level of mineral fertilizer use, up
to appropriate amounts, has considerable
potential for boosting smallholder crop yields.
However, given the generally poor condition of
soils in much of the region, smallholders need
support in improving soil qualit y and soil
ecosystem ser vices, as a complement to judicious
fertilizer application.
Improved carbon and nitrogen management are
also important for fisher y and forestr y systems.
Box 11 presents an example from Viet Nam,
where carbon management measures were
introduced as part of an integrated climate-smart
aquaculture system.

Food security benefits of improved farming practices
Significant improvements in food securit y can be
achieved with the introduction of improved
agricultural practices. Simulations using IFPRI’s
IMPACT model show that the adoption of heattolerant crop varieties produces the highest
projected global yield increase for maize in 2050.
Varieties that use nitrogen more efficiently
produce the highest global yield increase for rice,
while zero-tillage is the best option for wheat
(Rosegrant et al., 2014; De Pinto, Thomas and
Wiebe, 2016).

In many contexts, it makes sense to combine the
set of improved practices by “stacking” one on
top of the other in the same order as crop
production activities (i.e., first improvements in
land preparation, planting and crop
management, followed by irrigation, etc.). Model
projections indicate that the benefits to food
securit y are greater – up to three times greater
than that which can be obtained from the
improved use of nitrogen alone – when a
combined set of improved practices is adopted,
compared with the benefits of a single practice
(Rosegrant et. al., 2014).

Adopting these technologies would have
significant positive impacts on food securit y by
increasing the availabilit y of food energ y,
enhancing smallholders’ incomes and lowering
food prices. The number of people at risk of
undernourishment in developing countries would
be reduced in 2050 5 by 12 percent (or almost

diversified product portfolio also boosted the
resilience of the system. By using natural feed sources
and excess nutrients in the tilapia ponds, farmers
were able to reduce the need for pellet feed, which
helped to lower GHG emissions.
The promotion and scaling-up of climate-smart
aquaculture requires policy incentives, regulations
and strong institutional frameworks. Because the
introduction of tilapia increases overall production,
efforts are needed to expand markets, especially
export markets, for the fish. Obstacles to adoption,
such as the low quality and high cost of feed, can be
overcome by connecting farmer groups to feed and
seed suppliers.

Both climate change adaptation and mitigation
measures are needed to protect coastal aquaculture
production in Viet Nam’s North Central Coast region.
One feasible option is developing climate-smart
aquaculture practices that integrate mono-sex tilapia
into traditional mariculture systems.
The results of trials in Thanh Hoa province show that
incorporating tilapia is a good adaptation strategy,
which addresses all three objectives of climate-smart
agriculture: sustainably increasing productivity,
increasing adaptive capacity and reducing GHG
emissions. The approach resulted in higher
production efficiency and increases in household
income of between 14 and 43 percent. The

» diversification (Thornton and Lipper, 2014).

farming systems provide, via manure
amendments, about 15 percent of the nitrogen
inputs used in crop production, which reduces
input costs and achieves an emission intensit y
substantially lower than that of many grazing
systems (Liu et al., 2010; Herrero et al., 2013). In
addition, diversified farms can play an important
role in maintaining and increasing the provision
of ecosystem ser vices, which helps to increase
overall resilience (Ricketts, 2001; Kremen and
Miles, 2012).

Agricultural diversification means adding plant
varieties and species, or animal breeds, to farms
or farming communities. It may involve landscape
diversification, with different crops and cropping
systems being interspersed in space and time.
Livelihood diversification means farming
households engaging in multiple agricultural and
non-agricultural activities – for example, by
combining on-farm activities with seasonal
agricultural work elsewhere, taking a job in the
cit y, processing farm products or opening a shop.
Both agricultural and livelihood diversification
are ways of managing climate risk.

Support to risk management
Social protection programmes, which are a
critical tool for povert y alleviation, may also play
an important role in helping smallholders to
manage risk under climate change. Social
protection takes various forms, from cash
transfers to school meals and public works.
Agricultural input subsidies may also have a
social protection function by helping to reduce
the v ulnerabilit y of smallholders to price
volatilit y. Evidence from Latin America and subSaharan Africa shows the clear benefits of social
protection in terms of food securit y, human
capital development, and economic and
productive capacit y, even among the poorest and
most marginalized.

Since climate shocks affect different farming and
non-farming activities differently, diversification
can potentially reduce the impact of these shocks
on income, and provide a broader range of
options for managing future risks. When
combined with risk-mitigating measures, such as
crop insurance or social protection,
diversification can lead to higher incomes and
help accelerate povert y reduction. However, if
farmers diversif y to low-productivit y activities, it
may actually reduce average income, force
households to sell off assets in the event of
shocks, and trigger a vicious cycle of greater
v ulnerabilit y and exposure to risk (Dercon, 1996).
The scope of crop diversification as a means of
mitigating climate risks may be limited where the
risks affect equally different varieties of crops
(Barrett, Reardon, and Webb, 2001). However,
crop diversification may still be an option, where
farm conditions are neither so marginal that they
limit diversification nor sufficiently optimal for a
single high-return crop (Kandulu et al., 2012).

By ensuring predictabilit y and reg ularit y, social
protection instruments enable households to
better manage risks and engage in more
profitable livelihood and agricultural activities.
When directed towards women, they are not only
empowering, but improve households’ overall
welfare thanks to women’s priorities of food and
nutrition securit y and children’s wellbeing. Social
protection programmes also have an important
impact on the agricultural investment decisions
of rural households and thus have a longer-term
positive impact on access to food (FAO, 2015c).

Faced with climate variabilit y, farm households
engage in different diversification strategies,
depending on the nature of their exposure and
the performance of institutions. For instance,
when rainfall is more variable, farmers seek
alternative sources of income and employment in
Malawi, but diversif y into livestock in Zambia
(Box 12). Where weather risks are high, many
households in sub-Saharan Africa favour mixed
livestock-crop systems, using their livestock as
an asset to smooth income f luctuations (Herrero
et al., 2010 and 2013; Baudron et al., 2013). Mixed

In Zambia, households in areas that experienced
lower than average rainfall had lower levels of
daily caloric intake as well as lower food and
non-food expenditures. This effect was most
pronounced in the poorest households. Thanks to
a cash transfer programme aimed at 20 000 ultrapoor households, they suffered much less from
weather shocks. However, while participation in »

CLIMATE RISK, DIVERSIFICATION
AND SMALL FARMER WELFARE IN
MALAWI AND ZAMBIA
diversification shows no clear pattern correlated with
weather variables.
In general, access to extension led to greater crop,
labour and income diversification in both countries.
Households that received fertilizer subsidies in Malawi
were more likely to have diversified crops and
incomes, while in Zambia such households had lower
levels of income diversification. This underlines the
importance, when designing policies for
diversification, of understanding how local institutions
interact with incentives to diversify.
With the exception of crop diversification in Zambia,
each type of diversification is associated with higher
consumption or income per capita in both countries. In
Malawi, income diversification reduces the variability
in farm household consumption levels – an important
indicator of food security. In Zambia, households
engaging in any of the three types of diversification
were found to be less likely to fall below the poverty
line. The combined findings on diversification and
incomes suggest policy entry points to improve
institutions that facilitate the types of diversification
needed to build resilience to shocks.

Malawi and Zambia are among the 15 countries most
vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change
(Wheeler, 2011), particularly in agriculture. The sector
employs a significant share of the population, which
depends primarily on rainfed subsistence production
and is, therefore, vulnerable to various shocks.
To what degree is diversification an effective climate
change adaptation strategy for these countries? Recent
FAO studies document various types of diversification
in the farm sector – diversification into different crops,
livestock, and natural resource- related activities or
working on other farms – as well as in the non-farm
sector, through activities such as wage employment,
self-employment, transfers and rents.
The studies found that rates of crop, labour and
income diversification in Malawi, and livestock
diversification in Zambia, are higher where climate
variability is greater, indicating that exposure to
climate risk induces different types of diversification. In
Zambia (see Figure), patterns of diversification vary:
households diversify their crops more in areas with
higher long-term average seasonal rainfall; livestock
diversification is higher in areas where the long-term
variation in rainfall is higher; and income

» the cash grants programme helped mitigate the

climate-smart agriculture, and generating “green
jobs” in areas such as waste management,
reforestation and soil conser vation (Asfaw and
Lipper, 2016). Index-based insurance, which pays
out benefits on the basis of indices such as
rainfall, area-average yields and vegetation
conditions measured by satellites, is being tested
as a risk-mitigation tool in several countries.
When an index exceeds a predetermined
threshold, farmers receive a quick pay-out,
delivered in some cases via mobile phones.
However, index-based insurance by itself does
not provide a full solution to climate-related
risk. For example, India’s Weather-Based Crop
Insurance Scheme may have prompted a shift
among participants towards more profitable but
higher risk farm production systems, thanks to
subsidized premiums (Cole et al., 2013). Uptake
of index-based insurance has been generally
limited because it usually involves high
transaction costs. Another problem is a lack of
trust in insurance institutions.

negative effects of climate shocks on food
securit y, it was not sufficient to fully overcome
them. It is important to ensure, therefore, that
social protection programmes are aligned with
other forms of climate risk management,
including disaster risk reduction (Asfaw et al.,
2016b).
Existing social protection programmes rarely take
climate risk into account. In order to fill this gap,
several humanitarian and development
stakeholders, including FAO, are helping national
governments set up risk-informed and shockresponsive social protection systems, which
provide support ahead of a crisis, based on
economic and climate risk-related criteria (UNEP,
2016; Winder Rossi et al., 2016). If effectively
linked to early warning systems and informed by
agricultural, food securit y and nutritional
parameters, social protection systems can also be
used to plan a timely response to emergencies
(FAO, 2016a).

Better information about weather conditions would
help small-scale producers to adapt to
foreseeable variations in climate by, for example,
adjusting planting dates or timely sheltering of
livestock. Sur veys have found that farmers in
Eastern and Southern Africa who were able to
access seasonal forecasts changed at least some
management decisions, which helped them to
reduce har vest losses (O’Brien et al., 2000;
Ng ugi, Mureithi and Kamande, 2011; Phillips,
Makaudze, and Unganai, 2001, 2002; Klopper
and Bartman, 2003; Mudombi and Nhamo, 2014).
Access to climate-forecast information helped
farmers in Kenya to avoid losses equivalent to as
much as a quarter of their average net income
(Erickson et al., 2011). Farmers with access to
information and communications technolog y
tend to routinely use available climate
information (Ramussen et al., 2014). Investing in
institutions that share seasonal forecasts, a key
area of climate information, can increase
farmers’ capacit y to reduce their exposure to
risks (Hansen et al., 2011). Likewise, for disaster
relief agencies, overcoming institutional barriers
to the use of seasonal forecasts has proved
critical to saving lives during climate crises (Tall
et al., 2012).

Implementation of the approach outlined above is
achieved through the scaling-up of inter ventions
that provide cash and short-cycle productive
assets, accompanied by technical training. Where
markets function and currency is stable, cash
transfers have the advantages of costeffectiveness, impact and f lexibilit y, and give
beneficiar y households greater choice.
Nevertheless, in 2015, cash transfers and
vouchers accounted for only 6 percent of
humanitarian aid (ODI, 2015). Enhancing the
potential of cash-based inter ventions requires
integrating cash in preparedness and contingency
planning, strengthening partnerships with the
private sector, using e-payments and digital
transfers, and – when possible – leveraging cash
transfers to build medium and long-term social
assistance structures that can be used in
recurrent emergencies.
Entr y points and operational linkages between
social protection and climate change policies are
multiple. Public works programmes, including
productive safet y nets, can be designed to
simultaneously contribute to increasing
household incomes, engaging communities in

Reducing gender inequalities

people to migrate. As land is farmed more
intensively, soil degradation increases,
production declines, and incomes fall. Likewise,
water scarcit y caused by prolonged drought and
conf licts over water use may induce poorer
farmers to abandon the land. Temporar y, seasonal
and permanent migration can be a form of
livelihood diversification, which provides
significant benefits to many rural households. It
is a key source of income diversification that
boosts household resilience and provides the
means for productivit y-enhancing investments.
On the downside, migrants often face multiple
hardships, risks and dangers.

Because men and women have different priorities
and capacities in responding to climate change,
policy-makers and institutions need to explicitly
recognize gender differentials in designing
interventions that strengthen the resilience of
rural livelihoods (Acosta et al., 2015; Gumucio and
Tafur-Rueda, 2015). Social norms often impose
agricultural responsibilities and limit women’s
choices, which determine the type of information
they need and the information channels they can
access (Archer and Yamashita, 2003; McOmber et
al., 2013; Jost et al., 2015). For example,
information about the timing of rainfall onset is
important for male farmers in Senegal because
men have priority access to animals for field
preparation; women lack the capacity to act on the
information, and prefer forecasts of rainfall
cessation and dry periods (Tall et al., 2014).

One study projects that hundreds of millions of
people might need to f lee their homes as a result
of climatic and environmental pressures between
now and 2050 (IIED, 2010). Such forecasts have
helped to place migration as an issue to be
addressed in climate change adaptation. In their
adaptation strategies, governments tend to take
one of two approaches (KNOM AD, 2014). The
first, and most common, sees adaptation as a way
of reducing migration pressures and allowing
people to remain where they are by improving
agricultural practices and infrastructure. In the
second view, migration is itself an adaptation
strateg y, which alleviates population pressure on
fragile areas. Of particular interest to
development policy-makers is the potential of
migrants already living outside of v ulnerable
areas to help their home communities adapt and
respond to climate change.

The Kenya Agricultural Carbon Project,
implemented by Vi Agroforestr y and the World
Bank, highlights several strategies that address
gender disparities in land and tree tenure, labour,
knowledge, benefit sharing, participation and
leadership. Examples include: contracts signed by
groups, including women even though they do
not own land; investments in training designed
to reach women (e.g. hiring female communit y
facilitators); the provision of seedlings of tree
species usually desired by women (e.g. species
that provide fuelwood, fodder, shade and fruit);
rotating leadership systems and rules; and
improvements in women’s access to loans and
insurance ( World Bank, 2010a; Vi Agroforestr y
2015; Shames et al., 2012). A participator y project
in the water-stressed Kumbharwadi communit y,
in Maharashtra state, India, reduced the amount
of time women spent collecting drinking water
and fuelwood by installing sources for both
nearer to their homes, and helped to increase
women’s participation in village decision-making
processes. The project resulted in an increase in
the incomes of poor households (Gray and
Srinidhi, 2013; World Bank, FAO and IFAD, 2015).

Social protection and active labour market
policies can play important roles in mitigating
many of the risks associated with migration.
Better qualit y education and training would
enhance the employment prospects of rural
people who decide to migrate, especially youth,
and of those who seek more skill-intensive
employment in sustainable agriculture. Provision
of suitable transport and communications
infrastructure, either directly by the public sector
or by promoting private investment, will be
important in bringing down the costs associated
with both travel and sending remittances, as well
as facilitating f lows of information on
employment and business opportunities. n

CHAPTER 3 ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN SMALLHOLDER AGRICULTURE

HOW MUCH WILL
ADAPTATION COST?

A case study for Viet Nam likewise shows that
the economic costs of climate change are likely to
be far higher than the costs of adaptation ( World
Bank, 2010c). Although adaptation will not
prevent economic losses as a result of climate
change, it will significantly reduce their
magnitude. Without adaptation, agricultural
losses due to climate change are estimated at
about US$2 billion per year. Even with
adaptation, some losses are likely, but they will
be limited to about US$500 million, thus
reducing total losses by about US$1.5 billion
dollars annually. Adaptation would include
farmers’ own adaptation strategies, such as
changing planting dates and using droughttolerant or salinit y-resistant varieties, as well as
government inter ventions, including investments
in irrigation and increased spending on
agricultural research and development. The costs
of adaptation, estimated at about US$160 million
annually over the period 2010 –2050, would be a
fraction of the savings from adaptation.

How much will it actually cost to build the
capacit y of smallholder producers to adapt to
climate change? That question arises often,
particularly in the context of developing new
sources of climate finance. A review of literature
on the costs and benefits (to the entire economy)
of adaptation to climate change identified more
than 500 papers on the topic ( Watkiss, 2015).
Estimates var y for many reasons, including
differences in regional coverage, climate change
scenarios, methods and models, as well as in the
time period, adaptation measures and sectors
that were considered. Various global studies
suggest that the costs of inaction far outweigh
the costs of adaptation to climate change (Stern,
2007; OECD, 2012; Stern 2014; OECD, 2015).
Some countr y-level analyses provide estimates of
the costs of inaction side by side with costs of
adaptation. Here we consider two such studies in
developing countries, where a large share of
farmers are smallholders, as well as a study
initiated by FAO focusing specifically on
smallholders in four countries (Box 13).

In short, while few systematic studies are as yet
available on the cost of climate change
adaptation in smallholder agriculture, the
available evidence points to overwhelmingly
positive benefit-cost balances. This is especially
so when taken as the difference between the cost
of non-action and the benefits of action, but also
when weighing the cost of investments in
climate-smart agricultural practices and the
gains in terms of yield increases, livelihood
improvements and reductions in the number of
food insecure. The main issue, therefore, is how
to manage the transition to sustainable
agriculture and minimize the transaction costs
for smallholder systems. n

A study from Uganda estimates the economic
impacts of climate change on agriculture, water,
energ y and infrastructure as ranging from a
cumulative US$273 billion to US$437 billion
between 2010 and 2050, depending on
assumptions about socio-economic development
and the severit y of climate change (Markandya,
Cabot-Venton and Beucher, 2015). Considering
solely the agriculture sector, the costs of
inaction, in terms of reduced crop and livestock
production as well as reductions in exports,
amount to between US$22 billion and
US$38 billion in the same period. While the
budget for adaptation, including more efficient
irrigation systems, improved crop varieties, more
adapted and productive livestock breeds, and
credit facilities, could reach almost
US$644 million annually by 2025, the cost of
inaction would be up to 46 times higher.

BENEFITS AND COSTS OF INVESTING
IN SMALL FARMER ADAPTATION
(54 percent)*. However, projected levels of
adoption, while relatively high, are unlikely in most
cases to be sufficient to fully counterbalance
climate change impacts on smallholders. This
suggests that CSA practices alone will not be
enough to achieve the transformational changes
needed, without higher levels of investment in
building enabling environments and in promoting
technologies with high adaptation potential.
The study also looked into the costs and benefits of
adaptation through investments in improved seed
suited to projected changes in local conditions. In
the absence of adaptation, the cost of climate
change to smallholders is substantial under a
scenario of severe climate change (Table A).
Through the adoption of drought-resistant seed,
and based on conservative yield assumptions, the
losses due to climate change are reduced by
between 34 percent and 51 percent, depending on
the country. The net present value (NPV) of
investments in improved seed adoption was
estimated to range from an average of US$203
per ha in Malawi to US$766 per ha on rainfed
land in India.

Changes in agricultural practices will be an
important means of building resilience and
improving carbon and nitrogen management in
smallholder production systems. However, the rates
of adoption of these practices among farmers are
fairly low.
The question is: how much will it cost to boost
adoption rates to the level required to abate the
negative effects of climate change? A modelling
study that considers farmers’ cropping decisions
under climate change, combined with empirical
estimates from household surveys in four countries,
provides insights that help to answer this question
(Cacho et al., 2016). The study includes model
results from four areas in four countries that are
highly vulnerable to climate change impacts on
agriculture: Bangladesh, India, Malawi and the
United Republic of Tanzania.
The study projected the expected rates of adoption
in 2050 of climate-smart agriculture, based on
empirical evidence on adoption rates. The highest
adoption rate is projected to be in Malawi with 96
percent, followed by United Republic of Tanzania
(64 percent), India (62 percent) and Bangladesh

and seed purchase and distribution costs, plus administration costs, divided by the total area covered by the policy. The net benefit over a period of 30
years is estimated, subtracting the costs of implementation of the policy.

benefits of irrigation under climate change were
estimated at US$226 per ha in Bangladesh and

Benefits were calculated as the value of avoided
damage per hectare, based on smallholders’ crop
revenues. The per hectare costs of irrigation
improvements are lower for producers in smallscale systems, and consequently the benefit-cost
ratios are considerably higher, which further
supports the argument that investments made now
in effective adaptation will provide high returns to
smallholder agriculture.

The results suggest that well-designed, targeted
adaptation initiatives can generate high returns to
smallholders under the projected effects of climate
change. In the case of improved seed, this requires
interventions in the whole supply chain – from ensuring
that sufficient quantities of seed are produced, to
supporting the development of local enterprises
needed to market inputs and buy outputs. Establishing
systems that reduce the transaction costs of smallholder
access to seed supply is also an important aspect of
effective policies.
The analysis also looked at benefit-cost ratios of two
other important climate adaptation measures:

its three objectives of sustainably increasing
productivity, increasing adaptive capacity and
resilience to shocks, and reducing greenhouse
gas emissions. This is particularly important
when considering options for transforming
smallholder agriculture for poverty reduction
under climate change. The debate around
possible trade-offs between mitigation and food
security has been heated, owing to concerns
that smallholder producers in developing
countries might be forced to bear the costs of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to
mitigate a climate change problem not of their
making and from which they stand to suffer
most (Lipper et al., 2015).

site-specific evidence base. First, a proper
assessment of the barriers smallholders face in
transitioning to climate-smart, sustainable
agricultural systems is undertaken (Box 14).
The initial assessment is then the subject of
dialog ue among all stakeholders to decide
what changes in policies and incentive
structures are needed in order to create
enabling conditions for the transition.

The costs that agricultural producers face – and
therefore also the trade-offs – are inf luenced
by the policy and institutional environment.
An important step in the transition to climatesmart agriculture, therefore, is assessing the
need to modif y existing policy measures, such
as input subsidies, and the potential of social
protection programmes to address risks
imposed by climate change. For example,
subsidies on mineral fertilizer generally do not
provide incentives to use fertilizer efficiently;
in fact, they may produce quite the opposite
effect. Likewise, integrating exposure to
climate risks as part of the targeting
methodolog y for social protection programmes
is a relatively easily implemented institutional
shift in the direction of climate-smart
agriculture. Re-orienting agricultural research
to integrate climate change adaptation and
mitigation is another important component of
an enabling environment (Box 15).

Explicit recognition of the costs of making
changes is needed in order to adequately
identif y where trade-offs are possible. For
example, the improvement of soil carbon stocks
through improved land management and
restoration carries investment costs in the form
of fencing, seed and machiner y, opportunit y
costs in the form of lost production, and
operating costs in the form of annual labour
inputs needed to maintain and enhance soil
carbon. The costs of adopting practices that
increase soil carbon can be quite significant for
smallholders, particularly in the initial and
transition phases. They can also outweigh the
benefits to the farmers themselves, while
generating benefits to others, by improving
landscape and watershed functions.

The financing challenge
The sustainabilit y of smallholder food
production systems will depend upon the
abilit y of smallholders to adopt climate-smart
practices and technologies. To accomplish this
goal, additional financial investments are
needed. However, accessing finance for the
agriculture sectors – let alone for climatesmart agriculture – is a challenge in many
developing countries and has been for decades.
Traditionally, agriculture’s share in the
portfolios of financial institutions has been
small, and especially so when compared to
agriculture’s contribution to GDP. Because the
agriculture sector is considered low-profit and
high-risk, sources of finance in most countries
limit their exposure, tighten lending criteria
and impose onerous lending conditions. They
often shy away from agriculture altogether,
preferring to seek more stable returns from
other sectors of the economy. The resulting
shortfall in finance severely impacts
agriculture, especially farmers and small and
medium-sized agribusinesses.

Table 10 provides an example of these costs,
indicating the number of years before a
positive return could be obtained by yak
herders in Qinghai Province, China, if they
invested in restoring their highly degraded
grazing lands. The smallest producers have the
smallest returns in terms of the net present
value (NPV ) 6 per hectare of investment. They
also face the longest wait for positive returns –
it would take 10 years for their investment in
restoration of degraded grazing lands to yield
the same level of income they make with the
current degraded system. While the restoration
of highly degraded lands is considerably more
expensive, the costs associated with the
adoption of improved land management
practices on good soils also represents a
significant trade-off for farmers (FAO, 2009).

FACTORS THAT HINDER ADAPTIVE
CAPACITY
improved agroforestry practices are distance to
markets, membership of farmer groups and other
social capital, and tenure security. For adoption of
improved agronomic practices, the main barriers
were related to information access, followed by
tenure security, resource endowments and exposure
to risks and shocks. The analysis also indicated a
need for specifically targeting those with lower
endowments, especially women farmers and femaleheaded households, as they typically have much
more limited access to information and
technologies. Male-headed farm households were
far more likely to adopt improved agroforestry or
agronomic practices.

Insights into barriers smallholder farmers face in
making the types of incremental changes needed for
climate change adaptation are highlighted in a
recent meta-analysis of the determinants of improved
technology adoption in Africa (Arslan et al.,
2016a). The dataset is built on information from
some 150 published papers and includes 87
improved practices in agroforestry, agronomy and
livestock production.
The most prominent barriers to adoption of
agroforestry are access to information, primarily
from extension services, which is significant in
around 40 percent of the studies where it is
included. Other top determinants of adoption of

RE-ORIENTING RESEARCH FOR CLIMATE CHALLENGE
be paid to developing heat- and drought-tolerant
varieties, not only for tropical countries, but also for
temperate countries with already high temperatures
during their growing seasons. Some developed
countries, for example, are projected to experience
significant maize yield declines under climate change.
While developed countries generally have greater
capacity in both public and private sectors to develop
new varieties, poorer countries are dependent upon
the CGIAR and national agricultural research institutes
to develop high-yielding, climate-smart varieties. This
implies a need for increased and sustained investment
in these institutions.

Most crop research has focused on annual crops
rather than perennials. As the impacts of climate
change on agricultural productivity and production
potential are felt, research must take a far broader,
integrated approach, one that incorporates perennial
crops, livestock and aquaculture, and has a better
understanding of the implications of climate change
for pests and diseases.
The development of new varieties and supporting
technologies is especially urgent, owing to the lag –
typically more than a decade – between initial
research on a new variety and its release to producers
(Challinor et al., 2016). Particular attention needs to

Being highly disaggregated and located in areas
far from urban centres, smallholders are
difficult for lenders to even reach. Their
isolation results in transaction costs that are
sometimes greater than the size of the loan that
farmers require. Access to finance is particularly
difficult for women, owing to socio-economic,
political and legal barriers.
| 65 |

CHAPTER 3 ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN SMALLHOLDER AGRICULTURE

As a result, the vast majorit y of farmers in
developing countries are effectively
disenfranchised from the financial system and
denied opportunities for economic growth. By
one estimate, the total smallholder financing
needs in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa
and South and Southeast Asia are some
US$210 billion per year (Rural and Agricultural
Finance Learning Lab., 2016). Moreover, this
financing gap is likely to substantially widen
in the future, owing to the need for longerterm loans to fund climate change adaptation
and mitigation activities.
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
also face challenges in accessing finance, in
particular longer-term loans. SMEs are critical

for agricultural development, as they play a
major role in increasing smallholder income and
productivit y and improving the efficiency of
value chains, which generate rural jobs. When
SMEs lack the finance to grow to their full
potential, they generate fewer jobs and employ
fewer workers. The gap in financing for
agricultural SMEs thus exacerbates
unemployment and povert y in rural areas across
the globe. Many SMEs require funds that are
too large to be met by microfinance institutions,
but not large enough – and perceived as too
risky – to secure commercial loans. This is
especially problematic when producers and
enterprises wish to invest in value-adding
infrastructure that could significantly raise their
productivit y and incomes. n

CONCLUSIONS
This chapter has explored the v ulnerabilit y of
smallholder farming systems to climate change
risks, and examined entr y points to addressing
those v ulnerabilities. Several key elements
emerge from the analyses undertaken by FAO
and from the literature. First, although climate
change is a “catch-all” term, its manifestations
will be complex and diverse. The binding
constraints in terms of productivit y var y
considerably between farming systems and
regions. Furthermore, there is no knowing
whether average values, variabilit y or extremes in
rainfall or temperature will have the greatest
impact on yields. As the world’s climate changes,
some of these impacts will be direct and others
indirect through, for example, the propagation of
pests and diseases. Understanding the key
weather constraints and how they are affected by
climate change is an important first step in
determining the t ype of support that smallholder
farmers will need. Much remains to be done in
terms of improving our understanding and
communicating it appropriately to stakeholders.
The second important point that emerges from this
chapter is that sustainable intensification,

improved agricultural technologies and
diversification can abate the impacts of climate
change, and even reduce considerably the number
of people at risk of hunger. However, the
widespread adoption of improved technologies
may face policy and institutional constraints,
which will need to be overcome. Diversification is
typically adopted, and found to be more effective,
in areas where weather variability is greater, as
reported in case studies for Malawi and Zambia.
This underscores the importance of addressing
specific constraints, as opposed to imposing
blanket policies across agro-ecological regions and
farming systems.
The third point is that adaptation makes
economic sense: the benefits outweigh costs by
t y pically large margins. But that fact alone will
not make adaptation happen. It is particularly
difficult for smallholders to overcome barriers to
adoption of new technologies and practices
because of the challenges they face in accessing
finance. The same applies to small and mediumsized enterprises that generate income for
smallholders and rural jobs that allow for offfarm income diversification.

THE AGRICULTURE SECTORS FACE A UNIQUE CHALLENGE:
to produce more food while reducing greenhouse gas
emissions caused by food production.

AGRICULTURE COULD REDUCE ITS EMISSION INTENSITY,
but not enough to counterbalance projected increases in its
total emissions.

ADDRESSING EMISSIONS FROM LAND USE CHANGE DRIVEN BY
AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION IS ESSENTIAL, but sustainable
agricultural development will determine its success.

ALTHOUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN CARBON AND NITROGEN
MANAGEMENT ALSO REDUCE EMISSIONS, they are likely to be
driven by adaptation and food security objectives, rather
than mitigation goals.

REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM AGRICULTURE also hinges on
action to minimize food losses and waste and to promote
sustainable diets.

FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
SYSTEMS IN CLIMATE
CHANGE MITIGATION
Having examined in Chapter 3 measures that
build the resilience of smallholders and
v ulnerable rural populations to climate change,
we take a broader view of agriculture and food
systems in order to assess their potential
contribution to climate change mitigation. The
agriculture sectors will be called upon to play
their part in mitigation, because they will
generate an increasingly large share of what will
become, hopefully, declining levels of global
emissions, and because they can, under certain
conditions, sequester carbon dioxide.

them. This understanding will permit a fuller
appreciation of the difficulties inherent in
reducing agricultural emissions, which involve
complex biophysical processes and are more
difficult to monitor and control than emissions
from most other anthropogenic sources of
greenhouse gases. Improving the efficiency with
which natural resources are used in agriculture
will be a central element of mitigation strategies.
It is important to recall that in the agriculture
sectors it is impossible to separate the objectives of
food security, adaptation and mitigation, because
there are synergies and trade-offs among them.
Growing experience has shown that integrated
packages of technologies and practices, tailored to
the specific agroecological conditions of
producers, are required to deliver mitigation and
adaptation in a cost-effective manner. n

Agricultural emissions are expected to grow
along with food demand, which is being driven
by population and income growth and associated
changes in diets towards more animal-source
products. Agriculture can contribute to
mitigation by decoupling its production increases
from its emissions increases through reductions
in emission intensit y, which is the quantit y of
GHGs generated per unit of output. This, in turn,
can be complemented by actions that reduce food
losses and waste and foster changes in food
consumption patterns.

THE TECHNICAL
POTENTIAL FOR
MITIGATION WITH
ADAPTATION

The agriculture sectors, particularly forestry, have
a unique potential to act as carbon sinks by
absorbing CO 2 and sequestering carbon in biomass
and soil. At present, however, deforestation is a
major source of emissions, and unsustainable
farming practices continue to deplete the Earth’s
stock of soil organic carbon. Tapping into the
carbon sequestration potential of forests and
agricultural lands will depend on biophysical
conditions, technical options and policies.

Agriculture, forestr y and land use (A FOLU) are
responsible for about 21 percent of total
greenhouse gas emissions. All carbon dioxide
emissions from A FOLU are attributable to
forestr y and land use change, such as
conversion of forests to pasture or crop
production. The bulk of emissions of methane
and nitrous oxide are attributable to agricultural
practices (Table 5). Improved management of
carbon and nitrogen in agriculture, therefore,
will be crucial to its contribution to climate
change mitigation (Box 16).
»

Since agricultural emissions, as well as sinks, are
part of the global carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)
cycles, optimizing agriculture’s mitigation
potential requires first an understanding of these
cycles and how agricultural activities interact with

CARBON AND NITROGEN
IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTORS
global carbon is stored in aquatic systems.
Furthermore, around 25 percent of annual
GHG emissions are sequestered in aquatic
environments, primarily mangroves,
seagrasses, floodplain forests and coastal
sediments (Nellemann, Hain and Alder,
2008; Khatiwala et al., 2013). Aquatic
systems could, therefore, contribute
considerably to climate change mitigation.
Nitrogen is a major component of amino
acids, the building blocks of plant growth.
The use in agriculture of nitrogen, in plantuseable forms, has increased rapidly with
the growing demand for food. In 2005,
farmers applied to crops an estimated 230
million tonnes of nitrogen in the form of
mineral fertilizer and manure. Global
leakages of nitrous oxide into the
environment may have already exceeded
biophysical thresholds, or planetary
boundaries (Rockström et al., 2009; Steffen
et al., 2015).

The terms carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle
are used to describe the flow of those two
chemical elements, in various forms, through
the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, terrestrial
biosphere and lithosphere.
It is estimated that up to 80 percent of the
total organic carbon in the terrestrial
biosphere, excluding fossil fuels, is stored in
soils, while about 20 percent is stored
in vegetation.
Plant growth produces an estimated 54 Gt of
carbon (or GtC), a year. The human
appropriation of this net primary production
– i.e. the quantity of carbon in biomass that
is harvested, grazed, burned or lost as a
result of human-induced land-use change –
has been estimated in the range of 15–20
GtC a year (Running, 2012; Krausmann et
al., 2013).
Oceans and coastal margins play a
significant role in the carbon cycle. It is
estimated that more than 90 percent of

CHAPTER 4 FOOD AND AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS IN CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION

Soil carbon sequestration
to offset emissions

needs to be promoted as a system, with a range of
functions that provide multiple ecosystem
ser vices (FAO and ITPS, 2015). The technical
potential for SOC sequestration appears to be in
a range of 0.37 to 1.15 GtC per year (Sommer and
Bossio, 2014; Smith et al., 2008; Paustian et al.,
2004). Those are technical potentials and it is
implicitly assumed that all agricultural land
would be managed to sequester carbon. However,
soil C sequestration rates on land in agricultural
use var y in the order of 0.1 to 1 tC per hectare per
year (Paustian et al., 2016). Therefore, billions of
hectares would have to be managed to sequester
carbon optimally in order to reach an annual
sequestration rate of 1 GtC. Furthermore, levels
of sequestration would be relatively low at first,
would peak after 20 years, and would then slowly
decline (Sommer and Bossio, 2014).

There is great concern about the magnitude of
past and present losses of carbon as a result of
human activit y. Estimates of losses over the
past 150 to 300 years from land use and landuse change, mainly the conversion of forests to
agricultural land, range between 100 and
200 billion tonnes (Houghton, 2012). The
importance of soils as a terrestrial reg ulator of
the C and N cycles is increasingly recognized,
especially following the new climate regime
established by the Paris Agreement of
December 2015, which calls for action to
conser ve and enhance sinks and reser voirs of
greenhouse gases.
Soils represent the Earth’s second largest carbon
pool, after oceans, and small changes in the
stock of soil organic carbon may result in large
changes in levels of atmospheric CO 2 (Chappell,
Baldock and Sanderman, 2016). Up to one metre
in depth, the world’s soils – excluding
permafrost – contain a total of about 500±230 Gt
of carbon (GtC), equivalent to twice the amount
of carbon as CO 2 in the atmosphere
(Scharlemann et al., 2014). Soils carr y a large
potential for carbon sequestration, and this is
especially so for degraded soils through
restoration measures (Lal, 2010).

Reducing emissions in
livestock supply chains
There is also great potential to reduce the
livestock sector’s GHG emission intensit y. The
precise potential is difficult to estimate as
emission intensities var y greatly even within
similar production systems, owing to differences
in agro-ecological conditions, farming practices
and supply chain management. Gerber et al.
(2013a) estimate that emissions generated by
livestock production could be reduced by
between 18 and 30 percent if, in each system, the
practices used by the 25 percent of producers
with the lowest GHG emission intensit y were
widely adopted.

The capacit y of soil to sequester carbon can be
maintained and improved through farming
practices that also restore soil health and fertilit y
for agricultural production. Promoting
sustainable soil management provides, therefore,
multiple benefits: increasing productivit y,
fostering climate change adaptation,
sequestering carbon and reducing emissions of
GHG (FAO and ITPS, 2015). While the role of
soils as potential sinks and reser voirs is
recognized, knowledge of current soil carbon
stocks and the soil’s real sequestration potential
is still limited, owing to a lack of adequate
information and monitoring systems.

Based on six regional case studies and using a
lifecycle assessment model, Mottet et al. (2016)
estimate that sustainable practices would lead to
reductions of between 14 and 41 percent in
livestock GHG emissions. In five of the case
studies, mitigation resulted in increased
production as well as reduced emissions, a
double-win for food securit y and climate change
mitigation. Comparably high mitigation potential
has been found for ruminant and pig production
systems in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Significant emission reductions in countries of

the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) can also be attained in
dair y systems with already high levels of
productivit y (Gerber et al., 2013b).

Sustainable nitrogen management in agriculture
aims at simultaneously achieving agronomic
objectives, such as high crop and animal
productivit y, and the environmental objectives of
minimizing N losses. Because the nitrogen cycle
is ver y “leaky”, its management is not easy.
Under conditions of climate change and
adaptation, it is even more complex because of its
close interactions with the carbon and water
cycles – utilization and losses of nitrogen in
agriculture are strongly inf luenced by water and
carbon availabilit y.

The practices with highest technical potential
for reducing enteric methane emissions and for
sequestering soil carbon in grazing lands could
reduce GHG emissions by an amount equal to
11 percent of annual global ruminant
emissions. In a modelling study by Henderson
et al. (2015), improved grazing management
and the sowing of leg umes were the most
affordable practices – and, therefore, had the
greatest economic potential. Grazing
management was particularly effective in Latin
America and sub-Saharan Africa, while sowing
leg umes appeared to work best in Western
Europe. Urea treatment of straw tended to be
an economically less attractive option at low
carbon price levels, but ver y cost-effective at a
high carbon price of US$100 per tonne of
carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2-eq).

The potential for reductions in nitrous oxide
emissions in the global food system by 2030 and
by 2050, through the use of improved practices, is
illustrated by Table 11. Estimates are based on the
potential for increasing N-use efficiency and/or
lowering emission intensit y (Oenema et al., 2014).
Assumptions, based on a literature review and
expert views, include improvements in crop and
animal production, manure management and
food utilization, and lower levels of animal
protein in diets. In the results of five scenarios
analysed, effects include both direct and indirect
N 2 O emissions. (For comparison purposes, the
global warming potential of 1 million tonnes of
N 2 O is equivalent to 265 million tonnes of
carbon dioxide.)

Mitigating nitrous oxide
emissions
Together with water, nitrogen is the most
important determinant of crop yields (Mueller et
al., 2012). Nearly 50 percent of world food
production depends on nitrogen fertilizer, while
the other 50 percent depends on nitrogen found
in soil, animal manure, the tissues of nitrogenfixing plants, crop residues, wastes and compost
(Erisman et al., 2008). Nitrogen is easily lost from
agriculture to the environment, through
volatilization and leaching, causing
environmental damage which has been estimated
at about equal to the monetar y benefits of using
nitrogen fertilizer in food production (Sutton et
al., 2011). Emissions of nitrous oxide from applied
fertilizer have direct negative impacts: N 2 O is the
third most important greenhouse gas and the
most significant cause of ozone depletion in the
stratosphere. At the same time, thanks to its key
role in photosynthesis and biomass production,
nitrogen inf luences positively the biospheric
carbon dioxide sink and carbon sequestration.

In the business-as-usual scenario, annual nitrous
oxide emissions from agriculture increase from
an estimated 4.1 million tonnes in 2010 to
6.4 million tonnes in 2030, and 7.5 million tonnes
in 2050. Reduction strategies could potentially
hold emissions at 4.1 million tonnes in 2030 and
cut them to 3.3 million tonnes by 2050.
Improvements in crop production, notably
fertilizer use, appear to have the greatest
potential. However, offsetting the projected
increases in emissions under the business-asusual scenario for the year 2030 would require
the adoption of all five of the emission reduction
strategies presented in Table 11, including
behavioural changes such as reducing animal
protein in diets, making the reduction estimates
uncertain. The strategies appear to be technically
feasible, but there are many hurdles on the road
to implementation. Large investments in
education, training, demonstration and the

synergies between climate change adaptation and
mitigation, as well as significant socio-economic
and environmental co-benefits. For example,
increasing carbon and nitrogen efficiency in food
systems reduces GHG emissions and increases
carbon sequestration while, at the same time,
improving food securit y and increasing resilience
to climate change and climate shocks. More
efficient production systems make fewer demands

will be needed to achieve the projected N 2 O
emission reductions.
Achieving reductions in nitrous oxide emissions
will depend on management practices that
address their underlying root causes. The
biophysical processes linked to emissions var y
according to climatic and agroecological
conditions and farming systems. Nuclear and
isotopic techniques can help to understand these
processes better, and to improve the monitoring
of nitrous oxide emissions (Box 17). n

By helping to reduce yield gaps and increase
biological efficiencies, especially in developing
countries, the sustainable intensification of
agriculture would prevent deforestation and the
further expansion of agriculture into carbonrich ecosystems, thus simultaneously enhancing
food securit y and contributing to climate
change mitigation. In the livestock sector,
improving pasture productivit y can limit the
expansion of pasture into tropical forests and
enhance the conser vation and sustainable
development of carbon rich landscapes (De
Oliveira-Silva et al., 2016).

MITIGATION AND
ADAPTATION
CO-BENEFITS THAT
ENHANCE FOOD
SECURITY
Better management of the carbon and nitrogen
cycles is central to both the mitigation of net
GHG emissions from the agriculture, forestr y and
land use sector and to increasing the efficiency of
the global food system. Since mitigation and
adaptation measures both contribute to food
securit y and environmental sustainabilit y, they
can be implemented jointly and at the same time
when there is potential for establishing strong
synergies between them. Improving efficiency in
the carbon and nitrogen cycles can strengthen
resilience to climatic variabilit y, reduce GHG
emissions and contribute to food securit y
through higher food output. The key to reaching
these objectives is sustainable intensification (see
Chapter 3), which seeks to increase food
production per unit of input in ways that reduce
both pressure on the environment and GHG
emissions, without compromising the abilit y of
future generations to meet their own needs
(Garnett et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013).

The following section outlines two
complementar y goals that should be
considered in policies aimed at capturing
adaptation and mitigation co-benefits:
improving production efficiency and
minimizing GHG emissions in food systems,
and conser ving and developing carbon-rich
landscapes in agriculture and forestr y.

Higher production efficiency,
lower emission intensity
Investing in yield improvements
Since the 1960s, the intensification of crop and
livestock systems has limited the expansion of
farmland and improved the efficiency of food
supply chains (Tilman et al., 2011; Gerber et al.,
2013a; Herrero et al., 2013). Through higher
yields, agricultural intensification avoided GHG
emissions between 1961 and 2005 that are

BOX 17

NUCLEAR AND ISOTOPIC TECHNIQUES FOR MITIGATION
Nuclear techniques can help to identify soil and water
management factors that reduce the release of GHG
from soil and thus contribute to climate change
mitigation. For example, using a variety of isotopes,
scientists can determine the extent of carbon and
nitrogen accumulation and their interactions in soil
organic matter as a result of recently added organic
manure, crop residues or wastewater. The 15N stable
isotopic technique can help to identify the source of
nitrous oxide production from farmlands, which assists
in targeting appropriate N2O mitigation tools, such as

liming to modify the degree of soil acidity, or adding
nitrification inhibitors to nitrogen fertilizers to reduce
the conversion of excess N into nitrate, a mobile form,
which is readily converted into N2O under anaerobic
conditions. Isotopic and nuclear-based techniques used
by FAO jointly with the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) are at the forefront of innovative
practices to address the food needs of the future, as
well as contributing to a reduction in the impacts of
climate change.

agro-forestr y approaches.

productivit y compare favourably, therefore, with
other commonly proposed mitigation strategies
because they limit agricultural land expansion
and the large carbon losses associated with
deforestation (Burney, Davis and Lobell, 2010).

Reducing resource-use intensity in aquaculture
and fisheries

As agricultural and forestry efficiency have
improved over the past few decades, the GHG
emission intensity of many products has declined.
Between 1960 and 2000, global average intensities
fell by an estimated 38 percent for milk, 50 percent
for rice, 45 percent for pork, 76 percent for chicken
meat and 57 percent for eggs (Smith et al., 2014).
Much of the reduction in ruminant emission
intensity has been due to reduced output of
methane for a given amount of milk and meat
(Opio et al., 2013; and Box 18). In both ruminants
and monogastrics, improvements in feed
conversion efficiency and husbandry, and the
selection of highly efficient animal breeds, have
played key roles. Reducing the number of animals
required to produce a fixed level of output can
yield significant efficiency gains. For example, a
28 percent overall reduction in annual methane
emissions in the United Kingdom between 1990
and 1999 can be attributed largely to reductions in
cattle numbers and the increased productivity of
dairy cows (DEFR A, 2001). Strong disparities in
resource-use efficiency and GHG emission
intensity still exist between animal farming
systems and across regions (Herrero et al., 2013),
suggesting significant potential for gains.

The fisheries and aquaculture sector can
contribute to climate change mitigation by
increasing its sequestration of carbon and
reducing emissions from its value chain. It is of
primar y importance to halt habitat destruction
and inappropriate management practices in
fisheries and aquaculture, which disrupt the
carbon sequestration functions of aquatic
systems. There may be great scope for enhancing
sequestration through the rehabilitation of
mangroves and f loodplain forests, even if this
comes at an advanced cost for restoration.
In terms of GHG reduction, there is considerable
potential for lowering emissions by reducing fuel
and energ y use. This can be achieved either
directly – e.g. through more efficient fishing
methods or energ y use in processing – or
indirectly, through a variet y of actions, including
energ y savings along the supply and value chain
and strategic waste reduction. Across the sector,
the transition to more energ y-efficient
technologies is slow, although incentive
mechanisms associated with carbon markets have
shown some potential (FAO, 2013a).

As well as reducing yield gaps and increasing
herd productivit y, improved long-term, farmscale efficiency strategies would conser ve and
restore soils, water, biodiversit y and critical
ecosystem ser vices such as pollination (Garibaldi,
et al. 2016). For example, in both temperate and
tropical regions, farming system diversification
and crop-livestock-tree integration would
increase farm-scale efficiency and reduce GHG
emission intensit y (Soussana, Dumont and
Lecomte, 2015). A number of technologies can
help raise production efficiency and generate
co-benefits. They include the use of adapted
varieties that harness genetic resources and
advanced breeding, adjustments to planting dates
and cropping periods, precision farming,

Energ y use in processing, storage and transport
is the main source of GHG emissions in fisheries
and aquaculture. Processing ranges from simple
dr ying and smoking of fish in artisanal systems
to highly controlled seafood preparation using
high-specification packaging and labelling. There
are wide variations in emissions, depending on
local practices, inputs (species, sourcing, quantit y
and qualit y) and operating efficiency. As the most
widely traded global food products, aquatic foods
may travel considerable distances in a range of
forms and in various states of perishabilit y.
Greenhouse gas outputs are usually directly
related to fuel use in transport and to energ y use
in handling and storage. The most perishable

PRODUCTION
manure systems, which are found in parts of
Africa and Latin America. In liquid manure
systems, typical of Western Europe and North
America, methane emissions are high,
particularly when animals are confined.
Frequent removal of slurry from livestock
housing has thus been suggested as a way of
reducing methane emissions (Sommer et al.,
2009). Anaerobic digestion of manure has
large potential for reducing emissions and
substituting fossil fuel with renewable methane,
which can be used in heating and power
generation and as a vehicle fuel. However, the
unknown levels of methane leakage from
digesters and gas storage raises doubts about
the actual mitigation effect of this technology.
All options for the reduction of methane
emissions need to take into consideration the
entire production system, to avoid leakage from
one compartment to the next and increases in
nitrous oxide emissions.
Flooded rice. A range of traditional and
improved practices mitigate methane emissions
from rice paddies, including water, straw and
fertilizer management. Stopping flooding for a
few weeks saves water, as well as reducing
methane and GHG emissions by between 45
and 90 percent, without considering soil
carbon stock increases. However, this practice
can have negative impacts on yields, partly
through increased weed competition. Drying
early in the growing season, and then flooding,
reduces emissions by 45 percent and produces
yields similar to those of fully flooded rice
(Linquist et al., 2015).

Numerous studies have investigated potentials
for reducing methane emissions from livestock
and flooded rice systems.
Enteric fermentation. Most available
studies concern changes in animal diets and
adding supplements to animal feed (Veneman,
Saetnan and Newbold, 2014; Gerber et al.,
2013a). Improving the overall digestibility of
feed rations and balancing their nutritional
quality is the first level intervention, which
yields most mitigation benefits (Garg et al.,
2013; Gerber et al., 2011). Secondary plant
metabolites, such as tannins, are also available
in the diets of ruminants grazing and browsing
natural vegetation, especially in Mediterranean
and tropical regions (INRA, CIRAD and FAO,
2016), and are likely to reduce their methane
emissions. A number of other mitigation
strategies have been tested, including the use
of chemical inhibitors, ionophores, antibiotics,
hydrogen sinks, essential oils, enzymes,
probiotics, defaunation and vaccination
(Hristov et al., 2013). However, some of these
options are illegal in some countries, while
others are restricted or not commercially
available. In addition, since animal production
gains from methane mitigation are modest or
non-existent, incentives will be needed to
promote adoption of expensive additives that
cut emissions (Newbold, 2015).
Stored manure. Reducing methane emissions
from stored manure requires management
practices that avoid storing it under anaerobic
and/or warm conditions. Emissions from
manure are lower in dry lot and solid storage

animals to pests and diseases, increasing feed
use efficiency in livestock, restoring pollinators
and reducing weed competition. Restoration of

landscapes can also help to maintain crop and
livestock health, and minimize production losses,
while investments in roads, logistics, storage and
primar y processing infrastructure can reduce

also important – the leakage of refrigerant gases
from old or poorly maintained equipment
depletes the ozone layer in the atmosphere and
has significant global warming potential. More
stable dried, smoked and salted products
processed in artisanal supply chains require
methods of transport that are not time-sensitive
and produce lower levels of GHGs (FAO, 2013b).
The “Blue Growth” initiative launched by FAO
seeks to reconcile economic objectives with the
need to manage aquatic resources more
sustainably. Fisheries and aquaculture value
chains that adopt blue growth have been shown
to reap considerable gains in productivit y and
income, while managing aquatic resources in a
way that helps to restore their long-term
productive potential. Healthier oceans and
wetlands are also more resilient to climaterelated shocks, which improves the adaptive
capacit y of those who earn their livelihood from
fisheries and aquaculture.

On-farm diversification and integrated
farming systems
As well as reducing yield gaps and increasing
herd productivit y, improved long-term farm-scale
efficiency strategies should conser ve soils, water,
biodiversit y and critical ecosystem ser vices such
as pollination (Garibaldi, et al., 2016). For
example, in both temperate and tropical regions,
farming system diversification and croplivestock-tree integration would increase
resource-use efficiency and reduce GHG emission
intensit y (Soussana, Dumont and Lecomte, 2015).
A number of technologies can help to raise
production efficiency and harness co-benefits,
including precision-farming, advanced breeding,
judicious use of organic and inorganic fertilizers,
and better use of leg umes, genetic resources and
landscape biodiversit y.

For example, an FAO project worked with fishing
communities in Grand Cess, Liberia, to process
and smoke fish products more efficiently. It
involved more than 240 fish processors in the
construction of fish-smoking ovens and insulated
containers for fresh fish storage, which allowed
them to smoke fish and sell it on lucrative
markets in nearby Côte d’Ivoire. The
predominantly female fish processors benefited
from substantial increases in their income, while
also significantly reducing the amount of wood
needed to smoke fish. This further increased
their profits while generating important climate
change mitigation co-benefits (FAO, 2011a).

Carbon-rich landscapes in
agriculture and forestry
Since agriculture and forests occupy most of
Earth’s land surface, they are vital to the
conser vation and restoration of soil carbon and
the enhancement of carbon sinks. Agroforestr y,
forest regeneration, plantations, conser vation
agriculture, organic farming and grazing
management can all contribute to those goals,
although options will not apply equally across all
farming systems and regions.

Reducing on-farm losses
In developing countries, food losses occur
throughout the production chain and hit small
farmers the hardest. FAO estimates that between
30 and 40 percent of total food production may be
lost before it reaches the market, owing to
problems ranging from improper use of inputs to
lack of adequate post-har vest storage, processing
and transportation facilities. Reducing on-farm
losses increases the efficiency of production
systems. This can be achieved by improving soil

Forest landscapes
Each year, forests absorb an estimated 2.6 billion
tonnes of carbon dioxide (CIFOR, 2010),
equivalent to about one-third of the carbon
dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels.

considerable socio-economic and
environmental benefits (FAO, 2012). It retains
biodiversit y and ecosystem functions and, in
large land areas, inf luences local weather
patterns, which can have impacts on food
production (Siikamäki and Newbold, 2012).
Reduction of forest fires improves local air
qualit y which has health benefits for
communities living in and around forests
Mer y et al.
 Increasing the area under forest. The forest
area can be increased through planting,
seeding and assisted natural regeneration, and
through natural succession. Afforestation leads
to increases in the carbon pools held in aboveground and below-ground biomass and in dead
organic matter. It is generally undertaken in
rural areas and benefits the rural economy by
generating income and employment. There is
some concern that afforestation and
reforestation may diminish food securit y, if
they are carried out primarily on productive
agricultural land, and that monoculture
plantations reduce biodiversit y and are at
greater risk of diseases (FAO, 2011b). Careful
planning, across all agriculture sectors, is
needed when implementing this option.
 Maintaining or increasing carbon density.
Activities which maintain or increase carbon
stocks in forest stands include reduced-impact
logging and sustained-yield management in
timber production; maintaining partial forest
cover; and minimizing the loss of the dead
organic matter and soil carbon pools by
reducing high-emission activities such as
slash-and-burn cultivation (CIFOR, 2015; Putz
and Romero, 2015). Replanting after har vesting
or natural disturbances accelerates growth and
thus the rate of carbon sequestration relative to
natural regeneration.
 Increasing off-site carbon stocks in
harvested wood products. When wood is
transformed into long-lived products, such as
buildings and furniture, it can act as a reservoir
of carbon for decades or even centuries.

However, this immense storage system, once
disrupted by deforestation, becomes a major
source of emissions. According to the IPCC’s
Fifth Assessment Report, deforestation and forest
degradation account for nearly 11 percent of all
GHG emissions: more than the world’s entire
transport sector. As forests are lost, their capacit y
to sequester carbon is reduced.
During the 1990s, deforestation in the tropics was
largely responsible for carbon dioxide emissions,
while forest regrowth in the temperate zone and
parts of the boreal zone accounted for carbon
dioxide removals. However, the extent to which
the carbon loss due to tropical deforestation is
offset by expanding forest areas and
accumulating woody biomass in the boreal and
temperate zones is disputed. FAO estimates that
during the first decade of this centur y, total
emissions as a result of deforestation were 3.8 Gt
of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2-eq) a year,
while the net impact of forest degradation and
forest management resulted in the sequestration
of 1.8 GtCO 2-eq (FAO, 2016a). Also relevant are
biomass fires, including peatland fires and
drained peatlands, which account for emissions
of 0.3 and 0.9 GtCO 2-eq a year respectively).
The carbon mitigation potential of reduced
deforestation, improved forest management,
afforestation and agroforestr y differ greatly by
activit y, region, system boundaries and the time
horizon over which mitigation options are
compared. Reductions in deforestation dominate
the forestr y mitigation potential in Latin America
and Africa, while forest management, followed by
afforestation, dominate in OECD countries,
economies in transition, and Asia. Afforestation’s
potential contribution to mitigation ranges
between 20 and 35 percent of total forestr yrelated potential (Smith 2014: fig ure 11.18).
Climate change mitigation actions in the forest
sector fall into two broad categories: reducing the
emission of GHGs and increasing removals of
GHGs from the atmosphere. The options can be
grouped into four general categories:

The benefits of mitigation through forestr y can
be amplified through education, training and the
participation of rural communities in forestr y
planning and decision-making. Participator y

approaches to forest management can be more
successful than traditional, hierarchical
programmes and may help to strengthen civil
societ y and democratization processes (FAO,
2016b). They also create social capital, networks
and social relations which allow communities to
cope better with climate change.

Practices optimized to sequester soil organic
carbon also strengthen food securit y and
facilitate climate change adaptation. As levels of
SOC increase, important yield co-benefits could
also be achieved year after year in developing
countries (Lal, 2006). 7 By facilitating
improvements in soil structure, water infiltration
and water holding capacit y, soil organic carbon
also helps build resilience to drought and
f looding, two climate change impacts that affect
particularly tropical regions (Pan, Smith and Pan,
2009; Herrick, Sala and Jason, 2013). However,
the impacts on yields are dependent on local
conditions and the combination of practices
adopted by farmers, and yield losses have been
obser ved (Pittelkow et al., 2015).

The challenge posed by most forest-related
mitigation activities is the need for substantial
investment before benefits and co-benefits
accrue, t ypically over many years if not decades.
The substantial mitigation potential of forestr y
will not materialize without appropriate
financing and enabling frameworks that create
effective incentives.
Another issue is energ y production and product
substitution, which have social, economic and
cultural implications (EEA, 2016). For example,
policies in the European Union to increase the
use of biofuels, including wood fuels, for
energ y generation are affecting how foresters in
the region manage their forests, and how land
in developing regions is used (EC, 2013). There
are several reported cases of land grabs for
biomass production, which has implications for
food securit y.

Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils may
not be lasting. The extra soil carbon stored
through improved agricultural practices is partly
in unprotected forms, such that a fraction would
decompose if the practices ceased. In addition,
soil carbon sequestration may increase nitrous
oxide emissions in the short term, and
deficiencies in soil phosphorus and nitrogen may
impede SOC storage (Penuelas et al., 2013).
Action aimed at reaping the climate mitigation
benefits of soil organic carbon needs to take a
long-term view and be applied at landscape
rather than at field scale. It requires an
understanding that adoption of soil carbon
sequestration measures will take time, and that
SOC will increase only over a finite period, up to
the point when a new equilibrium is reached. The
additional stock will need to be monitored and
conser ved using appropriate land management
practices. All of these factors were considered in
an FAO-supported initiative on the restoration of
degraded grasslands in the Qinghai region of
China (Box 19).

Agricultural landscapes
Many current agricultural practices contribute
to losses of soil organic carbon and to the
reduction of SOC returns to soils (Table 12).
Losses can be lowered or SOC returns to the
soil increased by reducing fires, overgrazing and
soil erosion, or by recycling crop residues and
manure. Another option is to change the
balance between photosynthesis and ecosystem
respiration by increasing crop photosynthesis,
through the use of cover crops, intercropping
and agroforestr y, and by minimizing soil
disturbance through conser vation agriculture.
Large gains in crop carbon balances can also be
achieved with improved crop varieties,
nitrogen-fixing leg umes and organic and
inorganic fertilizers, which boost the amount of
crop residues available for returning to the soil.
Improved water management is also a strong
driver of primar y productivit y, and complements
all of those practices.

Finally, agroforestr y – the integration of trees
and shrubs into crop and livestock systems –
prevents soil erosion, facilitates water infiltration
and reduces the impacts of extreme weather
events. It also helps to diversif y income sources »
7 Lal et al. (2004) estimate these co-benefits at a ratio of 0.07 unit of dry
matter (DM) per soil organic carbon unit (≈ 0.07 t DM/t SOC).

small-scale herder communities. However, until now,
carbon sequestration projects in grasslands have been
hampered by high measurement costs. This problem
was overcome in Qinghai with the development of a
methodology certified by the Verified Carbon
Standard, which focuses on monitoring practices. It
allows farmers to access new sources of finance
through carbon credits, which cover the costs of
changing their management practices before
productivity gains make it profitable to restore
grasslands.

Too much livestock can lead to overgrazing and land
degradation. This is the hard lesson learned by
herders in Qinghai region, China, where some 38
percent of grasslands have been degraded. Together
with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
(CAAS), the World Agroforestry Centre and the
Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, FAO recently
developed a methodology that gives farmers the tools
to manage their animals and grasslands more

Forestr y represents the bulk of mitigation
potential in Latin America, at all levels of carbon
prices. However, different forestr y options have

nitrogen-fixing leg uminous trees, such as
Faidherbia albida, improves soil fertilit y and
yields. Although there is clear and abundant
evidence of the positive impacts of agroforestr y
practices on productivit y, adaptive capacit y and
carbon storage, a wide variet y of systems and
tree species need to be considered in
different contexts. n

MITIGATION COSTS,
INCENTIVES AND
BARRIERS

Among other mitigation options, cropland
management has the highest potential at lower
carbon prices of US$20 per tonne. At US$100, the
restoration of organic soils has the greatest
potential. Also, the potential of grazing land
management and the restoration of degraded
lands increases at higher carbon prices (Smith et
al., 2014).

There are many feasible and promising
approaches to climate change mitigation in the
A FOLU sector, and the technical potential is
considerable. But what are the costs and thus the
economic potential of mitigation? In other words,
what is the hypothetical price of carbon that
would induce farmers, fisherfolk and foresters to
apply appropriate practices for sequestering
carbon and reducing emissions?

These estimates of economic mitigation potential
provide broad indications of how to target
inter ventions in the most cost-effective way.
However, more detailed assessments are needed
in order to properly assess A FOLU’s mitigation
potential, the impacts on v ulnerable production
systems and groups, and the costs of
implementation. It is a pre-requisite that practices
optimized to reduce GHG emissions or sequester
carbon should also protect the land tenure rights
of small-scale producers and contribute to food
securit y and climate change adaptation,
particularly for the most v ulnerable groups.

Based on the combined mitigation potential of
forestr y and agriculture, estimated in the IPCC’s
Fourth Assessment Report, the IPCC suggests an
economic potential in 2030 of between ≈3 and
≈7.2 Gt of carbon dioxide equivalent a year at
carbon prices of US$20 and US$100 per tonne,
respectively (Smith et al., 2014). 8 Among regions,
the largest mitigation potential for agriculture,
forestr y and land use is found in Asia, at all
levels of carbon values (Fig ure 15, based on
Smith et al., 2014).

A range of institutional and economic
approaches can facilitate the implementation of
agricultural emission reductions. On the
institutional side, these would include providing
information to farmers about agricultural
practices that create adaptation/mitigation
synergies and, if needed, access to credit to
implement them. On the economic side, options
include positive incentives for farmers to provide
and maintain carbon sinks; taxation of nitrogen
fertilizer in countries where it is being
overutilized, a measure which is already applied
in some OECD countries to reduce nitrate
pollution; and supply-chain initiatives that
market food products with a low carbon
footprint (Paustian et al., 2016). n

Forestr y could make a significant contribution to
mitigation at all levels of carbon prices. At low
prices, the contribution of forestr y is close to
50 percent of the total from the A FOLU sector; at
higher prices the share of forestr y is lower.
8 A range of global estimates of sequestration potential at different levels
of costs has been published since the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report of
2007. The estimates differ widely. For carbon values up to US$20 a tonne,
they range from 0.12 to 3.03 GtCO2-eq per year. For values up US$100
per tonne, they range from 0.49 to 10.6 GtCO2-eq (Smith et al., 2014).

FOOD SYSTEM EMISSIONS: ENERGY USE ALONG
SUPPLY CHAINS
The modernization of food supply chains has been
associated with higher GHG emissions from both prechain inputs (fertilizers, machinery, pesticides,
veterinary products, transport) and post farm-gate
activities (transportation, processing and retailing). It
has been estimated, using previous calculations and
data from Bellarby et al. (2008) and Lal (2004), that
the production of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides,
along with emissions from fossil fuels used in the field,
represented in 2005 approximately 2 percent of
global GHG emissions (HLPE, 2012).
Lifecycle analysis methods are needed to calculate
emissions resulting from the consumption of food
products. These approaches generally account for
emissions from pre-chain inputs through to post-farm
gate processing by including methane, nitrous oxide
and CO2 emissions, and fossil fuel use in food systems
(e.g. Steinfeld et al., 2006; FAO, 2013b). Including
post-harvest stages, around 3.4 GtCO2-eq of emissions
are caused by direct and indirect energy use in the

agrifood chain (FAO, 2011d). This can be compared
with around 5.2 GtCO2-eq generated by agriculture
and around 4.9 GtCO2-eq by forestry and land use
change. Food systems currently consume an estimated
30 percent of the world’s available energy, with more
than 70 percent of that share being consumed beyond
the farm gate.
Although they are heavily dependent on fossil fuels,
modern food systems have contributed substantially to
improving food security. If those systems are to
contribute to climate change mitigation, however, they
will need to decouple future development from
dependence on fossil fuel. FAO’s Energy-Smart Food
for People and Climate (ESF) Programme uses a waterenergy-food nexus approach to help developing
countries to ensure adequate access to modern energy
services at all stages of agrifood chains, improve
energy efficiency and increase the share of renewable
energy (FAO, 2014).

CHAPTER 4 FOOD AND AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS IN CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION

A FOOD SYSTEM
PERSPECTIVE:
MINIMIZING LOSSES
AND WASTE,
PROMOTING
SUSTAINABLE DIETS

Food waste in middle and high-income
countries is caused mainly by consumer
behaviour and by policies and regulations that
address other sectoral priorities. For example,
agricultural subsidies may encourage the
production of surplus food crops, which
reduces both prices and the attention that is
paid – along the value chain and by
consumers – to food losses and waste.
Furthermore, food safety and quality
standards may remove from the supply chain
food that is still safe for human consumption.
At the consumer level, inadequate planning of
purchases and failure to use food before its
expiry date also lead to food waste.

Reducing food losses and waste, and
promoting a transition to more sustainable
diets, can also deliver emissions reductions
and contribute to global food securit y (Bajželj
et al., 2014). FAO has estimated that ever y
year roughly one-third of the edible parts of
food produced for human consumption is lost
(FAO, 2011c), representing an enormous
waste of the land, water, energ y and inputs
used to produce it and unnecessar y emissions
of millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases.
Reducing food losses and waste by increasing
the overall efficiency of food chains could
contribute to reducing GHG emissions, as
well as enhancing access to food and
improving the resilience of food systems to
climate change.

Dietar y patterns strongly inf luence some of
the factors that are driving climate change. In
countries where food consumption is
increasing, diets generally include more
livestock products, vegetable oils and sugar.
This trend is expected to continue as a result
of growth in incomes. A number of studies
have looked at the environmental
consequences of consumption of animalsource food, usually focusing on GHG
emissions and land use (INR A and CIR AD,
2009; Erb et al., 2009; Tilman and Clark, 2014;
Tukker et al., 2011; Van Dooren et al., 2014).
Using life cycle assessments, they generally
conclude that alternative diet scenarios with
less animal-source food could contribute to
reducing global GHG emissions, and have
positive impacts on human health.

In low-income countries, food losses occur
throughout food value chains, and result from
managerial and technical limitations in
har vesting, storage, transportation,
processing, packaging and marketing (HLPE,
2014). The heaviest losses are in the small and
medium-scale agricultural and fisheries
production and processing sectors. Social and
cultural conditions – such as the different
roles that men and women play at different
stages in the value chain – are frequently the
underlying causes of food losses. The
difficulties that women face in obtaining
access to, and benefits from, resources,
ser vices, jobs and income-generating
activities affect their productivit y and
efficiency in food production, which
exacerbates food losses.

There is increasing evidence that dietar y
patterns with low environmental impacts are
also healthier. Common features of such
diets are the diversit y of foods eaten, a
balance between energ y intake and energ y
expenditure; the inclusion of minimally
processed tubers and whole grains along
with leg umes, fruit and vegetables, and meat,
if eaten, in moderate quantities. Healthy
diets also feature dair y products in
moderation, unsalted seeds and nuts, small
quantities of fish and aquatic products, and
ver y limited intake of processed foods that
are high in fat, sugar or salt and low in
micronutrients (FAO and FCRN, 2016).
| 86 |

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2016

Another critical factor that needs to be
considered is the energ y used in modern
food systems to process food and bring it to
consumers (Box 20). In high-income
countries, perishable products require
significant energ y use, and corresponding
levels of GHG emissions, in the storage,
distribution and consumption stages.
Fischbeck, Tom and Hendrickson (2016)
have shown that following United States
dietar y g uidelines for healthy weights
would increase energ y use by 38 percent,
water use by 10 percent and GHG emissions
by 6 percent. This is due to the bigger share
in the diet of fruits and vegetables, which
have a high energ y, GHG and water
footprint in the United States. This
illustrates the importance of taking into
account the specific characteristics of
production systems in determining
environmental footprints. It also indicates
that there can also be trade-offs between

reduced environmental impacts and
healthier diets.
Bearing in mind the ver y large diversit y at
global level, rebalancing diets to reach
nutritional targets could nevertheless bring
ver y large co-benefits, through GHG
mitigation and improvements in the overall
efficiency of food systems (Tilman and
Clark, 2014). Further examination of
demographic and social differences,
including fast-growing food consumption
in developing countries, is needed to
inform strategies for promoting optimal
diets with improved health outcomes and
reduced levels of nitrate pollution and
greenhouse gas emissions.
Multidimensional life cycle assessments at
regional and global levels are needed to
estimate the adaptation and mitigation
effects of different dietar y transitions,
including the possible trade-offs. n

CONCLUSIONS
Agriculture, forestr y and land use are primar y
drivers of the terrestrial carbon and nitrogen
cycles. Better management of these cycles in
agriculture, forestr y and aquaculture can
provide multiple benefits in terms of food
securit y and climate change adaptation and
mitigation. Policies need to pursue three
complementar y goals:
 to increase agricultural production efficiency
and minimize farm-level GHG emission
intensit y;
 to conser ve and restore, through agricultural
and forestr y management, carbon-rich soils
and carbon-rich landscapes; and
 To g uide food systems towards reduced food
losses and waste, and towards healthier diets.
Pursuing these goals simultaneously would help
tap into the potential for co-benefits of
adaptation and mitigation. Priorities in food and

agricultural policies will need to be re-set – from
a narrow focus on reducing yield gaps to a much
broader focus on other, equally important,
objectives: soil conser vation and restoration to
enhance the capacit y of soils to sequester carbon
dioxide; improvements in nitrogen management
to reduce emissions and enhance productivit y;
practices that simultaneously increase farm level
production efficiency and minimize GHG
emission intensit y; measures to minimize losses
and waste within food systems and to promote
sustainable diets; and diversification strategies
that increase the resilience of production systems
to climate change and climatic variabilit y.
Having focused, in this chapter, on the
mitigation side of the adaptation-mitigation
nexus in agriculture and food systems,
Chapter 5 will examine an agricultural
response to climate change, in terms of
policies and institutions.

AGRICULTURE NOW
CENTRAL TO
“INTENDED
CONTRIBUTIONS”

Chapters 3 and 4 presented the economic and
technical options for building resilience to
climate change and contributing to climate
change mitigation. Those options will need to
be enabled and supported by appropriate
policies, institutional frameworks and
investment finance mechanisms. Many of
these are important for agricultural
development in general, but become even
more necessar y when addressing climate
change. Existing policy frameworks need to
be modified to integrate climate change
concerns. As well as addressing agriculture
and food securit y sensu stricto, they will need
to encompass land and water management,
disaster risk management, social protection,
and research and development.

At the Paris Climate Conference (COP21) in
December 2015, countries’ Intended Nationally
Determined Contributions ser ved as the basis for
negotiations and helped to produce the Paris
Agreement on climate change. However, while
countries committed themselves to defined
mitigation targets, those targets – if reached –
would result in aggregate greenhouse gas
emission levels in 2030 some 28 percent higher
than those required to keep the global
temperature increase below 2 ˚C.

Many countries have designed broad climate
change policies and strategies, which
establish overall objectives and targets that
ref lect the relative importance of various
sectors in their economies, as well as their
national priorities. However, as yet, few have
spelled out detailed action plans to achieve
climate targets. This chapter provides an
over view of policy actions proposed by
countries in relation to agriculture and land
use, and land-use change and forestr y
(LULUCF) in their Intended Nationally
Determined Contributions (INDCs) under the
United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC). It then discusses
how these national commitments need to be
linked to policies and institutions in order to
ensure an effective response to the climate
challenges facing agriculture. n

Even though ambitions fall short of what is
needed, and despite an apparent resistance to
undertaking binding international
commitments, many countries have taken steps
to define their climate change actions. Under
the Paris Agreement, each part y to the UNFCCC
is to prepare and maintain a Nationally
Determined Contribution (NDC), to be renewed
ever y five years and recorded in a public
registr y. If a countr y has previously submitted
an INDC, it will become an NDC once the
countr y ratifies the agreement. While not
binding, the NDCs are meant to g uide countr ylevel climate action in the coming years. They
include not only targets, but also concrete
strategies for addressing the causes of climate
change and responding to its effects.
While all the INDCs prepared for Paris were
meant to cover mitigation, parties were also
invited to consider including an adaptation

component, or communicating their undertakings
in adaptation planning. As of 31 March 2016,
INDCs had been submitted to the UNFCCC by
188 countries.9 All of them contain mitigation
commitments, and about 70 percent of them also
include a section on adaptation.

issue of major concern. Adaptation features in
all INDCs submitted by countries in subSaharan Africa and Eastern and Southeast
Asia. Most LDCs also highlight extreme events
as their main adaptation challenge, and more
than 80 percent of them mention droughts and
f loods as immediate threats.

An FAO analysis of the INDCs submitted before
COP21 shows that the agriculture sectors do
feature prominently (FAO, 2016). More than
90 percent of countries include the agriculture
sectors in their mitigation and/or adaptation
contributions. In addition, developing countries –
particularly the least-developed countries (LDCs)
– put a strong emphasis on the agriculture sectors
in terms of both mitigation and adaptation:

Synergies among actions aimed at climate
change adaptation and mitigation in the
agriculture sectors are highlighted in many
INDCs, as much as co-benefits foreseen in
terms of improved social and economic
outcomes and environmental protection. About
one-third of all countries mention such
co-benefits. Thirt y-one countries explicitly
mention climate-smart agriculture Specific
reference is made to joint benefits in terms of
rural development, improved health, povert y
reduction and job creation, on the one hand,
and conser vation of ecosystems and
biodiversit y, on the other. Likewise, the
importance of reducing gender inequalities and
promoting women’s empowerment in order to
improve agricultural production, while reducing
v ulnerabilit y to the impacts of climate change,
is underlined in many of the INDCs.

 Mitigation. Agriculture10 and land use, landuse change and forestr y are among the most
referenced sectors in mitigation contributions,
which set out targets and/or actions for
mitigation efforts. This holds, in particular, for
the INDCs submitted by developing countries.
Most countries, however, have not specified
agriculture and LULUCF-specific mitigation
targets, but have subsumed these under
economy-wide targets for GHG emission
reduction.
 Adaptation. More than 90 percent of
developing countries included in their INDCs a
section on adaptation to climate change in
their agriculture sectors, and consider it an

The INDCs were not prepared according to a
standard format. Therefore, they are
heterogeneous in length, coverage and level of
detail. Because of this heterogeneit y, caution is
needed when comparing countr y priorities and
actions beyond broad patterns. However, the
INDCs submitted do provide a clear indication of
the importance attached to the agriculture
sectors, by the vast majorit y of countries, in
terms of both adaptation and mitigation. At the
same time, however, it is clear that much better
tools are needed to tailor climate actions to the
specific characteristics and circumstances of the
agriculture sectors (Box 21).

9 A total of 161 INDCs were submitted to the UNFCCC, corresponding
to 188 countries (the European Union INDC corresponds to 28 countries).
Libya, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Nicaragua, Palestine, the
Syrian Arab Republic, Timor-Leste and Uzbekistan have not yet submitted
INDCs. On 19 April 2016, Panama submitted its NDC, which is not
included in this analysis.
10 In the context of mitigation, emissions from the “agriculture sector” – in
accordance with IPCC terminology – includes emissions from enteric
fermentation, manure management, rice cultivation, prescribed burning of
savannas and grassland, and from soils (i.e. agricultural emissions).
Emissions related to forest and other land uses are covered under LULUCF.

BOX 21

THE AGRICULTURE SECTORS
AND UNFCCC
recognizes the central role of forests in
achieving the 2 °C goal through mitigation
options covered by REDD+. It also
acknowledges the potential of forests for joint
mitigation and adaptation approaches, and
their important role in yielding non-carbon
benefits.
Third, since the Bali Conference (COP13) in
2007, a specific work stream on agriculture,
intended in this context as crop and livestock
production, has been developed. It has
advanced through four thematic workshops in
the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific
and Technological Advice, on early warning
systems, vulnerability, adaptation and
productivity. The results will be discussed in
COP22, in Marrakech.
Finally, the need for mechanisms and tools that
recognize and are adapted to the specificities
of the agriculture sectors emerges as a crosscutting theme, both in the above-mentioned
work streams, and in all the activities under the
Convention. Emissions and emission reductions,
including sources and sinks, are more difficult
to assess and monitor in agriculture than in
most other sectors. The sheer number and small
size of actors in the agriculture sectors are also
a major source of difficulties and transaction
costs for the implementation and monitoring of
mechanisms that have been conceived,
generally, for the energy and industrial sectors.
Moreover, the fact that mitigation and
adaptation are treated separately in the
UNFCCC impedes a proper valuation of the
synergies, as well as the trade-offs, between
adaptation and mitigation actions, which are
particularly important in the agriculture sectors.
As underlined in the INDCs, actions in the
agriculture sectors are particularly significant in
terms of potential co-benefits or trade-offs with
environmental, economic and social issues.
These issues are important to the agriculture
sectors, but are not taken into account in most
UNFCCC discussions and mechanisms.

How the agriculture sectors are taken into
consideration in UNFCCC discussions is often
misunderstood, with frequent statements that
agriculture was not included, or was even
excluded, from the negotiations. The United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change embraces all anthropogenic sources of
GHG emissions, as well as all impacts of
climate change. The question, therefore, is not
whether the agriculture sectors are integrated in
the scope of the Convention, but how their
specificities are accounted for.
There are several points that enable the specific
consideration of issues related to agriculture
and food security. The first one is the
UNFCCC’s recognition of the importance of
food production – Article 2 of the Convention,
which states its objective, says that this
objective should be achieved while ensuring
that “food production is not threatened”. The
Paris Agreement, adopted in COP21, further
recognizes “the fundamental priority of
safeguarding food security and ending hunger,
and the particular vulnerabilities of food
production systems to the adverse effects of
climate change”.
The second point is the recognition,
reaffirmed in the Paris Agreement, of the
important role of land use, land-use change
and forestry in addressing climate change.
This has prompted diverse work streams,
under the climate convention, on how to take
into account the specificities of sources and
sinks in accounting rules and financial
mechanisms. Among the principal issues
considered are the distinction between natural
and anthropogenic causes of sources and
sinks, and how to deal with the nonpermanence of emission reductions through
sinks. It has also led to an initiative, launched
in 2008, to reduce deforestation and forest
degradation (REDD+) by providing payments
to developing countries. Forests are quite
prominent in the Paris Agreement. Article 5

» The INDCs also highlight how adaptation and

for which further delay could increase
v ulnerabilit y or lead to increased costs at a
later stage – for climate change adaptation. To
date, 50 countries have submitted NAPAs to
the UNFCCC Secretariat (UNFCCC, 2016a).
Agriculture and natural resource management
issues are particularly prominent in them. The
great majorit y of priorit y projects are related to
the agriculture sectors and food securit y
(Meybeck et al., 2012), and most belong to one
of five main categories: cross-sectoral
(including early warning systems, disaster
management, education and capacit y building),
management of ecosystems, water
management, plant production and livestock,
and diversification and income. All NAPAs are
eligible for funding under the LDC Fund,
which is managed by the Global Environment
Facilit y (GEF) for their implementation.
 National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) focus on
addressing medium and long-term adaptation
needs and provide a significant opportunit y to
integrate the concerns and needs of the
agriculture sectors and actors in broad national
strategies and policies. Three countries –
Brazil, Burkina Faso and Cameroon – have
each completed a NAP, and all give importance
to adaptation in agriculture.
 Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions
(NAMAs), as defined by the UNFCCC, are
prepared by national governments in the
context of sustainable development and
provide for nationally appropriate actions that
reduce emissions in developing countries
(UNFCCC, 2016b). They t y pically include more
detailed actions than INDCs and can be
project-based, programmatic, sector-wide, or
focused at the policy level ( Wilkes, Tennigkeit
and Solymosi, 2013). Sectoral policies need to
be defined or revised and aligned with climate
policies and priorities. Baseline scenarios have
to be constructed and the mitigation potential
of different options estimated. The barriers to
implementation of these options need to be
identified. Institutional arrangements for
coordination and financing, as well as for
measuring, reporting and verification, must be
established. Some 13 percent of the NA M As in
the convention’s NA M A registr y are in the
A FOLU sector (UNFCCC, 2015). n

mitigation actions in the agriculture sectors are
particularly rich in potential co-benefits. As
countries move from intentions to
implementation, many have expressed concern
about the adequacy of available financial
resources and about their own institutional
capacit y. Countries of sub-Saharan Africa express
such concerns most often, and their INDCs are
also among the most detailed and exhaustive
when it comes to agriculture. n

FROM INTENTIONS TO
ACTION: AGRICULTURE
IN CLIMATE
STRATEGIES
Since the Nationally Determined Contributions
are general, non-binding commitments, and not
action plans, the commitments undertaken need
to be translated into action at the national level.
This directly concerns agriculture and food
securit y policy-making. However, it also entails
the mainstreaming of climate change
considerations into a range of other policies and
action areas that are highly relevant to
agriculture and food securit y, such as land and
water management, but also disaster risk
management and social protection. The challenge
is to incorporate the agriculture sectors into
national climate change strategies, which are
themselves linked to UNFCCC mechanisms
(Fig ure 16).
A series of instruments have been designed under
the UNFCCC for linking international climate
change commitments to concrete action for
mitigation and adaptation at the countr y level:
 National Adaptation Programmes of Action
(NAPAs) were originally established by the
UNFCCC as a dedicated, harmonized, countr yled instrument for least developed countries.

and of the consequences for the environment.
Doing so is complex, and win-win solutions may
not always be possible. Policies, market forces
and environmental constraints drive the use of
inputs and other resources in agriculture, the
levels of productivit y, and the degree of
conser vation or depletion of natural resources.
These drivers var y significantly among
countries. Subsistence farmers in Africa and
smallholders in Asia face different constraints
and do not have the same abilit y to respond to
policy and market signals as global agribusinesses. As shown throughout this report,
climate impacts var y widely by region, and will
have to be addressed according to local
circumstances. Despite those differences, there
are a number of common areas where trade-offs
between climate and food securit y objectives
can be addressed and where different policy
domains should come together.

The NAPAs, NAPs and NA M As focus on actions
that address climate change, either through
adaptation or mitigation. However, as discussed
in Chapters 3 and 4, to be effective and to ensure
that co-benefits are achieved, these actions need
to be an integral part of broader agriculture, food
and nutrition policies.
Restoration of forests and degraded soils,
climate-smart agricultural practices,
agroecolog y and better management of water
resources can all contribute to the productivit y
improvements needed to respond to the growing
demand for food, improve the resilience of
farming systems and reduce the emission
intensit y of crops, livestock, fisheries and
forestr y, while increasing carbon sequestration
in soils and forests. However, as indicated in
Chapters 3 and 4, a shift towards sustainable
practices in the agriculture sectors may not be
enough to place food systems on a sustainable
pathway and to eradicate hunger. For that,
further efforts are needed to improve the
resilience and livelihoods of the food insecure
and, across all economic sectors, to ensure a
reduction in GHG emissions in order to prevent
the global temperature from increasing by more
than 2 °C. Agricultural and rural development
policies that help diversif y income and
employment opportunities for the poor and food
insecure need to be complemented by policies
that address the carbon footprint of entire food
systems – for example, through measures
that align dietar y preferences with
environmental objectives.

Undoing environmentally
harmful subsidies and
support measures
The OECD countries spent US$211 billion in
agricultural production support in 2015. In the
non-OECD countries for which data are
available, this support reached US$352 billion in
the same year.11 Governments support farmers
and agri-businesses to provide direct stimulus
to agricultural production, inf luence input costs,
supplement farm incomes, and achieve other
social, economic and environmental objectives,
such as landscape preser vation, water
conser vation, povert y reduction, and climate
change mitigation and adaptation. Much of the
existing production support in both developed
and developing countries involves subsidies on
inputs, such as fertilizer and energ y, particularly
fossil fuels, or direct payments to farmers. In
OECD countries, support measures have been
declining since the 1980s, both in real and

From the perspective of agriculture, such an
integrated approach needs to start from an
understanding of the drivers of agricultural
production and natural resource management
choices, of their impacts on farmers’ livelihoods

Producer and Consumer Support Estimates database of the OECD (2016).

THE NEED FOR POLICY COHERENCE BETWEEN
AGRICULTURE AND ENERGY
economic viability of biofuel production depends on
oil prices, volatility in energy markets is transmitted to
agricultural markets and on to food prices (see Enciso
et al., 2016).
Biofuel policy measures are commonly implemented
through tax credits, quantitative targets (blending or
use mandates), and trade restrictions (Sorda, Banse
and Kemfert, 2010). These have different effects on
volatility in agricultural markets. Tax credits provide a
stronger link to energy markets, through relative
prices, rather than quantitative targets; hence the latter
are more predictable in terms of demand for biofuels.
Biofuel policies link markets for agricultural
commodities and energy, and must be considered
within the wider context of climate change policy. If
biofuel support policies are put in place, then
mandates could be preferable to tax credits, from a
food security perspective, because they are less prone
to market volatility. However, much depends on the
magnitude of the mandate and the size of the tax
credit. Particular care needs to be taken in managing
the interactions between tax credits and mandates,
further complicating policy coherence (De Gorter and
Just, 2009).

Lower taxes on fuel used in agricultural production and
support to the development of biofuels are two prime
examples of the need for better alignment of
agricultural, energy and climate change policies.
The argument for lower taxes on fuel used in the
agriculture sectors is the importance of transportation
fuels as an input to production, and the fact that they are
mostly used off-road. However, when it comes to GHG
emissions, diesel combustion contributes equally to CO2
emissions, irrespective of where it takes place. An
agricultural policy allowing full exemption would not,
therefore, be consistent with mitigating climate change.
Biofuels are another energy-related area where policy
coherence is problematic. Biofuel development is shaped
by several policy domains – agriculture, energy,
transport, environment and trade – and often there is no
clear coordination and policy coherence among them
(FAO, 2008). Only if the role of biofuels is considered
in relation to these policy domains can it be ensured that
objectives are not in conflict with each other.
Producing biofuel feedstock competes with

agricultural support measures conditional upon
the adoption of agricultural practices that lower
emissions and conser ve natural resources. As
subsidy levels are significant, there is scope for a
re-alignment and a re-direction of incentives.
However, none of this will suffice without
concerted efforts to align policies on climate
change and agriculture with policies in other
domains, particularly the energ y sector (Box 22).

production at the farm gate, support dropped
significantly, from 46 percent in 1986 to
20 percent in 2014. In contrast, in most nonOECD countries for which data are available,
agricultural production support is increasing.
Support measures may have unintended impacts
on the environment, if misaligned with efforts to
address climate change and environmental
concerns. For example, input subsidies may
induce inefficient use of synthetic fertilizers and
pesticides and increase the emission intensit y of
production. Almost half of all agricultural
subsidies provided by governments of OECD
countries in 2010 –12 were “potentially most
harmful to the environment” by inducing greater
demand for chemical fertilizers and fossil fuels
and leading to more greenhouse gas emissions
(OECD, 2015). The share of environmentally
damaging subsidies has fallen from 75 percent in
1995, while the share of subsidies and payments
subject to compliance with environmental
reg ulations has increased. While that is a
promising trend, OECD countries still have some
way to go to align overall agricultural price
policies with incentives to adopt environmentally
sustainable production practices.

Managing natural resources
Another key domain for policy synergy is
sustainable natural resource management.
Optimizing the sustainable use of land and water
requires appropriate governance and mechanisms to
manage synergies and trade-offs between different
objectives, interests and time scales. To achieve
multiple objectives in agriculture, energy and
forestry, large-scale land-use planning is needed in
order to identify priority areas for REDD+,
agricultural production and forests for other uses,
such as biomass energy production.
Crops and livestock are the most important
sectors driving deforestation and forest
degradation. The energ y sector is also closely
linked to forests in most developing countries,
through the widespread dependence on wood
fuels, especially in Africa and Asia, and the
expansion onto forest land of biofuel feedstock
production, mainly in Asia and Latin America.
The success of climate change mitigation and
adaptation actions will be heavily dependent,
therefore, on the harmonization of objectives
across the agriculture and energ y sectors. To
ensure national ownership and political
sustainabilit y, REDD+ will also need to
contribute to realizing the objectives of other key
economic sectors.

In developing countries, trends are towards
increasing use of producer price support and
input subsidies. Input subsidies are often
motivated by the belief that, by reducing input
costs, yields will increase and food securit y will
improve. As discussed in Chapter 3, in some
contexts, particularly in parts of sub-Saharan
Africa, incentives to increase the use of nitrogen
fertilizer can indeed have the co-benefit of
enhancing productivit y and improving the
resilience of smallholder producers. However,
benign impacts do not apply in all contexts, such
as in East Asia, where excessive use of fertilizer
has no production benefit and instead causes
severe environmental harm (Fixen et al., 2015).
Hence, careful assessment and policy design are
needed to avoid creating incentives that
counteract environmental goals.

Supporting and facilitating
collective action
Climate change gives rise to new and increasing
demands for collective action and, consequently,
coordination among stakeholders. These

One way of aligning agricultural development
and climate goals would be by making

systems – have been partly or totally
abandoned in many areas, owing to socioeconomic changes (FAO, 2013). Supporting or
reactivating these forms of cooperation for
restoration work, where appropriate, may be
beneficial. Encouraging informal social
networks to share information and experience
on adaptation options may also help to build
social resilience to climate change. Such
networks can play a key role in establishing
sur veillance, monitoring and early
warning systems.

demands should be met through policies and
institutions that facilitate and support
coordinated design and implementation of
actions, either in a specific area – e.g. a watershed
or forest – or in a sector, such as an entire food
chain. Promoting inclusiveness and transparency
in decision-making, and providing incentives to
actions that aim to induce long-term public and
collective adaptation benefits, are particularly
important for the management of natural
resources (Place and Meybeck, 2013).
In order to support landscape restoration, for
example, cross-sectoral coordination is
essential. Agencies often work in relative
isolation, and even at cross-purposes. This is at
least partially due to how institutions are
structured and the lack of capacit y of
institutions to cooperate closely in land-use
planning and management. There is a need –
and a real scope – for institutions dealing with
ecosystem and land-use issues to integrate the
management of natural resources, especially
forests, trees, soil and water, through improved,
multisectoral land use (Braatz, 2012).

Managing risks
Climate change is bringing new risks and
changing existing ones (FAO and OECD, 2012).
Better management of actual risks has been
highlighted by the IPCC as a key adaptation
action. This requires appropriate institutions
and policies, which are mostly sector- and/or
risk-specific. Weather stations, weather and
climate projection tools, yield response models,
environmental monitoring tools and
v ulnerabilit y assessments can help to determine
how local climate conditions will change in the
future, and to estimate their impact on
production. They are essential for reliable early
warning systems and for assessing
adaptation options.

To support improved governance of land and
water tenure systems under climate change,
multistakeholder dialog ue, taking into account
the interests of women, the poor and
marginalized groups, is a promising option. For
instance, experience over past decades has
shown that forests can be managed well and
degradation can be reversed by involving local
communities, with support from legitimate
decentralized institutional arrangements
developed through consultative processes
(FAO, 2013). There are many examples of forest
farmer groups (FAO and AgriCord, 2012) and
communit y forestr y groups (e.g. Nepal’s
Communit y Forest User Groups). The same
holds for communit y fisheries groups
and organizations.

Comprehensive risk management strategies
require a clear understanding of the robustness
of different risk management instruments under
climate uncertaint y (Antón et al., 2013). They
also require coordination of actions by public,
private and civil societ y sectors, from the global
to local levels ( World Bank, 2013). National
governments could provide mechanisms for
proactive and integrated risk management –
such as a national board that coordinates risk
management strategies with institutions for risk
monitoring, prevention, control and response at
the local and global levels – and provide
incentives for private sector participation in risk
coping. As highlighted in Chapter 3, social
protection programmes that g uarantee
minimum incomes or access to food have an
important role, but need to be well linked with

Social networks are also important components
of local governance and can help to provide for
effective responses to climate change.

agricultural production are essential.
Agricultural input and output markets play a
central role here, but other institutions – such
as rural credit and insurance programmes,
agricultural extension, land and water tenure
arrangements, and input subsidy programmes
– have all been found to play important roles
in supporting, or hindering, smallholders in
the transition to systems with higher
resilience (see Chapter 3 as well as: McCarthy,
Best and Betts, 2010; Asfaw, Coromaldi and
Lipper, 2015; Asfaw et al., 2015; Asfaw,
DiBattista and Lipper, 2014; Arslan et al., 2014;
2015; Arslan, Belotti and Lipper, 2015).

other forms of climate and disaster risk
management (Box 23).
Policies are also needed to reduce financial
risks, lower transaction costs, facilitate financial
transactions, enable access to financial ser vices,
and facilitate long-term investments, through
safe savings deposits, low-priced credit and
insurance. The financial needs of smallholders
and family farmers for both working capital –
for example, to buy fertilizer and seed – and for
medium and long-term investments must be
addressed and supported.
Last but not least, policies and institutions must
actively support the diversification of livelihood
strategies. Livelihood diversification is among
the most effective risk management strategies
for smallholders and family farmers facing
climate change. Depending on the specific
context, it might include land-use diversification
as well as income or labour diversification.
Agricultural and rural development policies
thus need to integrate diversification as a key
component, and local institutions need to
facilitate it by providing incentives through
improved access to credit, insurance,
information and training.

COOPERATION

Given the emphasis countries have placed in
their INDCs on both mitigation and
adaptation, supporting food producers in their
efforts to adapt to climate change, while
keeping GHG emissions in check, must
become a priorit y. To adopt new and more
resilient livelihoods, farmers, herders,
fisherfolk and foresters need an institutional
environment which supports that change. At
present, however, this t ype of enabling policy
and institutional environment is often lacking,

pillars, which correspond to the Sendai Framework for
Disaster Risk Reduction. They aim at:
 creating an enabling environment through
strengthened capacities and enhanced legal and
planning frameworks for disaster risk and crisis
governance;
 understanding the risk and informing decisionmaking through sector-specific risk monitoring
and early warning;
 promoting location-specific practices that prevent
and mitigate the impacts of natural hazards and
disasters; and
 enhancing capacities, coordination and planning
for preparedness, emergency response and
building back better than before during
rehabilitation.

Building resilience requires a change in the
conventional approach to disaster risk reduction (DRR)
– from simply reacting to extreme events to prioritizing
the reduction and active management of risks. On a
yearly average, less than 5 percent of all humanitarian
funding has gone to disaster preparedness and
prevention; and less than 1 percent to those countries
most in need. Investment in DRR from official
development aid (ODA) disbursements was in the
range of 0.4 percent in 2010 and 2011 across all
sectors (UNISDR/OECD, 2013).
The Food and Agriculture Organization has
conceptualized and implements DRR action in many
countries recurrently exposed to extreme climate and
other events (for several examples, see FAO, 2016).
The approach is based on four mutually supportive

BOX 24

KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND DATA CHALLENGES
To underpin both forecasting and monitoring of the
actual impacts of climate change, and actions to
counteract these impacts, statistics will need to provide
better information on a range of processes, including:
socio-economic drivers of emissions; emissions; Earth
observations; impacts on ecosystems and economic
activities; adaptation actions; and mitigation actions.
Major data gaps still exist in all these areas,
particularly for developing countries that lack the
capacity to analyse time-series data, estimate
emissions in key sectors and make full use of Earth
observations. Countries need support in improving
their national statistical systems, and especially in
developing their capacity to evaluate climate change
risks using socio-economic, geo-referenced data and
integrated economic models.
International and regional collaboration will be key in
addressing these knowledge gaps and delivering
information to stakeholders. The FAO statistical
database, FAOSTAT, provides yearly updates of
emissions estimates by country for agriculture, land
use, land-use change and forestry. FAO also publishes
geo-spatial information through a number of portals
and specialized products, such as GeoNetwork, the
Harmonized World Soil Database, and Collect Earth
— a new tool which enables forest data collection
through Google Earth.

Climate change also changes the risk environment and
adds an additional layer of uncertainty to risks already
faced by food producers. Gaps in important
information and knowledge, such as intra-seasonal
weather forecasts, need to be addressed. Investment is
required in infrastructure to measure, record, store and
disseminate data on weather variables, and to provide
weather and seasonal climate forecasts at desired
spatial and temporal scales. Climate forecasts need to
be made more useful and more user-friendly through
partnerships among agencies dealing with
meteorological and hydrological services, agricultural
research, and extension.
In the context of the need for more coordinated action,
the Agricultural Model Inter-comparison and
Improvement Project is an important initiative linking
modelling efforts around the world, focusing on
climate, crops, livestock and economics, and helping
to highlight remaining knowledge gaps and how to
address them. For example, despite recent literature on
climate change effects on plant pests and pathogens
(Bebber, Ramotowski and Gurr, 2013; Gregory et al.,
2009) and their antagonists (Thomson, Macfadyen
and Hoffmann, 2010), they are not incorporated in
projections of climate impacts on agriculture; they
have been identified as important for further model
development (Rosenzweig et al.,2014).

diseases, as well as movements of products,
from one countr y to another. This calls for
strengthened regional and international
cooperation to facilitate exchanges of
knowledge, manage common resources, and
exchange and value plant and animal
genetic resources.
Many resources upon which the agriculture
sectors depend – such as water, fish stocks and
ecosystems – are transboundar y in nature.
Changes in the environment will lead to
changes in the availabilit y of these resources
and to the migration of species, people and
human activities as they seek to adjust to these
changes. In addition, extreme events, such as
forest fires, species invasions, and pests and
diseases, reach across national boundaries.
Policies and institutions dedicated to the
prevention and management of specific risks
and v ulnerabilities that are being affected by
climate change are mainly local and national,
but they can be effectively supported by
international cooperation and tools.

The role of trade in
adaptation and mitigation

Multicountr y and regional action to
monitor and manage changes in natural
resources, as well as risks to the agriculture
sectors and food securit y, is thus crucial to
addressing climate change. Important
examples of transboundar y cooperation in
the agriculture sectors include:

An efficient international trading system is
important for both climate change adaptation
and mitigation. Climate change may have farreaching impacts on global production
patterns and patterns of international trade in
food and agricultural products. Trade may be
part of adaptation strategies for regions
adversely affected by climate change. Trade
restrictions, such as tariff and non-tariff
barriers, which limit the response of global
agricultural production to changes in demand
and supply under climate change, should be
minimized. However, since impacts are
expected to be worse in low-latitude regions
(see Chapter 2), climate change is likely to
exacerbate existing imbalances between the
developed and developing world. Climate
change underscores the need to help
developing countries deal with food and
energ y price increases, as well as volatilit y in
food supplies.

networks, which work together in the

waters of the western Pacific Ocean keeps
catches within sustainable bounds and
optimizes the distribution of economic
benefits.

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2016

Existing trade policy frameworks are far from
being “climate-compatible”. For instance, the
role of trade measures in international
negotiations on climate change stabilization
is unclear. There is no consensus as to
whether current World Trade Organization
( W TO) trade rules can promote adherence to
climate goals, or are a threat to mutually
agreed climate solutions (Early, 2009). In fact,
various forms of climate change mitigation
policies could be challenged under W TO rules
if they were deemed to be trade distorting.
This could apply, for example to: payments for
environmental ser vices, such as forest and
soil carbon sequestration; policies

implemented as unilateral measures, such as
carbon taxes or cap-and-trade regimes; and
related border adjustment measures that place
duties on imports from countries not
undertaking comparable mitigation efforts
based on the carbon-content of products or
production methods.
A key step towards reaching an international
agreement on the harmonization of trade
rules with climate objectives will be to tackle
concerns that climate measures may distort
trade, or that trade rules could stand in the
way of greater progress on climate change
( Wu and Salzman, 2014). n

CONCLUSIONS
In the Intended Nationally Determined
Contributions submitted in preparation for
COP21, a large number of developed and
developing countries clearly expressed their
determination to ensure an effective
response by the agriculture sectors to climate
change, in terms of both adaptation and
mitigation. This determination needs to be
translated into concrete action with the
support of an enabling policy and an
institutional environment, as well as regional
and international cooperation. Action plans
should now build on a recognition that there
are important synergies and trade-offs
between mitigation, adaptation, food
securit y and the conser vation of natural
resources. Creating co-benefits requires
coordination across all relevant domains.
Unfortunately, there is a general lack of
coordination and alignment of agricultural
development plans and actions that address
climate change and other environmental
problems. This is leading to the inefficient

use of resources and is preventing the
integrated management required to address
climate change threats, ensure productivit y
improvement in food production and
enhance the resilience of v ulnerable
households. At the same time, it should be
recognized that assessments of the impacts
of climate change are surrounded by
uncertaint y and hampered by large
knowledge gaps. To better inform policy
action, much greater efforts are needed to
improve assessment tools and close
knowledge gaps, for example by
strengthening statistical systems and climate
forecasting and monitoring capacit y (Box 24).
Breaking down the silos between policies on
adaptation, mitigation, food securit y,
nutrition and natural resources is essential
also when determining the financing needed
to support the transition towards sustainable,
climate-smart food systems. The next chapter
turns to the issue of linking climate change
action and agricultural finance.

FINANCING THE WAY
FORWARD
The previous chapters of this report highlighted the
benefits of climate change mitigation and
adaptation interventions in the agriculture sectors.
Most of the adaptation interventions needed are
similar to interventions that promote general rural
development, but they should be designed with a
focus on changing climatic conditions and related
risks, constraints and opportunities. Many of the
agricultural practices proposed are relatively lowcost and have both mitigation and adaptation
benefits, which increases their cost-effectiveness.

change adaptation and/or mitigation objectives. It
is useful, however, to disting uish between public
and private sector financing since they can play
complementar y roles in mobilizing resources for
climate change adaptation and mitigation.
While difficult to track, available estimates
suggest that the private sector is by far the largest
source of finance for climate change adaptation
and mitigation efforts, contributing approximately
62 percent of the US$391 billion invested in
addressing climate change in 2014 (Buchner et al.,
2015). Farmers, from small to large, are the biggest
investors in agriculture, providing many times
what governments provide for rural infrastructure
and agricultural research and development. Most
agricultural investments are financed from
domestic resources – whether public or private –
and only a small share of the funding comes from
international sources (FAO, 2012). However, while
small in magnitude, international public financing
can act as a catalyst, leveraging private financing
and investments in agriculture, including climaterelated investments.

Chapter 3 showed that the costs of adaptation
actions in smallholder agriculture would be a
fraction of the benefits and, hence, would justify
generous allocations of climate finance. The case
for funding increases becomes even stronger when
considering the mitigation co-benefits of climatesmart development, illustrated in Chapter 4, and
the emphasis that countries have placed on
adaptation and mitigation in agriculture in their
Intended Nationally Determined Contributions
(INDCs), as discussed in Chapter 5. This chapter
examines the role of finance in climate change
adaptation and mitigation in the agriculture
sectors, and how public finance – both international
and domestic – can be used more effectively to
support adaptation and mitigation efforts. n

Still relatively small, but with
catalytic potential

finance for climate change mitigation and
adaptation in agriculture, forestr y and fisheries
has increased substantially since 2002. By the

other, dedicated multilateral climate funds, such
as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), set up
expressly to support climate action. The focus
here is on the financing made available from each
of these sources for addressing climate change
adaptation and mitigation in agriculture (crop
production and livestock), forestr y and fisheries.

Trends in international
public climate finance for
agriculture13

Data on the scale of commitments between 2010
and 2014 suggest that bilateral development
assistance has been the dominant source of
international public finance for climate change
adaptation and mitigation in agriculture, forestr y
and fisheries. Average annual bilateral
commitments were US$1.9 billion for agriculture,
US$552.7 million for forest conser vation and
US$37.5 million for fisheries. Bilateral funding
was far larger than climate finance commitments
from multilaterals (Fig ure 17).

International public climate finance has evolved
in line with the incremental nature of
commitments made in the UNFCCC process, as
described in Chapter 5. The “architecture” may
be seen as consisting of: on the one hand,
funding from bilateral and multilateral
development finance bodies destined for climate
change mitigation and adaptation; and, on the

Globally, the level of international support for
mitigation has far surpassed finance for adaptation
(Norman and Nakhooda, 2014). However, in recent
years, there has been a shift towards adaptation,

CHAPTER 6 FINANCING THE WAY FORWARD

particularly by bilateral donors. Although the focus
is also shifting for multilateral funding, in the period
2010–14 it was still dominated by mitigation, which
accounted for approximately 70 percent of funding in
the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors. Forest
conservation and REDD+ have been financed mainly
as a mitigation opportunity, although bilateral
donors are moving towards forest interventions that
support both mitigation and adaptation objectives.
Funds available for fisheries are predominantly for
adaptation and building resilience.

funding were allocated to supporting policy and
strengthening institutions.
Most bilateral and dedicated multilateral
climate funding for agriculture supports both
agricultural development and agricultural
policy and administrative management
objectives, although funding is spread across a
wide range of sub-sectors. Some 40 percent of
bilateral agricultural climate finance is tagged
broadly for agricultural development, with
donors focusing overwhelmingly on rural
development. Bilateral donors have specifically
sought to support smallholders moving from
subsistence farming to producing a marketable
surplus through improved irrigation and
value-chains, as well as inclusive models for
contract farming (Donor Tracker, 2014).
Dedicated climate projects that support lowcarbon and resilient crop and livestock
production are few; they account for just 4
percent of total reported bilateral finance in
the case of crop production and 0.1 percent in
the case of livestock (see Box 25 for examples
of uses of available funding).

There are differences in the reg ional allocation
of adaptation and mitigation finance. Making
precise estimates is difficult because the
reg ional allocation of about one-fifth of bilateral
finance tagged for climate change is either
unspecified or unclear. Of the remainder, some
62 percent of finance from dedicated climate
f unds has been targeted at Latin A merica and
the Caribbean, ref lecting the sig nificant
opportunities seen for reducing emissions in the
forest sector in that reg ion. Adaptation f unding
has concentrated on sub-Saharan A frica, the
reg ion likely to be most impacted by climate
change, w ith 54 percent of approved dedicated
climate finance for the period 2010 –14. Bilateral
donors have also allocated almost half of their
adaptation-tagged finance to sub-Saharan
A frica. W hile bilateral donors have focused
finance on countries v ulnerable to food
insecurit y, finance currently misses the most
v ulnerable countries, a fact which ref lects donor
concerns about those countries’ capacit y to
absorb and benefit from development assistance.

In terms of multilateral funds, the GEF has been
one of the largest funds financing climate change
mitigation. The fund reported to COP21 that,
since its creation in 1991, it has financed 839
projects for climate change mitigation, with more
than US$5.2 billion in GEF financing in more
than 167 countries, mobilizing US$32.5 billion in
co-financing. The GEF has sought to develop
long-term, sustainable approaches to maintaining
forests. As of June 2016, the GEF had supported
more than 430 forest-related projects, with
US$2.7 billion in grants that leveraged an
additional US$12.0 billion in co-finance. Funding
for forests is steadily increasing. During the four
years of the Fifth Replenishment (GEF-5), exactly
US$700 million in grants was committed. In the
first two years of GEF-6 (2014–18), grants of
US$566 million have already been made available
through 52 projects and programmes to enhance
the economic, social and environmental value of
all t y pes of forests. In addition, the GEF has also
launched a US$45 million integrated programme
to take deforestation out of commodit y
supply chains.
»

Bilateral donors and dedicated multilateral
climate funds report a significant focus on
capacit y development, including policy and
administrative management and institutional
strengthening, across the agriculture sectors.
That focus is most pronounced for the forestr y
sector, where 57 percent of bilateral and

DEDICATED CLIMATE FUNDS AND
THE AGRICULTURE SECTORS
Dedicated multilateral funds, although smaller than
bilateral funds in the volume of finance, focus on
adaptation or mitigation outcomes as primary objectives,
which is not necessarily the case with all bilateral funding.
Multilateral funds support climate change mitigation and
adaptation actions that are not covered by existing ODAsupported development programmes. At least 13
dedicated multilateral climate funds have invested in
agricultural, forestry and fisheries projects or programmes
since 2010. Their size varies notably (see Figure).
Although bilateral and multilateral climate finance
employs a range of financial instruments, grants
predominate, particularly in the case of dedicated
multilateral climate funds and bilateral donors.
For agriculture, the most significant funds are the
Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP)
of the International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD), and the UNFCCC’s Least Developed Countries
Fund, which is managed by the Global Environment
Facility (GEF). Launched in 2012 to mainstream climate
change adaptation within IFAD investment programmes,
ASAP focuses all of its approved finance on supporting
the adaptation of low-income smallholder farming to
climate change. When paired with IFAD investment
operations, the impact is high. The ASAP experience has
highlighted the need to co-design investments early on,
rather than “retrofit” advanced pipeline projects, and to
ensure that climate interventions are an integral part of the
design, not the subject of a separate process or step.
The Least Developed Countries Fund specifically supports

the least developed countries in adapting to climate
change, by identifying key vulnerabilities and adaptation
needs, as well as raising awareness and sharing
knowledge. The Fund has programmed around 33
percent of its approved finance for agriculture, food
security and sustainable land management outcomes.
The architecture supporting forest conservation has been
designed largely to support the three phases of REDD+,
from REDD+ Readiness to verified emission reductions,
with payments based on results. The main international
multilateral forestry funds include the Forest Investment
Program, the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF),
the Global Environment Facility and the UN-REDD
Programme. The UN-REDD Programme approved an
average of US$15.6 million per year and the FCPF’s
Readiness Fund an average of US$26 million per year
between 2010 and 2014. Both of these dedicated climate
funds offer relatively small grants – of around US$5
million – to partner countries for capacity building and
readiness activities. The Forest Investment Programme has
approved on average US$61.6 million annually between
2010 and 2014, making it one of the most significant
sources of finance for forests. The fund offers bridging
finance between early policy and capacity building
support and efforts to demonstrate successful programmes
that will lead to verified emission reductions on the
ground. Among the national and regional dedicated
funds, the Amazon Fund is the largest source of public
finance for forest conservation programmes in the
Amazon biome.

and adaptation. It is referred to in several
INDCs as a key funding source. As of May 2016,
countries had pledged to the GCF some
US$10.3 billion, of which US$9.9 billion has
been signed over to the Fund. This sum is
expected to rise to at least US$100 billion in
annual climate finance to developing countries
by 2020. Investments in the agricultural sectors
are well aligned with the GCF’s stated priorities
– four of its eight strategic fund-level impacts
are directly linked to the agriculture sectors.
This is further ref lected by the agriculture
sectors being present in four out of the first
eight projects approved by the GCF in
November 2015, and five of the nine projects
approved in June 2016.

Fig ure 17 shows that international public finance
for adaptation and mitigation in the agriculture
sectors averaged US$3.3 billion a year between
2010 and 2014. Available estimates of the cost of
adaptation in agriculture var y widely, but are
generally much higher than available publicly
sourced international climate finance for the
agriculture sectors. The World Bank estimates
adaptation costs for the agricultural sectors alone
at more than US$7 billion per year. These
resources would be needed for investments in
agricultural research, irrigation efficiency and
expansion, and roads, in order to counteract the
effects of climate change on calorie availabilit y
and child malnutrition (Nelson et al., 2010). The
projected cost would be higher if the cost of
improving agricultural extension ser vices were
factored in as part of responding to climate
change. Factoring in the costs of GHG mitigation
that is not obtained as a co-benefit of adaptation
practices would add additional billions of US
dollars per year in financing needs.14 Clearly, the
agriculture sectors will need an increase in the
level of financing that is proportionate to the
adaptation needs and the mitigation ambition of
countries. Not all financing will need to be
international public financing, if other existing
funding sources can be leveraged (see section
6.2). Nonetheless, without adequate international
public climate finance allocated to the agriculture
sectors, such leveraging would be difficult to
implement. Here the potential magnitude of such
funds going forward is assessed.

Beyond the GCF, new pledges were announced at
COP21 in Paris, in December 2015. At least
US$5.6 billion has been pledged to new and
existing initiatives or funds that could be at least
partly eligible for use in support of agricultural,
forestr y and fisheries programmes. Another
US$12.7 billion was pledged for other sectors,
mainly energ y and insurance, and US$126 billion
was pledged without specif ying the target sector.
Information regarding the time period to which
the pledges refer is, however, limited.
Recently, support has grown for cross-cutting
forest and agricultural sector programmes. The
GEF has announced new climate finance
commitments of US$3 billion from across its focal
areas, with at least US$300 million being
dedicated to coastal and marine issues over the
next four years. Another US$250 million will flow
through the GEF’s Sustainable Forest
Management/REDD+ Incentive Mechanism, which
will mobilize US$750 million in grants from other
focal areas to tackle the drivers of deforestation
and forest degradation, while supporting the role
of forests in national and local sustainable
development plans. Some US$45 million will
address the key global drivers of deforestation by
expanding the supply of sustainably managed
commodities, while more than US$116 million will
help to improve food security, strengthen
resilience and enhance carbon sequestration in
sub-Saharan Africa (Box 26).

The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is the largest
international climate fund and aims at
allocating resources evenly between mitigation
14 Based on IPCC’s economic potential for mitigation, presented in
Chapter 4, realizing 1 GtCO2-eq reduction in annual emissions (which is
just a fraction of the economic mitigation potential at the lower cost
estimate of up to US$20 per tonne of CO2-eq) would cost billions of dollars
per year. Reducing emissions from deforestation, which is thought to be
among the most cost-effective options, is still estimated to cost annually
US$4–10 per tonne of CO2-eq reduction, without accounting for
transaction costs (Cattaneo et al., 2010). If countries improve policy
coherence with climate objectives, then financial costs may be lower, but
some trade-offs will remain that require financing.

The capacity challenge:
from commitment to action

countries have been ver y successful in securing
funds, for most of them disbursement
constraints remain a challenge that also
hinders the attainment of objectives and
impacts (see Fig ure 18, and Norman and
Nakhooda, 2014).

Even though estimates are uncertain, there is
clearly a wide gap between financing needs and
available resources for addressing climate risks
to agriculture. Availabilit y of resources is not
the only constraint many developing countries
face, however. Many countries encounter
difficulties in accessing funding and in
effectively deploying the resources that they
have obtained.

An example of the challenges posed by the
approval process is provided by the Green
Climate Fund. Its project approvals have been
fewer than anticipated. Funding for the first
eight projects approved in November 2015
amounted to only US$168 million, with total
project costs of US$624 million. The GCF Board
has set a target of committing US$2.5 billion in
funding in 2016; in June 2015, nine projects
with a value of US$257 million in GCF
resources and total cost of US$585 million,
were approved. The low approval level is
indicative of the challenges the GCF is facing as
a new institution, the capacit y constraints of
the direct access entities and at the national
level, staffing constraints in the GCF
Secretariat, and the rigorous project
preparation requirements that did not
disting uish between project t y pe and size.

The OECD (2015b) notes six major challenges
countries face in accessing climate change
adaptation finance: (a) a low level of awareness
of the need for adaptation and of relevant
sources of funding; (b) difficult y in meeting
funds’ procedures and standards for accessing
finance; (c) low level of capacit y to design and
develop projects/programmes and monitor and
evaluate progress; (d) limited availabilit y of and
access to climate information; (e) a lack of
coherent policies, legal and reg ulator y
frameworks and budgets; and (f ) a lack of clear
priorities identified through transparent
multistakeholder processes.

A number of decisions have been taken that
should expedite the preparation and approval
of GCF projects. A comprehensive readiness
programme and preparator y support
programme have been put in place to
strengthen the capacities of national
designated authorities and national entities,
and steps have been taken to increase GCF
staff from 45 to 100 by the end of 2016. At its
June 2016 meeting, the GCF Board approved
the operational g uidelines for its Project
Preparation Facilit y and a simplified procedure
for micro-scale and small-scale funding
proposals that are assessed as low risk or no
risk. These new procedures should accelerate
the project approval process.

Problems may also arise after having accessed
funds, during the implementation phase. For
example, allocating and approving finance
requires time, and many countries face capacity
constraints in the effective management of funds.
The constraints include the low absorptive
capacity of low-income countries’ public financial
systems, which slows the rate of disbursement.
Reporting by all donor sources indicates that
commitments to the agriculture sectors are
significantly higher than disbursements.
Disbursements or finance released to a recipient
or implementing agent is usually structured to
be released over the life cycle of the project and
often lags behind commitment levels.
Multilateral donors have a more protracted
disbursement timeframe, the result of lengthy
processes for programme approval and
implementation, and equally lengthy processes
for transferring funds. While a number of

Capacit y constraints, which affect both
providers and recipients of funds, will need to
be addressed if agricultural climate finance is to
have a truly catalytic effect in terms of
enhancing resilience and the sustainabilit y of
agriculture, forestr y and land use. n

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2016

MAKING A LITTLE
GO FAR: USING
CLIMATE FINANCE
STRATEGICALLY

As highlighted in Chapter 5, there is a continued
need to support the development of policies and
institutions to facilitate and secure public and
private investment for rural development.
Climate change accentuates the need for strong
institutions that support integrated management
of natural resources and collective action. This
also applies to policies and programmes
dedicated to the prevention and management of
specific climate risks and v ulnerabilities, such as
increased rainfall variabilit y, extreme weather
events and upsurges in plant pests and animal
diseases. Early warning systems and mechanisms
for sharing information along the food value
chain will be critical to the success of climatesmart agricultural development.

International public finance tagged for climate
change will probably remain a fraction of overall
investment in agriculture. To achieve impact in
increasing farming systems resilience or reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, climate finance must
focus on using strategic leverage points to direct
broader financing volumes towards climate
outcomes. In particular, public funds should be
oriented towards:

Policies and institutions that provide appropriate
information and incentives to food producers are
often weak in responding to climate-related
extreme events, or in overcoming barriers to the
adoption of climate-smart farming practices. In
the former case, carefully designed social
protection programmes that guarantee a minimum
income or access to food have an important role to
play within a broader agricultural risk
management strateg y. As discussed in Chapter 3,
improving smallholders’ access to financial
services will be important in supporting their
efforts to address climate change.

 reinforcing the enabling environment needed
to overcome barriers to the adoption of
climate-smart agriculture;
 supporting the mainstreaming of climate
change adaptation and mitigation efforts in
domestic budgets; and
 unlocking private capital for climate-smart
agricultural investment.

Financing the enabling
environment for climate-smart
agricultural development

With a better enabling environment, also limited
international public finance can act as a catalyst to
galvanize commitments from other public and
private sector sources. The broad coalition of nongovernmental organizations and private
corporations which signed the New York Declaration
on Forests, in 2014, is one example of the catalytic
role public finance can play. The coalition seeks to
reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases by
between 4.5 and 8.8 Gt annually (Conway et al.,
2015). The public financing of efforts to reduce
emissions from deforestation is likely to have played
a role in catalysing this private sector participation
by lowering risks linked to country participation,
and improving country readiness in terms of the
necessary institutional frameworks.

International funding for the agriculture sectors
has a significant focus on capacity development,
including policy and administrative management
and institutional strengthening across all the
agriculture sectors. At the same time, capacity
constraints are a major obstacle to the
effectiveness of all climate finance mechanisms.
This applies to funds such as the GEF and the
GCF, where a major impediment to impact is the
high cost of project development. However, even
after projects are prepared and approved,
disbursing funds and bringing projects to
fruition can also be a challenge. Readiness funds
and programmes may help strengthen the
capacity of national and regional entities to
receive and manage climate financing.

A core goal expressed by the private sector through
the declaration is the elimination of deforestation

CHAPTER 6 FINANCING THE WAY FORWARD

associated with the production of agricultural
commodities such as palm oil, soy, paper and beef
products by 2020. Large institutional investors are
also redirecting investments to align them with
climate objectives, such as reducing emissions
from deforestation. For example, the Norwegian
Pension Fund has begun to divest shares in
companies associated with unsustainable palm oil
production, which can be viewed as an alignment
of private financing with global climate change
mitigation objectives.

countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific,
highlights the fact that agriculture is ver y
prominent, second only to public works and
transport, with water and irrigation being
another prominent expenditure area. Significant
shares of climate-relevant expenditures are
channelled through local governments. The
effective use of funds channelled this way
requires adequate coordination with national
policies and improved implementation capacities
at the local level. The review showed that, while
countries had made significant progress in
establishing national climate policies, there had
been limited integration with sector and subnational policy, leading to a lack of coherence in
how climate change is addressed. Mechanisms to
ensure that policy priorities were ref lected in
public expenditure programmes were also
lacking, as were (although some progress was
noted) frameworks that assessed the performance
of climate spending. As with international
funding mechanisms, capacit y – both technical
and operational – remains an overarching
challenge in many contexts (UNDP, 2015).

Mainstreaming climate
change in domestic budgets
Domestic government budgets are a key source of
climate-relevant public finance. They constitute a
much more significant source of public investment
in agriculture than providers of international public
climate finance. No comprehensive assessment is
available to track climate finance from domestic
budgets, and there is no agreed classification
system for national climate budget tagging that
permits international comparisons or aggregation.
However, evidence from 11 countries indicates that
domestic resources are a significant and, in some
cases, even a dominant part of climate change
expenditure (UNDP, 2015). Furthermore, there may
be rural development funds that, strictly speaking,
would not fall under climate financing but are
“climate-relevant” in the sense that, through the
pursuit of other policy objectives, they may
influence climate change outcomes in areas such as
resilience or levels of GHG emissions.

To ensure the full mainstreaming of climate
change in public expenditure, the UNDP review
recommends the adoption of a comprehensive
climate financing or fiscal framework which
includes: planning and costing climate change
strategies and actions in the medium and longer
term; employing a whole-of-government
approach engaging all relevant stakeholders;
bringing public sources of climate finance
(domestic and international) into the national
planning and budgeting system, to be delivered
through countr y systems; and aligning private
sources of climate finance with the overall policy
framework. A number of countries have started
making headway in strengthening their
investment appraisal mechanisms to integrate
climate change (Box 27).

For climate-related policy goals to be achieved,
domestic budgets for agricultural investments need
to reflect the systematic integration of climate
change considerations into policies and planning,
as outlined in Chapter 5. In this respect,
agricultural support policies need to be considered
in the broader context of climate policy. For
example, input subsidies may induce the inefficient
use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, and
increase the emission intensity of production.

Countr y-study evidence highlights the need for
capacit y development to allow governments to
move towards the systematic integration of
climate change action into their budgets (UNDP,
2015). Dedicated climate finance should support
the strengthening of national systems and
capacit y for mainstreaming. This includes:

INTEGRATING CLIMATE CHANGE INTO ECONOMIC
APPRAISALS
(Government of Thailand, 2014). An assessment of a
major new investment in improved water distribution
and diversion resulted not only in enhanced budget
justification for the project but also informed redesign
of diversion canals and flood control systems (UNDP,
2015).
In Cambodia, piloting of a similar approach in the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries suggests
that the effectiveness of programmes managed by the
Ministry could be substantially improved when climate
change is taken into account. The analysis could
support requests for funding from the Ministry of
Economy and Finance, which introduced in 2016 a
requirement in the national budget guidelines that
climate-relevant programmes be identified (see
Cambodia Climate Change Alliance, 2015 and
Government of Cambodia, 2016).

Thailand’s Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives
has spearheaded the country’s budget mainstreaming
effort, moving from a qualitative assessment of the
climate relevance of policies and programmes to a
quantitative approach using cost-benefit analysis. The
benefit-cost ratio (BCR) for a given policy is
recalculated capturing the impact and associated costs
of climate change. The difference between the BCR in
a climate change and a “business–as-usual” scenario
leads to a climate change relevance score, which
provides an indication to policy-makers and managers
of the change in importance of a particular
programme if climate change is factored in. Pilot
analysis suggests that the consideration of climate
change increases the benefit of programmes managed
by the Ministry by between 10 and 20 percent. The
results also highlight opportunities to improve design

FINANCING INSTITUTIONS
development challenges and priorities and into
resulting programmes. All new operations are to be
screened for short- and long term climate change and
disaster risks and, where risks exist, they will be
addressed with appropriate resilience measures.
Screening tools have been developed for the national
policy level, along with project-level tools and a
specific sector tool for agriculture. The tools are
designed to help increase the effectiveness and
longevity of investments.
To complement screening and facilitate the
development of appropriate solutions, the World Bank,
in partnership with a wide range of organizations, has
also enhanced the availability of datasets, tools and
knowledge to support climate-smart development
planning. Climate risk screening is now applied to all
IDA projects, and will be extended to other World
Bank operations in early 2017. The Bank’s 2016
Climate Change Action Plan recognizes climate
change as a threat to its core mission of poverty
reduction, and makes a commitment to moving from
early screening to ex-ante planning with a climate
lens, in support of countries’ INDC/NDC
implementation (World Bank, 2016).

As the importance of climate change and its crosscutting nature has gained increasing recognition in the
development community, international financing
institutions have begun to develop specific
approaches, tools and protocols to integrate climate
change considerations into planning and
implementation. Recent joint public commitments
highlight convergence around key principles and
greater ambition. In December 2015, a group of 26
major financial institutions adopted five voluntary
“Principles to mainstream climate action within
financial institutions” (World Bank, 2015):
 commit to climate strategies;
 manage climate risks;
 promote climate-smart objectives;
 improve climate performance; and
 account for climate action.
Specific implementation approaches are illustrated by
the example of the World Bank. The International
Development Association (IDA), the part of the Bank
that helps the world’s poorest countries, has committed
to incorporating climate and disaster risk
considerations into the analysis of countries’

adequate and sufficient finance, which could
unleash the full potential of private investment,
remains a significant constraint for smallholder
farmers and agricultural small and medium
enterprises (SMEs). The main challenges are the
transaction costs of lending to small-scale and
dispersed customers with little or no financial
literacy, information gaps and asymmetries
regarding what constitutes viable funding
propositions in agriculture, and the management of
actual and perceived risks. A key challenge, and one
which will be exacerbated by expected increases in
climate variability, is the inability of both farmers
and financiers to fully manage the impacts of

and related institutional roles, to identif y
and address bottlenecks – in policies,
incentives and institutions – that impede an
integrated approach to climate change;
 strengthening the capacit y of relevant
institutions and stakeholders at national and
sub-national levels, particularly the technical
and functional expertise needed to translate
policies into programmes and budgets, and
track and assess performance; and
 enhancing transparency frameworks to
demonstrate results and ensure
accountabilit y.
Further work is needed to improve methodologies
for climate-relevant public expenditure reviews
and effectiveness assessments, and to develop
practical guidelines and tools that countries can
adapt to their specific circumstances, including
the integration of climate change in costeffectiveness analyses and investment appraisal.
In defining nationally appropriate investment
design and appraisal mechanisms, governments
can also draw on the experience of international
financing institutions that have already developed
approaches and protocols to mainstream climate
change in their portfolios (Box 28).

Adjusting food production systems to respond to
climate change will require substantial upfront
investments in increasing farmers’ productivit y
and their capacit y to adapt, while reducing the
emission intensit y of production. This requires
not only a significant increase in the amount of
capital available but also longer maturities (of 5
to 7 years) and more f lexible repayment
schedules that are adjusted to cash f lows. That
would allow farmers to undertake the necessar y
investments to maintain current yields, produce
more food on less land, and adopt practices and
technologies that would increase resilience while
also reducing emissions.

Efforts to enhance the integration of climate
change into domestic budgets should always be
aligned within ongoing efforts to strengthen
public financial and expenditure management.
Just as climate change should not be considered a
stand-alone issue, climate change budget
mainstreaming needs to be addressed in the
context of a countr y’s overall financial
management systems.

Climate finance can help address the constraints
that prevent financial service providers from
offering the types of financial services that
smallholders and SMEs require to undertake
climate-smart investments. It can play a catalytic
role by unlocking other sources of private capital
and supporting the agriculture sector in becoming
part of the solution to climate change. By filling
the financing gap and catalysing investment that
would not happen without the right enabling
conditions, climate finance can strengthen risk
management mechanisms, foster development of
appropriate financial products, and address the
capacity constraints of both lenders and borrowers.
Through strategic support, climate finance can
demonstrate the viability of climate-smart
agricultural investments to private investors and
banks that remain reluctant to expand their
lending into agriculture.

In particular, climate finance can support the design
of innovative mechanisms to leverage additional
sources of capital, from both public and private
sources, which can be directed towards climatesmart investments. These mechanisms include:
 fostering public-private partnerships to
leverage the resources, expertise and capacities
of different stakeholders. These partnerships
can bridge the gap between potential investors
and SMEs, or farmers who individually can
neither approach investors nor make a strong
case for their investment proposals;
 designing and piloting innovative investment
vehicles that can help to attract additional
capital by diversif ying and managing the risk
return profile of different investors (e.g.
layered capital structures in which public
finance can absorb risks related to climate
change, or extend repayment rates to better
match project cash f lows); and
 supporting the development and bundling of a
wider range of financial instruments to
increase effectiveness and provide more
holistic and comprehensive solutions. These
include insurance products, warehouse receipts
and value chain finance.

Climate finance could also fund the technical
assistance that is critically needed by actors in
the financial system to enhance their capacit y to
manage agricultural risks, and to address the
specific requirements of smallholders and SMEs,
whose business and financial management skills
should also be strengthened so that they can take
advantage of emerging financing options.
Capacit y support should focus on strengthening
the skills of borrowers and lenders in identif ying
and implementing investments that enhance
climate resilience and, where possible, contribute
to emission reductions. Capacit y support to
lenders would focus on enhancing their
understanding of risks in the agriculture sectors
and developing customized agricultural financial
products and ser vices to support investments.
Transaction costs will continue to provide a
challenge to agricultural finance for the
foreseeable future. However, by taking advantage
of the trend towards mobile financial ser vices,
climate finance can support and further
strengthen the development and roll-out of those
ser vices that address the needs of smallholders
and SMEs for climate-smart investments in
remote areas. n

CONCLUSIONS
Much more needs to be done to strengthen the
enabling environment for climate-smart
agricultural investments, mainstream climate
change considerations in domestic budget
allocations and implementation, and unlock
private capital for climate-smart agricultural
development. International climate finance can
be used strategically to leverage domestic public
funds and private sector financing, as well as
additional international public resources.
It is still not clear what proportion of new pledges to
climate financing will be directed to supporting
adaptation and mitigation action in the agriculture

sectors, but the amounts may be significant. The
transition to sustainable, resilient, climate-smart
food and agricultural systems requires adaptation to
climate change and a commitment to climate
change mitigation throughout the agriculture
sectors. The transition will depend on action by
policy-makers, civil society, farmers, herders,
foresters and fisherfolk, as well as stakeholders
along the food and agriculture value chains
worldwide. It is vital to ensure that the climate
finance available to the agriculture sectors is
commensurate with the role the sector must play in
ensuring food security and responding to the
challenge of climate change today and in the future.

datasets that are used to understand
international public finance for climate
change mitigation and adaptation in the
agricultural sector. These are the OECD’s
Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and the
Climate Fund Update (CFU) of the Overseas
Development Institute (ODI), United
Kingdom.
The CRS data cover some dedicated climate
funds as well as bilateral and multilateral
commitments directed at climate change
adaptation and mitigation. The CFU data
focus on dedicated multilateral climate
funds, which have been expressly set up to
address climate change. For climate finance
directed towards the agricultural sector, the
CRS include many, but not all, of the
dedicated climate funds considered by the
CFU. The CRS data also include the
climate-related portion of general
development funds from multilateral
institutions, whereas the CFU data do not
include any finance from general
development funds (see Table). The CRS
includes bilateral donors’ funds; these are
outside of the scope of the CFU.

Both the datasets are also lacking in
terms of their comprehensiveness. For
example, the OECD CRS dataset does not
include all donor countries; it is limited to
the assistance committed by OECD
member states and thus exclude
assistance from countries such as China.
In addition, there is a lack of information
on the extent to which projects and
finance reported are entirely supporting
climate outcomes. Numerous issues have
been raised in terms of how projects are
desig nated (“tagged”) as supporting
climate change adaptation and/or
mitigation (Caravani, Nakhooda and
Terpstra, 2014; Michaelowa and
Michaelowa, 2011).

As with any datasets, there are some clear
limitations to using the CRS and CFU data

STATISTICAL ANNEX
NOTES ON
THE ANNEX TABLES

Geographical location is the province, state,
countr y or region to which the estimate of change
in crop yield refers, using the wording and
geographical classifications found in the original
dataset. Some estimates are for the global level.
The following notation is used: (1) the estimate is
considered to be for a location in a developed
region; (2) estimate for a location in a developing
region; and (3) the location is global or
unspecified.

KEY
The following conventions are used in the tables:
.. = data not available

Period refers to the mid-projection year –
calculated from the starting year to the latest year
in the simulation – and considers the time period
to which it belongs. For instance, estimates from
a study written in 2010 may be projections for
2050 and 2080; in this instance the midpoint is
considered to be 2065 and the estimates are
grouped accordingly in the bin 2050 – 69.

0 or 0.0 = nil or negligible
blank cell = not applicable
Numbers presented in the tables may differ from
the original data sources because of rounding or
data processing. To separate decimals from whole
numbers a full point (.) is used.

TECHNICAL NOTES

Crops (estimated yield change) reports the crops
or groups of crops and, in parentheses, the
estimates of the change(s) induced by climate
change in the respective yield(s). Some studies
report more than one estimate for a given
location, time period and crop; this is due to the
use of more than one combination of climate
models, emissions levels, crop models, adaptation
and/or no adaptation.

Notes: Studies came from a broad sur vey of the
literature, which included process-based and
statistical models. There are wide methodological
variations among the studies, which are based on
different climate models, emissions levels and
crop models. Some studies include adaptation,
whereas others do not.

Emissions from agriculture are expressed in
carbon dioxide (CO 2) equivalent and consist of
methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O), produced
by aerobic and anaerobic decomposition
processes in crop and livestock production and
management activities. They are computed at Tier

THE STATE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 2016

TABLE A.3

1 following IPCC Guidelines for National GHG
Inventories. The emissions are estimated as the
product of an activit y level (such as number of
livestock, har vested area, application of fertilizer
or other) and an emissions factor from the IPCC.
They include the following sub-domains: burning
crop residues (CH 4 , N 2 O); burning savanna (CH 4 ,
N 2 O); crop residues (N 2 O); cultivation of organic
soils (N 2 O); enteric fermentation (CH 4); manure
management (CH 4 , N 2 O); manure left on pastures
(N 2 O); manure applied to soils (N 2 O); rice
cultivation (CH 4); and synthetic fertilizers (N 2 O).

Agricultural emissions in CO2 equivalent by
source, 2014
Source: FAO, 2016.

Emissions from burning crop residues consist of
methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O) gases
produced by the combustion of a percentage of
crop residues burned on-site. The mass of fuel
available for burning should be estimated taking
into account the fractions removed before burning
due to animal consumption, decay in the field, and
use in other sectors (e.g. biofuel, domestic
livestock feed, building materials). Emissions are
estimated as the product of an IPCC emissions
factor and activity data (the amount of biomass
burned, which is calculated from harvested area of
wheat, maize, rice and sugarcane).

Emissions/removals from forests consist of CO 2
emissions from the degradation of forest lands
and carbon removals (carbon sink) by land that
has remained forest land from year t – 1 to year t.
At the countr y level, forest data are either
positive (net emissions) or negative (net sinks).

Emissions from burning of savanna consist of
methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) gases
produced from the burning of vegetation biomass
in the following five land cover t y pes: savanna,
woody savanna, open shrublands, closed
shrublands and grasslands. Emissions are
calculated as the IPCC emissions factor times
activit y data (total mass of fuel burned using the
Global Fire Emission Database).

Emissions from net forest conversion are CO 2
emissions resulting from deforestation, or the
conversion of forest land to other uses.
Emissions from burning biomass consist of gases
produced from the burning of biomass for the
following items: humid tropical forest, other
forests, and organic soils. They consist of
methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and, only in
the case of organic soils, also carbon dioxide
(CO 2).

Emissions from crop residues consist of direct
and indirect nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from
nitrogen (N) in crop residues and forage/pasture
renewal left on agricultural fields by farmers.
Direct emissions are estimated as the product of
activit y level (crop yield and har vested area) and
an emissions factor from the IPCC. Crops
considered include barley, beans-dr y, maize,
millet, oats, potatoes, rice-paddy, r ye, sorghum,
soybeans and wheat. Indirect emissions are also
estimated; they are the N in crop residues
forage/pasture renewal that is lost through
runoff and leaching.

Emissions from cropland organic soils are those
associated with carbon losses from drained
organic soils of croplands.
Emissions from grassland organic soils are those
associated with carbon losses from drained
organic soils of grasslands.

STATISTICAL ANNEX

Emissions from rice cultivation consist of
methane gas (CH 4) emitted by anaerobic
decomposition of organic matter in paddy fields.
The emissions are estimated as the product of
activit y level (har vested area of rice paddy) and
an emissions factor from the IPCC.

Emissions from cultivation of organic soils are
those associated with nitrous oxide gas from
cultivated organic soils (both cropland and
grassland organic soils). Emissions are
estimated as the product of activit y level (area
of cultivated organic soils) and an emissions
factor from the IPCC.

Emissions from synthetic fertilizers consist of
direct and indirect nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions
from nitrogen (N) added to agricultural soils by
farmers. The emissions are estimated as the
product of activit y level (application of nitrogen
fertilizer) and an emissions factor from the IPCC.

Emissions from enteric fermentation consist of
methane gas (CH 4) produced in digestive systems
of livestock (both ruminants and non-ruminants).
The emissions are estimated as the product of
activit y level (number of livestock) and an
emissions factor from the IPCC. Livestock
considered include buffaloes, sheep, goats,
camels, llamas, horses, mules, asses, pigs, dair y
and non-dair y cattle and poultr y.

COUNTRY GROUPS AND REGIONAL
AGGREGATES
Tables A.2 and A.3 present countr y groups and
regional aggregates for all indicators. They are
calculated for the countr y groupings and regions
as described below. World and regional totals
may differ slightly from those available in
FAOSTAT.

Emissions from manure management consist of
methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide gases from
aerobic and anaerobic decomposition processes.
The emissions are estimated as the product of
activit y level (number of livestock) and an
emissions factor from the IPCC. Livestock
considered include buffaloes, sheep, goats,
camels, llamas, horses, mules, asses, ducks,
turkeys, dair y and non-dair y cattle, chickens
(layers and broilers) and market and breeding
swine.

For Tables A.2 and A.3, as well as some fig ures
and tables in the text, regional groupings and the
designation of developing and developed regions
follow a similar classification to the UNSD M49
classification of the United Nations Statistics
Division, available at unstats.un.org/unsd/
methods/m49/m49.htm.

Emissions from manure left on pastures consist of
direct and indirect nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions
from manure nitrogen (N) left on pastures by
grazing livestock. Livestock data cover the
following animal categories: buffaloes, sheep,
goats, camels, llamas, horses, mules, asses,
ducks, turkeys, dair y and non-dair y cattle,
chickens (layers and broilers) and market and
breeding swine.

The main difference is that “Countries and
territories in developed regions”, as used here,
includes countries designated as being in
developed regions by the UNSD M49, as well as
countries in Central Asia (Kazakhstan,
Kyrg yzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and
Uzbekistan). Data for China, mainland exclude
data for Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region of China and Macao Special
Administrative Region of China. n

Emissions from manure applied to soils consist of
direct and indirect nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions
from manure nitrogen (N) added to agricultural
soils by farmers. Livestock data cover the
following animal categories: buffaloes, sheep,
goats, camels, llamas, horses, mules, asses,
ducks, turkeys, dair y and non-dair y cattle,
chickens (layers and broilers) and market and
breeding swine.

THE STATE
OF FOOD AND
AGRICULTURE
CLIMATE CHANGE, AGRICULTURE
AND FOOD SECURITY
Unless action is taken now to make agriculture more sustainable, productive and resilient, climate
change impacts will seriously compromise food production in countries and regions that are already
highly food-insecure. The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015, represents a new beginning
in the global effort to stabilize the climate before it is too late. It recognizes the importance of food
security in the international response to climate change, as reflected by many countries focusing
prominently on the agriculture sector in their planned contributions to adaptation and mitigation.
To help put those plans into action, this report identifies strategies, financing opportunities, and data
and information needs. It also describes transformative policies and institutions that can overcome
barriers to implementation.
