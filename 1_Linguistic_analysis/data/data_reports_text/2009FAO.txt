Food Insecurity in the World
Economic crises – impacts and lessons learned

Key messages
The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2009 is FAO’s tenth
progress report on world hunger since the 1996 World Food
Summit (WFS). This report highlights the fact that, even before the
food crisis and the economic crisis, the number of hungry people
had been increasing slowly but steadily. With the onset of these
crises, however, the number of hungry people in the world
increased sharply.
As a result of the global economic crisis, developing countries
are facing declines in remittances, export earnings, foreign direct
investment and foreign aid, leading to loss of employment and

Even before the food and economic crises, hunger was
on the rise. The World Food Summit target of reducing the
number of undernourished people by half to no more than
420 million by 2015 will not be reached if the trends that
prevailed before those crises continue.
FAO estimates that 1.02 billion people are undernourished worldwide in 2009. This represents more hungry
people than at any time since 1970 and a worsening of the
unsatisfactory trends that were present even before the
economic crisis. The increase in food insecurity is not a result of
poor crop harvests but because high domestic food prices,
lower incomes and increasing unemployment have reduced
access to food by the poor. In other words, any beneﬁts from
falling world cereal prices have been more than offset by the
global economic downturn.
In trying to cope with the burden of consecutive food
and economic crises, poor people reduce their dietary
diversity and spending on essential items such as
education and health care. These coping mechanisms were
strained during the food crisis, and the poor will now be forced
to draw on their meagre assets even more deeply, creating
poverty traps and negatively affecting longer-term food
security. Infant mortality will increase, with girls being more
affected than boys.
A healthy agriculture sector can provide an economic and
employment buffer in times of crisis, especially in poorer
countries. However, past experience of economic crises
suggests that investment in agriculture may soon decline.
This must be avoided so that agriculture can play its role as an
engine of growth and poverty reduction and act as the
longer-term pillar of the twin-track approach to ﬁghting
hunger. Indeed, increased investment in agriculture during the
1970s and 1980s helped reduce the number of
undernourished. Due attention must also be given to
developing the rural non-farm sector in parallel with
agriculture, which is another key pathway out of poverty and
food insecurity.

income. This loss of income is compounded by food prices that are
still relatively high in the local markets of many poor countries.
As a result, poor households have been forced to eat fewer meals
and less-nutritious food, cut back on health and education expenses,
and sell their assets.
Despite the ﬁnancial constraints faced by governments around
the world, agricultural investment and safety nets remain key parts
of an effective response to reduce food insecurity both now and in
the future.

Safety-net interventions should address the immediate
impact on the vulnerable while also providing
sustainable solutions to the underlying problems. As the
shorter-term pillar of the twin-track approach, safety nets must
enable recipients to become more credit-worthy and more able
to access modern inputs and adopt new technologies, thus
allowing them to graduate from the safety-net programme. To
achieve these goals, safety nets should be well integrated with
broader social assistance programmes. The urban poor, in
particular, will need help, as they were hurt severely by the
food crisis and are now most likely to suffer unemployment
because of the economic crisis.
The fact that hunger was increasing even before the food
and economic crises suggests that present solutions are
insufﬁcient and that a right-to-food approach has an
important role to play in eradicating food insecurity. To
lift themselves out of hunger, the food-insecure need control
over resources, access to opportunities, and improved
governance at the international, national and local levels.

his report comes at a time of severe economic crisis. Countries across the globe are seeing their
economies slow and recede. No nation is immune and, as usual, it is the poorest countries –
and the poorest people – that are suffering the most. As a result of the economic crisis,
estimates reported in this edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the World show that, for the first
time since 1970, more than one billion people – about 100 million more than last year and around onesixth of all of humanity – are hungry and undernourished worldwide.
The current crisis is historically unprecedented, with several factors converging to make it
particularly damaging to people at risk of food insecurity. First, it overlaps with a food crisis that in
2006–08 pushed the prices of basic staples beyond the reach of millions of poor people. And,
although they have retreated from their mid-2008 highs, international food commodity prices remain
high by recent historical standards and volatile. Also, domestic prices have been slower to fall. At the
end of 2008, domestic staple food prices remained, on average, 17 percent higher in real terms than
two years earlier. The price increases had forced many poor families to sell assets or sacrifice health
care, education or food just to stay afloat. With their resources stretched to breaking point, those
households will find it difficult to ride out the economic storm.
Second, the crisis is affecting large parts of the world simultaneously. Previous economic crises that
hit developing countries tended to be confined to individual countries, or several countries in a
particular region. In such situations, affected countries made recourse to various instruments such as
currency devaluation, borrowing or increased use of official assistance to face the effects of the crisis.
In a global crisis, the scope of such instruments becomes more limited.
Third, with developing countries today more financially and commercially integrated into the world
economy than they were 20 years ago, they are far more exposed to shocks in international markets.
Indeed, many countries have experienced across-the-board drops in their trade and financial inflows,
and have seen their export earnings, foreign investment, development aid and remittances falling.
This situation will conspire not only to cull employment opportunities, but also to reduce the money
available for government programmes that are indispensable to promoting growth and supporting
those in need.
Faced with the crisis, households are forced to find ways to cope. Coping mechanisms involve
undesirable but often unavoidable compromises, such as replacing more-nutritious food with lessnutritious food, selling productive assets, withdrawing children from school, forgoing health care or
education, or simply eating less. Based on direct interviews with people who are most affected by food
insecurity, country case studies conducted by the World Food Programme (WFP) included in this year’s
report give an insight into how households are affected by the fall in remittances and other impacts of
the economic downturn. The case studies also show how governments are responding to the crisis by
investing in agriculture and infrastructure and expanding safety nets. These interventions will help to
save lives and families, although given the severity of the crisis, much more needs to be done.
If global food security is to be achieved and sustained as soon as possible, the twin-track approach
supported by FAO, WFP, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and their
development partners will be crucial. This strategy seeks to address both the shorter-term acute
hunger spurred by food or economic shocks and the longer-term chronic hunger that is symptomatic
of extreme poverty.
To help hungry people now, safety nets and social-protection programmes must be created or
improved to reach those most in need. Among these, national food safety-net programmes, such as
school feeding or voucher programmes, should be designed to stimulate the local economy by creating
jobs and increasing agriculture and local value-added food production. In addition, they should
integrate best practices so as to be affordable and sustainable, with handover plans embedded
and scalable in the face of crises and shocks. At the same time, small-scale farmers need access to
modern inputs, resources and technologies – such as high-quality seeds, fertilizers, feed and farming
tools and equipment – that will allow them to boost productivity and production. This should, in turn,
lower food prices for poor consumers, both rural and urban.
To ensure that hunger is conquered in the years to come, developing countries must be assisted
with the development, economic and policy tools required to boost their agriculture sectors in terms of
both productivity and resilience in the face of crises. Stable and effective policies, regulatory and
institutional mechanisms, and functional market infrastructures that promote investment in the
agriculture sector are paramount. Investments in food and agricultural science and technology need to

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

be stepped up. Without robust agricultural systems and stronger global food-security governance
mechanisms, many countries will continue to struggle to increase production in line with demand,
move food to where it is needed and find foreign exchange to finance their food import requirements.
Whenever possible, efforts should be integrated and produce a multiplier effect. For instance, local
purchase of produce for school meals can generate income and guaranteed markets for smallholder
farmers – both men and women – while community grain reserves can serve as a local food safety net.
The food crisis has propelled agriculture and food security, especially in developing countries, back
onto the front pages of newspapers and the top of policy-makers’ agendas. The Joint Statement on
Global Food Security (“L’Aquila Food Security Initiative”) produced by the G8 with partner
governments, agencies and institutions, is a testimony to this renewed commitment of the global
community. Nevertheless, there is a risk that a preoccupation with stagnating developed country
economies and failing corporations due to the financial and economic crisis will shift resources away
from the plight of the poorer countries. Yet food, the most basic of all human needs, is no more
affordable, leaving more and more people without the means to consistently obtain nutritious food
throughout the year. Indeed, if the food crisis was about higher prices, the economic crisis is about
lower household incomes, which can be even more devastating, aggravating already unacceptable
levels of food insecurity and poverty.
Past economic crises have typically led to declines in public investment in agriculture. However,
history tells us that there is no greater engine for driving growth and thereby reducing poverty and
hunger than investing in agriculture, complemented by programmes that ensure people can access the
food that is produced. Despite the difficult global economic conditions, support to agriculture should
not be reduced; indeed, it must be increased. A healthy agriculture sector, combined with a growing
non-farm economy and effective safety nets and social-protection programmes, including food safety
nets and nutrition-assistance programmes, is a proven way to eradicate poverty and food insecurity in a
sustainable manner.
This year’s State of Food Insecurity in the World is a true collaborative effort between our two
organizations, combining our different strengths to create new insights and a publication that
benefited tremendously from our joint cooperation. Collaboration with the United States Department
of Agriculture on certain parts of the report has also been instrumental and is highly valued; we thank
them for their efforts and willingness to share their expertise.

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2009 was prepared under the overall leadership of Hafez
Ghanem, Assistant Director-General, and the guidance of the management team of the Economic and
Social Development Department. The technical coordination of the publication was carried out by
David Dawe, who was also the technical editor of the report, Kostas Stamoulis and Keith Wiebe of the
Agricultural Development Economics Division (ESA). The staff of the Statistics Division (ESS) generated
the underlying data on undernourishment, including the estimates for 2008.
This is the first edition of this report that has been jointly prepared by FAO and the World Food
Programme (WFP). Valerie Guarnieri, Director of Programme and Design, and David Stevenson, Director
of Policy, Planning and Strategy, both from WFP, provided valuable insights and support. Joyce Luma
and Arif Husain of WFP served on the Editorial Board.
The chapter “Undernourishment around the world” was prepared by the Economic and Social
Development Department with key technical contributions provided by Gustavo Anriquez, André
Croppenstedt, Ali Arslan Gürkan, Mark Smulders and Alberto Zezza (ESA); and Cheng Fang, Kisan
Gunjal and Henri Josserand of the Trade and Markets Division (EST). The main text in the section
“Quantifying the food security impacts of the economic crisis”, along with the box on “Impact of
higher prices on African producers” was contributed by Shahla Shapouri and Stacey Rosen of the
Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Michael Hamp of
the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) contributed the box on microcredit.
The chapter on case studies was prepared by WFP under the technical coordination of Joyce Luma.
Claudia Ah Poe, Jean-Martin Bauer, Henk-Jan Brinkman, Monica Cadena, Mariana Castillo, Agnes
Dhur, Arif Husain, Alima Mahama, Adriana Moreno and Issa Sanogo, all from WFP, contributed the
specific country case studies along with Lorena Aguilar of the Famine Early Warning System Network
(FEWSNET).
The chapter “Towards eliminating hunger” was prepared by the Economic and Social Development
Department with key technical contributions from Gustavo Anriquez, Mark McGuire and Julian Thomas
(ESA); Ugo Gentilini (WFP) on safety nets and Jean Balié, Barbara Ekwall, and Mauricio Rosales on the
right to food. Boxes on Brazil were contributed by Carlos Santana from Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural
Research Corporation) and Flavio Valente, Secretary-General of the FoodFirst Information and Action
Network (FIAN).
Ricardo Sibrian produced the Technical annex with support from Cinzia Cerri, Seevalingum
Ramasawmy and Nathalie Troubat in ESS.
Valuable external comments, suggestions and inputs from John Hoddinott (International Food Policy
Research Institute [IFPRI]), Richard King (Oxfam GB) and Nancy Mock (Tulane University) were extremely
helpful, as were comments from Luca Alinovi (ESA), Lorenzo Giovanni Bellù (Policy Assistance and
Resource Mobilization Division) and Marie-Claude Dop (Nutrition and Consumer Protection Division).
Adam Barclay made major improvements to the readability of the publication. Anna Antonazzo,
Marina Pelaghias, Anne Rutherford and Sandra Stevens provided excellent administrative support, and
Aminata Bakouan, Katia Covarrubias, Federica Di Marcantonio, Panagiotis Karfakis, Rafik Mahjoubi
and Cristian Morales-Opazo provided invaluable research support.

Hunger has been on the rise for the past decade

ven before the consecutive food and economic
crises,1 the number of undernourished people in the
world had been increasing slowly but steadily for a
decade (Figure 1). The most recent FAO undernourishment
data covering all countries in the world show that this trend
continued into 2004–06.2 Thus, no progress was being made
towards the World Food Summit hunger reduction target
(see box), even before the two consecutive crises made the
situation substantially worse. This is especially disappointing
because, in the 1980s and early 1990s, good progress had
been made in reducing chronic hunger.
The number of hungry people increased between 1995–
97 and 2004–06 in all regions except Latin America and the
Caribbean. Even in this region, however, the downward
trend was reversed because of the food and economic crises
(Figure 2). While the proportion of undernourished
continually declined from 1990–92 to 2004–06, the decline
was much slower than the pace needed to meet the hungerreduction target of the first Millennium Development Goal
(MDG).

What is food security and what are the hunger reduction targets?

■ Food security exists when all people, at all times,
have physical, social and economic access to sufficient,
safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs
and food preferences for an active and healthy life.
Household food security is the application of this
concept to the family level, with individuals within
households as the focus of concern.

■ Food insecurity exists when people do not have
adequate physical, social or economic access to food
as defined above.

■ Undernourishment exists when caloric intake is
below the minimum dietary energy requirement
(MDER). The MDER is the amount of energy needed
for light activity and a minimum acceptable weight for

attained height, and it varies by country and from year
to year depending on the gender and age structure of
the population. Throughout this report, the words
“hunger” and “undernourishment” are used
interchangeably.

■ The World Food Summit goal is to reduce, between
1990–92 and 2015, the number of undernourished
people by half. Millennium Development Goal 1,
target 1C, is to halve, between 1990 and 2015, the
proportion of people who suffer from hunger.

Undernourishment around the world

The global economic crisis: another blow
to the food-insecure and vulnerable
In late 2008, as international food and fuel prices continued
to fall, there was some optimism that the developing
countries might be decoupled from the crisis and recession
that had started in the advanced economies. This proved to
be a false hope, however, and major international
organizations quickly revised their 2009–10 economic
growth projections sharply downward for all parts of the
world, including the developing countries.

■ The current crisis is different from past crises
While developing countries have been hit by many crises in
the past, the current economic turmoil is different in at
least three important aspects. First, the crisis is affecting
large parts of the world simultaneously, and, as such,
traditional coping mechanisms at national and subnational
levels are likely to be less effective than they were in the
past. Previous crises that affected the developing countries
tended to be confined to individual countries or several
countries in a particular region. Under such circumstances,
these countries tended to rely on large exchange-rate
depreciations to help them adjust to macroeconomic
shocks,3 while remittances (money sent home from family
members working in other areas or countries) represented
an important coping mechanism, especially for poorer

households. During the 2009 crisis, however, many
countries have seen a substantial decline in remittance
inflows. The scope for real exchange-rate depreciation is
also more limited in a global crisis, as it is not possible for
the currencies of all developing countries to depreciate
against one another; some must appreciate while others
depreciate. This situation has left developing countries with
less room to adjust to the rapidly changing economic
conditions.
The second key difference is that the current economic
crisis emerged immediately following the food and fuel
crisis of 2006–08. While food commodity prices in world
markets declined substantially in the wake of the financial
crisis, they remained high by recent historical standards.
Also, food prices in domestic markets came down more
slowly, partly because the US dollar, in which most imports
are priced, continued to appreciate for some time, but also,
more importantly, because of lags in price transmission
from world markets to domestic markets. At the end of
2008, domestic prices for staple foods remained, on
average, 17 percent higher in real terms than two years
earlier. This represented a considerable reduction in the
effective purchasing power of poor consumers, who spend
a substantial share of their income (often 40 percent) on
staple foods.

Note: GDP = gross domestic product; FDI = foreign direct investment.

Further, even if domestic food prices eventually return to
previous levels, months of unusually high food and fuel
prices have stretched the coping mechanisms of many poor
families to the brink as they have been forced to draw down
their assets (financial, physical or human) in attempts – not
always successful – to avoid large declines in consumption.
As shown in The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008,
higher food prices hurt most the poorest of the poor,
especially the landless poor and female-headed households
in both urban and rural areas. Higher food and fuel prices
forced families to choose which type of asset to sell first, and
which family member (mother, child or key labourer) should
pay the price in terms of reduced health care, education or
food consumption. Such decisions are especially difficult
given the large share that food represents in the budgets of
the poor and their limited access to credit markets. Whatever
choices were made would have diminished already limited
assets, thus reducing the ability of the most vulnerable
populations to deal with another crisis so soon after the
earlier one. Higher food prices and reduced incomes and
employment mean that, even though aggregate world food
availability was relatively good in 2008 and 2009, access by
the poor to that food has been adversely affected.
The third factor that differentiates this crisis from those of
the past is that developing countries have become more
integrated, both financially and commercially, into the world
economy than they were 20 years ago. As a consequence,
they are more exposed to changes in international markets.
Figure 3 illustrates both the increasing significance of
remittances – their share in gross domestic product (GDP)
during 2000–07 represented a 50 percent increase over that
of the 1990s – and marked increases in foreign direct
investment (FDI – foreign ownership of productive assets,
such as factories, mines and land) and exports.

■ Which groups will be most affected by the
economic crisis?
The economic crisis will negatively affect large segments of
the population in developing countries. The position of those
who were hurt most by higher food prices (the rural landless,
female-headed households and the urban poor) is
particularly precarious because they have already
approached, or in many cases reached, the limit of their
ability to cope during the food crisis. Among these groups,
the urban poor may experience the most severe problems
because lower export demand and reduced FDI are more
likely to cause employment to fall in urban areas, which are
more closely connected to world markets than rural areas.
But rural areas will not be spared – reductions in
employment have caused back-migration from urban to rural
areas, forcing the rural poor to share the burden in many
cases. In some countries, declining prices for specific crops
will add to that burden. Thus, despite the recent fall in food
prices, urban and rural areas have experienced a reduction in
various sources of income, including remittances, diminishing
the overall purchasing power of the poor and food-insecure.

■ Undernourishment estimates for 2008
and 2009
In spite of the negative consequences of the food and fuel
crisis on the world’s poorest and most vulnerable
population groups, better-than-expected global food supply
in 2007–08 has led FAO to revise its earlier estimates of
undernourishment for 2008 down to 915 million (from
963 million). However, based on projections produced by
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Economic Research Service (see Quantifying the food-

security impacts of the economic crisis on page 22), the
economic crisis is expected to increase the number of foodinsecure by about 9 percent in 2009, which comes on top
of a projected baseline increase of 2 percent for 2009 even
in the absence of crisis (see Figure 4 for a regional
breakdown). When applied to the revised FAO
undernourishment estimates, these projections imply that
the number of undernourished in the world will have risen
to 1.02 billion people during 2009, even though
international food commodity prices have declined from
their earlier peaks. If these projections are realized, this will
represent the highest level of chronically hungry people
since 1970.
While the number of hungry people has been increasing
since the mid-1990s, the number of undernourished in the
world was actually declining in the 1970s and 1980s in spite
of relatively rapid population growth during those decades
(Figure 5), and the proportion of undernourished in
developing countries was declining quite rapidly (Figure 6).
At that time, especially in the wake of the global food crisis
of 1973–75, large investments in the agriculture sector
(including for scientific research, rural roads and irrigation)
led to rapid growth in cereal yields (Figure 7) and lower
cereal prices that, in turn, significantly reduced food
insecurity. During those decades, the proportion of official
development assistance (ODA, i.e. development aid
contributed by donor governments) devoted to agriculture
was also relatively high (Figure 8).
During the 1990s and the current decade, however, the
number of undernourished has risen, despite the benefit of
slower population growth, and the proportion of
undernourished increased in 2008 (Figure 6). In the same
period, the proportion of ODA devoted to agriculture
declined substantially; in 2007, after adjusting for inflation,

Source: FAO.

the level of ODA was 37 percent lower than in 1988. Rice
and wheat yield growth has also slowed substantially. Maize
yield growth has increased, but this may be attributable to
the fact that a much greater proportion of research and
development (R&D) for maize is in the hands of the private
sector compared with rice and wheat, and private R&D has
been responsible for an increasingly large share of total R&D.
Given the increased importance of biofuels and the new
linkages between agricultural and energy markets, increased
cereal yields, if achieved, may not necessarily continue to
lead to lower cereal prices. Because the world energy market
is so much larger than the world grain market, grain prices
may be determined by oil prices in the energy market as
opposed to being determined by grain supply. Even if this
proves to be the case, however, higher cereal yields will still

Transmission of the economic crisis
to the developing countries
Economic crises can have severe impacts on poverty and
income levels, which in turn affect food security. An FAO
analysis of six developing countries shows that, in the wake
of the 1995 Mexican peso crisis and the Asian crisis of
1997–98, poverty rates increased by up to 24 percentage
points (e.g. from 35 to 59 percent), with an average of
12 percent. It took the affected countries five to eight years
to recover to pre-crisis poverty rates. Figure 9 illustrates the
cases of three of these countries: Argentina, Mexico and
Thailand. Furthermore, given today’s greater global
integration, economic crises in one country or region can
easily be transmitted to others. For example, after the
1997–98 Asian crisis, GDP fell in 12 of the 17 largest Latin
American economies, with a median drop of 5.4 percent in
real per capita GDP; it took, on average, five years for
countries to restore their pre-crisis income levels.4
Unemployment increased in 15 of the 17 countries, with a
median increase of 4 percentage points, and it took, on
average, eight years for countries to recover to their precrisis employment rates.

■ Countries with large current account deficits,
recurring crises and large food price shocks are
most vulnerable
The degree to which countries are affected by economic
crises that started elsewhere depends on their degree of
integration with international markets for goods and
services, including financial products. Countries with large
current account deficits (which occur when a country’s total
imports of goods, services and transfers is greater than its
total exports of goods, services and transfers) and low levels
of foreign reserves (foreign currency deposits and bonds held
by central banks and monetary authorities) are particularly at
risk, because these deficits are paid for with inflows of
private or public capital, such as FDI, remittances, foreign aid
and borrowing. But these financial inflows can end abruptly:
the 17 largest Latin American economies received
US$184 billion in 2007, which was roughly halved in 2008
to US$89 billion, and is expected to be halved again to
US$43 billion in 2009. A reduction in capital inflows will
mean that consumption must be reduced. For some lowincome food-deficit countries (LIFDCs), adjusting
consumption may mean reducing badly needed food imports
and other imported welfare-related items such as health-care
equipment and medicines.
Countries that have experienced other crises in recent years
are particularly vulnerable to the current crisis because
national and regional crises strain coping systems and often
lead to macroeconomic imbalances. FAO’s Global Information
and Early Warning System (GIEWS), which identifies hotspots
and emergencies every year, has identified 16 countries that
have experienced human-made crises, natural crises or both at
least once in each of the past ten years (Table 1, page 15).
Nearly all these countries have been ranked by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) as highly vulnerable to the
current crisis (only Uganda was considered to be at low risk).
Indeed, these countries constituted a major share of the
26 countries identified by the IMF as highly vulnerable.
Because many low-income countries are also net food
importers, large numbers of poor people in these countries
were vulnerable to the domestic food price increases
experienced during the global food crisis. However, the
extent to which basic food prices rose in low-income
countries – and subsequently fell in late 2008 – was not

Energy price index/Food price index
Sources: FAO and IMF.

As the economic crisis took hold, world commodity prices
plunged across the board. The declines for metals, fuel
and fertilizers were particularly sharp. World food prices
also fell, but not to the same extent. World prices for
beverages (coffee, cocoa, tea) relative to food
commodities actually increased, as beverage prices fell
less than the food price index. Such changes in relative
prices are referred to as changes in the terms of trade (the
relationship between the prices at which a country sells its
exports and the prices it pays for its imports). If the prices
of a country’s exports rise relative to the prices of its
imports, its terms of trade are said to have improved.
Although the fall in metal and energy prices was steep,
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) price indices for
these commodities in the first quarter of 2009, relative to
the FAO food price index, were still well above their
average level from 1992 to 2003 (by 25 and 66 percent,
respectively; see Figure A). Thus, while lower prices
obviously hurt oil and metal exporters, the declines
started from a historical high. To the extent that metaland energy-exporting countries practised prudent
macroeconomic management by saving some of the
windfall earnings and increasing foreign-exchange
reserves, the impact of the recent reduction in prices can
be mitigated.
The ratio of beverage prices to food prices on world
markets started to increase in the second half of 2008
(Figure B), although the ratio remains within normal

historical ranges. Thus, several countries that rely on
earnings from beverage exports to import food seem to
have experienced a slight improvement in their terms of
trade as the economic crisis took hold.
In the case of cotton exporters, the story is more
pessimistic. Cotton prices have been falling relative to
food prices since 2006, and their decline continued into
early 2009 (Figure B). Burkina Faso is one country that has
been particularly hurt by these shifts in the terms of trade.
Economic modelling suggests that the fall in cotton prices
has reduced the purchasing power of households by
3.4 percent. Burkina Faso was also hit hard by the rise in
oil prices from 2004 to mid-2008, although the decline in
the latter half of 2008 provided some relief.1

fully understood until recently. The domestic food price
database compiled by FAO shows that year-on-year price
increases (e.g. January 2007 compared with the same
month a year earlier), even after adjusting for general
inflation, exceeded 48 percent for half of nearly 127 case
studies of domestic grain and bean prices in the developing
countries. Although domestic prices for most countries
declined somewhat during the second half of 2008, in the
vast majority of cases, and in all regions, their decline did
not keep pace with that of international food commodity
prices. At the end of 2008, domestic staple food prices
were still 17 percent higher in real terms than two years
earlier, and this was true across a range of important
foodstuffs (Figure 10).

■ Migration and remittances
It is clear that the current economic crisis is precipitating a
drop in remittances that will result in lower incomes, and
consequent problems, for many. For a significant share of the
population living in developing countries, migration and
subsequent remittances represent an important livelihood
strategy and a source of income for the family members who
stay behind. Officially recorded remittances account for
around US$300 billion, or 2 percent of total GDP of

Variation in remittance income within countries: the case of Nepal

The flow of workers’ remittances into Nepal continuously
increased from 2001–02 to 2007–08 (Figure A).
Remittances tripled from 47.5 billion rupees (Nr) in 2001–
02 to Nr 142 billion in 2007–08 (more than doubling in
real terms).1 On the basis of data provided by the
Nepalese Department of Labour and Employment
Promotion, the number of workers going abroad for
employment in 2007–08 increased by almost 13 percent
from 2006–07. Many factors have contributed to the

recent increase in labour migration. Rapid population and
labour-force expansion combined with inadequate
domestic growth has stretched the capacity of the
economy to absorb workers. In the agriculture sector,
arable land is limited, landlessness is pervasive and the
number of landless households has been steadily
increasing. In the non-agriculture sector, the slowdown in
growth as a result of civil strife has further retarded the
pace of employment creation. Armed conflict has also

developing countries, but the figure goes up to 6 percent for
low-income countries.5 Actual figures are likely to be higher
because not all transfers travel through official and
measurable channels.
In 2005, 75 million people from less-developed regions
were classified as international migrants. At an aggregate
level, both men and women have migrated to the same extent
for many years: the share of female migrants was estimated at
50 percent in 2005, little changed from 47 percent in 1960.6
Global figures fail to convey the important role that
migration plays for many individuals, households, nations and
regions. For example, remittances tend to be the main source
of capital inflow in small countries near the migration corridors
of Europe, North America and the Russian Federation. World
Bank figures for 2007 show that remittances in Tajikistan
amount to 46 percent of GDP, with figures of 25 percent in
Honduras and 24 percent in Lebanon.7 In several large African
countries (Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco, Nigeria and Senegal),
remittances account for between 5 and 10 percent of GDP.
Within countries, remittances are often concentrated among
certain geographic regions (see box on Nepal).

16

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

In many developing countries, a sizeable share of
households relies on migrant remittances as a source of
income. In the Philippines, for example, 17 percent of
households receive remittances from abroad. Similar
proportions are seen in Albania, Armenia, El Salvador and
Haiti, while 25 percent of households in Peru receive some
form of private transfer (largely migrant remittances). In the
Dominican Republic, 40 percent of households in the
Sierra, one of the country’s poorer regions, report having
migrant members, with about half of them sending
remittances.8
Remittances flow directly to households, and in some
countries and regions (e.g. South Asia; see Figure 11) they
are much larger than either FDI or ODA. In many developing
countries, remittances constitute a higher share of income
for the wealthiest quintiles (Figure 12),9 although poorer
households are generally affected more by a decline in
remittance flows because they are less able to cope with
income loss.
As with other sources of income, remittances generate
multiplier effects for the local economy. For example, when

Undernourishment around the world

created difficult living and security conditions, especially in
rural areas. Many workers view foreign employment as
their only viable option.
Increased remittances have contributed significantly to
strengthening national GDP. The share of remittances in
GDP increased from 10 percent in 2001–02 to 17 percent
in 2007–08. The geographical proximity of India, the
historical and cultural links between the two countries, and
their extensive and porous border, has made India a
traditional destination for Nepalese migrants, and it
remains their most important destination country. In recent
years, however, an increasingly larger share of remittances
to Nepal has come from other countries as a result of
better job opportunities and higher earnings, especially in
the Near East. Indeed, remittances from the Near East now
represent a larger share (33 percent) than those from India
(24 percent). Malaysia and the United States of America are
also important sources of remittances.
Most migrants earn wages in the non-agricultural sectors
and are employed in restaurants and factories, or as domestic
workers, security guards and maids (in India) and as security
personnel, chauffeurs and construction workers in the Near
East.2
Remittances generate many benefits for Nepal.
However, their impact on household income and poverty
varies substantially across different parts of the country
(Figure B). Based on the 2003–04 Nepal Living Standards
Survey, the share of remittances in total household

income ranged from more than 20 percent in the Western
Mountains, Western Hills and Far-Western Hills to only
about 6 percent in the Mid-Western Mountains and
Central Mountains. This variance shows why national
averages can obscure the importance of remittances in
certain parts of a country.
Given the importance of remittances to Nepal, any
slowdown as a consequence of the economic crisis could
hinder national economic growth. Because the impact of
remittances on household income and poverty reduction
is uneven across the country, household-level analysis is
necessary if appropriate interventions are to reach the
right people.

remittances are used to build a house, demand for semiskilled labour increases, benefiting those who do not have
direct access to remittances. These multiplier effects imply
that the total impact of a decline in remittances will be
greater than the decline in the remittances itself. Empirical
studies indicate that the value of this multiplier is often
between 1.5 and 2.
In Africa and Latin America, a 1 percentage-point increase
in the ratio of remittances to GDP results in 0.29 percent and
0.37 percent declines, respectively, in the number of people
living below the poverty line.10 Remittances are also generally
less volatile than FDI, and in past crises have often been
counter-cyclical, meaning that they tend to increase when
home-country economic growth slows down (or when the
home country is hit by a disaster). However, given the global
nature of the current crisis – and the fact that the crisis first
struck and is most severe in host countries – the World Bank
estimates that remittances will fall by 5–8 percent in 2009
after growing by 15–20 percent per year from 2005 to 2007.11
The extent of the impact of reduced remittances on
different countries will also depend on exchange-rate

movements, which will affect, first, decisions on how much
money is sent home and, second, the purchasing power of
the recipients when remittances are changed into local
currency. Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which receive a
large share of their remittances from the Russian Federation,
are set to face sharp declines given the slowdown in the
Russian economy and the devaluation of the Russian rouble
(see box on Tajikistan).

■ Trade, credit, foreign direct investment and
foreign aid
The recession in developed countries has had a severe
negative impact on trade, credit, FDI and foreign aid. In
2009, global trade is predicted to fall between 5 percent12
and 9 percent.13 The plunge in the value of exports will be
higher in developing countries than in advanced economies,14
and will be especially damaging for economies that rely on
exports as their main source of foreign exchange.
As the crisis evolves, developing countries face higher costs
for external credit, from both private and public sources, as

18

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

the risk premium for lending money to developing countries
has increased by about one-quarter of a percentage point. In
many cases, credit is not available at any price as banks ration
credit and lend only to those perceived as the most reliable
borrowers. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) are experiencing
difficulties, although most have built a solid foundation and
are poised to expand further in the years ahead (see box,
page 20).
Foreign direct investment tends to be highly volatile across
time. In the current crisis, it has fallen sharply as private
corporations in developed economies face pronounced
recession. Table 2 in the technical annex shows that in
countries such as Georgia, the Gambia, Jordan and Lebanon,
FDI amounts on average to more than 10 percent of annual
GDP. The IMF estimated in April 2009 that FDI would fall
32 percent in 2009 in developing economies as a group,
with a 15 percent fall in Africa. Most FDI is for mining,
industry and services, with very little directed towards
agriculture (although some is related to agricultural
processing), but reduced employment stemming from the
decline will have economy-wide ripple effects, and will in

The impact of declining remittances to Tajikistan

Tajikistan has the world’s highest ratio of remittances to
GDP, currently estimated at around 46 percent. Based on
data from the 2007 Tajikistan Living Standards Survey,
researchers at the World Bank have simulated the poverty
impact of a decline in international migrant remittances
using two different methodologies.1 The study focused
solely on direct remittances effects, without taking into
consideration the potential economic recession in
Tajikistan (i.e., worsening conditions in the local labour
market) or potential second-order effects of remittances
(the multiplier effect).
The first approach simulated the impact on poverty of a
universal decline in remittances, applying the same
percentage reduction across all households and assuming
that, at least in the short term, households would not be
able to compensate for the loss. The second approach
simulated the poverty impact of a given percentage of
migrants losing their jobs abroad and returning home to
find employment in similar jobs locally, but at substantially

lower wages. In both approaches, the poverty impacts of
reductions in remittances and migrant employment of 20,
30 and 50 percent, respectively, were simulated.
Under all scenarios, a decline in remittances was seen
to push more people into poverty. In the worst-case
scenario, a 50 percent reduction in remittances would
raise the proportion of people living below the poverty
line from 53.1 percent to 59.6 percent, representing a
12.2 percent increase in poverty (see Table). The impact is
somewhat lower, although still substantial, when a
50 percent decline in migrant employment is simulated. In
this case, absolute poverty would increase to
56.5 percent, or by 6.4 percent. The research found that
rural areas would be affected more markedly than urban
areas, with the impact ranging between 1.3 and 1.8 times
greater, depending on the scenario.

some circumstances increase back-migration from urban to
rural areas.
Foreign aid is the principal source of capital inflow for
some of the poorest countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, ODA
often accounts for a large proportion of GDP (more than
40 percent in Burundi and Liberia, for example). In Haiti, the
Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Nicaragua, the share is
more than 10 percent. In response to the steep rise in food
prices, ODA at the global level increased substantially in
2008. However, development aid typically decreases when
donor GDP decreases. Thus, with donor countries facing
tougher budgetary constraints in 2009, the IMF projects that
the poorest 71 countries will experience an overall drop in
ODA of about 25 percent, although the new level will remain
above that of 2007.

■ Agriculture as a macroeconomic buffer
Economic crises have different impacts on various sectors,
depending on the nature of the crisis, the size of the sector
in terms of employment, and the trade structure of the
sector. However, patterns emerge in regard to the agriculture
sector. First, for almost all of the cases listed in Table 2,
agriculture sector growth rates before and after the crisis
were less than that of aggregate GDP (these cases are
highlighted in green in the table). Second, in all cases, the
growth rate of agriculture is greater than that of GDP during
the crisis (these cases are highlighted in orange). Thus,
agricultural growth tends to be more stable than growth in
other sectors.
Agricultural employment also tends to expand during a
crisis, as illustrated by the example of Indonesia during the

Impact of the economic crisis on microfinance

Microfinance is widely seen as an important intervention
for fighting poverty. The current crisis has not only
underscored the vital role of finance in economic growth
and development, but has also seriously affected
microfinance institutions (MFIs) in many developing
countries. One reason is that private investors are
withdrawing their funding, which forces MFIs to scale
down their lending. This, in turn, can have adverse effects
on poverty because the client base of MFIs is dominated
by the poor, including consumers, the self-employed and
smallholder farmers in rural areas.
Developing countries and emerging economies are
affected in different ways and for different reasons.
Microfinance institutions in more integrated economies –
particularly Central Asia, Europe and Latin America –
report the largest impact from the crisis. On the other
hand, India-focused microfinance funds supported by
foreign investors, which experienced delays in receiving
funds in 2008 as investors were concerned about the
impact of the financial crisis, can now expect robust fund
flows in 2009. Local and regional MFIs in Africa are
struggling to survive liquidity pressures as loan defaults
soar as a result of higher food prices and reduced
incomes. According to a recent survey conducted by the
Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP – an
independent microfinance policy and research centre, of
which IFAD is one of 33 members), in collaboration with a
group of practitioners and development agencies, twothirds of more than 400 participating MFIs reported

economic crisis of 1997–98. Although employment in the
Indonesian industrial and electricity sectors fell by 13 and
27 percent, respectively, during the economic crisis of 1997–
98, employment expansion in agriculture (at 15.2 percent),
more than made up for the reduction in other sectors.15 A
similar pattern emerged in other Asian countries affected by
the 1997–98 crisis: agricultural employment rose by
9.1 percent in Malaysia and 5.4 percent in the Republic of
Korea, while it fell in the manufacturing sector in both
countries.
Why would agricultural growth be less affected than
growth in other sectors? First, as income drops, demand for
agricultural products, especially food, does not decrease
proportionately – people will sacrifice other goods, such as
industrial products and services, to make sure they can buy
enough food (or as much as their income allows). On the
supply side, other sectors may use credit more intensively,
while agriculture, especially if it is dominated by

20

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

declining – or at best stable – loan portfolios and an
increase in their portfolio-at-risk levels, reflecting the
impact of the crisis.
However, the global industry survey on the impact of
the crisis on MFIs and their clients also indicated that the
microfinance sector is showing great resilience, in
particular where it is built on domestic funding sources
(e.g. small-balance deposits). Thus, despite the increased
links of MFIs with domestic and international financial
markets that have created some problems during the
crisis, the microfinance sector as a whole has built sound
foundations. There is a broad consensus with regard to
financial transparency through the use of ratings, audits
and social performance standards, while partnerships with
socially driven investors and development finance
institutions are providing emergency liquidity funds. This
strength, coupled with the potential for substantial
further expansion through tapping markets of
creditworthy poor clients in rural areas, will ensure that
the microfinance sector will survive and help mitigate the
effects of the global economic downturn on low-income
households. Looking ahead, there is a need to explore the
links between financial services and government social
safety-net programmes by delivering grant payments into
bank accounts, thereby linking social protection and
financial inclusion.

Advisor, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).

smallholders, is more self-financed and thus less affected by
sudden credit shortages. This latter argument would be less
relevant for large and commercial farms where credit is a
key input. Further, the supply of credit might be augmented
by migrants who return from urban areas.
In many cases, crises may be accompanied by a
depreciation of the exchange rate (e.g. Mexico in 1995,
Indonesia and Thailand in 1997–98). This will tend to benefit
agriculture because agricultural products are often
considered to be relatively more tradable than output from
the service sector. But not all economic crises are the same.
In the current crisis, the beneficial effects of exchange-rate
depreciation on agriculture will be mitigated by the global
nature of the economic slowdown and attendant reductions
in world commodity prices. Moreover, the global nature of
the crisis also makes it less likely that depreciation of any one
currency could be an effective boost to that country’s
exports.

Undernourishment around the world

Quantifying the food security impacts
of the economic crisis16
The impact of the economic crisis on the poor and foodinsecure is likely to be substantial, especially in light of the
negative impact of soaring food and fuel prices already
experienced by the most vulnerable population groups
during 2006–08. The more difficult global economic
environment has a significant influence on national food
security in a number of poorer countries, many of which
have become increasingly dependent on grain imports over
the past decade (Figure 13). This reliance on food imports
was spurred by trade liberalization policies and the expansion
and improvement of the global transportation system.
Increased reliance on grain imports has helped keep prices
more affordable for consumers, but the lack of domestic
agricultural growth that drove the imports has exposed many
countries to volatility on international markets.
Imported foods, including basic staples such as grains and
vegetable oils, now constitute an important component of
diets in most countries. From 1970 to 2003, import
dependency grew most among the least-developed countries
compared with higher-income country groups. In 2003,
least-developed countries relied on imports for 17 percent of
their grain consumption (compared with 8 percent in 1970),

45 percent for sugar and sweeteners (18 percent in 1970),
and 55 percent for vegetable oils (9 percent in 1970). At
individual country level, the situation varies significantly. For
example, imports accounted for more than half of grain
supplies in 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Angola, Cape
Verde, Eritrea, the Gambia, Lesotho, Liberia, Mauritania,
Senegal, Somalia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe) in 2005–06. In
another seven countries (Benin, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau
and Mozambique), this share ranged from 30 to 50 percent.

■ Financial and economic crisis set to deepen
food insecurity in 2009
In spite of declines in international food commodity prices
during the latter part of 2008, deteriorating purchasing
power and higher levels of food insecurity are expected in
2009. Based on historical trends in production in the 70
countries considered by the USDA Economic Research Service
model (see box, page 24), the number of food-insecure
people will increase by at least 2 percent, which is consistent
with FAO’s data showing that undernourishment was
increasing even before the crises (see page 8). The economic
crisis will exacerbate this problem substantially. For countries
that are dependent on food imports, and assuming no major
domestic production shortfalls, two critical determinants of
food import capacity are export earnings and capital inflow
(FDI, remittances and foreign aid). When a decline in exports
or capital inflows occurs, this is likely to force a reduction in
imports, including food imports (unless the country is able to
borrow internationally, which is not an option for many poor
countries). Thus, even if aggregate world food availability
remains unchanged, the access of poor countries to that food
will be reduced, compromising their food security. The USDA
model examined quantitatively the changes in import capacity
of the low-income countries in the face of various external
shocks and the resulting implications for food security.
Three scenarios were developed to evaluate the probable
impact of the economic crisis on the food security of lowincome countries. In the first scenario, export growth of the
countries in 2009 is reduced relative to the baseline
estimation (i.e., export growth in the absence of economic
crisis). This reduction is in the same proportion as the
estimated decline in the countries’ economic growth for

Undernourishment around the world

Are food imports necessarily bad?

The global food crisis of 2006–08 prompted many
countries to reconsider the virtues of relying on imports
for a significant share of their food consumption. Given
the high and volatile prices and market turbulence during
this period, it is obvious that countries become
concerned about excessive reliance on world food
markets. But what constitutes “excessive” reliance, and
what are the advantages and disadvantages of reducing
this reliance?
First, it is important to realize that domestic food prices
in many exporting countries also increased sharply during
the crisis, e.g. rice prices in Pakistan, Thailand and
Viet Nam, and maize prices in South Africa. In other
words, importers are not the only countries that are
vulnerable to higher prices on world markets; any country
that is open to trade can be affected. Second, price surges
can also originate from shocks to domestic agricultural
production: a simple policy of insulation from world
markets (self-sufficiency) exposes the country to
substantial weather-related risks. Thus, there is no easy
way to eliminate price instability on domestic markets.
Domestic price stabilization in the face of world price
surges is easier if the quantity of imports or exports is a
relatively small share of consumption or production,
because it can be buffered more easily by reasonable
levels of stockholdings. If imports account for 50 percent
of consumption, it will be difficult to implement an
effective stabilization policy that protects against world
price surges. The same is true if exports account for half
of production.
The merits of reducing the share of trade in
consumption or production depend on comparative
advantage. If a country has a strong comparative
advantage in producing a particular food commodity,

2009, resulting in estimated 50 percent declines in export
growth in North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, a
40 percent decline in Asia (60 percent in Central Asia) and
a 60 percent decline in Latin America and the Caribbean.
For example, an Asian country with previously forecast
export growth of 10 percent would see this growth
reduced by 40 percent, that is, to 6 percent. This scenario
assumes constant financial inflow (including FDI,
remittances and foreign aid) to finance trade deficits. The
second, or middle, scenario takes the assumption of the
first scenario and, in addition, reduces capital inflow in
2009 by 25 percent (because of cuts in FDI, remittances
and, possibly, ODA). The third scenario takes the
assumption of the first scenario and reduces capital inflow
in 2009 by 50 percent.

reducing production to reduce the importance of trade
(exports) will be counterproductive and harm many
farmers. Similarly, reducing the quantity of imports when
a country does not have a comparative advantage in
production will hurt consumers. Moreover, it is often the
poorest who are affected most by such a policy, as was
shown in The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008.
Analysis of household survey data can help determine
which groups are hurt most severely with respect to a
specific country and specific commodity.
Of course, comparative advantage is not a static
concept. If a country lacks comparative advantage in
producing a specific commodity, it may be because of
underinvestment in agricultural research, rural
infrastructure, roads or other public goods. In such cases,
the most appropriate solution would be to increase
investment in agriculture, not impose trade restrictions.
Even in the short term, before the investment can bear
fruit, trade restrictions are likely to be damaging if they
increase domestic prices to levels well above world prices
on a medium-term basis because the high prices will
typically hurt most the poorest of the poor. Further, while
it may be sensible to allow domestic prices to deviate
from world prices in the short run, pursuing such a
strategy over several years can be dangerous. Trade
restrictions, once implemented, are often difficult to
remove, and can fail to provide sufficient market discipline
to ensure that governments and the private sector invest
their money wisely. Thus, restricting imports simply to
avoid reliance on the world market may lead to domestic
food prices remaining high all the time, not only when
world prices are high. A more effective and lasting
solution would be to invest more in agriculture to
enhance productivity growth.

Under the first scenario, the reduction in export earnings
growth and the subsequent cut in import capacity are
projected to result in a decline in food consumption that
equates to a 7.3 percent rise, over the baseline estimate, in
the number of food-insecure people. The impact will not be
uniform across all regions and countries as the results vary
according to individual countries’ dependence on food
imports, export earnings relative to overall foreign exchange
availability, and initial position with respect to food security.
Under the second scenario, when a 25 percent cutback in
capital inflows is added to the reduced growth of export
earnings, the food security situation of the countries is
projected to deteriorate to a larger extent because of an
even greater decline in food imports. Under this scenario,
9.2 percent more people are projected to become food-

Undernourishment around the world

insecure relative to the baseline estimates for 2009. This
scenario has been used to generate the undernourishment
estimates provided earlier in this report (see page 11). Finally,
the third scenario results in an 11.6 percent increase in the
number of food-insecure. All three scenarios are, of course,
hypothetical: the actual impact will vary depending on
national and international responses to the economic
downturn.
The number of food-insecure people in sub-Saharan
Africa is projected to increase by 6 percent under the second
scenario (Figure 14), compared with 3 percent and 9 percent
under the first and third scenarios, respectively. Sub-Saharan
Africa is the world’s most food-insecure region. Average
calorie intake in the region barely exceeds the daily
requirement of 2 100 kcal, and is by far the lowest in the
world. Many countries in this region do not have an
adequate supply of food, and income inequality exacerbates
the problem. The countries that will be hardest hit by the
economic crisis are those with high levels of balance-ofpayments deficits and high food-import dependency.
The impact of the second scenario relative to the baseline
is projected to be an 8 percent increase in the number of
food-insecure people in Latin America and the Caribbean
(compared with 4 percent and 20 percent under the first
and third scenarios). As in sub-Saharan Africa, the share of
food imports has grown over time, as domestic food
production has failed to keep pace with rising food
demand. Trade liberalization policies and income growth
have been the main forces behind the increase in
consumption. High levels of income inequality increase
vulnerability to food insecurity in this region also. A key
concern in the region is the decline in remittances, which in
many countries exceed the sum of FDI, ODA, and

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

How is food security assessed by the
USDA Economic Research Service?
The Economic Research Service food security model
projects food consumption and access in 70 lowincome developing countries: 37 in sub-Saharan
Africa, 4 in North Africa, 18 in Asia (including 8 in
Central Asia) and 11 in Latin America and the
Caribbean. Because of the focus on lower-income
developing countries, several large developing
countries are not included (e.g. Argentina, Brazil,
China, Mexico, South Africa). Commodities included
in the model are grains, root crops and a group called
“other” that encompasses all other foods. The three
commodity groups in total account for 100 percent of
calories consumed. The population of each country is
divided into five equal groups (quintiles) according to
per capita income. Food consumption varies across
these groups, with the poorest consuming the least
amount of food. Based on the food consumption of
each quintile and the total population, the model
estimates the number of people who are unable to
meet their nutritional requirements of 2 100 kcal
per day.

government and private borrowing. Remittances often
provide income for the poorest segment of society and are
spent on basic necessities such as food (see Migration and
remittances on page 15).
The number of food-insecure people in Asia (including
Central Asia) under the second scenario is estimated to
increase by 13 percent from the 2009 baseline, compared
with increases of 11 percent and 13 percent, respectively,
under the first and third scenarios. The impact is generally
larger than in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the
Caribbean, driven by the importance of foreign trade to
Asian economies. The importance of trade in goods and
services also means that the incremental impact of a further
decline in capital inflows is relatively small, as evidenced by
the similar decline across the three scenarios. Asia’s
increasing links with the international economic
environment, particularly the performance and policies of the
major developed countries, means that the weakening of the
global economy directly affects the food security situation of
countries in this region, many of which suffer from persistent
and extreme poverty. India will be less affected than many
other Asian countries because its cautious financial policies
have reduced the country’s exposure to external financial
shocks. In addition, continuing government support to the
agriculture sector has transformed India from a net importer
of grains to a net exporter.
Overall, the magnitude of changes in food-insecurity
indicators under the various scenarios described above

Undernourishment around the world

Impact of higher prices on African producers

A recent USDA Economic Research Service project
examined the impact of higher food prices in Africa. One
aim of the study was to determine whether higher prices
are being passed on to local farmers, who might then
increase production and compete effectively with
imports in regional markets. In most cases, producers’
ability to respond to the higher prices was constrained by
a lack of access to capital, poor infrastructure, limited
technology, limited information, few inputs and poorquality seeds. These obstacles translate into poorly
integrated markets where prices vary significantly
between producers and consumers as well as from one
area to another.
In Ghana, for example, at the peak of global grain
prices in mid-2008, the government provided subsidies
for fertilizer and tractors. These subsidies were targeted
principally towards poorer maize farmers, but even at the
subsidized prices, many farmers were unable to afford
fertilizer, let alone tractors. Fertilizer prices in Ghana
increased by around 50 percent between April 2007 and
August 2008. Marked price variations existed among
different local markets to the extent that the difference in
maize prices in two different towns – only 65 miles
(105 km) apart – was almost threefold.
Similar issues were reported in Kenya, which is
vulnerable to increases in world fertilizer and energy
prices because all its fuel and fertilizer are imported. Flat
farmgate prices (despite rising consumer prices) and the
increased costs of agricultural inputs (fertilizer prices
tripled in six months) and transportation reduced foodproduction incentives. This situation, coupled with
domestic political unrest, meant that about half of the
agricultural land in the northern Rift Valley (the key maize-

highlights the vulnerability of millions of poor people whose
food consumption is equal or close to the daily nutritional
requirement. Each year, such vulnerability is intensified either
because of internal factors, including weather-related
domestic production shortfalls and inadequate domestic
policy responses, or external factors such as the global
economic shocks currently being experienced.
The scenarios also reveal an important aspect of the food
security equation – the growing role of food imports in many
low-income countries (see box on page 23). Where domestic
production accounts for most of a country’s food supplies, a
reduction in imports will probably have a negligible effect on
food security. However, for countries that have become
increasingly dependent on imports, a decline could
exacerbate their vulnerability. Regionally, import dependency
for grain, the main staple food consumed by the poor, is

producing area) was not prepared for the 2008 planting
season.
In Mozambique, the recent high food prices were felt
strongly at the consumer level but the country’s size and
geography limited price transmission to farmers. With a
fractured agricultural market and poor infrastructure
hindering trade, opportunities for agricultural producers
to capitalize on the relatively high and growing incomes
in the urban areas are limited. The study found that at the
market in Maputo, imported Argentinian maize was
available for the same price as maize transported
internally from the northern part of the country. This
means that domestic production is more likely to be
traded within rural communities or to rural areas of
neighbouring countries, such as Malawi or Zambia, that
face similar market infrastructure constraints.
In Uganda, despite growing demand, production
response was low for various reasons. The primary factor
underlying low productivity is land fragmentation – food
production is dominated by smallholders with
1–2 hectares of land. These producers do not have access
to credit markets and cannot afford fertilizer or highquality seed varieties. This situation has led to a decline in
both land fertility and crop quality. Moreover, the food
market (with the exception of sugar) is fully liberalized,
meaning that there are no input or production subsidies
and no tariffs on exports and imports. Government
expenditures on agriculture accounted for about
1.5 percent of total expenditures in 2006 and 2007. With
no farm organizations to enhance producers’ bargaining
power, cash-strapped farmers tend to sell their crops soon
after harvest rather than store their crop and wait for
higher prices.

lowest in Asia, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, Latin
America and the Caribbean, and North Africa. Most of the
countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and in North
Africa included in the USDA study import almost half of their
grain supplies. Some countries can forgo imports of other
commodities and allocate a much larger share of their import
budget to food during the crisis period, but for those that
were highly food-insecure at the outset, including many in
sub-Saharan Africa, a decline in economic growth and
import capacity can have severe adverse implications and
amplify food insecurity.
Performance in food production clearly plays a crucial role
in national food security. Since 1990, sub-Saharan Africa has
demonstrated the highest growth in grain production –
2.8 percent per year – but this growth has been almost
negated by the region’s high population growth of

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

25

Undernourishment around the world

2.7 percent per year (compared with less than 1.5 percent in
the other regions). Nearly 90 percent of the production
growth in sub-Saharan Africa over the last two decades is
attributable to area expansion; the region’s yields are the
lowest in the world, at about one-third of the global
average. This means that most countries are far from their
maximum technical potential for growing crops. The recent
high grain prices have improved production incentives for
countries that have relatively productive resources and
market economies that are efficient enough to take

advantage of the higher prices. However, in most subSaharan African countries, producers’ responses to price
changes are small because of poor market infrastructure,
high input costs and limited access to new technologies.
A USDA Economic Research Service study of four subSaharan African countries (Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique and
Uganda) showed that a variety of factors constrained a local
supply response to the higher prices, including rising costs of
imported inputs and transportation and infrastructure
constraints (see box, page 25).

Coping mechanisms of the poor and
food-insecure
■ How do households cope with declines in
income?
When families are faced with increased unemployment,
declining wages and reduced demand for their work, they
will attempt to maintain income through migration or
participation in new types of economic activity. Alternatively,
they will try to smooth consumption through selling assets,
such as livestock, or borrowing when access to credit
markets is feasible. They will also alter their spending
patterns by decreasing expenditures on durable goods the
most and on food the least. Food expenditures also shift
towards calorie-rich, energy-dense foods (e.g. grains) and
away from more expensive protein- and nutrient-rich foods
(Figure 15).
All the above coping strategies draw down the assets of
the poor. For example, migration may reduce community
cohesion, increased female employment may reduce visits to
health-care providers, asset sales reduce the stock of physical
or financial resources, and switching from more-nutritious
foods (such as meat, dairy products, fruit and vegetables)
towards less-nutritious grains may increase malnutrition and
reduce children’s cognitive potential. When facing a crisis,
households must choose which type of assets to draw down.
In many cases, there will be a gender dimension to this
decision, for example boys’ or girls’ education, husband’s or
wife’s assets.17
Poorer households, faced with tighter budget constraints,
are of course hit harder than wealthier households. During
the 1997–98 Asian economic crisis, for example, school
enrolment in Indonesia declined more among the poor.

26

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

In Cameroon’s economic crisis in the 1990s, the prevalence
of underweight children under three years of age increased
substantially more for the poorest half of the population
(7–8 percentage points) than it did for the wealthiest half of
the population (2–3 percentage points). During Zimbabwe’s
drought in the mid-1990s (not an economic crisis, but it
resulted in a loss of income), young children living in the
poorest households suffered a substantial reduction in
growth rate, and these children remained shorter than would
otherwise be expected several years later. These effects are
particularly worrisome because there exists a large body of
literature that suggests that stunting is associated with
reduced cognitive skills and slower progress in school as a
child, as well as reduced earnings as an adult.18
There is an important gender component to these coping
mechanisms in terms of women’s work participation.
Women in developing countries tend to work more when
per capita GDP declines (Figure 16), but the relationship
varies among women of different educational levels. In most
regions, with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa, women
with less education tend to increase work participation more
in times of economic crisis than do women with more
education.
Because working mothers in developing countries are less
likely to seek health care for themselves or their children,
health outcomes often deteriorate for the poor during times
of crisis, while they actually improve in developed countries.
During Mexico’s 1995 crisis, infant mortality rates increased
most in the areas where women’s work participation
increased. In addition, economic crises have a significant
impact on infant mortality: a 4 percent decline in per capita

In addition to its macroeconomic buffering function as
discussed earlier, agriculture can also serve as a householdlevel buffer by providing inexpensive shelter, food and
employment for unemployed labourers from urban areas in
times of crisis. In Ghana, agriculture acted as a safety net
for retrenched workers and others during the economic
crisis of the 1980s.21 It also acted as a safety net for many
of the 1.2 million Ghanaians who were repatriated from
Nigeria in 1983 in response to the economic crisis in that
country. This process was eased by the relatively abundant
supply of land in some regions of Ghana. During the
current crisis, agriculture has served this function in many
Asian countries, including China, and even in some
developed countries, such as Spain. Non-farm activities in
rural areas can also help to absorb labourers who had to
leave urban areas. Indeed, such activities may be more

■ How large are the back-migration flows? Are
they permanent or temporary?
Not surprisingly, back-migration flows from urban to rural
areas in times of crisis are greater in poorer countries where
the agriculture sector is larger. For example, in Indonesia
during the 1997–98 Asian crisis, 6 percent of all prime-age
adults moved from urban to rural areas in just one year –
this is equivalent to 11 percent of total agricultural
employment. In contrast, return migration in Thailand was
equal to just 1 percent of total agricultural employment in
1997, and 2–3 percent in 1998, with much of the backmigration going to the impoverished northeast of the
country.22 The reduced absorptive capacity of Thai
agriculture was probably a result of investments in laboursaving technology in the early 1990s that were made in
response to rising real wages.
For the urban unemployed, return migration is probably a
temporary coping strategy in most cases. Agricultural work
holds little attraction: the work is hard, the pay is poor and
many urban returnees have lost their farming skills, in
particular those needed in the cash-crop sector.23 Thus, while
there was urban-to-rural migration in Thailand in the wake
of the 1997–98 crisis, that back-migration was quickly
reversed by out-migration from rural areas of just over
5 percent of total agricultural employment in 1999, in
continuation of the previous longer-term trend.
Nevertheless, in some cases back-migration to rural
areas may be more permanent. In China, for example,
about 38 percent of all migrants over the past decade have
returned home.24 In part this was due to the hukou system,
where migration to urban areas is restricted and households
need to register their residence. Although now less
stringent than in the past, the hukou system still influences
the job security that rural migrants face in urban areas.
A chronic crisis in Zambia’s ailing copper industry (located in

28

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

Copperbelt Province, an urbanized area) may also help
explain the gradual fall of the country’s urbanization rate
(Figure 18).

■ Buffer role comes at a cost
Some policy-makers encourage return migration as it lessens
the burden on cities and makes unemployment less visible,
may reduce political instability, and relieves the pressure on a
government’s already strained budget at a time of crisis. But
there are also costs involved. Rural households will need to
cope with reduced levels of remittances, and at the same
time will have to deal with increased food demand following
the arrival of return migrants.
The impact on rural households depends on whether the
people returning can be employed productively. If this is not
the case, households will be burdened with extra mouths to
feed without any attendant increase in resources.
Unfortunately, there is little empirical evidence on this issue.
There is evidence from China that out-migration has a
negative impact on agricultural productivity (implying that
return migration will have a positive impact), but evidence
from Thailand suggests that the smallholder sector could not
absorb the low-skilled urban labour dislocated by the 1997–
98 economic crisis.25

Case studies of countries affected
by the economic crisis

T

he first section of this report described how hunger
has been on the rise for the past decade, even
before the 2006–08 food crisis and the current
economic crisis. It then described the nature of the economic
crisis and how it is transmitted to developing countries, the
impact on undernourishment, and the coping mechanisms
used by the poor to deal with the situation. In this section,
we present case studies that show how the economic crisis is
affecting five countries and the poor people who live there.
Two of the five (Bangladesh and Nicaragua) are rated by the
IMF as being at medium risk from the crisis, while the other
three (Armenia, Ghana and Zambia) are rated as high risk.
A variety of coping mechanisms have been used by the
poor to adapt to the crisis, depending on their own specific
situation (Table 3). The relative importance of remittances,

FDI and ODA varies across these countries (Figure 19). The
importance of remittances (Figure 20) and trade has been
increasing over the past decade (Figure 21), although trade
in goods and services relative to GDP has declined in
Armenia during the past 15 years.26 Analysis of the FAO price
database shows that the global food crisis caused key staple
food prices to increase in all of these countries (Figure 22).

Case studies of countries affected by the economic crisis

Armenia
Armenia is a mountainous landlocked country in the South
Caucasus with a population of 3.2 million, 64 percent of
whom live in urban areas. Despite many difficulties, Armenia
has successfully switched to a market economy over the past
decade, with double-digit growth rates between 2000 and
2007. Wheat is the main staple, supplying about 48 percent
of total caloric intake.

■ Macroeconomic impacts
According to the IMF, the Commonwealth of Independent
States (a regional organization whose participating countries
are former Soviet republics), of which Armenia is a member,
will be more affected by the global economic crisis than any
other region.27 During the first two months of 2009,
Armenia’s GDP decreased by 3.7 percent compared with the
same period in 2008, leading the IMF and the World Bank to
revise their growth projections downward for 2009 to minus
5 percent and minus 8 percent, respectively. This situation
contrasts with average annual growth of 12.6 percent from
2000 to 2007. In early March 2009, the Armenian currency
(the dram) was devalued dramatically, losing 18 percent of its
value in a single day. Such depreciation causes substantial
inflation.
The Armenian economy relies to a large extent on the
European and Russian markets for its trade, and its main
trading partners have been hit heavily by the crisis. The
slowdown has been particularly felt in the construction
sector – a key driving force behind Armenia’s recent
economic growth – as activity has slowed in the Russian
Federation and in Armenia itself. The mining sector has also
been hard hit by the steep fall in international prices of
copper and molybdenum, as has the chemical industry
following a slowdown in global demand for chemical
products.
Besides being a major trading partner, the Russian
Federation accounts for the bulk of foreign remittances from
seasonal and long-term migrants. More than 80 percent of
Armenia’s labour migrants are in the Russian Federation and
remittances in 2007 accounted for about 9 percent of GDP,
substantially higher than in the mid-1990s (Figure 20).
Because of these factors, the IMF rates Armenia as highly
vulnerable to a decline in remittances. Furthermore, an
extended decline in remittances seems likely, as official
remittances dropped by about 35 percent in February 2009
compared with one year earlier. According to International

Organization for Migration (IOM) data, departures to the
Russian Federation and other members of the
Commonwealth of Independent States in March 2009
decreased by 25 percent compared with the previous year.28
Foreign direct investment, which is another important source
of capital inflow (Figure 19), is also expected to decline given
the sharp slowdown in the Russian Federation (the main
source country).
Past economic growth in Armenia has been accompanied
by significant poverty reduction, but a decline in income
levels could cause many people to slip back into poverty,
negating the progress of the past few years. According
to World Bank estimates, the current crisis could push
172 000 more people below the poverty line in 2009–10,
increasing the total number of poor people to an estimated
906 000, of whom 297 000 will be extremely poor.29

■ Effects on food security and livelihoods
As most households in Armenia rely on markets to meet
their consumption needs, the crisis has an impact on
households’ ability to access sufficient food and cover other
basic needs such as heating, health and education. Many
households have already started to substitute wheat
products with cheaper potatoes and have reduced their
consumption of meat and dairy products to save money.
In the longer term, this could lead to greater risk of
micronutrient deficiencies. Combined with an increased
exposure to diseases – caused by reduced use of health
services and lack of funds for heating during the cold winter
months – the crisis could lead to increased malnutrition and
child mortality if the negative trend continues and mitigation
efforts by the Government and the international community
do not succeed.
The households most adversely affected by the shock are
those relying on remittances from seasonal and long-term
migrants or wage labour in the construction and production
sectors (particularly the mining and chemical industries).
However, households relying on agriculture, trade or social
benefits will also be affected indirectly.
According to national statistics, about one-fifth of
households had a migrant member aged 15 years or older
in 2007.30 Two-thirds of this migration is to other countries,
primarily the Russian Federation, with an overwhelming
majority of migrants working in construction, which – until
the economic crisis – had boomed in recent years.

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

31

Case studies of countries affected by the economic crisis

Remittances from migrant labour plus substantial transfers
from the large Armenian diaspora constituted a substantial
part of household income before the crisis (9.2 percent in
2007). Even in the poorest quintile, remittances still made
up 7.1 percent of income. Households depending on
remittances from seasonal migrants and other sources have
already experienced a steep drop in income as many
seasonal migrant labourers are still waiting for their
payments from the 2008 migration season. Migrants with
permanent residence abroad find it more and more difficult
to send money to their families and friends in Armenia.
Households are currently coping by increasing their use of
credit for purchases, which, given the bleak outlook for
the 2009 migration season, could push households into
serious debt.
In 2007, the Armenian construction sector accounted for
one-quarter of GDP and was a major force behind rapid
economic growth. Construction workers in Armenia are
facing a decline in construction activities within the country
and competition with tens of thousands of construction
workers returning from the Russian Federation. Employees in
the mining sector and chemical industry have been slightly
more protected through government interventions, but even
these workers have already been forced to take paid leave at
lower wages and fear losing their jobs in the near future.
Small-scale farmers and livestock breeders living at higher
altitudes, who often combine subsistence agriculture with
seasonal labour migration to the Russian Federation, are
particularly vulnerable to the downturn. They are coping by
selling off their few productive assets, especially livestock,
which will hamper their ability to participate in the eventual
recovery.
Many small shops in rural Armenia are faced with the
problem of an increasing number of households being forced
to buy food and other basic commodities on credit. Shopkeepers are fully aware that many of their customers might
not be able to repay their loans in the near future, and some
have decided to stop providing goods on credit, further
limiting household mitigation strategies.
Despite the importance of education, households may be
forced to cut their spending on educational costs. This will
primarily effect tertiary education, as parents are no longer
able to afford school fees and hostel rents.

■ What are the ongoing responses?
It is commonly reported that the Government of Armenia’s
social-benefit system has contributed to poverty reduction.
Social transfers such as pensions and family benefits
contributed 18 percent of total income for households in the
bottom quintile in 2007. Households receiving this benefit
are somewhat protected from the impacts of the global crisis
as both pensions and family benefits increased between
2008 and 2009. Nevertheless, these households are still
affected by price increases caused by the currency

32

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

depreciation. Unfortunately, about one-third of very poor
households were not covered by social transfers in 2007.
Furthermore, the crisis will place more people in need of
assistance, further straining the Government’s budget, which
is already hampered by losses in tax revenues as a result of
the general economic downturn.
Households with employed members in the public sector
were helped by a 50 percent increase in the official monthly
minimum wage. Since the dram’s depreciation, however, the
new monthly minimum is less than US$90, meaning that a
household of three or more people with only one income
earner will have a per capita income of less than a dollar per
day. This group is often referred to as the “working poor”.
In April 2009, the Government announced an anti-crisis
action plan to promote economic growth through the
realization of pan-Armenian projects that had already been
planned, including the construction of a nuclear power
plant, an Armenia–Iran railway line and the creation of a
pan-Armenian bank. In addition, the Government plans to
support some existing and emerging enterprises through
subsidies, and to promote small- and medium-enterprise
development through the creation of two free economic
zones. Social-sector priorities include the full and timely
implementation of social-sector commitments, a sharp
increase in the level of public works, and the availability of
affordable housing. These projects, however, can only be
realized with the support of external financing.

Case studies of countries affected by the economic crisis

Bangladesh
Bangladesh is home to more than 150 million people
concentrated in 144 000 km2. More than 40 percent of the
population are children and three-quarters of Bangladeshis
live in rural areas. The country sits within the world’s largest
delta, formed by the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna
rivers, making it extremely vulnerable to floods and cyclones.
Rice is by far the dominant staple, accounting for more than
70 percent of calories.
In the past decade, Bangladesh has made impressive
economic and social progress towards achieving some of
the MDGs, despite repeated natural disasters and external
shocks. Average GDP growth from 2003 to 2008 was more
than 6 percent. The country has met the MDGs for gender
parity in education (MDG 3) and universal primary
education (MDG 2) well ahead of time. Although poverty
fell from 57 percent of the population in 1990 to
40 percent in 2005, challenges remain in eradicating
hunger (MDG 1). Recently, the global food and fuel crisis
and 2007’s Cyclone Sidr have further tested the capacity of
the country to meet MDG 1.31 A nationwide survey
conducted by WFP, the United Nations Children’s Fund and
the Government in November–December 2008 to assess the
impact of high food prices on the population indicated that
one in four Bangladeshis was severely food-insecure and
that there was a significant increase in severe malnutrition
(wasting, stunting and underweight) from the 2005 levels.
The global economic crisis could further compound the
situation.

■ Macroeconomic impacts
The economy has become increasingly open to global
markets during the past 15 years, both in terms of
remittances and in terms of trade in goods and services (see
Figures 20 and 21). Bangladesh is heavily dependent on
migrants’ earnings in the Persian Gulf and other countries,
and the IMF rates it as highly vulnerable to a decline in
remittances. Indeed, Bangladesh is the fifth-largest recipient
of remittances in the world, and remittances are much more
important than either FDI or ODA (Figure 19). Ready-made
garments are the main driver of exports, accounting for
nearly 80 percent of the total. Almost half of the exports go
to the European Union and 25 percent to the United States
of America, making Bangladesh vulnerable to the recession
in those parts of the world. Agricultural exports of shrimp,
jute and tea are also important.

The volume of trade, which had increased in previous
years, declined in the second half of 2008. A further
decrease of 7 percent was observed in January 2009
compared with January 2008. Exports of ready-made
garments are diminishing (as reflected by a decrease of the
utilization declaration). Fish exports to the European Union
and the United States of America decreased by 16 percent in
July–December 2008 compared with July–December 2007.
Jute exports to the European Union and the United States of
America declined by a similar amount during the same
period, and then fell further (by 20 percent) in January 2009
compared with January 2008. The emigration of migrant
workers decreased by 40 percent in January–March 2009
compared with the same period in 2008. Cancellation of
55 000 work visas to Malaysia in March 2009 is adding to
concerns about the increasing number of deportees, which
nearly doubled from 4 800 in January 2009 to 8 000 in
February 2009.

■ Effects on food security and livelihoods
The recent declines in exports, remittances and income arrive
on the heels of the global food crisis and Cyclone Sidr
(November 2007), and are further testing the resilience of
the Bangladeshi people. In January 2008, domestic rice
prices soared to 53 percent above January 2007 levels (in real
terms), and, as late as July 2008, rice prices were still
45 percent above those of a year earlier. On average, the real
price of rice in 2008 was 33 percent higher than in 2007
(Figure 22). Such increases are a significant shock to the real
incomes of poor people, who often spend 40 percent of
their income on rice in normal times. Analysis of household
survey data from FAO’s RIGA database shows that the
poorest of the poor (the rural landless who rely on wage
labour) were most affected by the food crisis. As a result,
after a decade of progress, a substantial number
of households were pushed back into poverty even before
the global economic crisis. As shown in The State of
Food Insecurity in the World 2008, female-headed
households were affected disproportionately by the food
price shocks.
On average, at the end of 2008, households were
spending 62 percent of their income on food, up from
52 percent in 2005. This increase in the food budget share
forced households to reduce their expenditures on health
and education. Other coping strategies include eating fewer

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

33

Case studies of countries affected by the economic crisis

meals, changing diets, diversifying livelihoods and income
sources, and taking on more debt. Income diversification
could lead to child labour or less child care provided by
mothers because of increased time spent on incomegenerating activities. One-fifth of households reported
cutting expenditures on health and one-third were becoming
further indebted to financial institutions.
Discussions with focus groups revealed that the
deterioration of macroeconomic conditions has resulted in
job losses and a shift towards working as daily labourers. The
amount and frequency of remittances has decreased because
of job cuts abroad, the depreciation of the pound sterling
(a large proportion of Bangladeshi remittances come from
the United Kingdom) and higher expenses incurred by
migrants in host countries. A significant decline in both
production and prices has led to a decrease in unskilled
wage rates in the fish/shrimp industry and garment factories.

■ What are the ongoing responses?
Given that recent studies indicate that household
expenditures on several key items remain lower than before
the food and economic crises, there are serious concerns

about health care, food intake, education and debt, and
about how these factors will affect food security and
nutrition in the longer term. Focus group discussions
revealed a bleak perception of the future: participants
generally expected that it would take at least one to two
years for households to return to the income level prevailing
immediately before the global economic crisis, although
several focus groups indicated that it could take three to five
years. Such a pessimistic outlook is probably attributable to
the continuing shocks (including the food and fuel crisis,
Cyclone Sidr, and the global economic crisis) experienced
over the past two to three years.
In response to the shocks of the past few years, the
central bank has made it easier for banks to lend to
businesses. It has also withdrawn investments from overseas
banks perceived as risky. The Government has scaled up preexisting food distribution programmes in order to provide
subsidized rice for all workers in the ready-made garments
sector, and anticipates an increase in short-term spending for
rescue packages including tax breaks and cash subsidies to
safeguard vulnerable people. However, there is a danger that
increased government spending could lead to higher rates of
inflation.

Ghana
Ghana is a West African country of 24 million people that
has achieved significant progress in reducing poverty and
hunger. The diet in Ghana is relatively varied, with cassava
accounting for 24 percent of total calories and maize
another 13 percent. The percentage of people living below
the national poverty line declined from 52 percent in 1991–
92 to 29 percent in 2005–06. This progress is in danger,
however, because Ghana’s small open economy is vulnerable
to external shocks affecting FDI, trade, ODA and remittances.
For each of these individual components of financial flows,
the IMF rates Ghana’s vulnerability as medium, but because it
is vulnerable to several different types of shock, the IMF’s
overall assessment is that Ghana is highly vulnerable to the
crisis. In the context of Ghana, ODA is much more important
than either FDI or remittances (Figure 19).

■ Macroeconomic impacts
Ghana’s currency lost about 30 percent of its value against
the US dollar between early May 2008 and early May 2009.
Although a depreciated currency can help countries adjust to

34

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

macroeconomic shocks, it also means higher import costs for
food, fuel and fertilizers, as well as higher debt repayments –
putting pressure on the government budget and curtailing
economic growth.
Ghana is facing a reduction in foreign capital inflows and
higher interest rates, making the financing of the current
account and budget deficits more difficult. Timber exports
declined by 27 percent and remittances by 16 percent in
January–February 2009, compared with the same months in
2008. Exports of horticultural products and shea nuts (the
raw material for shea butter, which is used in the cosmetics
industry) have also decreased. The impact later in the year is
likely to be larger because of lags in transmission of the crisis
from developed countries.

■ Effects on food security and livelihoods
Household purchasing power has been reduced as a result of
lower prices for selected cash crops, declining remittances
and rising inflation, including of food prices. Fortunately, the
price for Ghana’s main cash crop, cocoa, has remained

Case studies of countries affected by the economic crisis

relatively high, providing a cushion for the 1.6 million cocoa
producers.
For now, the most affected group appear to be shea nut
collectors. Shea nut collection is a key income source for
women in the savannah – the country’s poorest and most
hunger-prone area – during the lean season, providing a
buffer against seasonal food insecurity. Focus group
interviews with women smallholder farmers in the north
revealed that one-third of incomes are derived from shea
nuts in that area. Lower volumes and lower prices for shea
nuts mean that women are spending a larger share of their
income on food, at the expense of health and education.
Unskilled labourers’ livelihoods are affected by declining
volumes in industries such as timber. With their reduced
incomes, unskilled labourers who have moved away from
home are sending fewer remittances to their families
elsewhere in Ghana and are trying to find alternative
employment opportunities. Three percent of households in
Ghana rely mainly on unskilled labour for their income.
As in many countries, the global food crisis hit poor
households hard. Prices of white maize and imported rice in
2008 were 51 and 43 percent higher in real terms than in
2007, constituting a large shock to the purchasing power
of the poor (Figure 22). The impact was moderated to some
extent by the diversity of the Ghanaian diet; the fact that
cassava, which is not widely traded on world markets,
accounts for about one-quarter of total caloric intake; and
the availability of locally produced rice. However, cassava
and local rice prices increased from 2007 to 2008 by
26 and 33 percent, respectively. While these increases were
smaller than those for white maize and imported rice, they
were still substantial and suggest that demand shifted
towards these staples in response to higher prices of other
foods.

High food and fuel prices, coupled with lower incomes,
have put pressure on food consumption and livelihoods.
Urban households – in the capital Accra in particular – face
high food and utility costs. The decline in income is to some
extent mitigated by Ghana’s social-protection system, which
includes, among other things, an education allowance and a
national health insurance system. This will allow some
households to spend more on food without sacrificing access
to basic social services.
The main coping mechanisms being used by families
include reductions in the quality and quantity of food
consumed. There is also probably some substitution towards
cassava as it is generally a cheaper source of calories than
maize and rice. However, with its low protein content,
cassava is less nutritious than an equivalent amount of grain.
Casual labourers are migrating, cash-crop farmers are
diversifying into crops where prices remain attractive, and
smallholders in the north are selling livestock and seeking
alternative occupations, such as casual labour. In some cases,
parents are moving their children from private schools to
public schools, increasing pressure on the government
budget.

■ What are the ongoing responses?
The Government has a broad safety-net system, which
includes a targeted cash transfer programme (Livelihood
Empowerment Against Poverty, or LEAP), national health
insurance, an education allowance, school feeding and a
national youth-employment programme. These interventions
could be scaled up if necessary. The Government has also
created a working group on social protection, which is
coordinating interventions to monitor and respond to the
effects of the economic crisis.

Nicaragua
Nicaragua is a small Central American country consisting of
extensive Atlantic coastal plains rising to central interior
mountains, and a narrow Pacific coastal plain interrupted
by volcanoes. The country is home to 5.6 million people,
with 59 percent living in urban areas and most of the
population concentrated in the Pacific lowlands. Maize
(21 percent of total calories) and rice (16 percent) are the
leading sources of dietary energy. Nicaragua is a lowincome open economy with limited capacity to absorb
financial shocks.

■ Macroeconomic impacts
Remittances as a proportion of GDP have tripled over the
past ten years (Figure 20). The IMF rates Nicaragua as
highly vulnerable to a decline in remittances, which are the
country’s second-largest source of capital inflow after
agricultural exports. In 2008, the central bank estimated
remittances at US$818 million (excluding unofficial
remittances).32 This represents about 13 percent of GDP,
but the figure is projected to decrease to 12 percent in
2009 as remittances from the United States of America, as

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

35

Case studies of countries affected by the economic crisis

well as from neighbouring Costa Rica and El Salvador,
decline.
The share of exports and imports in GDP has also increased
sharply over the past three decades (Figure 21). The country’s
economy is highly dependent on the United States of
America, not only for remittances but also for FDI and exports
(especially relating to maquila manufacturing for garments
and car equipment, as well as coffee and seafood). The
slowdown of the United States economy is expected to affect
employment and output of United States-owned companies
operating in Nicaragua (around 100 companies in total).
Employment in the maquila sector (companies in this sector
import materials, tariff-free, for assembly or manufacturing,
and then re-export the finished product, usually back to the
originating country) is expected to diminish, especially in the
garment industry, as a result of reduced demand by United
States customers. An estimated 19 000 maquila workers were
laid off in early 2009, and there was also a decrease in
employment in the construction sector.
Given these trends, the balance of trade is expected to
worsen and GDP growth is projected to decrease from
3 percent in 2008 to 1.5 percent in 2009. Foreign direct
investment may also decrease slightly (from 7.1 percent of
GDP in 2008 to 6.1 percent in 2009), while official aid
should remain about the same (11 percent of GDP).

■ Effects on food security and livelihoods
An assessment conducted in selected areas among
vulnerable population groups in March 2009 confirmed the
negative effects expected for the economy, employment,
agriculture and remittances. The households most likely to
be affected include those for which a significant share of
income is derived from remittances or wages from
employment in export-oriented activities, or from sales of
handicraft. Household survey data from FAO’s RIGA database
show that the share of remittances in total income is similar
across the different income groups (quintiles), although the
wealthiest quintile receives a larger share from remittances
than does the poorest quintile. However, even remittances
that accrue directly to the wealthiest quintile can benefit the
poor through multiplier effects such as hiring of construction
labour to build housing.
Households receiving remittances reported that these
were instrumental in paying for agricultural inputs, investing
in land and animals, covering education costs, and carrying
out housing repairs and improvement. Participants in the
assessment confirmed that remittance flows had decreased
as a result of fewer employment opportunities abroad.
Household food insecurity in Nicaragua is essentially a
problem of economic access to food, although food
availability can be an issue in some isolated rural areas and
at some periods of the year because of large distances to
markets and poor roads and transportation facilities.

36

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

The households surveyed noted changes in their food
consumption patterns – particularly less consumption of
meat and dairy products – and attributed this change to
higher prices. Data from FAO’s GIEWS price database
show that domestic maize and tortilla prices were not
substantially affected by the global food crisis, but domestic
rice prices in 2008 were 29 percent above those in 2007 in
real terms. The diminished economic access to food because
of higher prices was compounded by lower incomes
resulting from decreased employment opportunities abroad
(meaning reduced remittances) and locally (including for
agricultural labourers, mine workers and workers in exportoriented factories). Lower earnings from handicrafts,
because of reduced demand and higher raw material costs,
also contributed to food insecurity for some livelihood
groups. Damage from Hurricane Felix and flooding in late
2007 and early 2008 also contributed to reduced incomes
and higher food prices.
The types of dietary changes reported (away from meat
and dairy products) may translate into higher chronic
malnutrition rates among children under five years of age
(stunting already affects one out of five children) and worsen
energy and micronutrient deficiencies among other
vulnerable groups such as pregnant and lactating women,
the elderly and the chronically sick. Decreased household
spending on health will delay treatment of illness or use
of preventive services such as vaccination, with further
negative effects on the nutritional status of vulnerable
individuals. At the same time, the economic crisis will limit
the Government’s capacity to expand the coverage of
water and sanitation services and improve the quality of
health care.
A depressed local economy also means that small
businesses will close and local shopkeepers will tighten credit
conditions, further limiting access to food by poor
households. Those who do not benefit from remittances and
are not trusted to repay their debts will be particularly
hard hit.
Apart from coping with the crisis through dietary
changes, many households indicated their intention to
increase out-migration to try to secure jobs and additional
income, even though they acknowledge reduced work
opportunities abroad. A return to subsistence (instead of
cash-oriented) agriculture and engagement in informal, lowearning activities (e.g. petty trade) were also frequently
mentioned as coping mechanisms. Some households are also
adopting negative or environmentally damaging strategies,
such as accumulating more debt, selling livestock and
domestic assets, and collecting fuelwood for sale. Depending
on the length of the crisis, reduced household investment in
child education may impair future livelihood opportunities
and contribute to the intergenerational cycle of poverty,
given the close association between education levels and
poverty rates in Nicaragua.

Case studies of countries affected by the economic crisis

■ What are the ongoing responses?
Expansion of responses to the earlier food and fuel crisis by
the Government and a number of donors and UN agencies
could help address the current economic crisis. These include
the Integral School Nutrition Programme (supported by the
World Bank and WFP), the Agro-Seeds and Productive Food
Programmes (supported by the World Bank and FAO), and
opening fair-price shops for basic foods in poor urban
neighbourhoods.
It is clear that the global economic crisis will aggravate a
pre-crisis situation of widespread chronic poverty, food
insecurity and malnutrition. These conditions are themselves
related to basic agro-ecological and socio-economic factors

compounded by the high vulnerability of Nicaragua to
natural disasters. Consequently, responses to the economic
crisis should not only aim to mitigate the immediate effects
on specific population groups (small-scale agricultural
producers, the landless rural poor, the newly unemployed in
urban areas and children in poor households) but also
continue to tackle the basic causes of poverty and food
insecurity. Thus, it will be important to improve services
(e.g. health, water, sanitation and education), infrastructure
(e.g. roads and electricity), agricultural productivity and
access to credit. With no clear sense of the length and depth
of the crisis, contingency planning and enhanced monitoring
of the evolving economic, fiscal and household food-security
situations is also critical.

Zambia
Zambia is a landlocked country in southern Africa with a
population of about 12 million people. Overall poverty rates
in Zambia declined from 70 percent in 1996 to 64 percent in
2006. Despite this progress, half of the population is still
considered extremely poor, with 14 percent classified as
moderately poor. The staple food is white maize.
Foreign remittances are of minor importance (Figure 19),
but the IMF rates Zambia as highly vulnerable to the
economic crisis because of several interlinked factors: a sharp
decline in the price of the primary export commodity, copper;
devaluation of Zambia’s currency, the kwacha; a reduction in
foreign direct investment; continued high food inflation and
a decline in tourism.

■ Macroeconomic impacts
Zambia needs a sustained economic growth rate of about
7 percent if it is to meet the MDGs by 2015, but as a result of
the global economic crisis, projections for economic growth
have been revised downward from 6 percent to 4 percent for
2009. In addition, FDI fell from US$1 323.9 million in 2007 to
US$938.6 million in 2008 (a 29 percent drop). Foreign
portfolio investment (investment by foreign individuals or
companies in bonds and shares as opposed to factories,
mines and land) showed an outflow of US$6.1 million in
2008 compared with an inflow of US$41.8 million in 2007.
These trends are expected to continue in 2009.
Zambia is particularly vulnerable to the economic crisis
because it relies so heavily on mining, particularly of copper.

The mining sector accounted for about 8 percent of GDP in
2008, but 74 percent of total export earnings. Expectations
of slower economic growth, coupled with political
uncertainty and a fall in international copper prices, caused
the kwacha to lose one-third of its value against the
US dollar between March 2008 and March 2009.
Inflation, particularly of food prices, is on the rise in
Zambia. In April 2009, overall inflation was 14.3 percent
compared with 10.1 percent in April 2008 and 13.1 percent
in March 2009. Food inflation rose sharply to 15.9 percent
in April 2009 from 10.1 percent in April 2008 and
13.9 percent in March 2009. As bad as this price inflation
is, the increases in the price of maize, the main source of
calories for the poor, have been even higher. Data from
FAO’s GIEWS database show that white maize prices in
2008 were 24 percent higher in real terms than they were
in 2007.

■ Effects on food security and livelihoods
Copperbelt Province: the mining sector
The mining sector in Copperbelt Province directly employed
an estimated 30 000 individuals in 2008. Approximately
8 000 have already been retrenched and this figure was
predicted to reach 10 000 by June 2009. In terms of overall
unemployment, this is an underestimate as it does not
account for retrenchments by contractors, suppliers and
service providers for the mining companies. In essence,
towns in Copperbelt Province are built around the needs of

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

37

Case studies of countries affected by the economic crisis

the mining companies and the majority of jobs are either
directly or indirectly linked to the sector.
Until mid-2008, mining-sector jobs were considered the
most secure and lucrative not only because of the relatively
higher salaries but also because of the fringe benefits,
including severance pay, free medical care, and allowances
for education, housing and meals. The perceived job security
in the sector meant that many people took out loans from
commercial banks, which, in turn, felt comfortable lending
to mine workers. However, when declining global demand
for copper forced mining companies to lay off employees,
the banks also called in their loans. In many cases, severance
pay – two months of base salary for each year worked –
went directly to the banks.
The loss of health benefits has been difficult for many
people, particularly those on anti-retroviral medication for
HIV/AIDS, which is a major problem in Zambia. The private
clinics and hospitals established by the mining companies
were not only providing drugs but also the necessary highprotein diets. Now, many retrenched workers depend on
public health systems that do not necessarily have the
capacity to absorb the additional caseload. Thus, already
weak public health facilities are becoming further strained,
resulting in both reduced quality of care and poor coverage
for all. This is a critical issue for a country that has one of the
world’s highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates.
Most of the retrenched miners are still residing within the
mining communities in the expectation that the situation will
soon improve and they will be re-employed. However, their
prospects are poor because the mining companies have used
the lower copper prices as an opportunity to minimize
production costs by shifting from labour-intensive operations
to the more capital-intensive technologies (e.g. increased
mechanization) required to stay competitive in the current
economic environment. Some retrenched workers want to
practice agriculture but find themselves ill-prepared and illequipped, with neither the skills nor the resources to acquire
land and pay for the inputs.
Households in the Copperbelt are employing several
coping mechanisms to deal with the economic slowdown.
People in the towns have moved their children from private
schools to public schools and now rely more on the public
health-care system. Some households have reduced the
number of meals they consume or are eating less-nutritious
but cheaper food. In the province’s rural areas, sales of
charcoal and livestock have increased.
Because Copperbelt Province has been one of Zambia’s
more prosperous provinces, there are few UN or other
international agencies present to provide humanitarian
assistance. WFP is currently absent from the area, but may
need to establish a presence given the current and emerging
vulnerabilities.

38

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

Southern Province: the tourism sector
The main source of livelihood in the district around Southern
Province’s capital of Livingstone is tourism. The area boasts a
range of tourist attractions, including the Victoria Falls,
national parks, museums, rafting and boating, and game
parks. Most people either work directly for tourism service
providers (e.g. lodges) or rely on the industry indirectly as
suppliers, transporters and sellers of small handicrafts.
The decline in international tourism triggered by the
economic crisis, coupled with extensive flooding along the
Zambezi River, has hurt the economic well-being of most
communities. It is estimated that as many as three-quarters
of the people working for the hospitality and tourism sector
have either been retrenched or are working fewer hours.
Business was significantly down during the early period of
the 2009 peak tourism season (which begins in April).
Managers of quality hotels do not foresee a substantial
improvement in the business environment until mid-2010
and were expecting occupancy rates of only about
50 percent during the 2009 high season.
Remittances from Copperbelt and Northwestern Provinces
are an important income source for about 23 percent of the
households in the Livingstone district. However, both the
amount and frequency of the remittances have declined
given retrenchments in the copper industry. Around
44 percent of the migrants have already returned home.
The affected households are employing a range of coping
mechanisms to mitigate the economic slowdown. Some are
venturing into farming, but poor soils, lack of capital for
inputs and threats from wild animals are hampering
progress. Others are relying on extended family support, but
this is unlikely to be sustainable. Many see no option but to
reduce expenses by cutting the number of meals, consuming
less-nutritious but cheaper food, or spending less on health
care and schooling. Focus group interviews with
communities suggested that negative coping strategies such
as theft and prostitution are also on the rise.
Communities worry that it might take more than two
years for the situation to improve, and they are unsure about
how they will survive until things do turn around. Their main
priorities for weathering the crisis are employment, credit
and improved access to food.

■ What are the ongoing responses?
The Government has not allocated any funds specifically to
the crisis, but it has increased spending on agriculture, health
and education. These expenditures are aimed at a range of
programmes, including increased fertilizer use in agriculture,
enhanced treatment of HIV/AIDS and malaria, hiring of new
teachers and construction of new schools.

Towards eliminating hunger

T

he present crisis is not a new crisis. It is the sudden
worsening of a structural crisis that, over the past
decades, has denied hundreds of millions of human
beings access to adequate food for an active and healthy life.
The rapid increase in the number of hungry over the past
two years, because of first the food and fuel crisis and now
the economic crisis, reveals the fragility of present food
systems. The current situation points to the urgent need to
tackle the structural, root causes of hunger. In addition to

macroeconomic stabilization policies designed to minimize
the immediate impact of the current shock, governments
should boost and encourage their investments in agriculture
(including non-farm rural activities), expanding safety nets
and social-assistance programmes, and improving
governance. Although not a focus of this publication, it will
also be important to create income-generating activities for
the urban poor.

The importance of investing in agriculture
and public goods
The World Bank’s World Development Report 2008 clearly
shows that agriculture can make substantial contributions to
economic development and poverty alleviation in the leastdeveloped countries.33 Even though this role is reduced
substantially in middle-income countries, agriculture
continues to play a crucial role in alleviating poverty, which
remains disproportionately rural in spite of the falling relative
importance of agriculture in national economies.
To fulfil its role as an engine of growth and poverty
alleviation, however, agriculture itself needs to grow. And
agricultural growth cannot be achieved and sustained
without investing in agriculture. Unfortunately, in countries
where the socio-economic role of agriculture is largest,
public investment in agriculture tends to be relatively very
low. Public investment in agriculture as a percentage of
agricultural GDP is lowest in agriculture-based economies
(around 4 percent) and largest in urbanized developing
countries (around 15 percent).34 As discussed earlier, the
most rapid progress in reducing food insecurity was made
when the level of ODA allocated to agriculture was much
higher than it is today.

The problem of underinvestment in agriculture is
compounded during times of economic turmoil such as the
current global economic slowdown, because when both
private and public budgets contract, investments tend to be
cut to a greater extent than other expenditures in all
sectors – including agriculture. It is as yet uncertain how the
current economic environment is affecting capital stocks
(including machines, livestock and trees) in agriculture, but
history tells us that during economic crises and the years that
follow, capital stocks decline as a consequence of reductions
in investment. Figure 23 shows that after the debt crisis of
1982 there was a marked reduction in agricultural capital
stocks in developing countries (similar declines occurred in
developed countries).
It is therefore important that, during and following
economic crises, investment in agriculture receives decisive
support from both the private and public sectors. For
investments in agriculture to fully materialize, a business
environment that promotes private, domestic and foreign
investment in not only agriculture but also all other sectors
needs to be in place. Such an environment includes respect

for the rule of law, good governance and macroeconomic
stability.
Private investment in agriculture requires accompanying
public investment. For example, by integrating a fertile
region, a public road makes private investments in that
region more profitable. Research has shown that in countries
as diverse as China, India, Uganda and the United Republic
of Tanzania, investments in agricultural research and rural
roads contribute substantially to poverty alleviation. A study

40

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

from Latin America showed that, while government
spending on public goods increased agricultural growth rates
and accelerated poverty reduction, government spending on
private initiatives such as credit subsidies or production
promotion that benefits only a small group of large farmers
were less beneficial. Thus, the public sector has a crucial role
to play in promoting the overall investment in agriculture
required to achieve the full socio-economic potential of
agricultural growth.35

Towards eliminating hunger

Safety nets for the short term and long term
■ Safety nets in times of crisis
During any crisis, safety nets and social programmes are
particularly important for the food-insecure. At such times,
however, government expenditures often contract as
developing countries find it hard to implement countercyclical spending. For example, during the economic crisis in
Peru in the late 1980s, public-health expenditures fell by
58 percent in total and from 4.3 percent to 3 percent as a
share of overall government expenditures.36 Even in other
cases where health’s share of government expenditures
increased, declines in GDP and/or the share of government
spending in GDP mean that real per capita government
health expenditures often contract in times of crisis.
In addition, evidence from Argentina, Bangladesh, India
and Indonesia shows that government social spending tends
to be less well-targeted in times of economic contraction, i.e.
the non-poor increase their share of benefits relative to the
poor.37 Thus, even if governments are able to protect overall
social spending during a contraction, there is no guarantee
that the same level of social spending will continue to reach
the poor. These considerations suggest the importance of
designing safety nets whose coverage automatically
increases during downturns. Moreover, to keep costs
manageable, it will be important to design a safety-net
programme in such a way that the poor are the only people
who want to access the benefit (this is termed “selftargeting”). For example, the employment-guarantee
schemes used in India are self-targeted to the poor because
usually it is only the poor who will want to work as daily
labourers. In addition, if market wages decrease during an
economic downturn and the wage in the employmentguarantee scheme is fixed, then the number of people who
want to participate will increase. Further, as economic
recovery takes hold, many people will drop out of the
programme automatically as market wages increase, without
any need for bureaucratic intervention.38

■ Rationale for safety nets
Social safety nets are not a new concept, but their
importance has grown considerably in recent years. Their
implementation is often a key recommendation for
mitigating the effects of food, fuel and financial crises.39
The approach to those measures has evolved remarkably
since the 1990s, experiencing four core conceptual shifts:40

v From relief to risk management. In some cases, risks and
shocks are predictable. In such cases, they can be
prevented or mitigated by advance preparation provided
there are comprehensive national and household riskmanagement strategies, as opposed to relying on coping
responses after the event (see box on Ethiopia).
v From projects to systems. A number of countries
(e.g. Malawi and Mozambique) are rationalizing and
coordinating various safety nets in order to create safetynet systems, as opposed to collections of scattered
projects.41
v From assistance to country ownership. International
assistance should support governments’ capacities to
make a gradual transition towards nationally owned and
funded safety-net systems, such as those in high- and
middle-income countries. The provision of national safety
nets is a key component of the social contract and mutual
accountability between state and citizens.42
v From handouts to investments. Safety nets can be an
integral component of inclusive growth strategies, as
opposed to simply being residual to the growth process.
For example, safety nets can give people the opportunity
and incentive to improve their skills, knowledge and
productive capabilities, and encourage risk-taking
initiatives.43

■ Defining safety nets
While there are a number of definitions of, and approaches
to, safety nets, there is consensus that they are a subset of
broader social-protection systems (Figure 24, page 43).
Safety nets mostly include transfers that are not dependent
on the recipient having previously contributed money. These
transfers can be in cash or in kind, and can be conditional or
unconditional.44 In addition to safety nets, social protection
also includes labour-market policies and insurance options
(e.g. contributory pensions and health insurance), as well as
some components of “sectoral” policies whose main focus is
on sectors such as education, health, nutrition or agriculture.
These other social-protection measures can sometimes
overlap with safety nets: the use of weather insurance, for
example, represents a common area between safety nets and
labour/insurance measures.45 Sectoral policies can also
overlap with safety nets, as they provide physical
infrastructure such as schools and health clinics that are
necessary for safety nets to function well. However, the

Safety nets in Ethiopia

For many years, Ethiopia has seemed to be in constant
crisis. Each year, when harvests failed, the government
would ask the international community for emergency
assistance. Yet this approach failed to address the
structural problems underlying Ethiopia’s food insecurity.
The need for a strategy that left behind more than empty
food sacks triggered the shift from annual relief to multiannual predictable support under the Productive Safety
Net Programme. Predictable and counter-cyclical safety
nets put in place before crises hit not only decrease the
need for relief assistance, but are also vital for enhancing
risk management.1
Under the Productive Safety Net Programme (the largest
safety-net programme in Africa), cash or food goes to
some 7 million Ethiopians for six months each year, either
through public works such as construction of rural roads
and bridges, or as direct payments. Families live off their
own income for the rest of the year.
A survey of nearly 1 000 households participating in
this programme found that almost all food transfers were
consumed and most cash was used to purchase food.
Participants were also less likely to sell assets (especially
livestock) to buy food, leaving them less prone to
destitution.
The programme includes other innovations. In 2006, for
example, the World Food Programme (WFP) initiated, with
AXA Re, the world’s first insurance contract for
humanitarian relief. Under this arrangement, support to
vulnerable people is triggered by adverse weather events
such as drought.2
In 2007–08, soaring food prices and a drop in foreign
investment and remittances threatened to stall the
national progress made through the programme.
Problems such as the low value and erratic disbursement

scope and range of sectoral policies often go beyond social
protection.

■ Key implementation issues
Implementing effective safety nets requires tailoring the
interventions to the local context, both in terms of local
capacity and the specific crisis being addressed. The design
of safety nets should explicitly recognize such diversity and
be tailored to meet context-specific conditions and
constraints. In particular, it is important to understand
countries’ institutional, political, technical and financial
capacity to introduce or expand safety nets. The four
clusters, or models, of safety nets include:46

42

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

of cash and food must be addressed. Preliminary analysis
suggests that when families do receive predictable
disbursements of cash and food transfers at frequent
intervals, as opposed to unpredictable disbursements at
varying intervals, several benefits are realized. Households
in distress are less likely to sell assets and more likely to
adopt riskier but profitable technologies, and the private
sector is more likely to extend credit, even for
consumption needs, because the default risk is lower.
Improved targeting of beneficiaries and their
subsequent “graduation” from a safety-net programme
should also be prioritized. Despite progress in expanding
the number of eligible beneficiaries, the programme still
targets only some of the country’s food-insecure
households. This issue is particularly compelling for
pastoralist areas (e.g. the Somali region in eastern
Ethiopia) not yet covered by the programme. At the same
time, improved linkages with emergency responses and
other development packages need to be explored.3

v Absence of safety-net systems. This includes very lowcapacity, often post-war, countries that do not have
formal safety-net systems in place. Factors that
characterize such countries include stagnant or declining
economic growth, instability, low-productivity food and
agricultural systems, market failures and low humandevelopment levels. Safety nets are often provided by the
international community, mostly in the form of emergency
relief. Such forms of assistance, if designed well, can lay
the basis for a transition towards a more permanent
national safety-net system.

Brazil’s safety-net response to the economic crisis

The economic crisis hit Brazil as early as the final quarter
of 2008, when GDP declined by 3.6 percent compared
with the previous quarter after years of positive growth.
The Brazilian Government responded with a range of
policies, including counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies
(e.g. increasing government spending during an economic
downturn to boost employment) made possible by
prudent management of current account surpluses
accumulated in previous years. In addition, the
Government has also implemented a range of safety nets:
v Coverage of the Bolsa Familia programme – which
awards monthly cash payments to poor families
provided that they meet certain conditions such as
school attendance, vaccines and prenatal visits – was
expanded from 10.6 to 11.9 million families. All
families would receive a payment of US$28 per family
plus US$9 per child under the age of 9 years and
US$14 per older child (all per month). Although this is
a small amount of money for wealthy families, it is very
important for poor families.

v Unemployment insurance coverage for workers
registered at the Labour Secretariat and who work in
specific subsectors and states was expanded from
5 months to 7 months.
v The minimum wage was increased by 12 percent
(nearly twice the rate of inflation), benefiting 45 million
workers and injecting additional spending power into
the economy.
v In the wake of falling agricultural prices, coverage of
the Price Guarantee Programme for Family Agriculture
was expanded from 15 to 29 crops and minimum
guaranteed prices were also increased for a number of
crops.
v An investment programme, “My house, my life”, was
established to assist families in the construction of new
houses through subsidized credit and reduced taxes on
building materials.

national safety-net programmes are present, although
they are often uncoordinated, short term, and limited in
scale. As mentioned earlier, the Productive Safety Net
Programme in Ethiopia has relatively robust coordination
and considerable donor support, and is providing cash
and food to about 7 million people.
v Emerging social-protection systems. Under this model,
low- to medium-capacity countries start formulating
formal safety-net policies and strategies, and seek to
institutionalize multi-annual programmes to improve
coverage, coordination and flexibility.
v Consolidated safety-net systems. This group includes
medium-capacity countries that have institutionalized a
safety-net system funded by national governments.
In these countries, markets and food and agricultural
systems tend to function relatively well, and the
challenges are mostly in filling gaps, making the system
work more efficiently, and enhancing the technical
aspects and quality of the assistance.
Ultimately, the design of safety nets appropriate for the
local context involves making decisions about what
conditions recipients must meet; the choice of cash, food or
vouchers; and the extent of targeting. Effective targeting is
important to maximize impact and minimize distortions to
incentives. A number of targeting methods exist (e.g. meanstested, categorical, geographical and community-based), and
each has advantages and disadvantages in any given context.
It is important to strike a balance between ensuring that
benefits reach the most vulnerable populations while at the

same time do not create artificial boundaries between and
within communities that are almost equally vulnerable.
While the understanding of safety nets in middle- and
some low-income counties is growing, the challenge often
lies in how to make the lessons learned relevant to fragile
states and other low-income countries with lower capacities.
Broader applied research priorities should include appraising
country capacity to provide safety nets; identifying methods
to fill capacity gaps; testing institutional flexibility to respond
to unexpected emergencies; investigating the ability of safety
nets to reduce the sources and perception of risks so as to
ultimately trigger behavioural change; nurturing in
governments a genuine demand for social protection; and
establishing common platforms for sustainable handover
from external agencies to national governments.

The right to food
In 2008, the right to adequate food was recognized as a
fundamental component of a sustainable solution to the
world food-security crisis caused by high food prices. The
reasons are twofold. On the one hand, the crisis
disproportionately affected those who were already
vulnerable, typically people who spend large proportions of
their income on food. On the other hand, there was wide
recognition that, when it came to responding to the crisis,
the “business-as-usual” approach would not work.
Traditional approaches, which dealt with the technical
dimensions of food insecurity in terms of both their
emergency and structural aspects, needed to be
complemented with an additional dimension focusing on the
promotion of the right to adequate food and the reform of
both global and national food-security governance.

44

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

The right to food was also central to the January 2009
High-Level Meeting on Food Security for All, held in Madrid.
In his closing remarks to the conference, United Nations
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pleaded for inclusion of the
right to food “as a basis for analysis, action and
accountability” in promoting food security.
The right to food is, first of all, a basic human right
enshrined in international law. It is the right of every person
to have continuous access to the resources necessary to
produce, earn or purchase enough food not only to prevent
hunger, but also to ensure health and well-being. The right
to food provides a coherent framework within which to
address critical governance dimensions of the fight against
hunger and gives voice to a wide array of relevant groups
and individuals. It establishes principles that govern decision-

Towards eliminating hunger

making and implementation processes, namely participation,
non-discrimination, transparency and empowerment. It also
provides a legal framework – based on the concepts of rights
and obligations – and mechanisms for increased
accountability and the rule of law.
A right-to-food perspective provides a framework for the
diagnosis of the food security problem as well as guidance
for the design, implementation and monitoring of initiatives
taken in response to the food crisis. In this context, the
Right to Food Guidelines (Voluntary Guidelines to support

the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in
the context of national food security)47 provide a context for
translating political commitments into practical and
concrete action. The Guidelines recommend that states
adopt a national strategy for the realization of the right to
adequate food that includes: mapping the groups that are
most vulnerable and ensuring their participation; clearly
allocating responsibilities across different branches of
government and improving coordination; setting
benchmarks and imposing time frames; and empowering

The right to food in Brazil

The conceptual discussion on the relevance of the
“human right to adequate food” approach to fighting
hunger, and its effective incorporation into Brazil’s food
and nutritional security strategy, is closely intertwined
with the discussions held around the 1996 World Food
Summit (WFS) in Rome and the resolutions of the World
Conference on Human Rights in 1993 in Vienna. The
strong participation of civil society in the process bridged
the struggles against hunger and poverty with those
promoting human rights, with the right to food at the
centre.
The 1994 National Food Security Conference convened
by Brazil’s National Council of Food and Nutrition Security
defined the direction for a national food-security strategy,
and incorporated the right to adequate food into the
discussions. This was clearly reflected in Brazil’s official
report to the WFS, which reaffirmed the relevance of the
right to adequate food to a national food security
strategy.
The new Federal Government, elected in 2002 in the
midst of a serious social crisis, defined a rights-based fight
against hunger as one of its central political banners. One
of the Government’s first measures was to reconstitute
the National Council of Food and Nutrition Security, with
the mission to guarantee the realization of the right to
adequate food by instituting the Zero Hunger Programme
as a strategy geared to reach those Brazilians most
affected by food and nutritional insecurity and hunger.
The national food and nutritional security policy –
implemented by the Government with the support of the
National Council, and state and municipal councils
composed of civil-society and governmental
representatives – is based on and geared towards
promoting the right to food. This policy promotes the
coordination of all food and nutritional security-related
public policies and programmes along two main lines of
action: guaranteeing immediate access to healthy and
adequate food to the most affected sectors of the

population, and the promotion of socio-economic
inclusion of these groups into productive and economic
activities. Most importantly, the food and economic
assistance programmes are planned and implemented so
as to stimulate and consolidate small-scale farm
production and local economies, thereby helping people
pull themselves out of poverty.
In 2006, the National Congress approved the
National Food and Nutritional Security Organic Law,
which reaffirms the State’s obligation to respect, protect
and fulfil the right to food, including the obligation to
establish recourse mechanisms through which people
can claim their right.
The Zero Hunger Programme incorporates more than
40 social and social-security policies and programmes,
reaching out to more than one-third of the Brazilian
population (through means such as cash transfers, schoolfeeding programmes and direct procurement from
smallholder farmers). These programmes, which are
associated with further agrarian reform and strong credit
and technical support to smallholder agriculture, have
allowed Brazil to mitigate the impact of the global food
and economic crises on food security and overall
economic growth.

independent institutions, including courts, to enhance
accountability.
The Right to Food Guidelines also recommend that states
promote good governance as an essential factor for
sustained economic growth, sustainable development, and
poverty and hunger eradication, as well as for the realization
of all human rights including the progressive realization of
the right to adequate food.
Improved governance of public institutions that monitor,
design and implement food security policies and

programmes is an essential part of the implementation of
the Guidelines. At government level, this means that all
relevant ministries, technical departments and commissions
need to combine their complementary skills and efforts to
design and implement effective, integrated cross-sectoral
initiatives. Participation of households, families, farmers’
organizations, agribusiness, civil society organizations and
others in the policy-making process – not only at the national
level but also at the regional, village and even family
levels – is essential.

Strengthening governance mechanisms for world food security

The persistence of undernourishment and its aggravation
during the recent food and economic crises underscore
the need for improved global food-security governance to
address fundamental weaknesses in the fight against
hunger. In spite of ongoing global food-security analysis
and timely warning of likely immediate and long-term
problems, such knowledge has not been translated
effectively into appropriate and timely policies,
programmes, institutions and response mechanisms. The
attention currently focused on global food insecurity
should be utilized to tackle the root causes of hunger and
show how future crises could be avoided by addressing
long-term challenges to food security such as rural
poverty, inappropriate policies and strategies, and
insufficient investment in food and agriculture.
Such objectives would require coherent and
coordinated action over the longer term. To be
addressed in a sustainable manner, they require
common policies, strategies and programmes and also
strengthened capacity for implementation and
monitoring of interventions. To that end, the governance
of the fight against food insecurity needs to be
consolidated at the global level, drawing and building on
existing structures.
The Committee on World Food Security is a universal
intergovernmental body made up of Member Nations of
FAO and UN Member States that is mandated to review
and follow up policies concerning world food security and
to examine issues affecting the world food-security
situation. It is currently undergoing reform, with the aim
of enhancing its effectiveness in galvanizing political will
and developing technical solutions for the alleviation of
chronic hunger and food insecurity. By helping to
coordinate the actions of all relevant stakeholders, and by
being empowered to become more effective, the
reformed Committee has the potential to generate
momentum for timely, integrated, sustainable and
effective responses to the challenges of food security.

46

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2009

It could become a key component of a global partnership
for agriculture, food security and nutrition.
Initiatives to revitalize the global governance of world
food security should consider past experiences and
ongoing global changes. Civil society has become more
prominent in the public debates that influence policy and
shape public opinion at the national, regional and global
levels, and it has also become more involved in the affairs
of the UN. Moreover, the world economy, including food
systems, has become more interconnected and globalized,
with a shock in one country now reverberating across the
globe more than it would have done in the 1970s. Nongovernmental organizations, farmers’ organizations and
the private sector should be engaged in policy and
programme design to remedy the negative effects of such
economic shocks.
To ensure a more effective and efficient global
agriculture, food and nutrition system, the governance of
world food security must:
v provide science-based analysis and advocacy
concerning the key determinants and possible
evolution of food security;
v help coordinate and strengthen international, regional
and national strategies, policies and programmes for
sustainable agriculture and food security;
v promote actions that encourage investment in
agriculture while maintaining focus on equitable,
broad-based sharing of resources;
v strengthen coherence among food security policies and
related issues such as climate change, environmental
sustainability and natural resource management;
v monitor progress and the results of past and present
policy measures, as well as the effectiveness and
efficiency of resource mobilization; and
v influence governments and other key stakeholders to
commit themselves to clearly defined, time-bound
goals and actions to eradicate hunger and food
insecurity and to develop ways to monitor these goals.

Towards eliminating hunger

In the wake of the food crisis, countries that have begun
implementing the right to food, such as Brazil (see box on
the right to food in Brazil), have demonstrated the value of
participatory coordination mechanisms. These include the
National Council of Food and Nutrition Security, targeted
safety nets such as the Bolsa Familia programme, transparent
and accountable programmes such as the school-feeding
programme, and empowered citizens.
Food security is a function not only of production and
market access, but also of the environment created by
economic and political institutions at all levels. These
institutions can facilitate or obstruct people’s access to
essential livelihood assets. Understanding governance
structures and institutional contexts is crucial for addressing
food security as a policy issue that cuts across several

sectors and has multiple dimensions. It is now well
recognized that the institutional set-up and the processes
that allow interactions among stakeholders are critical
factors for success or failure when formulating,
implementing and monitoring policies, strategies and
programmes.
Because of their close link to the current economic crisis,
the global food crisis and the commitment to address its
structural causes should remain at the top of the
international political agenda. In addition to preventing past
mistakes from being repeated, the right to food and good
governance will ensure that food systems, along with social,
economic and political systems, will be set up at all levels
with the overarching objective of promoting the well-being
of humanity and the dignity of every human being.

Throughout this publication, “economic
crisis” is used to refer to general global
economic conditions in 2008 and 2009,
including both recession and the financial
crisis. “Food crisis” refers to the period in
2006–08 that saw the prices of almost all
major food commodities (as well as the
cost of fuel) increase to levels that were
unaffordable for a great number of the
world’s poor.

World Food Summit goal: halve, between 1990–92 and 2015,
the number of undernourished people.
Millennium Development Goal 1, target 1C: halve, between 1990 and
2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. Indicator 1.9:
Proportion of population below minimum level of dietary energy
consumption (undernourishment).
Latest report period refers to 2004–06 estimates, and baseline refers
to 1990–92. For countries that did not exist in the baseline period,
the 1990–92 proportion of undernourished is based on 1993–95
and the number of undernourished is based on their 1990–92
population and this proportion.

Countries revise their ofﬁcial statistics regularly for the past as well as the
latest reported period. The same holds for population data of the United
Nations. Whenever this happens, FAO revises its estimates of
undernourishment accordingly. Therefore, users are advised to refer to
changes in estimates over time only within the same edition of The State of
Food Insecurity in the World and refrain from comparing data published in
editions for different years.
Figures following country names refer to the prevalence categories
(proportion of the population undernourished in 2004–06):
[1] < 5 percent undernourished
[2] 5–9 percent undernourished
[3] 10–19 percent undernourished
[4] 20–34 percent undernourished
[5] ≥ 35 percent undernourished
Developing countries for which there were insufﬁcient data are not listed in
the table.
Ratio current/baseline number of undernourished – ratio for WFS
target = 0.5.
** Ratio current/baseline prevalence of undernourished – ratio for MDG
target = 0.5.
*** Although not listed separately, provisional estimates for Afghanistan
and Iraq (Near East and North Africa), Papua New Guinea (Asia and
the Paciﬁc) and Somalia (East Africa) have been included in the
relevant regional aggregates. Developed countries have been included
in world estimates.
**** Eritrea and Ethiopia were not separate entities in 1990–92, but
estimates of the number and proportion of undernourished in the
former People’s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia are included in
regional and subregional aggregates for that period.

DES = dietary energy supply available for human consumption.
The data reported in this column include workers’ remittances,
compensation of employees and migrants’ transfers.
Net ofﬁcial development assistance (ODA) consists of disbursements of
loans made on concessional terms (net of repayments of principal) and
grants by ofﬁcial agencies of the members of the Development
Assistance Committee (DAC), by multilateral institutions, and by
non-DAC countries to promote economic development and welfare in
countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. It includes
loans with a grant element of at least 25 percent (calculated at a rate
of discount of 10 percent).
Foreign direct investment (FDI) is net inﬂows of investment to acquire
a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in
an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor.
It is the sum of equity capital, re-investment of earnings, other
long-term capital and short-term capital as shown in the balance of
payments (BoP). Figures shown represent the average for 2003–07.
This series shows total net FDI, that is, net FDI in the reporting
economy from foreign sources minus net FDI by the reporting
economy to the rest of the world. Data are in current US dollars.
Current account balance is the sum of net exports of goods and
services, net income and net current transfers.
Total reserves comprise holdings of monetary gold, special drawing
rights, reserves of International Monetary Fund (IMF) members held by
the IMF, and holdings of foreign exchange under the control of
monetary authorities. The gold component of these reserves is valued
at year-end (31 December) London prices. This item shows reserves
expressed in terms of the number of months of imports of goods and
services that could be paid for.
Cash surplus or deﬁcit is revenue (including grants) minus expense,
minus net acquisition of non-ﬁnancial assets. In the 1986 government
ﬁnance statistics (GFS), manual non-ﬁnancial assets were included
under revenue and expenditure in gross terms. This cash surplus or
deﬁcit is closest to the earlier overall budget balance (missing is
lending minus repayments, which is now a ﬁnancing item under net
acquisition of ﬁnancial assets).

The State of

Food Insecurity in the World
Economic crises – impacts and lessons learned

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2009 presents the latest statistics on
global undernourishment and concludes that structural problems of
underinvestment have impeded progress toward the World Food Summit goal and
the ﬁrst Millennium Development Goal hunger reduction target. This disappointing
state of affairs has been exacerbated by ﬁrst the food crisis and now the global
economic crisis that, together, have increased the number of undernourished
people in the world to more than one billion for the ﬁrst time since 1970.
The report describes the transmission channels through which the economic
crisis has affected developing countries and presents a series of country case
studies that show how the poor are struggling to cope with a severe shock that is
not of their own making. This crisis is different from the crises developing countries
have experienced in the past, because it is affecting the entire world
simultaneously, because it comes on top of a food crisis that has already strained
the coping mechanisms of the poor, and because developing countries today are
more integrated into the global economy than in past decades.
In the context of the enormous ﬁnancial pressures faced by governments, the
twin-track approach remains an effective way to address growing levels of hunger
in the world. Stepping up investment in the agriculture sector, especially for public
goods, will be critical if hunger is to be eradicated. In addition, safety nets
designed to protect the most poor and food-insecure are an essential complement
to such investment because the poorest should be given the opportunity to feed
themselves now, even if the full impact of longer-term investment has not yet been
realized.
