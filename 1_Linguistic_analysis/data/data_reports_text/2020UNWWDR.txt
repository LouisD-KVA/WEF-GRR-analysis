Foreword
by Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO

The climate is changing, and our world is in danger.
Around one million animal and plant species are facing extinction. Freshwater species have
suffered the greatest decline, falling by 84% since 1970. Humans are also affected: around four
billion people currently experience severe physical water scarcity for at least one month per year,
a situation that has been exacerbated by the climate crisis.
As the planet warms, water has become one of the main ways we experience climate change.
And yet the word “water” rarely appears in international climate agreements, even though it
plays a key role in issues such as food security, energy production, economic development and
poverty reduction.
This potential of water must be explored, given that our actions to reduce global warming are
currently lagging behind our ambitions, despite wide adherence to the Paris Agreement.
That is the goal of the 2020 World Water Development Report on water and climate change.
The report shows that water does not need to be a problem – it can be part of the solution.
Water can support efforts to both mitigate and adapt to climate change. Wetland protection,
conservation agriculture and other nature-based solutions can help to sequester carbon in
biomass and soils. Improved wastewater treatment can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions
and produce biogas as a source of renewable energy.
Coordinated and produced by UNESCO, this report is the result of close and continued
collaboration within the UN-Water family. It was made possible thanks to the Government of Italy
and the Regione Umbria, which have long supported the World Water Assessment Programme.
I wish to thank all those who participated in this common endeavour.
Water is not just about development – it is a basic human right. It is essential to peace and
security around the world. Addressing the issue of water is not a task to be taken lightly. We
must rise to this challenge if we are to leave behind a world that future generations can live in.

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

Foreword
by Gilbert F. Houngbo, Chair of UN-Water and President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development

Climate change affects – and is affected by – global water resources. It reduces the predictability of water
availability and affects water quality. Climate change also increases the occurrence of extreme weather
events, threatening sustainable social-economic development and biodiversity worldwide. This, in turn,
has profound implications for water resources. As such, climate change exacerbates the ever-growing
challenges associated with the sustainable management of water. Conversely, the way water is managed
influences the drivers of climate change.
Water, therefore, is the ultimate connector in the global commitments towards a sustainable future: the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are highly
dependent on improved water management. Within the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction,
adopted by UN Member States in March, 2015, water management is essential for reducing the occurrence
and impacts of water-related disasters, which have the largest effect on society and people’s livelihoods.
And the implementation of the Paris Agreement is dependent on improved management of water
resources. This is clearly acknowledged in many countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change under the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change. Adaptation initiatives related to water, for example, have been included as a
first priority in many NDCs.
The 2020 edition of the UN World Water Development Report addresses the critical linkages between
water and climate change in the context of sustainable development. It also serves as a guide for concrete
actions to address these challenges. It outlines actions, supported by examples from across the world,
in three areas: first, enabling people to adapt to the impacts of climate change; second, improving the
resilience of livelihoods; and, third, reducing the drivers of climate change. Critically, measures to improve
the efficiency of water use in agriculture - while at the same time ensuring water access for vulnerable
groups such as smallholder farmers - is inextricably linked to multiple SDGs. These include those related to
zero hunger (SDG 2), availability and access to water (SDG 6), climate action (SDG 13), and promoting the
sustainable use of ecosystem services (SDG 15).
The Report concludes that reducing both the impacts and drivers of climate change will require substantial
changes in the way we use and reuse the Earth’s limited water resources. The experience and expertise
needed to achieve this goal are brought together in the Report through UN-Water’s Members and Partners.
I would like to thank them all for the development of this flagship publication. I am grateful to UNESCO and
its World Water Assessment Programme for coordinating the production of this report. I am confident that
it will support policy makers in tackling the challenges of climate change by harnessing the wide-ranging
opportunities that improved water management offers for adaptation, mitigation and resilience in a rapidly
changing world.

Preface
by Michela Miletto, UNESCO WWAP Deputy Coordinator
and Richard Connor, Editor in Chief

Climate change affects ecosystems, human societies and economies in a variety of ways, and water is the
primary medium through which these impacts are felt. In some cases, these impacts are clearly obvious
– for example through the increasing frequency and intensity of storms, floods and droughts. Increasing
variability in the global water cycle implies greater water stress at different times and over different areas.
The water-related impacts of climate change also include negative effects on food security, human health,
energy production, and biodiversity, not to mention the daily livelihoods of the world’s most vulnerable
women, men and children. These in turn can lead (and have led) to rising societal inequities, social unrest,
mass migration and conflict.
At the international level, a number of global frameworks have been adopted to address these challenges.
However, while the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (with its 17 SDGs, including specific goals
for water and for combating climate change), the 2015 Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for
Disaster Risk Reduction have all set ambitious goals and targets, actual progress towards meeting these
global commitments has been lagging, especially in how each of these major global agreements pertain to
water and climate change.
The 2020 edition of the United Nations World Water Development Report (WWDR) addresses the critical
linkages between water and climate change in the context of the broader sustainable development agenda.
The report is not meant to be a purely technical examination of the impacts of climate change on the
hydrological cycle. Rather, the report focuses on the challenges, opportunities and potential responses
to climate change – in terms of adaptation, mitigation and improved resilience – that can be addressed
through improving how water resources are management and used, while providing water supply and
sanitation services for all in a sustainable manner. In doing so, the report tackles two of the most critical
crises the world will continue facing over the next several decades: Water (in)security and climate change.
When it comes to climate change, there has been a long-held belief that mitigation is mainly about energy,
and that adaptation is mainly about water. Such a perspective greatly over-simplifies things. Of course,
the water sector needs to adapt to climate change – from countering the effects of floods to addressing
increasing water stress for agriculture and industry. But water management can also play a very important
role in climate change mitigation. Specific water management interventions such as wetland protection,
conservation agriculture and other nature-based solutions can help to sequester carbon in biomass and
soils, while improved wastewater treatment can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions while supplying
biogas as a source of renewable energy.
Improving adaptation in water management alone will not solve the climate crisis, nor will mitigation
alone solve the water crisis or meet the SDG for water supply and sanitation. But ignoring water’s role in
climate change adaptation and mitigation, and failing to embrace the opportunities that the climate change
frameworks offer to improve water management is certain to derail any significant progress towards
solving either crises.

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

We have endeavored to produce a balanced, fact-based and neutral account of the current state of
knowledge, covering the most recent developments, and highlighting the challenges and opportunities
provided by improved water management in the context of climate change. Although primarily targeted
at national-level decision-makers and water resources managers, as well as academics and the broader
development community, we also hope this report will be particularly well received by scientists,
practitioners and negotiators from the climate change community.
As the seventh in a series of annual, thematic reports, this latest edition of the WWDR is the result of a
concerted effort between the Chapter Lead Agencies: FAO, SIWI, UNDP, UNESCO-IHP, UNESCO WWAP,
UN-Habitat, UNU-INWEH, WHO, WMO and the World Bank; with regional perspectives provided by GWP, ODI,
UNECA, UNECE, UNECLAC, UNESCAP, UNESCO Office in Nairobi and UNESCWA. The Report also benefitted
to a great extent from the inputs and contributions of several other UN-Water members and partners, as
well as from numerous scientists, professionals and NGOs who provided a wide range of relevant material.
Similar to the other editions, the Report has been gender-mainstreamed and the cross-cutting gender
dimension has been taken into consideration.
On behalf of the WWAP Secretariat, we would like to extend our deepest appreciation to the afore-mentioned
agencies, members and partners of UN-Water, and to the writers and other contributors for collectively
producing this unique and authoritative report that will, hopefully, have multiple impacts worldwide.
We are profoundly grateful to the Italian Government for funding the Programme and to the Regione Umbria
for generously hosting the WWAP Secretariat in Villa La Colombella in Perugia. Their contributions have been
instrumental to the production of the WWDR.
Our special thanks go to Ms Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO, for her vital support to WWAP and
the production of the WWDR. The guidance of Mr Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of the International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD), as Chair of UN-Water has made this publication possible.
We extend our most sincere gratitude to all our colleagues at the WWAP Secretariat, whose names are
listed in the acknowledgments. The report could not have been completed without their professionalism and
dedication. This includes our heartfelt appreciation to Stefan Uhlenbrook who served as UNESCO WWAP
coordinator from November 2015 through September 2019, and who played a key role in the design and
development of the report.
Last but not least, we dedicate this report to the youth of the world, whose inspirational calls for action on
climate change have been heard loud and clear.

Executive Summary
Climate change will affect the availability, quality and quantity of water for basic human needs, threatening
the effective enjoyment of the human rights to water and sanitation for potentially billions of people. The
hydrological changes induced by climate change will add challenges to the sustainable management of
water resources, which are already under severe pressure in many regions of the world.
Food security, human health, urban and rural settlements, energy production, industrial development,
economic growth, and ecosystems are all water-dependent and thus vulnerable to the impacts of climate
change. Climate change adaptation and mitigation through water management is therefore critical to
sustainable development, and essential to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the
Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.

Impacts on water resources
Global water use has increased by a factor of six over the past 100 years and continues to grow steadily
at a rate of about 1% per year as a result of increasing population, economic development and shifting
consumption patterns. Combined with a more erratic and uncertain supply, climate change will aggravate
the situation of currently water-stressed regions, and generate water stress in regions where water
resources are still abundant today. Physical water scarcity is often a seasonal phenomenon, rather than a
chronic one, and climate change is likely to cause shifts in seasonal water availability throughout the year
in several places.
Climate change manifests itself, amongst others, in the increasing frequency and magnitude of extreme
events such as heatwaves, unprecedented rainfalls, thunderstorms and storm surge events.
Water quality will be adversely affected as a result of higher water temperatures, reduced dissolved
oxygen and thus a reduced self-purifying capacity of freshwater bodies. There are further risks of water
pollution and pathogenic contamination caused by flooding or by higher pollutant concentrations during
drought.
Many ecosystems, particularly forests and wetlands, are also at risk. The degradation of ecosystems will
not only lead to biodiversity loss, but also affect the provision of water-related ecosystem services, such
as water purification, carbon capture and storage, and natural flood protection, as well as the provision of
water for agriculture, fisheries and recreation.
Much of the impacts of climate change will be manifested in the tropical zones where most of the
developing world can be found. Small island developing states are typically environmentally and socioeconomically vulnerable to disasters and climate change, and many will experience increasing water
stress. Across the planet, drylands are expected to expand significantly. Accelerated melting of glaciers
is expected to have a negative effect on the water resources of mountain regions and their adjacent
lowlands.
Despite the growing evidence that the changing climate will affect the availability and distribution of
water resources, some uncertainties remain, especially at local and basin scales. While there is not
much disagreement about the temperature increases, which have been simulated by different General
Circulation Models (GCMs) under specific scenario conditions, more variability and ambiguity exist in
projected precipitation trends. Often, trends in extremes (heavier precipitation, heat, prolonged droughts)
show a clearer direction than trends in annual precipitation totals and seasonal patterns.

Executive Summary

1

Adaptation and mitigation
Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for managing and reducing the risks of climate
change.
Adaptation encompasses a combination of natural, engineered and technological options, as well as social
and institutional measures to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities from climate change.
Adaptation options exist in all water-related sectors and should be investigated and applied where possible.
Mitigation comprises human interventions to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases
(GHGs). While mitigation options are also available across every major water-related sector, they remain
largely unrecognized.

International policy frameworks
Within the 2030 Agenda, water serves as an (often) unacknowledged but essential connecting factor for
attaining the different Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As such, failure to adapt to climate change
not only puts the realization of SDG 6 (the ‘water goal’) at risk, it also jeopardizes the achievement of most
other SDGs. And while SDG 13 "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts" includes
specific targets and indicators, there is no formal mechanism linking SDG 13 to the goals of the Paris
Agreement, resulting in parallel processes.
Although water is not mentioned in the Paris Agreement per se, it is an essential component of nearly all the
mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, water is identified as the number one priority for adaptation
actions in most of the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) and is directly or indirectly
related to all other priority areas. Similarly, water is hardly mentioned in the Sendai Framework itself, even
though water flows through each of the priorities for action and is central to all its seven targets.
The challenges of development, poverty eradication and sustainability are intricately interwoven with those
of climate change mitigation and adaptation, especially through water. Given water’s role in mitigating
and adapting to climate change, water could play a connecting role across the SDGs and across policy
frameworks such as the Paris Agreement.

Water resources management, infrastructure and ecosystems
Climate change generates additional risks to water-related infrastructure, requiring an ever-increasing need
for adaptation measures.
Water-related extremes exacerbated by climate change increase risks to water, sanitation and hygiene
(WASH) infrastructure, such as damaged sanitation systems or flooding of sewer pumping stations. The
consequent spread of faeces and associated protozoa and viruses can cause severe health hazards and
cross-contamination.
For water storage infrastructure, there is a need to reassess the safety and sustainability of dams, and to
evaluate them for potential modifications or decommissioning, for the minimization of their environmental
and social impacts, and for the optimization of their services.
In many regions of the world, aquifers present the largest storage capacity, often orders of magnitude
greater than surface water storage. Groundwater is also more buffered from seasonal and multi-year
climate variability and less immediately vulnerable than surface water.
It is increasingly necessary to consider ‘unconventional’ water resources in future planning. Water reuse (or
reclaimed water) is a reliable alternative to conventional water resources for a number of uses, provided
that it is treated and/or used safely. Desalination can augment freshwater supplies, but it is generally energy
intensive and thus may contribute to GHG emissions if the power source is non-renewable. Atmospheric

moisture harvesting such as cloud seeding, or fog water collection presents a low-cost and lowmaintenance approach for localized areas where advective fog is abundant.
The bulk of the GHG emissions related to water management and sanitation either originates from the
energy used to power the systems or the biochemical processes involved in water and wastewater
treatment. Increasing water use efficiency and reducing unnecessary water consumption and water loss
both translate into lower energy use and thus lower GHG emissions.
Wetlands accommodate the largest carbon stocks among terrestrial ecosystems, storing twice as much
carbon as forests. Taking into account that wetlands offer multiple co-benefits – including flood and
drought mitigation, water purification, and biodiversity – their restoration and conservation is of critical
importance.

Disaster risk reduction
The current impacts and future anticipated risks associated with extreme events demand sustainable
solutions for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction (DRR).
The range of available climate change adaptation and DRR strategies includes hard (structural) and
soft (policy instruments) approaches. Hard measures include enhanced water storage, climate-proof
infrastructure, and crop resilience improvements through the introduction of flood- and drought-resistant
crop varieties. Soft measures include flood and drought insurance, forecasting and early warning systems,
land use planning, and capacity building (education and awareness).
Hard and soft measures often go together. Urban planning, for example, can help increase resilience to
flood risks by featuring drainage systems that provide spaces to safely collect and store floodwater. The
city thus acts as a ‘sponge’, limiting surges and releasing rainwater as a resource.
Modern communication methods such as social media and mobile phone services provide significant
opportunities to help improve communication and early warning effectiveness. Drought and flood
monitoring systems are also an important component of risk reduction.
Mainstreaming gender and community involvement in decision-making processes are key elements to
DRR strategies. Improved inter-agency coordination in water resources and disaster risk management is
needed, especially in transboundary basins where it remains fragmented throughout most of the world.

Human health
Anticipated water-related health impacts of climate change are primarily food-, water- and vector-borne
diseases, deaths and injury associated with extreme weather events such as coastal and inland flooding,
as well as undernutrition as a result or food shortages caused by droughts and floods. Mental health
impacts associated with illness, injury, economic losses and displacement may also be substantial,
although difficult to quantify.
At the end of the Millennium Development Goals period (2000–2015), 91% of the global population used
an improved drinking water source and 68% used improved sanitation facilities. Much remains to be done
to reach the new, higher levels of safely managed water supply and sanitation services as defined under
the SDGs for the 2.2 billion and 4.2 billion people respectively who lack this superior level of service.
Climate change is likely to slow or undermine progress on access to safely managed water and sanitation,
and lead to ineffective use of resources if systems design and management are not climate-resilient. By
extension, progress on the elimination and control of water- and sanitation-related disease will also be
slowed or undermined by climate change.

Executive Summary

Food and agriculture
The specific challenges for agricultural water management are twofold. The first is the need to adapt
existing modes of production to deal with higher incidences of water scarcity and water excess (flood
protection and drainage). The second is to ‘decarbonize’ agriculture through climate mitigation measures
that reduce GHG emissions and enhance water availability.
The scope for adaptation in rainfed agriculture is determined largely by the ability of crop varieties to cope
with shifts in temperature and to manage soil water deficits. Irrigation allows cropping calendars to be
rescheduled and intensified, thus providing a key adaptation mechanism for land that previously relied
solely on precipitation.
In terms of equivalent tonnes of CO2, the largest contribution to agricultural GHG emissions is made by the
release of livestock methane through enteric fermentation and manure deposited on pasture. For forestry,
the greatest opportunity for mitigation involves reducing the emissions attributable to deforestation and
forest degradation.
Agriculture has two main avenues for mitigation of GHGs: carbon sequestration through organic matter
accumulation above and below the ground, and emission reduction through land and water management,
including adoption of renewable energy inputs such as solar pumping.
Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is a recognized suite of well-informed approaches to land and water
management, soil conservation and agronomic practice that sequester carbon and reduce GHG
emissions. CSA practices help to retain soil structure, organic matter and moisture under drier conditions,
and include agronomic techniques (including irrigation and drainage) to adjust or extend cropping
calendars to adapt to seasonal and interannual climate shifts.

Energy and industry
The water-related effects of climate change generate risks to business and power generation. Water
stress can put a halt to manufacturing or energy generation. Impacts will also carry into operational
aspects, affecting the supply of raw materials, disrupting supply chains, and causing damage to facilities
and equipment.
Energy is in the spotlight of climate change initiatives as about two-thirds of the world’s anthropogenic
GHGs come from energy production and use. There are a number of opportunities to mitigate GHGs
and reduce water use at the same time. Reducing energy demand and increasing energy efficiency are
starting points. One promising direction is the increased use of low-carbon renewable energy technology
with little water requirements, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind, the costs of which are becoming
increasingly competitive with fossil fuel energy generation. While hydropower will continue playing a
role in climate mitigation and adaptation of the energy sector, the overall sustainability of single projects
needs to be assessed, taking account of potential water consumption through evaporation as well as GHG
emissions from reservoirs, not to mention the potential ecological and socio-economic impacts.
For business, water stress is one of the main drivers for water reuse and efficiency. In concert with
technology, a facility could look at day-to-day operations such as the use of washwater, and better
monitoring and leak detection. On an expanded scale, a company might evaluate its water footprint and
include those of its suppliers, which may have far-reaching effects if they are large water users.

Human settlements
The impacts of climate change on urban water systems include higher temperatures, reduced precipitation
and more severe drought on the one hand, and increasing heavy precipitation and flooding events on
the other. It is precisely these extremes that make the planning of urban space and the provision of
infrastructure so difficult.

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

The physical infrastructure for delivery of water and sanitation facilities can also be disrupted, leading
to contaminated water supplies and the discharge of untreated wastewater and stormwater into living
environments. Vectorborne diseases such as malaria, rift valley fever, leptospirosis and others are often
observed after flooding events.
Urban water resilience goes way beyond the traditional city boundaries. In cases where water supplies rely
on distant watersheds, planning needs to look well beyond the city’s boundaries and consider the longterm impacts of urban expansion on distant freshwater ecosystems and the local communities that also
rely on them.
In small urban and rural settlements, use of water for agriculture and in some cases industrial applications
results in reduced availability for domestic uses. Domestic supplies must be prioritized under the human
rights to water and sanitation.

Nexus: Accounting for interlinkages
Adaptation and mitigation actions by one sector can directly influence its water demand, which can in turn
augment or reduce the local/regional water availability (including quality) for other sectors. In cases of
reduced water demand, such actions can lead to multiple benefits across sectors and boundaries, whereas
increased water demand can result in the need for trade-offs over the allocation of limited supplies.
Water use requires energy. Therefore, any reduction in water use has the potential to reduce the energy
demand from the water sector and thus help mitigate climate change (if said energy source is from
fossil fuels). Conversely, energy production also requires water. With their very low water requirements,
renewables such as wind, PV and certain types of geothermal power generation are by far the best energy
alternatives from a water demand perspective.
Water efficiency measures in agriculture can increase water availability and reduce the energy needed
for pumping, in turn further reducing the water needed for energy production. Increased use of renewable
energy in agriculture (e.g. solar PV pumps) provide additional opportunities to lower GHG emissions and
to support the livelihoods of smallholders. Since agriculture accounts for 69% of global water withdrawals,
reducing food loss and waste could also have significant repercussions on water and energy demand, and
thereby reducing GHG emissions.
Conservation agriculture allows soils to retain more water, carbon and nutrients, with additional ecological
benefits. The biomass and soils of properly managed forests, wetlands and grasslands provide mitigation
opportunities through carbon sequestration, with significant additional benefits in terms of nutrient cycling
and biodiversity.
Improved approaches to the treatment of water, and especially wastewater, offer a range of mitigation
opportunities. Untreated wastewater is an important source of GHGs. With more than 80% of all
wastewater (globally) released to the environment without treatment, treating its organic matter prior to
its release can reduce GHG emissions. The reuse of untreated or partially treated wastewater can reduce
the amount of energy associated with water extraction, advanced treatment and, in cases where the
wastewater is reused at or near the release site, transportation. The biogas produced from wastewater
treatment processes can be recovered and used to power the treatment plant itself, rendering it energyneutral and further enhancing energy savings.

Governance
Both climate and water management require mechanisms for oversight and coordination. Sectoral
fragmentation and bureaucratic competition may pose serious challenges for the integration across
scales. This calls for i) greater public participation to discuss and manage climate risk; ii) building adaptive
capacities at multiple levels; and iii) prioritizing risk reduction for socially vulnerable groups.

Executive Summary

5

‘Good governance’ involves adhering to principles of human rights, including effectiveness, responsiveness
and accountability; openness and transparency; participation in the performance of key governance
functions relating to policy and institutional arrangements; planning and coordination; and regulation and
licensing. For the integration of substance, integrated water resources management (IWRM) provides a
process to involve stakeholders across society, the economy and the environment.
Greater public participation to manage climate risk is suggested as a way to build adaptive capacities at
multiple levels, avoid institutional traps and prioritize risk reduction for socially vulnerable groups. At the
same time, scientific information and data also need to be made available at the local level and included as
information into local multi-stakeholder decision processes.
While governments remain responsible for leading national climate mitigation and adaptation measures
as well as water governance, the process of change is always coproduced. There are many indications that
young people are increasingly concerned about climate change. Cities have also become forerunners of
climate action in many countries, and leading companies have made commitments to reduce their water
footprint and GHG emissions in order to address their contribution to water stress and climate change.
Poverty, discrimination and vulnerability are closely related and typically intersect. Women and girls from
minority ethnic groups or from remote or disadvantaged areas may suffer multiple forms of exclusion and
oppression. When disasters hit, such inequalities can become exacerbated, making it more likely that poor
people are affected. Poor people are also likely to lose relatively more than the non-poor.

Finance
Current levels of financing are inadequate to reach the international community’s goal of universal
availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation. Proponents of water projects could aim
to increase the water sector’s share of climate finance and emphasize water’s ties to other climate-related
sectors in order to ensure greater funding for water management.
Two promising trends are generating opportunities for water projects to access climate finance. The first is
the increasing recognition of the mitigation potential within water and sanitation projects. This trend could
be particularly advantageous, as mitigation made up 93.8% of climate financing in 2016, but water projects
consisted of a fraction of 1% of that sum. The second trend is an increasing emphasis on financing climate
adaptation.
Accessing climate finance can be competitive and difficult, especially for complex water projects that may
transcend national boundaries. Bankable climate projects are those that have a clearly articulated link to
climate change impacts, familiarity and strict compliance with funding procedures, and sometimes additional
funding sources. In order to be considered bankable, projects hoping to use climate finance must explicitly
address the causes and/or consequences of climate change. Projects that communicate and address risks,
and capture co-benefits in other areas such as health, are also considered more bankable.
Differentiated strategies that specifically consider the resilience needs of marginalized groups should also
be built into larger water–climate plans and projects.

Technological innovation
The challenges, in terms of technological innovation, knowledge management, research and capacity
development, are to promote the generation of new tools and approaches through advanced research
and development, and, equally as important, to accelerate the implementation of existing knowledge
and technologies across all countries and regions. However, these actions will only lead to the intended
outcomes if they are accompanied by awareness-raising, as well as educational and capacity development
programmes, in order to widely disseminate the available knowledge and to stimulate the uptake of new and
existing technologies.

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

Satellite-based earth observation can help identify trends in precipitation, evapotranspiration, snow and ice
cover/melting, as well as runoff and storage, including groundwater levels. While remote sensing can reveal
large-scale processes and features that are not easily observable via traditional methods, the temporal and
spatial resolution may not be fully adequate for smaller-scale applications and data analysis. However, when
backed with national statistics, field-based observations and numerical simulation models, remote sensing
can contribute to a comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts related to water.
Evolutions in the field of data acquisition have been facilitated by high-speed internet networks and global
coverage, as well as cloud computing and the enhancement of virtual storage capabilities. Wireless sensors
for monitoring water consumption have been developed and are increasingly used to allow for remote water
metering. Applications of big data analytics can help to obtain knowledge by processing the collection
of continuous streams of water-related information and data, in order to extract actionable information
and insights for improved water management. Citizen science and crowdsourcing have the potential to
contribute to early warning systems and to provide data for validating flood forecasting models.

Regional perspectives
Domestic regulation of water resources development, use, conservation and protection forms the
foundational pillar of water governance and is the prime instrument for the implementation of INDCs under
the Paris Agreement.
While two-thirds of countries outline a general portfolio of water projects in their INDCs, only one in ten cite
what could be called a detailed project proposal, and these originate either from domestic water planning
processes or have emerged from previous climate funding proposals. However, the need for institutional
reforms is well recognized in INDCs, often prioritized alongside infrastructure investments.
Regional approaches to support transformative shifts can play a critical role in national-level
implementation by improving collaboration and coordination between responsible institutions; ensuring
that action is based on sound information and evidence; and increasing access to both public and private
finance for climate-resilient investment.

Sub-Saharan Africa
Impacts of climate variability on Africa’s water resources are already acute, as exemplified by the recent
decrease in rainfall in southern Africa. Water-related impacts of climate change on human health are also
expected, through vector- and waterborne diseases (including by further challenging access to safe drinking
water, sanitation and hygiene) and via malnutrition, given expected impacts on food security. In agricultural
systems, especially in semi-arid areas, conventional livelihood-based approaches appear not robust enough
to deal with the long-term impacts of climate change.
Policies and actions towards climate change adaptation and mitigation include: supporting resilience to
droughts and floods through investing in and improving the climate resilience of WASH facilities; expanding
social protection and introducing financial products like insurance; enhancing gender equality in the use and
management of water resources; and improving water availability for agriculture through water harvesting,
mulching and reduced tillage in rainfed systems.
Energy is politically important to fulfil the ambitions of many African countries in terms of economic
transformation. It could provide a catalyst to encourage regional cooperation to address challenges at the
water–energy–climate nexus, possibly opening up investment in regional power pools and the institutional
mechanisms for energy trading.

Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia
Climate projections indicate increasing precipitation in northern Europe and decreasing precipitation in
southern Europe. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights increasing challenges
for irrigation, hydropower, ecosystems and human settlements in the region.

Executive Summary

The key actions for more effective adaptation and more resilience to extremes in the region include:
enhanced water efficiency and water saving strategies; monitoring and data sharing on water quantity and
quality; improving coherence of climate change adaptation and water-related DRR; and attracting funding
from multiple sources (e.g. international, national and private).
In transboundary basins, technical and financial assistance can be shared up- or downstream, from
wealthier to poorer riparian countries. However, even where funds are available, transboundary water
management can be politically difficult. This points to the need to find a politically salient entry point
around which to build cooperation. In some cases, climate change itself can be the factor that opens up the
opportunity for cooperation.

Latin America and the Caribbean
Climate variability and extreme events already severely affect the region. In Central and South America,
observed streamflow and water availability changes are projected to continue, affecting vulnerable regions.
Rapid urbanization, economic development and inequality are among the key socio-economic drivers of
pressure on water systems with which climate impacts intersect. Poverty is persistent in most countries,
contributing to the vulnerability to climatic change. Economic inequality also translates into inequality in
access to water and sanitation, and vice versa. Increasing risks of waterborne diseases have a greater
impact on poor people. Vulnerability is also high in rural areas, with climatic factors limiting economic
options and driving out-migration.
For many countries in the region, climate change occurs against a backdrop of high levels of intersectoral
competition for water, including between urban areas, the energy and agriculture sectors, and ecosystem
needs.
The limited explicit mention of transboundary water–climate issues in development strategies is
symptomatic of wider challenges in cooperation on transboundary waters in Latin America and the
Caribbean.

Asia and the Pacific
There is high variation and low confidence in projected water-related impacts of climate change at the
subregional scale in Asia and the Pacific. The region is highly vulnerable to climate-induced disasters
and extreme weather events, which are disproportionately burdening poor and vulnerable groups. Waterrelated climate impacts intersect with other socio-economic trends that impact water quality and quantity,
including industrialization (which is reshaping sectoral demand for water and increasing pollution),
population growth and rapid urbanization. The latter have also increased exposure to water-related natural
hazards such as floods.
Climate change and increasing demand for water will put additional stress on the region’s groundwater
resources, which are already experiencing severe stress in some areas due to increases in demand for
irrigation.
At the national level, identified priorities to accelerate water–climate action include: enhancing water
governance and water productivity to manage competition between the water needs of agriculture, energy,
industry, cities and ecosystems; promoting nature-based solutions that can curb emissions and increase
resilience; and integrating climate change and DRR across the entire project and policy cycle.
Regional cooperation on investment and information, as well as on institutional areas such as governance,
capacity and partnerships, is urgently needed in Asia’s transboundary basins.

Western Asia and North Africa
Vulnerability to climate change is moderate to high across the region, with a generally increasing gradient
from north to south. Runoff and evapotranspiration generally follow the same trends as precipitation,
although evapotranspiration is limited by water scarcity.

8

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

The areas with the highest vulnerability to climate change are in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel and the
southwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula, which comprise several of the region’s Least Developed
Countries. While their exposure to climate change varies, they all exhibit low adaptive capacity.
Intersecting with broad challenges of climate change and limited adaptive capacity are complex socioeconomic and political dynamics, affecting water at the regional, national and subnational levels. Politicization
and weaponization of water resources, displacement, and degradation of water infrastructure have been major
challenges for countries affected by conflict. Inequalities in access to and control of water resources persist,
especially across urban–rural and gender lines.
Regional stakeholders identified many priorities and opportunities relating to water, including: rendering urban
development more sustainable; enhancing data, research and innovation; increasing the resilience of vulnerable
communities exposed to floods and droughts, and threatened by food insecurity; furthering policy integration
between mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development; and increasing access to finance, including via
international climate funds and through the development of local markets and investment products.

The way forward
Given the cross-cutting nature of water and climate through different economic sectors and across society,
trade-offs and conflicting interests need to be addressed at all levels in order to negotiate integrated
and coordinated solutions. This requires an equitable, participatory, multi-stakeholder approach to water
governance in the context of climate change.
There are increasing opportunities to more genuinely and systematically integrate adaptation and mitigation
planning into water investments, rendering these investments and associated activities more appealing to
climate financiers. Furthermore, various water-related climate change initiatives can also provide co-benefits
such as job creation, improved public health, reduced poverty, the promotion of gender equality and enhanced
livelihoods, among others.
Despite the mounting evidence that climate change is affecting the global hydrological cycle, much
uncertainty remains when projecting its impacts over smaller geographical and temporal scales. However,
this uncertainty must not be seen as an excuse for inaction. Rather, it should serve as an impetus to expand
research, to promote the development of practical analytical tools and innovative technologies, to adopt
no-regrets approaches, and to build the institutional and human capacity required to foster informed, sciencebased decision-making.
The need for greater cooperation between the water and climate communities exists well beyond the realm
of scientific research. On the one hand, it is imperative that the climate change community, and climate
negotiators in particular, give greater attention to the role of water and recognize its central importance in
addressing the climate change crisis. On the other hand, it is equally (if not more) essential that the water
community focuses its efforts to promote the importance of water in terms of both adaptation and mitigation,
develop concrete water-related project proposals for inclusion in nationally determined contributions (NDCs),
and strengthen the means and capacities to plan, implement and monitor water-related activities in NDCs.
Combining climate change adaptation and mitigation, through water, is a win-win-win proposal. First, it
benefits water resources management and improves the provision of water supply and sanitation services.
Second, it directly contributes to combating both the causes and impacts of climate change, including DRR.
Third, it contributes, directly and indirectly, to meeting several of the Sustainable Development Goals (hunger,
poverty, health, energy, industry, climate action and so on – not to mention SDG 6, the ‘water goal’ itself) and a
host of other global objectives.
In an era characterized by a host of ‘gloom and doom’ studies and articles on climate change and other global
environmental crises, this report proposes a series of practical responses, in terms of policy, financing and
action on the ground, to support our collective objectives and individual aspirations to achieve a sustainable
and prosperous world for all.

The Prologue provides an overview of the state of the world’s water resources
and the potential impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle, including
water availability and quality, water demand, water-related disasters and
extreme events, and ecosystems. Knowledge gaps, limitations and uncertainties
are also addressed.

Introduction
There is now strong scientific consensus regarding the human influence on the climate system
and the role of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in global warming (IPCC,
2014a; 2018a). The rate of GHG emissions is at an all-time high (WMO, 2019). Even if emissions
are brought in line with current political pledges on the nationally determined contributions
(NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, the scientific community is highly confident that the global
average temperature will surpass pre-industrial levels by at least 1.5°C after 2030 (IPCC, 2018a).
Climate change affects global water resources in multiple ways, with complex spatiotemporal
patterns, feedback effects, and interactions between physical and human processes (Bates et
al., 2008). These effects will add challenges to the sustainable management of water resources,
which are already under severe pressure in many regions of the world (WWAP, 2012) and subject
to high climate variability and extreme weather events. Notably, they affect the availability, quality
and quantity of water for basic human needs, threatening the effective enjoyment of the human
rights to water and sanitation for potentially billions of people. Although the effects of climate
change can be highly idiosyncratic at the local scale (IPCC, 2019a), current trends and future
projections indicate major shifts in climate, and more extreme weather events in many parts of
the world (IPCC, 2014a). It is therefore paramount that water resources managers consider the
potential impacts of a changing climate when managing water as a resource for society that is
fundamental to sustainable development.
The hydrological changes induced by climate change imply major risks for society, not only
directly through alterations in the hydrometeorological processes that govern the water cycle,
but also indirectly through risks for energy production, food security, economic development and
social inequalities, among others (Figure 1). Climate change adaptation and mitigation through
water management is therefore critical to sustainable development, and necessary to achieve the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for
Disaster Risk Reduction.

Climate change
Scientific evidence that the climate system is warming is now unequivocal, with scientific
consensus on the role of human activities. Anthropogenic GHG emissions have steeply increased
since the pre-industrial era (Figure 2), and atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane
and nitrous oxide (Figure 3) are at levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years (IPCC,
2014a; 2018a; WMO 2019).

The effects of GHGs, together with those of other anthropogenic drivers, have been detected throughout
the climate system and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming
since the mid-20th century (IPCC, 2014a). Globally, the average surface temperature of the planet has risen
about 0.9°C since the 19th century (Figure 4). Most of this warming happened in the last 35 years, with
five of the warmest years on record having occurred after 2010. According to latest data from the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the Copernicus Climate Change Programme, July 2019 matched,
and maybe broke, the record for the hottest month since analysis began (WMO, 2019). Ocean water
temperatures also show an increasing trend (Cheng et al., 2019).

Since the mid-20th century, changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather and climate events
have also been observed. Several of these changes have been linked to human influences, including
a decrease in cold temperature extremes, an increase in warm temperature extremes, an increase in
extremely high sea levels and an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events in a number of
regions (Min et al., 2011).
The continued emission of GHGs will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components
of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and
ecosystems (UNCTAD, 2016).
While there is a clear trend in temperature (Figure 5), trends in annual precipitation volumes are much
more uncertain in many regions, for example in larger parts of the sub-tropics, where many of the Least
Developed Countries are located. For example, under Representative GHG Concentration Pathway 8.5
(RCP8.5), General Circulation Models (GCMs) are in agreement on the future directions of precipitation
amounts for only a third of the land surface (IPCC, 2014a). Large uncertainties in climate models, especially
in the transition zones between regions with increasing and decreasing annual precipitation, do not preclude
potentially large impacts on weather extremes and water resources. Even small changes in temperature and
climate (i.e. low-end GHG scenarios) can have large impacts on water availability and extremes in particular.

More so than for annual averages for precipitation (especially in the subtropics), global models agree
to a large extent on a future increase in extreme weather (Hattermann et al., 2018). Climate projections
indicate with high confidence that extreme precipitation events will become more intense and frequent
in many regions, but also that heatwaves will occur more often and last longer (Figure 6). The former will
increase global flood risk (Hirabayashi et al., 2013), while the latter is expected to make droughts more
intense (Trenberth et al., 2014). These risks are unevenly distributed geographically, and are generally
larger for vulnerable people and communities in countries at all levels of development (IPCC, 2014a).

For example, in West Africa, with the Niger as its main river basin, as well as in the region of the Upper
Amazon, uncertainty in annual precipitation projections is very high. At the same time, there are strong
indications that there will be a higher proportion of dry days, even in a climate that on average will become
wetter (GIZ/adelphi/PIK, forthcoming) (see Section 9.1.3).

Prologue

In view of these and other threats posed by a changing climate, at the 21st Conference
of the Parties (COP21) in Paris (December 2015), the Parties to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reached a landmark agreement
to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments
needed for a sustainable low-carbon future. The Paris Agreement’s central aim is to
strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by limiting the global
temperature rise this century to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue
efforts to limit the temperature increase even further, to 1.5°C.
But even if this ambitious goal is achieved, some of the current trends will continue,
creating long-lasting or potentially irreversible changes. This must be taken into account
in the management of water resources into the future.

Climate and water
The earth’s climate and the terrestrial water cycle have a very close and complex relationship (Figure 7).
Changes in climate variability and change will therefore propagate to affect water resources. For example,
a rainfall deficit will reduce soil moisture, river flow and groundwater recharge, but the magnitude of these
flow-on effects will depend on local conditions such as soil properties, geology, vegetation and water use.
Because of the different timescales of the involved processes, the impacts on groundwater deficit
(although they are usually less pronounced than for surface water and come with a delay) may last for
much longer than the original meteorological drought that caused them, thus initiating a ‘memory effect’
(Changnon, 1987). Floods, on the other hand, may have an impact on water availability, sanitation and
other facets of human livelihoods through damage to key infrastructure and services.
At the same time, the hydrological cycle is itself an essential component of the climate system, controlling
the interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface and providing feedback mechanisms for the
transport, storage and exchange of mass and energy (Figure 7).
The linkages between the climate and water resources are affected by a variety of anthropogenic factors,
including but not limited to land use and land cover change, water regulation and withdrawal systems, and
water contamination. Through a combination of ‘grey’ and ‘green’ engineering, such as the construction
of water resources infrastructure, and the development of agricultural and other water use practices,
humankind has improved access to safe water supply and sanitation services throughout its history.
Climate change will affect many of these strategies in numerous ways, and therefore require a new, climatesmart approach to water resources management.

Status of water-related impacts from climate change
Climate change affects the terrestrial water cycle through many different processes. Feedbacks and
interactions between those processes, which are not all fully understood or measurable at relevant scales,
make quantification and prediction of the consequences very difficult. Furthermore, water resources
development and management have, historically, been undertaken under the assumption of stationarity1 of
hydrological time series (Milly et al., 2008). Whilst hydrological data collected in the past provide valuable
information on processes and events, they are not necessarily indicative of the future hydrological regime.
Furthermore, even when hydrological changes are detected, attribution of causes, including climate change,
often remains uncertain (UN-Water, 2019).

Water availability and stress
Changes in precipitation and temperature (Figure 8) will directly affect the terrestrial water budget (Schewe
et al., 2014). Evaporation from the land surface is expected to increase as a result of the global trend of
rising air temperatures in all but the driest regions, where the lack of water prevents such an increase. This
increase may be offset by an increase in precipitation, but in many regions and especially in those areas
where rainfall volumes will decrease, this leads to decreasing streamflow volumes and a decrease of water
availability in different seasons (IPCC, 2018a).
Decreases have already been observed in rivers in western Africa (Batisha, 2012), southwestern Australia
(Australian Academy of Science, 2019), the Yellow River basin in China (Piao et al., 2010) and the Pacific
Northwest of the United States of America (USA) (Kalra et al., 2008). Such decreases affect water availability
directly, for water withdrawal for agriculture, industry and domestic supplies, as well as for in-stream uses
such as power generation, navigation, fisheries, recreation and, last but not least, the environment.
The combined impact of changes in precipitation and evaporation will also determine future trends in soil
moisture and groundwater, with potential consequences for the frequency and severity of soil moisture
drought spells (Van Loon et al., 2016). Increased soil moisture drought has for instance been observed in
north-central and northeast Asia (Wang et al., 2011).

Climate change-induced changes in the cryosphere are also widespread, leading to a global reduction
in snow and ice cover (Huss et al., 2017). Snow cover, glaciers and permafrost are projected with
high confidence to continue declining in almost all regions throughout the 21st century (IPCC, 2019a).
Accelerated melting of glaciers is expected to have a negative effect on the water resources of
mountain regions and their adjacent lowlands, with tropical mountain regions being among the
most vulnerable (Buytaert et al., 2017). Although the accelerated melting of glaciers may locally and
temporarily increase streamflow, the reduction of glacier cover tends to lead to more variable river
flows and reductions in baseflow in the long term, as well as changes in the seasonal timing of peak
streamflow. Shifts to earlier peak flow in snow-dominated rivers have been observed in Eurasian and
North American rivers (Tan et al., 2011), while reductions in baseflows in glacier-fed rivers are becoming
evident in the Andes and the Himalayas (Immerzeel et al., 2010; Baraer et al., 2015).
Such changes are likely to exacerbate water stress, which is among the main problems to be faced by
many societies and the World in the 21st century. Water use has been growing at more than twice the
rate of population increase in the last century (FAO, 2013a). Combined with a more erratic and uncertain
supply, this will aggravate the situation of currently water-stressed regions, and generate water stress in
regions with currently abundant water resources.
Water stress already affects every continent (Figure 9). Physical water scarcity is often a seasonal
phenomenon, rather than a chronic one (Figure 10), and climate change is likely to cause shifts in
seasonal water availability throughout the year in several places (IPCC, 2014a). About four billion people
live under conditions of severe physical water scarcity for at least one month per year (Mekonnen and
Hoekstra, 2016). Around 1.6 billion people, or almost a quarter of the world's population, face economic
water shortage, which means they lack the necessary infrastructure to access water (UN-Water, 2014).

Because of the high population density of cities and increasing urbanization, urban water supply is
particularly vulnerable. It is estimated that by 2050, 685 million people living in over 570 cities will face an
additional decline in freshwater availability of at least 10%, due to climate change (Figure 11). Some cities,
such as Amman, Cape Town and Melbourne, can experience declines in freshwater availability by between
30 to 49%, while Santiago may see a decline that exceeds 50% (C40 Cities, 2018).
The societal impact and consequences are likely to be severe. Water scarcity, exacerbated by climate
change, could cost some regions up to 6% of their gross domestic product, while spurring migration and
sparking conflict (FAO/World Bank Group, 2018).

Knowledge of climate change impacts on agriculture through water has significantly expanded over
the past 20 years. Convergent results are showing that climate change will fundamentally alter global
food production patterns as a function of water availability. Crop productivity impacts are expected to
be negative in low-latitude and tropical regions but somewhat positive in high-latitude regions (FAO,
2015a). By 2040, there will be better rainfall availability for wheat, soybean, rice and maize, even if the
Paris Agreement emissions targets are met. Projections show parts of Africa, the Americas, Australia and
Europe will be drier, while the tropics and north will be wetter (Figures 12 and 13) (Rojas et al., 2019). Since
water mediates much of the climate change impacts on agriculture, increased water scarcity in many
regions of the world presents a major challenge for climate adaptation.

Water quality
The world’s freshwater resources are increasingly polluted with organic waste, pathogens, fertilizers and
pesticides, heavy metals, and emerging pollutants. Water pollution by organic matter is growing because
of increasing municipal and industrial wastewater discharge, the intensification of agriculture (including
livestock farming) and reduction in river dilution capacity due to decreasing runoff and water extractions
(Zandaryaa and Mateo-Sagasta, 2018). Eutrophication is a widespread phenomenon globally because of
the release of man-made nutrient enrichments in surface waters as a result of ineffective wastewater and
agricultural runoff management. Pathogen contamination is the most widespread water quality problem
in developing countries due to unsafe water and sanitation (WHO/UNICEF, 2017). Emerging pollutants
present a new global water quality challenge in both developed and developing countries, with potentially
serious threats to human health and ecosystems.

Climate-induced harmful algae blooms (HABs) are increasing due to warmer water
temperatures caused by global warming. Many lakes and estuaries around the world, which
provide drinking water for millions of people and support ecosystem services, already have
toxic, food web-altering, hypoxia-generating blooms of harmful cyanobacteria. For example, in
China, more than 60% of the lakes suffer from eutrophication and HABs (Shao et al., 2014).
Climate change is severely affecting our ability to control these HABs, or making it near
impossible (Havens and Paerl, 2015).
Freshwater and coastal wetlands are already adversely affected by human
impacts, such as altered flow regimes and deterioration of water quality.
Climate change is likely to further stress the world’s wetlands and aquatic
ecosystems with negative implications on fisheries and aquaculture (Poff
et al., 2002). These changes in water quality not only affect the economic
and social welfare but also the sustainability of vital environmental flows,
ecosystems and biodiversity (WWAP, 2017).

Global water use has
increased by a factor
of six over the past
100 years

Water demand
Global water use has increased by a factor of six over the past 100 years (Figure 14) and
continues to grow steadily at a rate of about 1% per year (AQUASTAT, n.d.) with increasing
population, economic development and shifting consumption patterns. In 2012, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) projected that water
demand would increase by 55% globally between 2000 and 2050, mainly as a function of
growing demands from manufacturing (+400%), thermal power generation (+140%) and
domestic use (+130%) (OECD, 2012). A different study concluded that the world could face a
40% global water deficit by 2030 under a business-as-usual scenario (2030 WRG, 2009).

In the face of these competing demands, there will be little scope for increasing the amount of water
used for irrigation, which currently accounts for 69% of all freshwater withdrawals (AQUASTAT, n.d.).
While the OECD projects an overall decrease in future global water withdrawals for irrigation, the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimated a 5.5% increase in irrigation water
withdrawals from 2008 to 2050 (FAO, 2011a). Discrepancies in such projections highlight the challenge of
projecting the growth in water demand at the global scale. However, “regardless of the magnitude of future
global, and more importantly local, water deficits, water scarcity is likely to limit opportunities for economic
growth and the creation of decent jobs in the coming decades.” (WWAP, 2016, p. 23).
Global warming will further exacerbate this trend, as water demand tends to increase with temperature
(Gato et al., 2007). This will exert significant pressure on the water authorities to maintain the balance
between water demand and supply. Therefore, assessing the climate change impacts on water demand is
crucial to ensure water demand is met under changed climate conditions. Temperature and rainfall are the
most commonly used climate variables in water demand modelling (Haque et al., 2015).
The combined effects of growing populations, rising incomes, changing consumption patterns and
expanding cities will see demand for water rise significantly, combined with a more erratic and uncertain
supply. This may generate water stress in regions with currently abundant water resources, such as
Central Africa and East Asia (World Bank, 2016a).

Water-related disasters and extreme events
Changes in precipitation patterns under climate change conditions are expected to increase the intensity
and frequency of flood and drought events in many regions (Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Asadieh and
Krakauer, 2017). Such changes may also lead to secondary effects. For example, combined with changes
in vegetation, they will also lead to the destabilization of slopes and thus higher potential for sudden
floods and landslides (Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016).
Global floods and extreme rainfall events have surged by more than 50% this decade, and are now
occurring at a rate four times higher than in 1980. Other extreme climatological events such as storms,
droughts and heatwaves have increased by more than a third this decade and are being recorded twice
as frequently as in 1980 (EASAC, 2018). Figure 15 shows the increasing trends in flood-related disasters
globally, as well as meteorological and climatological events.

During the past 20 years, the two main water-related disasters – floods and droughts – caused
more than 166,000 deaths, affected another three billion people and caused total economic
damage of almost US$700 billion (EM-DAT, 2019). Droughts accounted for 5% of natural
disasters, affecting 1.1 billion people, killing 22,000 more, and causing US$100 billion in
damage over the 20-year period (1995–2015). Over the course of one decade, the number of
floods rose from an annual average of 127 in 1995 to 171 in 2004 (CRED/UNISDR, 2015).
Figure 16 shows global drought patterns in 2017 based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index,
which uses regional temperature and precipitation data to estimate dryness. Global-scale
drought conditions temporarily improved in early 2017 compared to recent years. The area of
global droughts reached its highest level in several years starting in late 2015 and remained
high throughout 2016, but rapidly declined by early 2017.

Water-related ecosystems
Water-related ecosystems such as lakes, rivers and vegetated wetlands are among the
world’s most biologically diverse environments and provide multiple benefits and services to
society, making them essential for reaching several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
(WWAP/UN-Water, 2018). Although they account for only 0.01% of the world’s water and cover
approximately 0.8% of the Earth’s surface, they provide a habitat for almost 10% of the world’s
known species. In arid environments, springs host over half the species (UN Environment/
UN-Water, 2018). Additionally, water-related ecosystems have significant economic, cultural,
aesthetic, recreational and educational value. They help to sustain the global hydrological,
carbon and nutrient cycles. They support water security, provide natural freshwater, regulate
flows and extreme conditions, purify water, and replenish aquifers. Other services also
depend on these ecosystems, which provide water for drinking, agriculture, employment,

24

energy generation, navigation, recreation and tourism. Moreover, water services go beyond water supply
to humans: water also supports plants and animals, which themselves provide services to humans:
biodiversity, food, energy, tourism, green infrastructure, etc.
Many of these ecosystems, particularly forests and wetlands, are at risk, and with them their waterrelated ecosystem services. Changes in water flows through river systems and/or from coastal storm
surges threaten to destroy many wetlands, which would cause the loss of the filtering, buffering and
carbon sequestration services they currently provide. Human activities (such as dam construction and
cultivation of wetlands and forests) also place high pressure on ecosystems (Blumenfeld et al., 2009).
Hot, dry conditions will increase the risk of wildfires in all types of forest, while warmer and longer growing
seasons in mountain forests could lead to an explosion of pest populations.
Wetlands are also huge carbon pools. Peatlands alone store twice as much carbon as the Earth’s forests.
Healthy wetlands function as carbon sinks, degraded wetlands are significant sources of GHGs. The
extent of wetlands has sharply declined (35%) between 1970 and 2015 (Crump, 2017).
The current state of the world’s water-related ecosystems, of which the majority is already degraded and
polluted, is alarming. Over the past 100 years, the world is estimated to have lost half its natural wetlands
and with this a significant number of freshwater species (UN Environment/UN-Water, 2018).
Around one in ten known species of plants, mammals, fishes, reptiles, insects and mollusks, amounting
to more than 126,000 species, live in freshwater ecosystems, even though these cover less than 1%
of the Earth’s surface. Around 880 of those species show an 83% decline according to the Freshwater
Living Planet Index. The regions most at risk are the Neotropics (-94%), the Indo-Pacific (-82%), and
the Afrotropics (-75%), with reptiles, amphibians and fishes being most vulnerable (WWF, 2018). In the
20th century, freshwater fish have had the highest extinction rate worldwide among vertebrates.
Increasing water temperature will also alter biogeochemical balances in freshwater ecosystems, which
may lead to deterioration of water quality, for instance because of more frequent algae blooms, and faster
growth of pathogens (Chapra et al., 2017).

Water infrastructure
Projections of the needs for water security investment diverge, but they all indicate that the scale of
investment ought to increase significantly (see Chapter 12). Global estimates range from US$6.7 trillion by
2030 to US$22.6 trillion by 2050 (WWC/OECD, 2015). To achieve the WASH component of SDG 6 by 2030,
it is estimated that capital investment needs to triple (to reach US$1.7 trillion), and operating and
maintenance costs will be commensurately higher (Hutton and Varughese, 2016). The FAO has projected
that an estimated US$960 billion of capital investment is needed to expand and improve irrigation until
2050 in 93 developing countries, compared to the 2005–2007 levels of investment (Koohafkan, 2011).

Prologue

Investments are needed not only in new infrastructure but also in the maintenance and
operations of the existing stock, in order to improve their efficiency and reduce water
losses. Climate change generates additional risks to water-related infrastructure,
requiring an ever-increasing focus on the inclusion of adaptation measures.
Investment will need to be channelled into creating the appropriate water
infrastructure in developing countries, and targeted at upgrading existing
infrastructure in advanced economies. Many developed countries are dependent on
ageing infrastructure, designed and constructed on the assumption of stationary
hydrological time series, and many water networks are nearing the end of their design
lives. For example, in the United Kingdom, 75% of the urban water networks are more
than 100 years old (Water UK, 2011).

25

Risk-sensitive areas – SIDS, semi-arid regions, coastal
hinterlands and mountainous areas
Small Island Developing States
Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are typically characterized as environmentally and socioeconomically vulnerable to disasters and climate change. They also often have limited resources for
freshwater provisioning services. The number of disasters in SIDS is increasing at a higher rate than
the global average, and the frequency and intensity of the disasters will likely increase because of
climate change (Gheuens et al., 2019). These combined factors will impact SIDS on the societal level
and on environmental levels, reducing their adaptive capacity, resources and resilience. Sea level rise
is a major concern for many low-lying islands: the seawater/freshwater interface will move inland and
decrease the volumes of groundwater available (UNESCO-IHP/UNEP, 2016). Because of increasing
demand (e.g. population growth and tourism) and decreasing supply (e.g. pollution and changes in
precipitation patterns), freshwater resources are becoming increasingly limited, often suffering from
the spill-over effects of competing and conflicting uses. Threatened ecosystems and limited economic
resources further influence the adaptive capacities of communities in SIDS (Gheuens et al., 2019).
Studies predict that water scarcity will continue to increase in the future, with around 52% of the
world’s population living in water-stressed regions by 2050 (Kölbel et al., 2018). SIDS will be particularly
affected by this trend because of their vulnerabilities and already scarce freshwater resources. Most
SIDS will experience a decrease in freshwater supply as a result of decreased rainfall and an increase
in demand, triggered by growth in population and tourism. Tuvalu, for example, has already had
problems with water supply in 2011 when it had no rain for six months, and 1,500 of its population of
11,000 were left with no access to freshwater (Gheuens et al., 2019).

Semi-arid regions
Climate change impacts add to already difficult water management challenges in the arid and semiarid regions (drylands) (WWC, 2009). Drylands are ecosystems, such as rangelands, grasslands and
woodlands, characterized by high temporal and spatial rainfall variability. They are commonly defined
as regions in which the annual potential evapotranspiration (PET) greatly exceeds annual precipitation
(P); that is, the P/PET ratio is less than 0.65 (Huang et al., 2017).
Huang et al. (2017) have shown that climate change is the main contributor to the long-term trend
in the Aridity Index. The increasing aridity, enhanced warming and rapidly growing population will
exacerbate the risk of land degradation and desertification in the near future, with as much as 80% of
this expansion occurring in developing countries.
About 20–35% of drylands already suffer some form of land degradation, and this is expected to
expand significantly under different emissions scenarios (IUCN, 2018). Land degradation impairs water
security through a reduction in the reliability, quantity and quality of water flows (IPBES, 2018).
Climate models project decreasing precipitation in already dry areas, such as northern Africa. In South
Asia, earlier snowmelt and the loss of glacial buffering in the Hindu Kush–Himalayas will affect the
seasonal water supply for a significant proportion of the population of the subcontinent and change
the frequency and severity of extremes (WWC, 2009).
The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)
recommends timely action to avoid, reduce and reverse land degradation with the aim of increasing
food and water security. It also notes that while intensified land management systems have greatly
increased crop and livestock yields in many areas of the world, when inappropriately managed, they
can result in high levels of land degradation, including soil erosion, fertility loss, excessive ground and
surface water extraction, salinization, and eutrophication of aquatic systems (IPBES, 2018).

Coastal hinterlands
Coastal areas are vulnerable from the increase in sea levels, flooding, storm surges and stronger
winds. More than 600 million people (around 10% of the world’s population) live in coastal areas that
are less than ten meters above sea level (McGranahan, et al., 2007) and these areas are becoming
increasingly urbanized. During this century, flooding from the rising sea level and storm surges will
threaten the viability of some islands as well as some major deltas, such as the Nile and Mekong River
deltas (WWC, 2009). In addition to direct impacts, this will also have severe impacts on water supply
and sanitation infrastructure.

Mountainous areas
There is growing evidence that high-mountain areas are warming faster than lower elevations (Pepin
et al., 2015). This elevation-enhanced acceleration in warming makes mountainous areas exceptionally
vulnerable to climate change. This is most obvious from the impact on mountain glaciers and
snowcaps, which show a decreasing trend almost everywhere in the world (Figure 17) (Huss et al.,
2017), affecting water resources for downstream populations (Immerzeel et al., 2019). Although the
way in which meltwater contributes to downstream water availability is complex (Buytaert et al., 2017),
glacier and snowmelt water increases water security in many parts of the world. Glacier meltwater
is a particularly important buffer against drought in arid and semi-arid mountain bases such as the
upper Indus, Aral and Chu/Issyk-Kul River basins (Pritchard, 2019). Current trends in cryosphere-related
changes in high-mountain ecosystems are expected to continue and impacts to intensify. The amount
and seasonality of river runoff in snow-dominated and glacier-fed river basins will change further in
response to projected snow cover and glacier decline with potentially negative impacts on agriculture,
hydropower and water quality (IPCC, 2019a).
At the same time, climate change impacts in mountain regions extend beyond the acceleration of
glacier melt and the reduction of snowcaps, but will also lead to changes in vegetation, soils and
non-glacier-related hydrological processes (Tovar et al., 2013). These changes affect a large range
of ecosystem services, including water availability but also biodiversity, soil fertility and carbon
sequestration (Buytaert et al., 2011).

Limitations and challenges
As identified by the IPCC (2014a; 2018a), a wide range of limitations remains before the potential
impacts of a changing climate on water resources are fully understood. While there is not much
disagreement in temperature increases simulated by different GCMs under specific scenario
conditions, more variability and uncertainty exist in projected precipitation trends (IPCC, 2014a). By far
the greatest limitation is the uncertainty in the projection of the predicted climate changes into the
complex interactions between atmosphere, land and oceans and consequently, the water resources.
Yet as described above, evidence is emerging globally that the climate is changing beyond the natural
variability and that this affects the availability and the temporal and spatial distribution of water
resources. One study by Hattermann et al. (2018) suggests that small increases in global temperature
can have statistically significant impacts on river discharge, but this effect is often concealed by the
uncertainty in precipitation trends projected by GCMs. Temperature increases are generally expected
to intensify the hydrological cycle (Kundzewicz and Schellnhuber, 2004), but the feedback with
different climate variables, such as evapotranspiration fluxes, is nonlinear.
The fact that strong impacts on water resources and extremes will occur is often obscured by large
climate model-related uncertainty, especially in the transition zones between regions with increasing
and decreasing annual precipitation. Often, trends in extremes (heavier precipitation, heat, prolonged
droughts) show a clearer direction than trends in annual precipitation totals. Hydrological modelling
adds another layer of uncertainty. Using regional models considering catchment-specific characteristics
can decrease the uncertainties in the hydrological model (GIZ/adelphi/PIK, forthcoming).

Although current and historic trends become increasingly clear and statistically significant, making
accurate predictions for the future remains challenging. A number of studies (for example, Görgen et al.
(2010) on the Rhine River basin and Elshamy et al. (2009) on the Nile River basin) have used downscaling
of climate change scenarios and hydrological modelling to predict the possible impacts of climate change
on river flows. In some instances, predicted reductions in summer discharges are up to 25% whilst winter
discharges may increase by up to 15%. Both studies however highlight the challenges and limitations of
such downscaling approaches. While downscaling produces climatic information at scales finer than the
initial projections, this process involves additional information, data and assumptions, leading to further
uncertainties and limitations of the results (USAID, 2014).
Although methods to quantify the contribution of climate change to particular extreme weather events
(floods and droughts) or other events are developing rapidly, there is as yet no consensus on which
approach is best. Attribution depends fundamentally on global climate models that can adequately
capture regional weather phenomena – including circulation anomalies. Any statement on attribution
should therefore always be accompanied by a scientifically robust demonstration of the model’s ability to
simulate the global and regional weather patterns and the related weather phenomena that lie at the root
of extreme events (NAS, 2016).
Lastly, making a global assessment of the status of water resources and water-related risks has become
more challenging because of the need to increase the evidence base to support planning and decisionmaking. In its Assessment of the State of Hydrological Services in Developing Countries, the World Bank
Group (2018a) states that only 10% of countries surveyed had adequate water-related monitoring systems,
while 80% of the countries surveyed did not have adequate water-related information being collected to
meet user needs. Increasing the global hydrological monitoring and data collection activities therefore
remains a major challenge. In addition to strengthening global monitoring networks, this may require
exploring the potential of new technologies (Tauro et al., 2018), as well as new approaches such as
participatory monitoring and citizen science (Buytaert et al., 2014).

This introductory chapter describes the objectives and scope of the report,
describing the main concepts related to water and climate, emphasizing the crosssectoral nature of the challenges and potential responses, and highlighting those that
are potentially the most vulnerable.

1.1

Objectives and scope
The scientific evidence is clear: the climate is changing and will continue to change (IPCC, 2018a),
affecting societies and the environment. This occurs directly through changes in the hydrological
systems that are affecting water availability, water quality and extreme events, and indirectly through
changes in water demand, which in turn can have impacts on energy production, food security and
the economy, among others. Climate change will influence the spread of water-related diseases and
will affect the attainment of a number of other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (World Bank,
2016a). This in turn will both lead to additional security risks and limit the available opportunities for
development (PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, 2018).
Population growth, economic development, changing consumption patterns, intensified agricultural
production and expanding cities will generate a substantial rise in water demand (Wada and Bierkens,
2014), while water availability becomes more erratic and uncertain (UNU-INWEH/UNESCAP, 2013; FAO,
2017a; IPCC, 2018a). Water supply and sanitation services, including water and wastewater treatment
facilities, can be highly vulnerable to potential shifts in hydro-climatic parameters. Climate-related
risks to health, livelihoods, food and energy security, human security, and economic growth, which are
projected to increase with a global warming of 1.5°C, would increase further at a 2°C level, meaning that
the SDGs are more easily achieved by limiting warming to 1.5°C (IPCC, 2018a). As such, climate change
directly and indirectly threatens human rights (HRC, 2018). The rising incidence of weather extremes,
such as floods and storms, not only increases the direct risk of drowning, injury, or damage to human
settlements, but also the indirect consequences such as the spread of waterborne diseases (Watts et
al., 2018).
The energy and agriculture sectors are increasingly shifting to low-emissions production systems,
with generally positive implications for freshwater demand as well as water pollution. However, the
quality of water resources is expected to deteriorate due to a number of interacting factors: increased
temperature; increased sediment, nutrient, and pollutant loadings from heavy rainfall; increased
concentration of pollutants during droughts; disruption of treatment facilities during floods; and
groundwater deterioration due to saline intrusion in coastal areas as a consequence of sea level rise
(IPCC, 2014a; UNEP, 2016). Companies are increasingly encountering disruption of their operations due
to problems of water supply and water quality, as well as floods and droughts (Newborne and Dalton,
2016). Furthermore, the degradation of ecosystems will not only lead to biodiversity loss, but also
affect the provision of water-related ecosystem services, such as water purification, carbon capture
and storage, and natural flood protection, as well as the provision of water for agriculture, fisheries
and recreation. These developments particularly affect people who depend on natural resources for
their lives and livelihoods (PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, 2018). Meeting the
increasing demand for freshwater to satisfy basic human needs, while at the same time protecting
ecosystems, will require concerted efforts among all stakeholders to find a sustainable balance between
social, economic and ecological needs (Timmerman et al., 2017).

With mounting evidence of the ongoing meteorological and hydrological changes (Blöschl et al., 2017;
Su et al., 2018) and projections of substantial increases of these changes in the near future, the urgency
of adaptation in water management is unquestionable. Without concrete adaptation measures, water
scarcity, both in terms of surface water and groundwater resources, is expected to expand to some
regions where it currently does not exist and to considerably worsen in many regions where water
resources are already stressed (Gosling and Arnell, 2016).
Beyond the uptake of urgently needed adaptation measures to increase water system resilience, improved
water management opens up opportunities for climate change mitigation as well as adaptation. Mitigation
measures such as water reuse, conservation agriculture and renewable energies (hydropower, biofuels,
wind, solar, and geothermal) can directly affect water resources (for example, by increasing or decreasing
water demand), and it is important to recognize this two-way relationship when developing and evaluating
mitigation options (Wallis et al., 2014).
Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for managing and reducing the risks of climate
change. Substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions over the next few decades can reduce
climate risks in the 21st century and beyond, increase prospects for effective adaptation, reduce the costs
and challenges of mitigation in the longer term, and contribute to climate-resilient pathways for
sustainable development (IPCC, 2018a).

Adaptation and
mitigation are
complementary
strategies for
managing and
reducing the risks of
climate change

Adaptation options exist in all water-related sectors and should be investigated and
exploited where possible. Mitigation options are also available across a variety of
water management interventions. While adaptation and mitigation are activities,
resilience is a property of a system. Adaptation, as well as certain mitigation
measures (for example via carbon capture and storage through forest restoration),
can increase or decrease resilience (Box 1.1). This report aims at improving the
understanding of what works best, where, and under which circumstances, also taking
into account (potential) co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs. Adaptation as discussed
in this report is a combination of natural, engineered and technological options, as
well as social and institutional measures, where all measures should emphasize
flexibility, knowledge and learning (IPCC, 2014a; 2014b; WWAP, 2015).

Box 1.1 Definitions
Adaptation1 in this report is defined as the process of adjustment in/to natural or human systems in response to actual
or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities (IPCC, 2014b;
UNFCCC, n.d.a).
Mitigation is defined as a human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases as
well as other substances. It may contribute directly or indirectly to limiting climate change, including for example
through the reduction of particulate matter emissions that can directly alter the radiation balance (e.g. black carbon) or
through measures that control emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and other
pollutants that can alter the concentration of the tropospheric ozone, which has an indirect effect on the climate (IPCC,
2014b; UNFCCC, n.d.a).
Resilience is defined as the ability of social, economic and environmental systems exposed to hazards to resist,
absorb, accommodate, adapt to, transform and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient
manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions, while also
maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation (IPCC, 2014b; UNDRR, n.d.).

Alternative definition: Climate adaptation refers to the actions taken to manage impacts of climate change by reducing vulnerability and exposure to its
harmful effects and exploiting any potential benefits (IPCC, 2018b, p. 31).

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

It should be noted that the effects of mitigation occur on different time and spatial scales than the effects
of adaptation. As a result of the inertia of the climatic system, mitigation measures will only have an effect
at time scales of several decades and over wide areas. Adaptation options, on the other hand, can have an
almost immediate effect in reducing vulnerability in a specific locality or region, and should therefore be
considered at the different time scales they target. Adaptation measures can be taken to address shortterm changes (up to 10 years), changes at medium term (10 to 30 years) or changes expected over the
long term (30 years and more).
Water-related adaptation options exist in all sectors, but their context for implementation and their
potential to reduce climate-related risks differ across sectors and regions. Some adaptation responses
involve significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs. Increasing climate change will augment the
challenges for many adaptation options (IPCC, 2014c).
Mitigation options are available in every major water-related sector. Mitigation can be more cost-effective
if an integrated approach is used that combines measures to reduce energy use and the GHG intensity of
end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emissions, and enhance carbon sinks in landbased sectors (IPCC, 2014c). Like adaptation, water-related mitigation options also offer a number of
economic, social and environmental co-benefits (see Chapter 9).
This report addresses the critical linkages between water and climate change in the context of the broader
sustainable development agenda. It focuses on the challenges, opportunities and potential responses to
climate change – in terms of adaptation, mitigation and improved resilience – that can be addressed by
enhancing water resources management, attenuating water-related risks, and improving access to water
supply and sanitation services for all in a sustainable manner. Since many aspects of climate impacts
are uncertain (and noting that there may well be unintended benefits), integrated solutions should be
robust (spanning a wide range of potential futures) and flexible (capable of responding to unexpected or
alternative futures) (SIWI, n.d.). By examining these issues, this report addresses water (in)security2 in the
context of climate change.
The report is not intended as a detailed review of the potential impacts of climate change on water but
seeks to provide a fact-based, water-focused contribution to the knowledge base on climate change. It
is complimentary to both the scientific assessments and the international political frameworks, with the
goals of i) helping the water community tackle the challenges of climate change and ii) informing the
climate change community about the opportunities that improved water management offers in terms of
adaptation and mitigation.
The report illustrates the key challenges in the water domain stemming from climate change, and serves
as a guide for concrete actions to address these challenges, supported by examples of responses and
their effects from across the world. It addresses the interrelations between water, people, environment
and economics in a changing climate. It also illustrates how climate change cannot be an excuse to
cover up poor water management, and how climate change can be a positive catalyst for improved water
management and water governance.

1.2

A cross-sectoral challenge and the need for integrated
assessments
Societies and ecosystems are highly dependent on water. As a result, water management is critical
to sustainable development in all its dimensions. The projected reduction in water availability in many
regions as a result of climate change puts the achievement of sustainable development under severe
pressure. Agriculture and energy are the largest water users globally and are therefore central to finding
sustainable solutions. The industrial sector has a substantial and rapidly increasing demand for water.

“Water security is the capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water for
sustaining livelihoods, human well-being, and socio-economic development, for ensuring protection against water-borne pollution and
water-related disasters, and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability.” (UN-Water, 2013).

Climate change, water and sustainable development

33

Supplying drinking water requires available and accessible sources of high-quality water. Adequate
treatment of wastewater is very limited or lacking in many countries (WWAP, 2017), rendering high volumes
of freshwater unfit for human use and a number of other purposes. Finally, ecosystems, whether freshwater,
coastal, marine or terrestrial, require water to sustain the provision of services, which are indispensable for
human well-being.
Water-related climate risks cascade through food, energy, urban, transportation and environmental systems
with mutual and conflicting influences. Therefore, a cross-sectoral approach is needed to not only address
the potential impacts of climate change within a sector, but also the interactions between the sectors.
Production of biofuels as a mitigation measure, for instance, requires water and arable land that will
consequently not be available for food production, leading to trade-offs between water use, energy security
and food security (see Box 9.1). Dams, often built for hydropower as a mitigation measure to reduce GHG
emissions by substituting fossil-fuel powered energy production, can also contribute to flow regulation,
flood control and availability of water for irrigation. However, reservoirs can ‘consume’ much water through
evapotranspiration and under certain circumstances be net emitters of GHGs. Moreover, poorly designed
and/or managed hydropower plants may cause negative ecological impacts on existing river ecosystems
and fisheries, and social disruption and human rights violations, among others (Bates et al., 2008; World
Bank, 2016a). Therefore, sustainable development requires looking at various sectors and aspects, including
agriculture, energy, transportation, industry, cities, human health, ecosystems and the environment, as well
as their interrelationships through water.
Integrated assessments that take the nexus between the various sectors into account are necessary to
identify the cross-sectoral impacts and to formulate a coordinated response, balancing different sectoral
water-dependent objectives and ecosystem needs (Roidt and Avellán, 2019). Policy-makers around the world
face common challenges: improving coherence between sectoral policies, balancing economic growth with
social, environmental and climate action, and using resources more efficiently and effectively. A common
ground for compromise needs to be found to effectively address trade-offs between development and
environmental protection, and also between the diverging interests of the various economic sectors. At the
same time, applying a nexus approach can bring mutual benefits between, among others, energy, agriculture,
ecosystems and water efficiency (FAO, 2014; IRENA, 2015). It can also help establish coherence between
sectoral policies and avoid potential conflicts between sectors. As intersectoral impacts can traverse
borders, the transboundary aspects should also be taken into account (UNECE, 2018a).
There is a growing awareness that nature-based solutions (NBS), which are inspired and supported by
nature and which use or mimic natural processes, can contribute to the improved management of water
while providing ecosystem services as well as a wide range of secondary co-benefits, including adaptation,
mitigation and resilience to climate change (IPCC, 2014a; UNEP/UNEP-DHI Partnership/IUCN/TNC/WRI,
2014; WWAP/UN-Water, 2018). For example, healthy wetlands can store carbon and simultaneously reduce
flood risk, improve water quality, recharge groundwater, support fish and wildlife, and provide recreational
and tourism benefits (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018). In urban areas, green infrastructure (or low-impact
development) approaches might be used to accommodate projected climate change. These approaches
also have a variety of co-benefits, such as climate change mitigation as well as other ecological and
social benefits. Hence, NBS can help to respond to the impacts of climate change on water resources and
contribute to people’s health and quality of life by supporting sustainable food production, improving human
settlements, providing access to water supply and sanitation services, and reducing the risks of waterrelated disasters (UNEP/UNEP-DHI Partnership/IUCN/TNC/WRI, 2014; WWAP/UN-Water, 2018). Application
of NBS thus implicitly necessitates integrated approaches.
Adaptation measures are generally designed to deal with climate change impacts without necessarily
considering their effects on GHGs, whereas mitigation measures are rarely considered in light of their
adaptation potential or their impact on water resources. However, it is possible to incorporate mitigation in
designing and selecting adaptation measures in water management. For instance, several NBS for water
offer a potential for increased carbon capture and storage. Wetland restoration as an adaptation option
can result in improved water quality and decreased flooding, and also contribute to mitigation through CO2
absorption and carbon capture. In many cases, it can also lead to cost savings when compared to built
infrastructure solutions. However, net carbon storage, including possible CH4 and NOx emissions, needs to
be considered as well. Afforestation and reforestation may also have beneficial hydrological and mitigating

34

effects (Bates et al., 2008; Tubiello and Van der Velde, 2011; Wallis et al., 2014), but since adverse
effects due to the water requirements of the vegetation have also been demonstrated (Schwärzel et al.,
2018), careful planning is required in order to achieve a beneficial effect in terms of soil water infiltration
and deep percolation under different circumstances (SIWI, 2018). Water efficiency measures can help
mitigation by reducing energy needs for processing, transporting, and treating water and wastewater, and
for better processing and disposing of sludge and other forms of waste. Conversely, mitigation measures
can have negative impacts on water. For instance, the electrification of personal/private vehicles will
likely still have significant GHG and water footprints if the source of the electricity is not renewable. This
underlines the need for comprehensive and coordinated policy-making and planning.

1.3

The most vulnerable
The developed world is responsible for much of the anthropogenic GHG emissions driving climate change.
The concentrations of GHGs started accumulating in the atmosphere at beginning of the nineteenth
century, coinciding with a period of rapid industrialization, and have been increasing ever since
(Mgbemene et al., 2016; Dong et al., 2019; IPCC, 2018a). However, much of the impacts of climate change
will be manifested in the tropical zones where most of the developing world can be found. Another
discrepancy is that developing countries have a lower ability to respond to climate change impacts, and
the poorest groups and societies are the most vulnerable to minor and major shocks. Many of the
developing countries are short of the financial resources for adaptation and mitigation efforts, and for
some, the capacity to act may also be hindered by poor governance (Das Gupta, 2013). Also, many
developing countries lack a knowledge base on water-related disaster management, and on water
availability, demand and use.

Much of the

can be found

Scientific evidence has revealed numerous discernible impacts of climate change
on natural, managed and human systems worldwide (IPCC, 2014a). There is high
confidence that warming from anthropogenic emissions from the pre-industrial period to
the present will persist for centuries to millennia and will continue to cause further longterm changes in the climate system (IPCC, 2018a). While many developing countries
emphasize the historical responsibility of the developed world when it comes to GHG
emissions, many developed countries have remained reluctant to bear the full burden of
climate responsibilities. From this, the concept of climate justice has emerged, stressing
that climate change is an ethical and political issue as well as an environmental and
physical one. In this light, the Paris Agreement also refers to equity, climate justice and
human rights.

The effects of multiple other drivers acting on natural and especially human and managed systems (e.g.,
land use change, population growth, technical developments) have either been collectively greater than
the effects of GHG emissions or made it difficult to determine the relative importance of these emissions
as a driver (Stone et al., 2013). In some situations, inherently poor water management practices are
important contributing factors to water-related problems. Funds, like the Adaptation Fund established
under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, have been
made available for developing countries to improve their water management and to better adapt to climate
change. One of the issues in making these funds available is demonstrating the extent to which existing
problems can be attributed to climate change. The potential cumulative effects of multiple non-GHG
emissions drivers (‘confounders’) can create attribution challenges that, as a result, leave developing
countries with challenges in fulfilling the ‘burden of proof’ required to receive funding in support of
appropriate adaptation and risk management approaches (Huggel et al., 2016).
The impacts of climate change on the availability of water resources over space and time affect the
poor disproportionately through their effects on agriculture, fisheries, health and natural disasters.
Nearly 78% of the world’s poor, approximately 800 million people, are chronically hungry while two billion
suffer micronutrient deficiencies (FAO, 2017a). They largely live in rural areas and rely mainly on rainfed
agriculture, livestock or aquaculture to sustain themselves and their families – all of which are highly
climate- and water-dependent and therefore at risk to hydro-meteorological irregularities. With increased
rainfall variability in many regions, they will become increasingly vulnerable and their opportunities for

rising out of poverty will likely diminish. Moreover, agricultural production shocks may trigger significant
increases in the price of food and lead to food insecurity, for inhabitants of both rural and urban areas.
As poorer households spend a significantly larger share of their income on food, they will be the most
impacted (World Bank, 2016a).
These impacts are particularly felt by poor women and girls, who often experience inequalities in the
access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services and to the water resources that they often
depend upon for their livelihoods. Likewise, indigenous peoples are notably sensitive to the effects
of climate change, especially when they are unable to apply traditional knowledge and strategies for
adaptation to environmental changes and mitigation of its effects. Children are disproportionately
affected but, along side youth, can also influence and participate directly in efforts to learn about,
prevent, prepare for, cope with and adapt to climate change and extreme events (Haynes and Tanner,
2015). The Paris Agreement in this respect refers to intergenerational equity (UNFCCC, 2015).
The frequency and intensity of floods, droughts and storm surges are expected to increase with climate
change. Poor households tend to be more exposed to the impacts of droughts and urban floods than
their wealthier counterparts (see Chapter 8). This is primarily because the rural poor disproportionately
rely on agricultural income, which is most at risk from droughts. Poorer families in urban areas are more
likely to live in flood-prone areas because land is scarce and higher risk zones are valued lower, making
them more affordable (Winsemius et al., 2015; World Bank, 2016a).

Climate change and
the related water
challenges are not
only complex and
interconnected, they are
also intergenerational

Increased water scarcity and variability in availability may also lead to greater
exposure to contaminated waters, insufficient water available for sanitation and
hygiene, and subsequent increased disease burdens (see Chapter 5). These
impacts will disproportionately affect poor households who may already lack
adequate sanitation and reliable safe water supplies. Climate change will increase
incidences of diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases, causing healthcare costs
and days lost at work or school. Such losses are often cited as the reason why
households fall into poverty (World Bank, 2016a).

In addition to being more exposed to extreme events, poor households tend to lose a higher share of
their assets due to storms or floods because their low-quality houses tend to suffer relatively more
damage. Poor people tend to have most if not all of their assets in material form, making them all
the more vulnerable to extreme events. They also have limited access to recovery support, such as
insurance, social protection and credit (Winsemius et al., 2015; World Bank, 2016a).
Although climate change affects all groups in society, the magnitude of impacts on women and girls
are much greater, increasing gender inequalities and threatening their health, well-being, livelihoods and
education. In times of drought, women and girls are likely to spend longer periods of time collecting
water from more distant sources, putting girls’ education at risk because of reduced school attendance.
Women and girls are exposed disproportionately to risks of waterborne diseases during floods due
to a lack of access to safe water, the disruption of water services and increased contamination of
water resources. Climate change will also jeopardize the livelihoods of women farmers in developing
countries who depend heavily on access to water resources for food and crop production. Women make
up on average 43% of the agricultural labour force in developing countries (Oxfam International, n.d.),
as compared to about 35% in Europe (Eurostat, 2017) and 25% in the United States of America (USA)
(USDA, 2019). The proportion can be much higher, such as in Kenya, where about 86% of farmers in
2002 were women (FAO, 2002). The out-migration of males can lead to an increased role of women in
agriculture in terms of greater workloads (Miletto et al., 2017; FAO, 2018a). For these and other reasons,
a gendered approach to the differential impacts of climate change on women and men, combined
with the participation of women in climate-related policy development, is required. The need for
disaggregated data on climate change, including by gender, is critical for the development of appropriate
gender-sensitive and transformative policies (Miletto et al., 2019).
Diminishing water supplies can translate into lower economic prospects, particularly in terms of
agricultural and industrial production. Climate change disproportionately affects food-insecure regions,
jeopardizing crop and livestock production, fish stocks, and fisheries, primarily because protection

levels and overall water quality are lower in poor countries (Winsemius et al., 2015; FAO, 2017a). Some
regions could see sustained negative economic growth as a result of water-related losses in agriculture,
health, income, and property. Poorly designed water management policies can exacerbate the negative
impacts of climate change, while on the other hand well-designed policies can go a long way towards
neutralizing them. Such policies therefore need to be based on an extensive and sound knowledge and
scientific basis. Some regions stand to see economic growth accelerate with improved water resource
management. “When governments respond to water shortages by boosting efficiency and allocating water
to more highly-valued uses, losses [in terms of GDP] can decline dramatically and may even vanish” (World
Bank, 2016a, p.14). However, it is essential that the allocation of water to such higher-value uses also
takes account of any potentially negative impacts on water resources, the human rights to water and
sanitation, and the environment.
When economic prosperity is impacted by rainfall, episodes of droughts and floods, this can lead to
waves of migration and spikes in violence within countries – 18.8 million new internal displacements
associated with disasters were recorded in 135 countries and territories in 2017 (IDMC, 2018). Moreover,
water scarcity is likely to limit the creation of decent jobs, since about three out of four jobs constituting
the global workforce are dependent on water (WWAP, 2016). Conflicts further reduce food availability,
pushing many affected people back into poverty and hunger (FAO, 2017a). In a globalized and connected
world, such problems are impossible to quarantine and attribute to a specific cause. A range of
economic, social and political drivers, especially where large inequities prevail, make people move
from zones of poverty to regions of prosperity, which can lead to increased social tensions (Foresight,
2011). Economic prosperity and poverty alleviation are thus closely tied, with the latter highly dependent
on the former. Across all nations, a 1% increase in mean income has been associated with a 2 to 3%
reduction in the number of people within a country living below the poverty line (World Bank, 2016a). In
this way, water management is closely linked to the socio-economic status of countries as well as to the
vulnerability of individuals.
Some areas are more vulnerable to climate change as a result of their geographical conditions. These
include Small Island Developing States (SIDS) that are vulnerable to possible changes in rainfall
patterns. When rainwater is the primary source of water, a reduction in rainfall may decrease the volume
of available freshwater. This vulnerability can be further aggravated by sea level rise, which may reduce
or contaminate surface and subsurface water resources because of saline intrusion. Coastal areas in
general, including SIDS, are under the influence of a combination of sea level rise and more extreme
storms as a result of climate change. Mountainous areas may undergo a change from mainly snowcovered to mainly snow-free as a result of increasing temperatures. This may trigger the release of loose
rock and soil in former permafrost areas and exacerbate the danger of rockfall, debris flows and mud
flows, especially when combined with more intense rainfall. A specific risk is the build-up of glacial lakes
and the threat of lake outbursts. All this could result in human casualties and the destruction of property.
Drylands are already vulnerable as a result of limited rainfall and many of them are expected to receive
less rainfall or have more variable rainfall as a result of climate change, which will put additional stress
on agricultural production and will enhance the risks of desertification.
Climate change and the related water challenges are not only complex and interconnected, they are also
intergenerational. Decisions being made today will be felt by future generations. Accounting for next
generations is therefore imperative. Increasing numbers of academic programmes and specializations
in water- and climate-related issues in the past decades have given rise to a generation increasingly
equipped to deal with climate change issues.
The preceding outlines the compelling and complex interactions between humankind and the
environment, in particular with respect to water and climate change. It also highlights the need for
appropriate adaptation and mitigation approaches that will allow human populations to live in balance
with the resulting changing environment, while growing and developing in a sustainable and equitable
manner. Good water governance and improved water resources management are fundamental and
essential requirements to success. The following chapters look into these issues in more detail and
discuss ways to address global, regional and local challenges.

This chapter reviews the major international policy frameworks, highlighting existing
gaps and opportunities for linkages in terms of resilient water management that could
inhibit or enhance progress on global climate action and sustainable development.

2.1

Introduction
Over the past four decades, the international community, principally through United Nations policy-making
processes, has been concerned with unsafe water and sanitation, and the challenges arising from growing
demands on the world’s water resources to meet human, economic and environmental needs. At the
same time, climate change has emerged as an existential threat to human well-being and the effective
enjoyment of all human rights, further imperiling water security for hundreds of millions of people, as well
as ecosystems worldwide. As such, international policy frameworks addressing climate change must take
water into account, even more because water is key to reducing carbon emissions and adapting to an
increasingly variable climate. Unfortunately, fundamental detachments between water management and
international policy remain prevalent.
The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, with its Millennium Development Goals, laid out
the foundations for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted in 2015, alongside two
other major global agreements, the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Sendai Framework
for Disaster Risk Reduction. These international policy frameworks formed a historic step forward in
addressing the most pressing global challenges, yet they still suffer from some of the problems of
earlier agreements. While in spirit, the 2030 Agenda acknowledges the importance of interlinking the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this integration has not translated into practice, and issues of
poverty reduction, health and sanitation, environmental degradation, climate change, and disaster risk are
still addressed in separate ‘silos’ at the global and national levels. Furthermore, integration between the
global agendas has also been lagging.

2.2

Overview of the main agreements
2.2.1 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development describes a trajectory for global development where the
entire suite of goals constitutes a pathway to ‘transforming our world’ in order to reach the future we want
whilst leaving no one behind. It mentions rising inequalities, natural resource depletion, environmental
degradation and climate change as being the greatest challenges of our time. It recognizes that social
development and economic prosperity depend on the sustainable management of freshwater resources
and ecosystems, and highlights the importance of the integrated nature of SDGs (UNGA, 2015).
Within the 2030 Agenda, water serves as an (often) unacknowledged but essential connecting factor for
reaching the SDGs (Figure 2.1). Water is essential for basic human needs, as described in the SDGs on the
human rights to water and sanitation for all (SDGs 6, 5), but also for marine (SDG 14) and land (SDG 15)
ecosystems, for producing food (SDG 2) and energy (SDG 7), supporting livelihoods (SDG 8) and industry
(SDGs 9, 12), and providing sustainable and healthy environments to live in (SDGs 1, 3, 11) (Sweden, 2018).

Water has a critical role to play in both mitigation of and adaptation to climate change (SDG 13) and, in
that capacity, contributes to building resilient, just, peaceful and inclusive societies (SDG 16) (White, 2018).
While SDG 13 ‘Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts’ includes specific targets
and indicators, it also explicitly acknowledges that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) is the primary international forum for negotiating and overseeing the global response
to climate change (see next section). Without necessarily specifying water-related issues, several of the
targets and indicators in SDG 13 (Figure 2.2) are relevant for water or dependent on water (13.1, 13.2,
13.B). But SDG 13 is also emblematic of the fundamental disconnection between the SDGs themselves,
and between the 2030 Agenda and other global frameworks. For example, there is no formal mechanism
linking SDG 13 to the goals of the Paris Agreement, resulting in parallel processes.
Given water’s role in mitigating and adapting to climate change, water could play a connecting role both
across the SDGs and across policy frameworks such as the Paris Agreement.
An integrated approach to the 2030 Agenda recognizes that most aspects of society, development,
sustainable growth and the environment are symbiotic. Yet during the 2018 July session of the High-Level
Political Forum (HLPF), when SDG 6 was reviewed, amongst other SDGs, and Voluntary National Reports
were presented, countries acknowledged that the SDGs were being addressed in a siloed manner and
that they were not on track to meet the targets of SDG 6, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable
communities (HLPF, 2018).

Furthermore, SDG 6, like the other SDGs, has targets that are universally applicable and progressive.
However, each government must decide how to incorporate them into national planning processes, policies
and strategies based on national realities, capacities, levels of development and priorities (United Nations,
2018a). In the climate arena, this is addressed by specific national-level mechanisms that were agreed upon
at the 21st Conference of the Parties (United Nations Climate Change Conference 2015, COP21) within the
Paris Agreement (see section below and Chapter 11). Hence, there is a unique opportunity to interlink the
implementation of the global agendas at the national and local level by mainstreaming and addressing waterrelated issues in an integrated and systemic manner when addressing the climate commitments.

2.2.2 Paris Agreement on climate change
The UNFCCC entered into force in 1994, after being formally adopted during the Rio Earth Summit in
1992. Within the UNFCCC, legal instruments, or ‘protocols’, have been employed to reach the goals of the
Convention. The Paris Agreement adopted at COP21 was quickly ratified and went into effect on the eve of
COP22, which took place in 2016 in Marrakech, Morocco.
The Paris Agreement's long-term goal is “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below
2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial
levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change” (UNFCCC, 2015,
Article 2). The Agreement focuses on dealing with climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as the
financial needs required to reach this goal. Unfortunately, the outcomes of COP25 in 2019 appear to suggest
that meeting Paris Agreement's long-term goal may be even more difficult than earlier anticipated.

How it functions
Under the Paris Agreement, each Party has committed to determine, plan and regularly report on the
measures it will undertake to mitigate and adapt to climate change. These measures, known as nationally
determined contributions (NDCs), are to be reviewed every 5 years. The next round of NDCs (new or updated)
are to be submitted in 2020. NDCs are designed to be progressive and NDC reporting on adaptation measures
is entirely voluntary.
Separately from the NDCs, Parties to the UNFCCC are also encouraged to develop National Adaptation Plans
(NAPs). These plans are meant to identify medium- to long-term adaptation needs and develop the strategies
needed to address them. Ideally, NAPs take into consideration the 2030 Agenda and work to integrate
the SDGs and their targets where appropriate. As such, with a high level of alignment of SDG targets and
ambitions in the NDCs, delivering on NDCs and NAPs should help countries achieve their SDGs and achieving
the SDGs should facilitate countries’ efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change (Hamill and Price-Kelly,
2017; Northrop et al., 2016).
In addition, the Paris Agreement specifically acknowledges the need to address loss and damage, since many
climate change effects cannot be avoided by adaptation measures alone. It specifies that loss and damage
can take various forms – both as immediate impacts from extreme weather events or as slow-onset impacts,
such as the loss of coastlines due to sea level rise (section 2.2.3). Here water management interventions
can act as a bridge and offer remedies, including so-called nature-based solutions (NBS), that can help
communities and ecosystems prevent, adapt and recover from disasters.
The Paris Agreement also recognizes the essential roles that non-state parties, such as local authorities,
the private sector, academia, civil society organizations, international and non-governmental organizations,
foundations, women, indigenous peoples, and youth groups play in reaching its goals (UNFCCC, 2015). The
Global Climate Action Agenda (known as the Marrakech Partnership Global Climate Action Agenda – MPGCA)
(UNFCCC, 2019) enables non-state parties to contribute to the UNFCCC, highlight solutions and demonstrate
concrete actions on the ground. Upon the initiative of the water community, water has an official ‘voice’ within
the MPGCA,4 meaning that there are UNFCCC-sanctioned water and climate events at each COP, and water is
one of the permanent thematic groups represented in the MPGCA.

Participating organizations included AGWA, ARUP, CDP, CEO Water Mandate, Deltares, FAO, FWP, INBO, SIWI, SUEZ, UNESCO, WRI and
WWC non-exhaustive list. In July 2016, SIWI coordinated and submitted, on behalf of several international organizations an official letter
to COP21 and COP22 champions promoting the added value of having a specific focus on water in the MPGCA.

International policy frameworks

41

Since the ratification of the Paris Agreement, tangible steps have been taken to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions and initiate adaptation measures, with over 160 countries and the European Union
submitting Intended NDCs (INDCs) (Northop et al., 2016). However, as the latest Special Report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicates, there is still a long way to go in order to
reach the objectives of the agreement (IPCC, 2018b). The need to raise ambitions was highlighted in the
closing plenary session of COP24 by Frank Bainimarama, Prime Minister of Fiji and President of COP23,
who noted that the world needed “five times more ambition, five times more action” in order to achieve the
goals of the Agreement (UN News, 2018).

Water in the Paris Agreement – a hidden treasure
Although water is not mentioned in the Paris Agreement per se, it is an essential component of nearly all
the mitigation and adaptation strategies – from carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems, to emerging
clean energy technologies, to adapting to extreme weather events (White, 2018). Water is identified as
the number one priority for most of the INDC’s adaptation actions and is directly or indirectly related to all
other priority areas (Figure 2.3). Most identified hazards are also water-related (Figure 2.4).

Furthermore, since many of the SDGs and their relevant targets are addressed by these INDC priorities, transforming
water-related commitments into national adaptation/action plans gives countries and cities the opportunity to
address the needs in an integrated, holistic, effective, efficient and sustainable manner in order to build resilient
societies.
Outside the UNFCCC, independent groups such as the NDC Partnership are working to connect the SDGs with the
NDCs and NAPs. The partnership is an opportunity for international water organizations to become members and
support the delivery in 2020 of more ambitious, reviewed NDCs that further integrate water into the operational phase
of the NDCs and NAPs.

2.2.3 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030
On 18 March 2015, UN Member States adopted the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030
(“Sendai Framework”). This non-binding framework is comprised of seven standard global targets and four priorities
for action designed to achieve “the substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and
in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries”
(UNDRR, 2015a).
In pursuit of this outcome, Member States must develop publicly available national and local disaster risk reduction
(DRR) strategies by 2020 (Target E). Non-Member stakeholders are also invited to showcase voluntary commitments
to help the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) monitor and disseminate action to achieve the
Sendai Framework targets.
Prior to the Sendai Framework, global DRR strategies focused primarily on disaster relief activities. One of the
primary purposes of Sendai Framework is to promote active prevention and improved rebuilding strategies aimed at
increasing resilience and reducing long-term risk from both sudden and slow-onset hazards within and across sectors
at the local, national and international levels (Priorities 3 and 4). This shift from disaster relief to prevention and
preparedness remains an ongoing process mediated by complex interactions between a number of disaster drivers
including climate change, inequality, demographic change and population distribution, as well as environmental
degradation (Briceño, 2015).
While water is seldom mentioned in the Sendai Framework itself, water flows through each of the priorities for action
and is central to all seven targets. Floods and storms account for nearly 90% of the most severe natural disasters
(Adikari and Yoshitani, 2009). Water-related hazards are particularly sensitive to even small shifts in climate, so that
the frequency, magnitude and intensity of these hazards are shifting over time (Milly et al., 2005).
Recognition of the clear linkages between water, climate change and disaster predate the Sendai Framework.
Since 2007, the UN High-level Experts and Leaders Panel on Water and Disasters (HELP) has been working to raise
awareness about the connections between water and disasters (Box 2.1) and strives to bridge the gaps between their
respective policy communities.

2.2.4 International water conventions
Global legal and intergovernmental frameworks on water, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of
Non-Navigational Watercourses (Watercourses Convention) and the Convention on the Protection and Use of
Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention), provide a framework for addressing the
impacts of climate change on water resources.
Many provisions of international water law support climate change adaptation measures, such as the principles of
equitable and reasonable use, ‘no significant harm’, and the precautionary principle (UNECE/INBO, 2015). Therefore,
although the Water Convention does not explicitly mention climate, it provides a powerful tool for cooperation by
requiring Parties to prevent, control and reduce transboundary impacts on water resources, including those related to
adapting and mitigating climate change.
At the regional level, the Protocol on Water and Health helps to protect human health and well-being by improving
water management and reducing water-related diseases impacted by climate change.
While the transboundary water frameworks guidelines have been ratified or signed by several countries, noncompliance and obstacles to the expansion of transboundary cooperation remain. Nevertheless, the urgent need for
cooperation in addressing climate change can act as an incentive for wider cooperation in transboundary basins.

Water as a connector to support the implementation of global
agreements
When it comes to water and climate change within the 2030 Agenda, both SDG 6 and SDG 13 have a direct or
indirect impact on all the other SDGs. The challenges of development, poverty eradication and sustainability
are intricately interwoven with those of climate change mitigation and adaptation, especially through water.
Water is not a sector, but a connector and the impacts induced by climate change touch all aspects of our
society (economic, social and environmental) (White, 2018). Strong political will and leadership are needed
to highlight and mainstream water’s value in implementing the global agreements (Figure 2.5).
Several initiatives led by Heads of State, Member States and the United Nations have been launched in
order to bridge divides and find means to implement the goals of the global agreements in a more efficient
and sustainable manner (Box 2.1). These initiatives recognize water as a connector and facilitator in
implementing the global agendas. Yet there is a discrepancy when it comes to transforming these global
recommendations and policies into concrete actions on the ground.
While these efforts may be laudable, further blending of insights, perspectives and financial mechanisms
from the water, DRR and climate change communities would be mutually beneficial, increase costeffectiveness, and help ensure that their respective choices do not undermine or inadvertently heighten risks
for others (Matthews et al., 2018).
Where water is often considered a stand-alone sector, it is essential that water is recognized as a connector.
For instance, although water is relatively high on the adaptation agenda, NDCs do not offer options for
improving water management decision-making, policies and intersectoral institutions at the national level
in order to reach the targets and avoid difficult trade-offs and conflicts. Some progress in this direction was
made at the 74th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) held in September 2019 (Box 2.2).
Water goes beyond water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and water resource management. Water is the
basis for all life on Earth and a basic human right. Streamlining water into global climate, development and
DRR processes could be a means of connecting climate change issues with all the other SDGs. Placing water
at the heart of these strategies is an essential way forward and would help the water community deliver its
message to the climate community and a broader audience.

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

Box 2.1 High-level initiatives launched by Heads of State and the United Nations
In 2016, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim launched a High-Level Panel on Water,
consisting of a number of Heads of State, government representatives and a special advisor chartered for a two-year period.
In March 2018, the High-Level Panel released its report Making Every Drop Count: An Agenda for Water Action (HLPW, 2018a),
highlighting the enabling aspects of water for implementing a wide variety of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The
recommendations from this report may be a useful vehicle to articulate the interdependence of the SDGs, the Paris Agreement and
the Sendai Framework for long-term sustainability, particularly concerning resilience and reducing the impacts of water-related
disasters.
The High-Level Experts and Leaders Panel on Water and Disaster (HELP/UNSGAB) was established upon request of the
UN Secretary-General’s Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation (UNSGAB) in 2007 to raise global awareness and promote tangible
actions in addressing issues of water and disasters, by releasing reports and biannually co-convening UN Special Thematic
Sessions on Water and Disasters. The aim of HELP is to urge countries to take preventive actions against increased frequencies
and even higher impacts of water-related disasters due to climate change, population growth and rapid urbanization. It calls for
disaster risk reduction, water resources management and climate adaptation to no longer be treated as separate topics.
The International Decade for Action on Water for Sustainable Development, 2018–2028, was launched in March 2018, after
being adopted by the 71st United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), with the aim to accelerate efforts to meet water-related
challenges, including limited access to safe water and sanitation, increasing pressure on water resources and ecosystems, and
the exacerbated risk of droughts and floods. One of the key objectives of the Decade is for the international community to energize
implementation of existing programmes and projects, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the 2015–2030
Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the 2015 Paris Agreement, in a coordinated and effective manner to further
improve cooperation, partnership and capacity development. The mid-term review of the Decade in 2023 will highlight how water
has been addressed as an enabling factor for implementing the global agendas (United Nations, 2018b).

Box 2.2 Progress at the 74th United Nations General Assembly (September 2019)
Several summits on climate action, sustainable development and financing for development were held on the margins of the
74th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in September 2019. Heads of State and country delegations
assembled in New York to reaffirm their commitment to deliver on these agendas. In calling for the summits, António Guterres,
the Secretary-General of the United Nations, specifically asked states “not to come to the Summit with beautiful speeches … the
ticket to entry is bold action and much greater ambition” (UN Secretary-General, 2019), highlighting the emergency of the situation.
The political declaration of the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF), unanimously adopted by the UNGA, validated the next five-year
cycle of the 2030 Agenda and highlighted the countries’ dedication to ‘leaving no one behind’; reducing disaster risk and building
the resilience of countries, economies, communities and individuals to economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters;
as well as improving data collection and reporting at global and national level (HLPF, 2019). Furthermore, world leaders took
note of the Secretary-General’s progress report on the Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2019) and the Global
Sustainable Development Report (Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary-General, 2019) and acknowledged
the importance of a systemic and holistic approach, taking into account interlinkages between goals and targets.
Last but not least, within the UN Climate Action Summit, the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) presented its flagship
report Adapt Now: A Global Call for Leadership on Climate Resilience and called for 2020 to be the Action Year for Adaptation.
Water has a prominent place in the GCA’s report, and a dedicated Water Action Track was announced in order to foster
adaptation through resilient water management (GCA, 2019).
Among the main outcomes of these summits is that world leaders, pressed by citizen and youth movements, called for a
decade of ambitious action to ‘leave no one behind’ and announced specific actions to advance the implementation of their
engagements. There is a renewed commitment to ensure the lasting protection of the planet and its natural resources, including
freshwater, and to protect and conserve our planet’s marine and terrestrial resources, recognizing their key role in adapting to and
mitigating the impacts of climate change. Many countries and Heads of State also highlighted the importance of delivering on
the water resource management and sanitation goals.
The main challenge will be to pool all these intentions and initiatives into a comprehensive and coherent process that enables
concerted and amplified action plans instead of isolated and parallel processes at the global, regional, national and local level.
Identifying the water initiatives announced at these summits and highlighting how they complement and feed into one another
would be an efficient way of moving forward and ensuring that funding opportunities and bottlenecks identified at the Financing
Development Summit (2019) are addressed.

This chapter establishes linkages between climate change and various aspects of
water management. Adaptation and resilience-building options are presented with
respect to water storage – including groundwater – and water supply and sanitation
infrastructure, and unconventional water supply options are described. Mitigation
options for water management systems are also presented.

3.1

Impacts on water resources and infrastructure
3.1.1. Water scarcity, ecosystem degradation and water pollution
As noted in the Prologue, climate change exacerbates water scarcity. Depending on how water
scarcity is defined and interpreted (Falkenmark et al., 1989; Seckler et al., 1999), climate change brings
contrasting challenges to different regions. Economic water scarcity is normally caused by a lack of
water infrastructure that can ensure access to water (Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management
in Agriculture, 2007), and occurs typically in Africa and some parts of South America and South Asia.
Developing more water infrastructure in these regions is the only way to alleviate scarcity, but it should
take into account the impacts of climate change that are already observed (or are likely to occur). Physical
water scarcity, on the other hand, due to excessive withdrawals and well-developed infrastructure for
human use or due to natural aridity, typically occurs in Australia, Central Asia, Middle East and North
Africa, Northern China, and Southern Africa.
Water sustains both terrestrial (forests, grasslands, etc.) and freshwater ecosystems (rivers, lakes and
wetlands), which provide important services such as water supplies, natural purification, food production,
cultural values and economic activities. Yet, on top of the impacts of climate change, rapidly occurring
ecosystem degradation due to pollutants from industrial, mining and agricultural activities, untreated
urban and rural waste, oil spills, and toxic dumping has caused strong negative effects on biodiversity
and freshwater ecosystems, also threatening essential ecosystem services. Around one million animal
and plant species are threatened with extinction, and freshwater species are the ones that have suffered
the greatest decline, falling by 84% since 1970. More than 85% of global wetlands present in 1700 had
been lost by 2000 and continue to disappear at a rate three times faster than forest loss. Since 1970,
there has been a 70% increase in numbers of invasive alien species in wetlands (e.g. Asian carp, water
hyacinth, nutria) (IPBES, 2019). Water depletion and pollution are the major causes of biodiversity loss and
ecosystem degradation, which, in turn, reduce ecosystem resilience, making societies more vulnerable to
climate and non-climate risks.
Poor water quality due to eutrophication (mostly from poor sanitation and poor nutrient management)
is one of the most widespread problems affecting available water supplies, fisheries and recreational
activities. For example, the estimated cost of damage caused by eutrophication in the United States
of America (USA) alone is approximately US$2.2 billion annually (Dodds et al., 2009). Climate change
is expected to exacerbate water quality degradation as a result of higher water temperatures, reduced
dissolved oxygen and thus a reduced self-purifying capacity of freshwater bodies. As floods and droughts
are likely to increase due to climate change, there are further risks of water pollution and pathogenic
contamination caused by flooding or by the higher pollutant concentrations during drought.

Water availability, infrastructure and ecosystems

Urbanization is an important pollution source, particularly in developing countries and especially for
groundwater, as a result of under-managed solid waste disposal and poorly managed sanitation
infrastructure. Even in well-managed sanitation systems, climate change may indirectly exacerbate
groundwater contamination risk through the switch to unprotected on-site sanitation and open defecation
when droughts limit water availability for flush toilets and proper hygiene practices associated with
well-managed sanitation systems (McGill et al., 2019).

3.1.2 Threats to water infrastructure

Climate change
elevates
risks to water
infrastructure

Climate change elevates risks to water infrastructure. More intense and more frequent
floods increase the risks of damage to water treatment and supply infrastructure, which
can lead to service disruptions. Water and wastewater infrastructure in coastal low-lying
cities are more prone to severe flooding (Cain, 2017). Wastewater treatment plants have to
deal with increasing incidents of pollution surges caused by floods. Increasing variability
in rainfall intensity and patterns caused by climate change have a significant impact on the
performance of urban drainage systems, with an increase in combined wastewater and
stormwater overflows during heavy precipitation and flooding (Tavakol-Davani et al., 2016).

Another globally emerging issue is ageing water infrastructure (Ansar et al., 2014; Grant and Lewis, 2015;
Zarfl et al., 2015), although the pattern of ageing differs between regions. In water storage infrastructure,
the issue manifests itself through sedimentation, increased operation and maintenance costs, structural
changes, increasing risks of breakage, and overall operational efficiency decline as a structure approaches
its design life. But ageing is also influenced by the changing river inflow variability associated with climate
change. Increased uncertainty in stationarity of hydrology due to climate change makes it necessary
to reassess the safety and sustainability of water storage dams, and to evaluate them for potential
modifications or decommissioning, for the minimization of their environmental and social impacts, and for
the optimization of their services. Pittock and Hartmann (2011) identified several implications of climate
change for the management of existing water storage dams, including the failure of dams due to frequent,
extreme and sudden inflows; failure of dams to perform their intended services as a result of climate
change; and operational changes of dams imposed by climate change, such as additional storages and
inflow/outflow controls.
Somewhat related to the issue of ageing infrastructure is the emerging trend of decommissioning dams
that have become either unsafe, obsolete, or socially and environmentally unacceptable. The scale and
pace of dam decommissioning is increasing, particularly in areas with a long history of impoundments
construction like Europe and the USA (Dam Removal Europe, n.d.; Thomas-Blate, 2018). In the USA alone,
over 80 dams were removed in 2017, and in total some 1275 dams were removed in 21 states over the
last 30 years. Decommissioning, however, primarily focuses on smaller structures. There are many ageing
dams globally with no or limited value today. Removal is often the best option, but it is generally a longterm and costly process.
Conveyance to urban areas and in irrigation is often a bigger bottleneck than storage (PPIC Water Policy
Center, 2018), as it has to deal with less predictable peak flows of progressively increasing magnitude and
frequency. Many regions will need substantial climate-resilient infrastructure investment to improve water
conveyance reliability under climate change.
Water-related extremes exacerbated by climate change increase risks to drinking water, sanitation and
hygiene (WASH) infrastructure, such as damaged sanitation systems or flooding of sewer pumping
stations. The consequent spread of faeces and associated protozoa and viruses can cause severe
health hazards and cross-contamination. Water quality decline exacerbated by climate change increases
water purification costs. Furthermore, climate change may compromise the effectiveness of available
water storage options – both surface, for examples due to increased evaporation triggered by increased
temperature, and sub-surface, for example due to saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers triggered by
climate change-induced sea level rise. Higher sea levels due to climate change also cause saline water
intrusion into sewers in coastal areas (Laugier et al., 2010; Rasmussen et al., 2013). Adaptation of water
infrastructure to climate change is, to a large extent, about how well the diverse and growing water
scarcity and water pollution challenges, exacerbated by climate change as outlined above, are dealt with.

Options to enhance water security under a changing climate
3.2.1 Innovations in and adaptation of conventional water infrastructure
As section 3.1.2 suggests, climate change challenges conventional water infrastructure solutions. More
emphasis on multi-purpose infrastructure projects may partially help meet the challenge (Branche, 2015).
Such projects often address drought resistance, flood control, regional development and other needs
conjunctively and yet provide public goods (navigation, river basin management, maintaining ‘ecological’
river flows, etc.), recognizing the cross-sectoral and multi-purpose nature of water. Nature-based solutions
(NBS) can be implemented to better adapt to climate change, to increase the efficiency, effectiveness and
robustness of water management infrastructure (including operations and maintenance), and to contribute
to climate change mitigation.
As a conventional approach to surface water storage, the potential for building more reservoirs,
particularly large ones, is increasingly limited by siltation, available runoff, environmental concerns and
restrictions, and the fact that most cost-effective and viable sites – at least in developed countries –
have been already used. While it is unlikely that NBS can replace some larger forms of built storage
infrastructure, more ecosystem-friendly forms of water storage, such as natural wetlands, soil moisture
retention (through sustainable land management) and more efficient groundwater recharge (Section 3.2.2)
could help enhance the overall effectiveness of surface storage operations (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018). It is
important to identify the most appropriate blend of conventional infrastructure and NBS. An example is to
apply more water harnessing upstream for release for human use and environmental flows, while using
treated wastewater for managed aquifer recharge (MAR) in coastal areas to combat seawater intrusion
and reuse for urban purposes. Application of such hybrid approaches could expand rapidly if water
resources and land use planning policy and management consider these NBS and increase investments.
Evidence suggests that investment in NBS remains well below 1% of total investment in water resources
management infrastructure (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018).
The increasing impacts of climate change and other change drivers trigger the need for overall
revision of national and regional storage operation, planning and management strategies (Scanlon
and Smakhtin, 2016), including in some countries, like the USA, with a long history of large storage
development (Ho et al., 2017). In the past, ecological impacts of infrastructure development and future
costs such as maintenance or removal beyond the economic design life were not fully considered or
valued. Progressively, legislation becomes stronger, giving more value to ecology and environmental
considerations. Increasing impacts of climate change trigger the need to develop various innovations in
water storage – in a variety of ways (e.g. Box 3.1; WWAP/UN-Water, 2018, Box 2.1, p. 39).
Enhancing the resilience of WASH infrastructure is particularly critical in Least Developed Countries (LDCs)
and Small Island Developing States (SIDS), where vulnerability to climate change impacts is relatively
high. According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2015a), adaptation and resilience measures for
sanitation systems to counteract climate change should be implemented under six categories, including
technologies and infrastructure, financing, policy and governance, workforce, information systems,
and service delivery. Table 3.1 (WHO, 2018a) summarizes possible adaptation measures for some key
sanitation technologies and sanitation management systems.
Overall, conventional water infrastructure is becoming more vulnerable to climate change, and may incur
increasingly high costs or adverse societal and environmental impacts. On the other hand, lack of water
infrastructure of any kind makes a country even more vulnerable to changing hydrological regimes.
In countries with economic water scarcity, more water infrastructure, like water storage and reliable
water supply and sanitation systems, needs to be developed in an accelerated way, but with a clear
consideration of future climate uncertainty and (generally increasing) variability.

3.2.2 Groundwater storage and conjunctive water management
In many regions of the world, aquifers represent the largest source, or potential source, of water
storage, with often orders of magnitude more storage capacity than surface-water storage (Hanak
et al., 2011). Because aquifers often span large geographic areas and regions, they provide a spatially
distributed source of water and storage as well as some built-in water conveyance. Groundwater is
also more buffered from seasonal and multi-year climate variability and less immediately vulnerable
than surface water (Green et al., 2011).
Shallow groundwater is generally more accessible by rural and poor communities than river flow
because of the necessary infrastructure to harness and distribute the river water to dispersed rural
communities. However, some regions, including much of Africa, lack infrastructure such as wells,
technical capacity to build and maintain infrastructure, and hydrogeological characterization of aquifer
systems to develop and sustainably use local groundwater resources and enhance water storage in
local aquifers (UNESCO-IHP, 2015a; 2015b).
Aquifer storage includes not only groundwater already in aquifers but also the potential to store
additional water, if it can be captured. MAR serves various purposes (Dillon et al., 2018; WWAP/
UN-Water, 2018; GRIPP, n.d.), including maximizing water storage, replenishing depleting aquifers,
improving water quality, enhancing flood management, and mitigating seawater intrusion of coastal
aquifers or land subsidence. MAR approaches can use water supplied by both conventional (typically
surface water) and unconventional sources (e.g. reclaimed or desalinated water; see next Section),
through integrated or ‘conjunctive use’ management strategies. The use of wastewater for MAR has
been on the rise (GRIPP, n.d.).

Box 3.1 Coastal reservoirs as a water supply option for coastal cities
An emerging solution to the water supply problems of coastal megacities is the creation and use of coastal reservoirs,
which provide water storage facilities at or near the mouth of rivers. Such storage is formed either by constructing
a barrage across the river, or by containment reservoirs built along one of the riverbanks or the coastline. These
reservoirs generally have a system of gates that are operated in a carefully designed manner to capture freshwater,
reduce flood risk, and minimize saltwater intrusion. Many coastal cities, including Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore
are using coastal reservoirs for their water supply. For example, the Qingcaosha Coastal Reservoir in the mouth of
the Yangtze River, completed in 2010, supplies water to nearly 50% of Shanghai city residents (Lin et al., 2018). The
construction of several coastal reservoirs in China has advanced their design and the overall best practices of this type
solution. However, challenges such as saltwater intrusion, pollution control, algal blooms, sediment accumulation and
ecosystem imbalances are important considerations for the design, construction and operation of coastal reservoirs.
Coastal reservoirs as a supplement to local water supplies have been or are currently being explored in other countries,
including India (Sitharam, 2018), Malaysia (Chong et al., 2018), the Netherlands and Australia (Yang and Ferguson,
2010), though the Netherlands already have strong historic experience and expertise in managing coastal waters. The
coastal reservoirs can also provide renewable energy if they are in regions of high tidal range (Angeloudis et al., 2016).

While surface reservoirs have the potential to fill and empty quickly, creating a flexible water supply that
also assists flood management, large surface storage is costly and may be ecologically damaging (Hanak
et al., 2011). Aquifers recharge and empty more slowly, which makes them more suitable for longer-term
storage. Conjunctive use, taking advantage of a span of storage solutions, makes it possible to expand a
region’s overall water storage capacity, by using more surface water (and storing more water in aquifers)
during wet periods, and relying on groundwater during dry periods.
Groundwater is underutilized is some regions, such as parts of Africa and Central Asia. Still, an estimated
75% of Africans use groundwater for small-scale purposes, namely as their main source of drinking
water, particularly in rural areas that rely on dug wells and boreholes (Tuinhof et al., 2011). However, only
about 1% of the cultivated land in Africa is irrigated with groundwater, and for the most part this resource
remains an underutilized and reliable resource for irrigated food production (Altchenko and Villholth,
2015). Many other regions, including parts of the USA, China and the Indo-Gangetic plains of northern

52

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

India, suffer from over-abstraction of groundwater resources, which has resulted in severe drawdown
of the water tables (Tiwari et al., 2009; Wada et al., 2010; Famiglietti, 2014; Richey et al., 2015). Climate
change may exacerbate such phenomena as higher air temperature, resulting in an increase in evaporation
of rainfall and therefore reduced recharge (Taylor et al., 2012).
Groundwater recharge may also be impacted by climate change in other ways: in arid and semi-arid
areas, the increased intensity of rainfall associated with and amplified by climate change (see Box 9.2)
may make groundwater recharge more episodic and localized (Cuthbert et al., 2019). An adequate
management of surface water and groundwater through various forms of MAR has the potential to
reduce the peak flood flows and inundations, and to mitigate the groundwater depletion at the same time
(Muthuwatta et al., 2017).
Water storage is a particularly critical issue on low-lying islands, atolls and many SIDS. These are among
the most vulnerable communities to climate change because of sea level rise, which has a direct impact
on flood risk, but also reduces the size of groundwater lenses because of seawater intrusion. Proper
management and use of groundwater will be important for sustaining access to supplies of potable water
in many SIDS. The use of MAR has greatly increased in coastal aquifers worldwide to enhance water
storage and in part to minimize seawater intrusion (GRIPP, n.d.). However, the use of MAR on atolls or SIDS
is not widely reported (Hejazian et al., 2017). SIDS’ adaptation to climate change will require more MAR
programmes that recharge the freshwater lens from rainwater or stormwater capture during wet periods to
help sustain communities through dry periods (UNESCO-IHP, 2015b).

3.2.3 Unconventional water resources
The growing demand for water, resulting from population growth and the need to produce more food,
puts increasing pressure on the limited available water resources, particularly in areas of physical water
scarcity. This is accentuated by the fact that improvements in the efficiency of exploiting conventional
sources and approaches have a ceiling (World Bank, 2017a). It is increasingly necessary to consider
various ‘unconventional’ and/or regionally underutilized water resources (Figure 3.1) as part of water
management and water planning for the future (Qadir and Smakhtin, 2018). Unconventional water
resources are generated as a result of specialized processes or technologies to collect/access water.
They may require suitable pre-use treatment, potentially including on-farm management when used for
irrigation (Qadir et al., 2007).

Safe water reuse (or ‘reclaimed water’) is a reliable alternative to conventional water resources in the
face of climate change impacts (WWAP, 2017). The main challenge remains in shifting from unplanned
use of untreated, or partially treated, wastewater to safe water reuse practices. Use of untreated or poorly
treated water is associated with human and environmental health risks linked to microbial and emerging
pollutants in reclaimed water. Several countries, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, use treated
wastewater for irrigation. Water reuse in agriculture has been shown to act as a buffer to increasing water

scarcity and the impacts of extreme climate events (Drechsel et al., 2015; Hettiarachchi and Ardakanian,
2016; WWAP, 2017). With more intense and prolonged droughts, a growing number of cities (e.g. in India
and the USA) are adopting direct or indirect (via MAR) potable reuse schemes to cope with recurrent water
shortages. In Namibia, the city of Windhoek has been successfully implementing potable reuse for over
50 years (Box 3.2). Reclaimed water is increasingly considered an alternative water resource in some
regions of Europe. According to Water Reuse Europe (2018), only 2% of treated wastewater is reused in
Europe, but it is expected to grow in the future, with the biggest potential in Portugal and Spain.
Seawater and brackish water desalination. Desalination is an option to augment freshwater supplies by
removing dissolved salts from brackish or saltwater. According to the estimate by Jones et al. (2019), there
are 16,000 operational desalination plants globally, producing around 95 million m³/day of desalinated
water, of which around 50% is produced in the Middle East and North Africa region. However, desalination
is relatively costly due to high energy consumption – even if the cost is becoming increasingly competitive.
The production and disposal of a hypersaline concentrate (‘brine’), a process by-product, is another
challenge in terms of costs and associated environmental impacts. Given the unlimited nature of seawater
and the decreasing cost of renewable energy sources, desalination has a potential to significantly improve
water supply in the future and may even replace domestic and industrial water demand in the 100-km
coastal belt by 2050 (Sood and Smakhtin, 2014).
Atmospheric moisture harvesting such as cloud seeding, or fog water collection in areas where advective
fog is abundant, is practiced in parts of South America, the Middle East and North America. Many
locations with estimated high potential for fog water collection have been identified throughout the globe
(Klemm, et al., 2012). Unlike the massive potential provided by desalination, fog water is primarily of local
importance, as a low-cost and low-maintenance approach (Qadir et al., 2018).
Offshore aquifers. Attention is growing to offshore groundwater options. It is estimated that 0.5 million
km3 of fresh/brackish water exists in offshore aquifers located below shallow (<500 m) ocean water within
100 km of the shoreline (Post et al., 2013). There are multiple locations around the world where offshore
low-salinity groundwater has been observed (Person et al., 2017). Post et al. (2013, p. 76), however
suggest that “offshore groundwater is not the answer to global water crises”, but “…it can be weighed
against other options in long-term strategies”.
Physical transportation of freshwater by the sea. These options are the most ‘fictional’ at present, but the
ideas and attempts to harvest them are becoming stronger (Rafico, 2014). Water can be transported from
large rivers’ deltas/estuaries, such as Amazon or Congo (the total annual discharge of both is close to
8,000 km3, some 20 times the total amount of wastewater globally) by tankers or bags to such areas as

Box 3.2 Fifty years of direct potable reclamation in Windhoek, Namibia
For over 50 years, the City of Windhoek has been directly reclaiming potable water from secondary effluent. Direct Potable
reclamation has proven to be a safe and economically feasible way to supplement the scarce water resources in Windhoek
and to overcome the effects of reoccurring droughts (Du Pisani et al., 2018). The current supply of drinking water to the
approximately 400,000 inhabitants of the City of Windhoek consists for 25–30% of reclaimed water (Lahnsteiner and
Lempert, 2007).
In the absence of existing legislation, regulations, policies or guidelines on the subject, the City of Windhoek decided to use
an approach centred on consumer safety when implementing direct potable reclamation (Law et al., 2015). This experience
resulted in an acceptance and trust towards this non-conventional source of drinking water (Boucher et al., 2010).
The capacity of the first reclamation plant commissioned in 1968 was 4,800 m3/day, which was over the years adapted in
terms of processes applied. Its capacity was then increased to 7,200 m3/day (1986) and later to 14,400 m3/day (1994). The
newest reclamation plant, commissioned in 2002, has a capacity of 21,000 m3/day (Honer, 2019).

Assessments exists of the possibility to transport water from far-apart water-abundant places to
water-scarce regions such as Namibia and South Africa (Valentine, 2017). Similarly, the ideas for iceberg
transport – either as a whole or ‘shaved ice’ in tankers have been put forward (Ruiz, 2015). These options
at present exist only as concepts due to their high cost, large fleet of tankers required and large
calculated losses.

The production and/or use of some of the unconventional water resources such as
desalinated water or wastewater may result in environmental impacts and/or associated
health risks. Hence, these different options for unconventional water resources need
health and environmental risk assessments and pertinent mitigation options (Grangier
et al., 2012; WWAP, 2017; Qadir, 2018; Jones et al., 2019). Some unconventional sources,
like water reuse, increase resilience to climate change through renewable energy
generation, for example energy recovery from wastewater during the treatment process
(Drechsel et al., 2018).
In summary, in the face of climate change, water supply augmentation using
unconventional sources offer alternative solutions to increase water supplies to meet
the growing water demand, especially in regions and countries with physical water
scarcity. At present, among unconventional water resources, reclaimed water is seen as
being the most promising with a growing number of successful real-life applications and
a worldwide growing market for reclaimed water, particularly for irrigation. To increase
wastewater reuse in agriculture and other sectors, effective monitoring and regulations
need to be developed and implemented to overcome concerns related to environmental
and human health risks. Applications of other unconventional water sources and
technologies will likely continue grow in the next decades.

Mitigation options for water resources management5
3.3.1 The water supply and sanitation sector
The bulk of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to water management and sanitation either
originates from 1) energy used to power the systems and 2) the biochemical processes involved in water
and wastewater treatment.
Water and wastewater utilities are reportedly responsible for between 3 and 7% of GHG emissions
(Trommsdorf, 2015), but these estimates do not include emissions associated with discharging
untreated sewage. Indeed, untreated wastewater is an important source of GHGs. Given that, in
developing countries, 80–90% of the wastewater is neither collected nor treated (Corcoran et al., 2010;
WWAP, 2017), the emissions related to the water supply and sanitation sector – and its potential to
contribute significantly to climate change mitigation – should not be neglected.
Electricity use by the sector is mainly for the abstraction (40%), conveyance (25%) and treatment (20%)
of water and wastewater, representing some 4% of global electricity production. Energy consumption in
the water sector is expected to double through 2040, as a result of increasing desalination of seawater
(Figure 3.2; IEA, 2016). Energy consumption for wastewater treatment is also expected to increase in the
coming decades, which seems unnecessary since, at the global scale, the potential for energy-positive
treatment plants has been increasing rapidly (Freyberg, 2016). Increasing water use efficiency and
reducing unnecessary water consumption and water loss both translate into lower energy use and thus
lower GHG emissions. It has been estimated that the water sector worldwide could reduce its energy use
by 15% until 2040 (IEA, 2016).

The formation of CH4 and N20 in landfills, open sewers and lagoons amounted to an estimated 13% of
global non-CO2 emissions in 2005 (US EPA, 2012). Some 58% of these emissions stem from landfills,
part of which is wastewater treatment sludge disposal (Guo et al., 2012). The contribution of non-CO2
emissions from wastewater is expected to increase (US EPA, 2012).
The organic matter in wastewater contains more energy than is needed to treat it (Li et al., 2015).
Energy from wastewater can therefore be an important source for the water sector to become more
energy-efficient. Centralized treatment plants capture most of the developing CH4 and use this for
energy production, thus reducing both direct emissions and indirect emissions from energy use. Some
wastewater treatment facilities in Europe and the USA have on-site renewable energy production and
energy use efficiency improvements, leading to advancements in ‘net-zero’ energy and energy-positive
practice (Rothausen and Conway, 2011; Maktabifard et al., 2018).
Wastewater can be a source of raw materials like nutrients or certain metals (i.e. industrial wastewater),
further contributing to reduced energy required in the extraction of these raw materials for use as
fertilizers (Wang et al., 2018a).
Thus, by increasing water use efficiency and by reducing water losses, including reuse of (untreated
or partially treated) wastewater and its constituents, water supply and sanitation systems can not only
directly and substantially contribute to GHG mitigation, but also become more cost-effective.
In addition to wastewater treatment infrastructures, an overlooked source of non-CO2 emissions are dam
reservoirs (World Bank, 2017b). CH4 emissions caused by the decomposition of organic material in dam
reservoirs may contribute as much as 1.5% of global CO2-equivalent emissions, a number that may rise
due to new dam construction in certain parts of the world (Zarfl et al., 2016) and increasing erosion due to
land use change and unsuitable land management practices. Moreover, increases in wastewater discharge
and fertilizer-rich runoff can lead to enhanced levels of eutrophication. The resulting methane emissions
from lakes and reservoirs alone are estimated to increase by 30–90% through 2100 (Beaulieu et al., 2019).
Innovative use of water infrastructure can also be a source of energy. For instance, gravity-driven
pipelines for drinking water may be equipped with turbines to generate electricity. Vienna’s drinking water,
for example, comes from mountain springs through two long-distance pipelines. The turbines that are
installed, in addition to producing electricity, reduce the water pressure to levels suitable for the city’s
drinking water infrastructure (WWAP, 2014).

3.3.2 Water-related ecosystems
Wetlands,6 including peatlands, accommodate the largest carbon stocks among terrestrial ecosystems
and store twice as much carbon as forests (Crump, 2017; Moomaw et al., 2018). Wetlands are however
under high pressure, and the loss rate of wetlands is three times higher than that of forests (Ramsar
Convention on Wetlands, 2018). A poorly managed wetland can become a source of GHGs instead of
a sink. Peatland, for instance, consists of a thick layer of peat, a carbon stock that has formed over
thousands of years. Draining peatland for agriculture or other purposes leads to decomposition of the
peat, releasing CO2 and other GHGs into the atmosphere (see Chapters 6 and 9). The carbon stock is
reduced as a consequence. In 2017, around 15% of the global peatlands were considered to be either
degraded or destroyed, with agriculture being the main driver. Burnt and drained peatlands account for
nearly 5% of the global CO2 emissions caused by humans (Crump, 2017). On top of this, wetlands are
sensitive to global warming; warmer climates could lower the rate at which peatlands accumulate carbon
over the long term (Gallego-Sala et al., 2018).
Griscom et al. (2017) suggest that around a third of the GHG mitigation until 2030 can be attained through
ecosystem-based mitigation, to which wetlands can contribute a share of 14%. Taking into account that
wetlands offer multiple co-benefits – including flood and drought mitigation, water purification, and
biodiversity – conservation of wetlands is an important mitigating measure.

6

A wetland is a distinct ecosystem that is inundated by water, either permanently or seasonally, where oxygen-free processes prevail.
The main wetland types are swamp, marsh and peatlands (bog and fen), and also include mangroves and seagrass meadows
(Keddy, 2010).

This chapter focuses on the linkages between climate change adaptation and
disaster risk reduction, highlighting opportunities to build more resilient systems
through a combination of ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ measures.

4.1

Climate and water extremes as challenges for water
management
Climate change manifests itself, amongst others, through increasing frequency and magnitude of
extreme events such as heat waves, unprecedented rainfalls, thunderstorms and storm surge
events caused by cyclones, typhoons or hurricanes, that, in turn, render societies increasingly
vulnerable to water-related disasters. Around 74% of all natural disasters between 2001 and 2018
were water-related and during the past 20 years, the total number of deaths caused only by floods
and droughts exceeded 166,000, while floods and droughts affected over three billion people, and
caused total economic damage of almost US$700 billion (EM-DAT, 2019).7 The number of deaths,
people affected and economic losses significantly varies annually and by continent, with Asia and
Africa being the most impacted on all counts (Figures 4.1, 4.2, 4.3).

The current impacts
and future anticipated
risks associated
with extreme events
demand sustainable
solutions for climate
change adaptation and
disaster risk reduction

Climate change has made extreme events more severe by altering the timing,
intensity and duration of their occurrences (Blöschl et al., 2017). For example,
in certain cases it has caused droughts in the winter months, which may
cause much greater impacts on agricultural and water resource systems
than in the summer (FAO, 2018b). The current impacts and future anticipated
risks associated with extreme events demand sustainable solutions for
climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR). CCA and
DRR are connected through the common goal of reducing the impacts of
climate change, minimizing the consequences of extreme events when they
happen and increasing resilience to disasters, particularly among vulnerable
communities in developing countries and Small Island Developing States
(SIDS).

Protection of human rights during extreme events is essential as these events can trigger political,
social and economic instabilities in countries, degrading health, livelihoods, and food and water
security. The currently active Sendai Framework (see Section 2.2.3) is a critically important
international effort that aims to make the world much safer in 2030, through seven targets and four
priorities timely designed for DRR (UNDRR, 2015a).

4.2

Hard and soft measures in climate change adaptation and
disaster risk reduction
The range of available CCA and DRR strategies that may help overcome the impacts from extremes
is diverse and includes hard (structural) and soft (policy instruments) approaches. Examples of hard
measures include enhanced water storage, climate-proof infrastructure, and crop resilience improvements
through the introduction of flood- and drought-resistant crop varieties. Examples of soft measures include
flood and drought insurance, forecasting and early warning systems, land use planning, and associated
capacity building (education and awareness) in all of the above. Hard and soft measures often go
together. For example, implementing structural flood protection measures, or improvements to agricultural
systems such as crop diversification or the introduction of hazard-resistant crop varieties (i.e. both,
essentially, hard measures), need enabling policy environments (i.e. soft measures in the form of policy
and institutional support).

4.2.1 Hard measures
Climate-proof infrastructure
Climate-proofing refers to the explicit consideration and internalization of the risks and opportunities
that alternative climate change scenarios are likely to imply for the design, operation and maintenance of
infrastructure, including water infrastructure under extreme events (UNDP, 2011). Conducting a disaster
risk assessment is the essential first step in a DRR strategy and normally includes three elements: the
magnitude of the hazard expressed in terms of frequency and severity (depth, extent, duration and
relative velocities); the exposure of human activities to hazard; and the vulnerability of the elements at
risk (APFM, 2007). Bottom-up climate assessments investigate exposure, the vulnerability of individuals
and/or communities to climate variability, and the adaptive capacity for describing risks (García et al.,
2014). In contrast, top-down approaches rely on climate models to predict a possible future and build
their responses on the output of these models (Figure 4.4). Although both approaches can be used in
a complementary fashion, often only one of the two is used. A policy guidance for conducting national
disaster risk assessments and establishing a thorough understanding of risk systems is provided by the
UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR, 2017).

Smart and adaptable approaches to water-related infrastructure such as dams, diversions, levees and
drainage systems development are cognizant that the past is an unreliable guide to face present and
future extreme events, due to the uncertainty caused by climate change. Among the water-related
infrastructure that needs to be climate-proofed are dams. While storing water for periods of scarcity is
often the main concern, increasing the capacity for absorbing floods can be equally important – with
potentially conflicting management implications of both functions. To better deal with the increasing
variability of river flows, various measures can be implemented, ranging from generally lowering the
reservoir water level, to increasing flood retention capacities (Sieber and Socher, 2010), to increasing the
(technical) capacity for water withdrawal within dams. This allows for more efficient lowering of water
levels in case of an expected flood event. Adding outlet structures at various depths also enhances

62

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

options to use them for water quality management by withdrawing, under stratified conditions, water from
problematic water layers (Klapper, 2003). Such measures should be accompanied by measures in the
drainage basin upstream of reservoirs.

Nature-based solutions
“Nature-based solutions (NBS) are inspired and supported by nature and use, or mimic, natural processes to
contribute to the improved management of water” (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018, p. 2). NBS include adapted land
use to increase water storage capacities in the subsurface, preventing erosion and excessive overland
flow, but also technical measures such as the construction of pre-dams (Paul and Pütz, 2008). Ecosystembased adaptation (EbA) is particularly relevant for CCA and DRR, since it uses biodiversity and ecosystem
services as part of an overall adaptation strategy to overcome the adverse effects of climate change and
extreme events (IUCN, 2017). EbA could be implemented through maintaining and restoring ecosystems
to a good ecological state, using ecosystems as naturally ‘engineered’ landscapes to help in DRR under
climate change, and integrating CCA measures into wetlands and other ecosystem management
strategies and plans and vice versa (UNECE/UNDRR, 2018).

4.2.2 Soft measures
Forecasting and early warning systems
Awareness and preparedness are fundamental components of resilience, DRR and response to waterrelated disasters. Early warning systems play an important role in DRR, especially to assess imminent
flood and drought risks, enhance decision-making strategies, improve community preparedness, and
mitigate damage from extreme events through timely and effective action. UNDRR (n.d.) defines early
warning systems as “an integrated system of hazard monitoring, forecasting and prediction, disaster risk
assessment, communication and preparedness activities systems and processes that enable individuals,
communities, governments, businesses and others to take timely actions to reduce disaster risks in advance
of hazardous events”.
Thanks to major improvements over the last decades in climate- and weather-related forecasting and
prediction tools, communities at risk can currently often be provided with sufficient lead time to respond
to imminent disasters (WMO, 2015a; 2015b; 2016). The timescales at which forecasts are provided are
often divided into now-casting, with lead times in the order of 0–6 hours; short term forecasts (0–3
days); medium range forecasts (3–15 days); and the longer term sub-seasonal (1–3 months) to seasonal
forecasts (3–6 months) (Golding, 2009). While smaller timescales lead to more accuracy, the choice of the
most appropriate timescale is often concomitant with the decision processes that the forecasts provided
intend to inform. In the example of informing responses to flash floods, now-casts and short-range
forecasts are the appropriate timescale, while decision processes defined in drought management plans
may be supported by forecasts at the sub-seasonal to seasonal scale.

Modern
communication
methods such
as social media
and mobile
phone services
provide significant
opportunities
to help improve
communication
and early warning
effectiveness

Increasing lead times can help improve the effectiveness of early warning systems,
but needs to be complemented with clear communication, and co-development and
engagement with the communities at risk (Parker and Priest, 2012; Cools et al., 2016),
especially in transboundary basins where coordination, cooperation and data sharing
are sometimes limited due to political conflicts and weak governances within and
between countries (Bakker, 2009a; 2009b). Modern communication methods such
as social media and mobile phone services provide significant opportunities to help
improve communication and early warning effectiveness (Cumiskey et al., 2015)
(see Chapter 13). There are also increasing efforts to go beyond the hazard-only
information traditionally provided by early warning systems, through the development
of impact-based forecasting (WMO, 2015b). Rather than providing only predictions
of hydro-meteorological variables, impact-based forecasts also aim to provide clear,
sector-specific information on the expected impacts of extreme events. Similarly,
action-based forecasting initiatives such as forecast-based financing (Coughlan
de Perez et al., 2016) are being used to inform humanitarian response. Sustainable
economic and social development requires prediction, forecasting and warning
systems for communities at risk to be continuously developed, reviewed and refined,

Water-related extremes and risk management

which in turn demands an optimal combination of data, forecasting tools and well-trained specialists and
must be complemented by accurate risk management actions (Leonard et al., 2007). Integrating gender
in early warning systems is important, as women and children are reportedly 14 times more likely than
men to die during a disaster (UNDP, 2013). They also play a pivotal role in emergency preparedness and
responses as well as in DRR (UNDRR, 2015b), provided they are empowered to do so.
Operational forecasting and warning services have been in development over several decades, providing
many examples (Pappenberger et al., 2015; Adams and Pagano, 2016; Smith et al., 2017). These include
services provided at the basin scale and national scale (an overview of several such systems can be
found in Adams and Pagano, 2016) through to the continental and even global scale (Emmerton et al.,
2016). However, a globally consistent picture is currently missing regarding the availability and state of
operational early warning systems for floods, especially with regard to achieving the goals set in global
agendas such as the Sendai Framework and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Perera et al.,
2019). There are also many technical, financial, institutional and social challenges, including inadequate
hydro-meteorological networks, lack of technical expertise and limited human resources to perform
forecasts, and lack of knowledge about operational effectiveness of early warning systems, among others.
Drought monitoring and drought early warning systems are similarly diverse and face similar challenges.
Drought early warning systems, such as seasonal outlooks based on, for example, El Niño/Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) indices, can be used to provide advance warning of drought conditions, or of
continuing drought conditions, which in turn enable proactive drought management decision-making,
such as destocking of animals, reduction in planted area, or planting of different crops. Seasonal drought
forecasting has shown success in Southeast Asia and western South America (in large part due to their
proximity to the Pacific Ocean, where the ENSO originates). However, the seasonal drought forecasts
in Africa remain less precise. There are many examples of national and regional ‘drought monitors’ in
operation (WMO/GWP, 2016).
In the drought management community, there has been a focus on advancing a three-pillar approach to
drought management, incorporating: i) comprehensive drought monitoring and early warning systems;
ii) vulnerability and impact assessments; and iii) appropriate drought risk mitigation and response
actions (Pischke and Stefanski, 2018). The approach stresses the importance of interconnecting these
three pillars through stakeholder engagement aimed at developing and implementing proactive drought
management plans or policies.

Drought and flood
monitoring systems are
an important component
of risk reduction

Drought and flood monitoring systems are an important component of risk
reduction. However, they need to be embedded in a comprehensive drought/flood
management strategy, which builds on an understanding of who and what is at risk
and why, while identifying appropriate measures to reduce risk as well as ways to
respond depending on a set threshold. Guidance for selecting measures has been
developed in the flood management community (APFM, 2013a; 2013b).

Flood and drought insurance
Enhancing the accessibility to climate risk insurance enables communities to improve their resilience to
disasters and plays an important role in supporting the recovery from extreme events, such as floods and
droughts, by providing timely pay-outs. Insurance can support disaster preparedness and management
if it is accompanied by requirements or incentives to take preventive measures, therefore constituting an
important element of a cost-effective DRR strategy (UNDRR, 2017).
Insurance sets a minimum threshold for an acceptable level of risk by establishing a cost estimate on the
risk and setting risk prevention standards. Resilience-building is incentivized as lower risks translate to
lower premiums (GWP, 2018a). An index-based flood insurance scheme (Figure 4.5) can simplify decisionmaking and speeds the delivery of insurance pay-outs to compensate farmers for crops ruined by floods
through a high-tech approach that has been demonstrated to be more efficient than conventional field
assessments (Amarnath et al., 2017; Amarnath and Sikka, 2018).

Furthermore, insurance companies can also mobilize significant finance for DRR through capital
investments in resilience-building measures. Overall, insurance can help mobilize additional external
finance because the economic risk from disasters is lower. Another possibility in the context of risk
transfer mechanisms is the development of resilience bonds, which encourage investments in measures
that build resilience (Hermann et al., 2016).

Urban planning
Urban planning is one of the soft/non-structural measures that provide excellent opportunities for DRR
and CCA. For example, increased resilience to flood risks can be achieved by developing urban drainage
systems that are integrated within urban infrastructure design to provide safe flooding spaces. The city
thus acts as a ‘sponge’, limiting surges and releasing rainwater as a resource (Liu et al., 2016). The Delta
Programme adopted by the Dutch Government to ensure the Netherlands is protected against flooding
(van Herk et al., 2013; Gersonius et al., 2016) and the Tsurumi River Multipurpose Retarding Basin in Japan
(Ikeuchi, 2012), which uses spaces normally used for parks and stadiums as floodwater retarding area, are
two examples of successful integration of DRR in urban planning.

Contingency planning
Preparing a flood contingency plan to prepare for disasters increases the capacity of officers in charge
of disaster response and enhances local resilience. One of the potential tools to achieve these objectives
is ‘evidence-based flood contingency planning’, which is based on scientific approaches such as
flood simulation and quantitative risk assessment. It consists of six steps: i) understanding of current
conditions; ii) risk identification through a flood inundation simulation; iii) impact analysis; iv) development
of a response strategy; v) development of a contingency plan; and vi) sharing the plan. This tool, which is
designed to be applicable in any flood-prone area, has been tested in the Luzon Island in the Philippines
(Ohara et al., 2018).

Planning and assessment methods for disaster risk reduction
To reduce water-related disaster risks under climate change, it is necessary to integrate DRR into different
sectoral policies and plans (Birkmann and Von Teichman; 2010; Reinmar, et al., 2018). This mainstreaming
process includes assessing the implications of disasters and climate change on any planned development
action in all thematic areas and sectors at all levels. This also requires identifying existing sectoral policy
and legal instruments, which already take DRR measures into account.

Mainstreaming gender
and community
involvement in decisionmaking processes
should be a key element
in DRR strategies

Stakeholder involvement is crucial in all the steps in the development and
implementation of DRR strategies. It is important to identify the stakeholders and
their responsibilities in DRR, facilitate their involvement (different sectors, including
local communities) by providing the relevant information to them, and build
stakeholder capacity to make them more prepared for emergencies. Mainstreaming
gender and community involvement in decision-making processes should be a key
element in DRR strategies. The gender dimensions of DRR in the context of climate
change is well expressed in General Recommendation 37 of the Committee on the
Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW, 2018).

A transboundary basin level DRR assessment provides opportunities to evaluate the most severe risks
faced by the entire basin and to foster joint efforts among the riparian countries. Addressing disasters at
the basin level extends the decision space and broadens the range of possible solutions (UNECE, 2009;
2015). Solutions to transboundary water-related disasters emanating from consultation and joint action
between the riparian countries can help achieve mutual benefits (e.g. costs and data sharing, common
early warning systems). It also makes preparedness more effective and help to avoid unilateral measures
that may have negative impacts on other riparian countries. Approaches and tools for policy-makers and
practitioners on how to address water-related disasters under climate change in transboundary basins are

Opportunities
New knowledge and approaches to build resilient societies and to maximize the synergies between
CCA and DRR are emerging (Birkmann and Von Teichman, 2010; Reinmar, et al., 2018) (see Chapter 13).
Artificial intelligence (AI), ‘big data’, sophisticated climate and hydrological models, advanced remotesensing technologies, NBS, and social media may all strengthen the global agendas in CCA and DRR.
AI and machine learning have the potential to significantly improve efforts in environmental monitoring,
flood forecasting and disaster communication (Sermet and Demir, 2018). Social media data streams
can provide critical information for ungauged locations in flood monitoring (Wang et al., 2018b; Sit et
al., 2019). Decision support systems (Demir et al., 2018; Newman et al., 2017) reinforced with serious
gaming approaches can facilitate participatory decision-making in multi-hazard mitigation (Meera et al.,
2016; Carson et al., 2018). Emerging techniques may not fully replace traditional DRR measures but may
complement the latter to increase capacity to cope with water-related disasters (Gan et al., 2016).

Improved inter-agency
coordination in water
resources and disaster risk
management is needed,
especially in transboundary
basins where it remains

of the world

Maximizing the benefits of these innovative tools requires filling (or at least
reducing) the gap between scientific knowledge and action taken by policymakers and practitioners. Improved inter-agency coordination in water
resources and disaster risk management is needed, especially in transboundary
basins where it remains fragmented throughout most of the world. It is also
important that these developments are linked to proactive policy and planning.
Government agencies should not only anticipate events and know their extent
and intensity when they occur. They should have developed and agreed action
plans in place to react timely and properly to ensure that the costs of the
impacts are managed, and that communities and businesses are able to return
to normal as soon as possible.

water quality and quantity due to climate change. Trends in morbidity and mortality
are examined in the context of health risks associated with climate change, and
response options related to water supply and sanitation are presented.

5.1

Introduction
It is becoming increasingly clear that climate change has severe impacts on health, and that many of
these impacts are related to water. Climate change threatens all aspects of society, and the continuing
delay in addressing the challenge further increases the risks to human lives and the right to health
(WHO, 2018b). If current greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trends continue, climate change will trigger
a range of health impacts concentrated on the poorest and most vulnerable populations, thereby
deepening inequalities both within and between countries.

Climate change
can be expected to
cause an additional
250,000 deaths
yearly by 2030
by hampering the
progress that is
being made against
killers such as
undernutrition,
malaria and
diarrhoea

Anticipated water-related health impacts of climate change are primarily food-,
water- and vector-borne diseases, deaths and injury associated with extreme
weather events such as coastal and inland flooding, as well as undernutrition as
a result or food shortages caused by droughts and floods. Mental health impact
associated with illness, injury, economic losses and displacement may also be
substantial, although difficult to quantify. Even considering only a subset of the
health risks, and making optimistic assumptions about economic growth, climate
change can be expected to cause an additional 250,000 deaths yearly by 2030 by
hampering the progress that is being made against killers such as undernutrition,
malaria and diarrhoea (WHO, 2014).
The drivers of climate change (see Chapter 1) cause a heavy burden of disease
(WHO, 2018b). Mitigation efforts focused on reducing GHG emissions will remain
essential in maintaining the social and environmental conditions for combatting
diseases in the long term. Such efforts are also needed to avoid uncertain, but
potentially severe water-related risks that are determinants of health, including
extreme weather events overwhelming health systems, breakdowns in food
systems, large-scale population displacement and exacerbation of poverty. These
factors threaten to reverse progress in health and overall development.

The impacts of climate change on health will likely lag behind GHG emission reductions by several
decades, due to delays between changes in social and environmental determinants of health (e.g.
migration due to food shortages) and the associated health outcomes (e.g. undernutrition and
stunting, mental health consequences of migration). There is an important opportunity, however,
for coordinated action to immediately address climate change and improve health by drawing on
principles of the ‘One Health’ approach, which combines interventions with humans, animals and
ecosystems to improve public health outcomes. Strengthening the resilience of water and sanitation
services as well as health systems would save lives now and protect populations from much of the
potential health impacts of climate change.

Human health impacts related to water, sanitation and climate change

69

The international community has made important progress in recent years. Global climate and
health agreements, most notably the Paris agreement (outcome document of the 21st Conference
of the Parties (COP), or United Nations Climate Change Conference), now provide clear mandates
for stronger action to protect human health from climate risks, and to promote the health benefits
of cleaner development choices. A range of different policy and technical support options regarding
water and, to a lesser extent, sanitation are currently available to support countries in their efforts
to include health in adaptation and mitigation policies. What is needed now is a more systematic,
evidence-based and scaled-up implementation (WHO, 2015b).

treatment costs in the case of illness and/or lost income while recovering from illness.

Microbial infections

Faecal-oral infections (diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, polio) and helminth infections due to
a lack of sanitation and hygiene, contaminated water and food, or conditions caused by repeated
microbial infections (stunting, pneumonia, anaemia). Vectorborne diseases due to poor water
management.

Physical injury

Drowning and/or workplace injuries to water and sanitation workers. Physical injuries caused by floods.

Chemical poisoning

Ingestion of elevated levels of nitrates, fluoride, arsenic and other chemical pollutants in drinking water.

Undernutrition and stunting
(and associated impaired cognition)

Repeated diarrhoea or helminth infections due to unsafe water and sanitation, causing environmental
enteropathy, undernutrition and stunting. Insufficient food supplies due to a decrease in water
availability for food production, causing undernutrition and stunting.

Issues of emerging concern

Antimicrobial resistance exacerbated by poor water and sanitation for infection prevention and control
in communities and health facilities, and the discharge of antibiotic residues, resistant bacteria and
genes in wastewaters further driving resistance.

Inadequate water and sanitation have been conservatively estimated to cause nearly two million
preventable deaths worldwide annually, as well as 123 million preventable Disability-Adjusted Life Years
(DALYs),8 with the greatest burden falling on children under five (WHO, 2019a) (Table 5.2). Since 2000,
progress on mortality associated with all major water- and sanitation-related diseases has shown an
encouraging downward trend (WHO, n.d.) commensurate with advances in access to improved water
supply and sanitation. However, morbidity has been slower to decline and, in many regions, the social and
economic burden of inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) lies disproportionately on women
and girls (e.g. lost opportunities for work or education due to water collection tasks or shame and anxiety
about toilet use and menstrual hygiene management) (Wendland et al., 2017).

At the end of the Millennium Development Goals period (2000–2015), 91% of the global population used
an improved drinking water source and 68% used improved sanitation facilities (WHO/UNICEF, 2015).
Much remains to be done to reach the new, higher levels of safely managed water supply and sanitation
services, as defined under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for the 2.2 billion and 4.2 billion
people, respectively, who lack this superior level of service (WHO/UNICEF, 2019). Safely managed services
are essential to achieve significant health gains from WASH (WHO, 2014).9

Human health impacts related to water, sanitation and climate change

71

5.3

Health risks associated with climate change
The 2015 Paris agreement concluded that climate change is already affecting human health, with
increasing exposure and vulnerability recorded worldwide. Furthermore, warming of even 1.5°C is
not considered safe for human health. The physical and mental health of the most disadvantaged,
vulnerable and poor populations is expected to be disproportionately affected. Thus, climate
change is considered to be a poverty multiplier, which could force 100 million people into extreme
poverty by 2030 (WHO, 2018b).

The direct health impacts of climate change include physiological effects from
exposure to higher temperatures, increasing incidences of respiratory and
cardiovascular disease and injuries, and death due to extreme weather events
such as droughts, floods, heatwaves, storms and wildfires. Indirect effects on
health arise from ecological changes, such as food and water insecurity and
the spread of climate-sensitive infectious diseases, and also from societal
responses to climate change, such as population displacement and reduced
access to health services. Mental health impacts after extreme weather events,
climate-related displacement, immigration and loss of culture can be lifelong. As
indirect effects of climate change may result from long causal pathways, they
are particularly difficult to anticipate or prevent (WHO, 2018b).

Water-related diseases affected by climate change via water are primarily food-, water- and vectorborne (with particular challenges in case of flooding), as well as deaths and injury associated
with coastal and inland flooding and droughts. Health impacts can also occur due to increased
exposure to pathogens, toxins or chemicals in drinking water, and undernutrition in the event
that crops fail (WHO, 2017). Health impacts will disproportionately affect people working in
occupations where they experience greater daily exposure to these hazards, including agricultural
work (ILO, 2016).
Table 5.3 summarizes the main causal pathways by which exposures related to climate variability
and change determine health impacts, primarily via drinking water quality and quantity. Climateresilient Water Safety Plans (WSPs) have the potential to contribute to reduced disease rates by
mitigating these effects.
A lot of uncertainty remains around the quantification of the additional burden of disease
associated with climate change, due to the variability of climate scenarios and the mediating effect
of societal responses (WHO, 2018b). However, it is clear that climate change is likely to slow or
undermine progress on access to safely managed water and sanitation, and lead to ineffective use
of resources if systems design and management are not climate-resilient. By extension, progress
on the elimination and control of water- and sanitation-related disease will also be slowed or
undermined by climate change. Past estimates of changes in disease due to climate change by
2030, compared to 2000 levels, point to a 10% higher risk of diarrhoea in some regions (McMichael
et al., 2004). What’s more, even relatively small losses of water and sanitation coverage at the
community level due to poor climate resilience could have disproportionate effects on human
health. For sanitation in particular, a small number of households with latrines that are periodically
flooded, for example, may contaminate the whole community potentially exposing
everyone in the community even if their own toilet was not affected. Therefore,
ensuring climate-resilient water and sanitation services for entire communities

The capacity of disease vectors to spread infectious diseases is increasing as rising water temperatures
will increase the range of favourable breeding sites for certain vectors for diseases (including malaria,
dengue, West Nile and Lyme disease, as well as neglected tropical diseases). Insect and animal vectors
may allow them to travel to areas such as Europe and North America, which were previously too cold to
support transmission. For example, the vectoral capacity of the mosquitoes that are primarily
responsible for the transmission of dengue fever has risen by approximately 10% since the 1950s
(WHO, 2018b). This increase in range is also anticipated for malaria in regions bordering current endemic
zones, with smaller changes occurring in currently endemic areas. Climate change and increases in
population are also predicted to significantly exacerbate the impact of dams, which provide breeding
sites for mosquitoes, on the spread of malaria, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (Kibret et al., 2016).

Ecological shifts
due to climateinduced changes
in water availability
may cause food
insecurity and
undernutrition

Ecological shifts due to climate-induced changes in water availability may cause food
insecurity and undernutrition. Climate variation and extremes are among the leading
causes of severe food crises, and the cumulative effect is undermining all dimensions
of food security, including availability, access, use and stability. Undernutrition is
anticipated to be one of the greatest threats to health resulting from climate change.
It is projected that 540–590 million people will be undernourished at a warming of
2°C, with the young and the elderly particularly affected. Rising temperatures, floods
and droughts also affect food safety. For example, rising temperatures can increase
the levels of pathogens in food sources (such as ciguatera in fish) and in food, while
flooding increases the risk that pathogens will spread from livestock (WHO, 2018b).

The estimated proportional changes in the numbers of people killed or injured in storm surges and
coastal floods are large and the acute health impacts (e.g. injury and drowning) of inland floods
are predicted to increase by a similar proportion to those affected by undernutrition (WHO, 2018b).
Increases in eutrophication and harmful algae blooms (HABs) caused by warmer water temperatures are
of particular concern. Exposure to cyanotoxins from HABs through drinking water, fish and recreational
activities cause acute or chronic poisoning in humans and animals (CRS, 2018). A recent study indicates
cyanotoxin poisoning outbreaks have become more common over the past three decades (TrevinoGarrison et al., 2015).
When human health is compromised, other components of development are put at risk. For example,
when an adult falls ill, they can neither work or care for others. If it happens to youth, they cannot
attend school and parents may forego working to care for them. Meanwhile, medical bills are likely to
accumulate, burdening household incomes. Households are therefore backsliding economically, and
even facing economic migration (Chapter 8) as a consequence of dealing with the additional health
burden of climate change. The failure to draw connections between water, sanitation and income is
one of several oversights that led to development approaches that ignored financial markets as an
important ally in the global effort to eradicate the water and sanitation crisis (Pories, 2016). The World
Health Organization (WHO) estimates that universal access to safe water and sanitation would result
in US$170 billion of economic benefits each year from reductions in healthcare costs and increased
productivity from reduced illness (WHO, 2012).

5.4

Water supply and sanitation response options
In the face of climate change, meeting the health, nutrition and water targets of the SDGs will require
sectoral but also coordinated and linked interventions (Ringler et al., 2018). Adaptation of water supply
and sanitation services is critical to avert the potential health risks associated with climate change. In
the case of sanitation, the choice of on-site sanitation facilities and wastewater treatment technologies
and the way they are managed can also play a role in mitigation (WHO/DFID, 2009).
Adaptation measures to make water and sanitation systems more climate-resilient can be considered
under six core components of health systems: policy and governance, financing, service delivery,
technologies and infrastructure, workforce, and information systems (including monitoring, surveillance
and research) (WHO, 2015c). Measures such as data collection and monitoring systems, disaster

Potential health and other impacts

Increased average
temperatures

• Accelerated growth, survival, persistence, transmission and
virulence of waterborne pathogens, compounded by reduced
stability of chlorine residuals.

• Increased risks of foodborne and
waterborne diseases from pathogens.

• Increased formation of disinfection by-products.

Increased drought

• Possible increased risk of cancer with longterm exposure to disinfection by-products.

• Increased evapotranspiration and decreased water
availability.

• Impacts similar to those from droughts.

• Lower water availability for washing, cooking and hygiene,
increasing exposure to waterborne contamination.

• Increased burden of foodborne and
waterborne disease.

• Increased concentration of pollutants when conditions are
drier. This is of concern for groundwater sources that are
already of low quality, for example in certain locations in
India and Bangladesh, North and Latin America, and Africa,
where concentrations of arsenic, iron, manganese and
fluoride are often problematic.

• Fluoride: dental and skeletal fluorosis.

• Reduced groundwater tables and surface water flows may
cause wells to dry up, increasing the distances to be travelled
to collect (potentially unsafe) water, and increasing water
source pollution.
• Low rainfall may increase vector breeding sites by slowing
river flows.
• Decreased food security due to lower food production in
the tropics; lower access to food due to reduced supply and
higher prices.

• Arsenic: skin changes (pigmentation
changes, hyperkeratosis), cancer (skin,
bladder, lung), etc.
• Iron and manganese: discoloured water,
unpleasant taste.
• Increased risk of health impacts associated
with malnutrition resulting from the
interaction of diminished food production
and intake in poor regions, and higher rates
of infectious disease.
• Combined effects of undernutrition and
infectious diseases; chronic effects of
stunting and wasting in children.

• Increased dam construction to adapt to more frequent
droughts can intensify transmission and shift patterns of
malaria infection (Kibret et al., 2015).
More extreme
precipitation
events

• Lack of water for hygiene, flood damage to water and
sanitation infrastructure, and contamination of water
sources through overflow.

• Increased risks of food- and waterborne
diseases and of exposure to potentially toxic
chemicals.

• Heavier rainfall events and storm runoff, causing increased
loading of pathogens, chemicals, and suspended sediment in
surface waters.

• Increased or decreased risk of vectorborne
diseases, depending on local ecology.

• Flooding causing overflow and contamination from
sewerage systems, particularly where infrastructure is poor.
• Long-term increases in rainfall cause rising groundwater
levels, which may decrease the efficiency of natural
purification processes.
• Increased surface water may expand breeding sites for
vectors while increased rain may favour vegetation growth
and allow expansion in population of vertebrate hosts.
• Flooding may also force vertebrate hosts into closer contact
with humans.
• Very high rainfall can reduce populations of insect vectors
and intermediate hosts of infectious diseases (e.g.
schistosomiasis) by flushing larvae from their habitat in
pooled water.

• Coastal areas experiencing sea level rise may become
uninhabitable and influence population displacement.
• Sea level rise that increases the salinity of coastal aquifers,
where groundwater recharge is also expected to decrease.

• Liver damage, tumour promoter,

associated with undernutrition.
• Increased risk of water- and vector-borne
diseases linked to untreated wastewater use

• Health impacts resulting from unsafe use
or non-use of sanitation systems (e.g.
physical or mental conditions arising from

Policy and governance

National policies and strategies informed by WASH and health vulnerability assessments to ensure
sustainability of investments (WHO, 2018a). Incorporation of the One Health approach, which addresses
human, animal and ecological determinants of health.

Financing

Utilize risk management approaches to identify the cost of additional climate-related risks and to integrate
these into water and health financing plans as well as water supply and sanitation infrastructure operating
and financing plans (WHO, 2018a).
Financial inclusion activities that provide low-income households with credit and/or insurance can enable
victims of intense climate events to recover from house or crop destruction more easily.

Service delivery

Implementation of climate-informed water and sanitation risk management approaches at the local level,
e.g. climate-resilient water safety planning (see WHO, 2017, table 3, p. 35 for examples of hazards and
control measures) and climate-resilient sanitation safety planning (see WHO, 2016 and 2018b, table 3.6,
p. 54 for sanitation system adaptation options), implemented by service providers and municipalities.
Addressing water scarcity through safe use of wastewater in agriculture and groundwater recharge.

Technologies and infrastructure

Mitigation of emissions from sanitation and wastewater treatment, e.g. emissions from latrines and
wastewater treatment plans (WWTP); potential for energy and biogas recovery.
Strengthen the resilience of health, water and sanitation systems, e.g. climate-resilient WASH in healthcare
facilities, readiness for climate-related admissions, and climate-resilient water and sanitation technologies
(WHO, 2018a).

Workforce

Ensuring the adequate workforce for water and sanitation services and worker awareness. Training and
protections in place to prevent workplace-related illness and injury from climate risks (ILO, 2016; WHO,
2018b).

Information systems (including
monitoring and surveillance)

Ensuring health surveillance and monitoring systems include data on access and use of water and
sanitation services and are analysed with climate data to inform adaption of health programmes and
water and sanitation service delivery (WHO, 2018b).
Strengthen monitoring and surveillance programmes for drinking, irrigation and recreational water,
especially during extreme weather events and water-related disasters (WHO, 2018a).

Research

response and rehabilitation plans, and behaviour change programmes can support effective adaptation.
Improved finance mechanisms for water and sanitation service providers that facilitate the ability of
these entities to build emergency reserves would leave them better prepared to respond to climate
events. Examples of key adaptation and mitigation measures are summarized in Table 5.4. Additional
water sector adaption and mitigation measures are detailed in Chapter 3.
While many of the responsibilities for implementation of adaptation options lie outside health
ministries, the health sector needs to fulfil its core functions within water supply and sanitation service
delivery. One of these functions is to contribute to sector coordination and to ensure that health
protections are included in norms and standards. Another primary function is to incorporate water- and
sanitation-related climate risks into health policies, health surveillance systems and health promotion
activities where water and sanitation are necessary for the primary prevention of illness and for
reducing the use of antimicrobials.

One aspect for which the health sector holds full responsibility is the climate resilience of healthcare
facilities, including climate-resilient water supply and sanitation service within health facilities. The
sector is also responsible for ensuring healthcare facilities’ readiness to handle additional patient loads
associated with extreme events, and to adapt to the slow changes in disease burden associated with
climate change.
To plan and adopt the most cost-effective combination of solutions, it will be critical to develop models
and scenario analysis frameworks that enable a better understanding of the sources of the local disease
burden as well as the possible future changes as a result of climate change to inform climate-resilient and
health-protective management of water resources (Hofstra et al., 2019).

offer scope for both climate adaptation and mitigation though agriculture. It also
provides an agricultural perspective from which to further engage the United Nations
Climate Change Conference in terms of water management.

6.1

Introduction
Climate is a resource for agriculture. Human systems of crop production, livestock husbandry, freshwater
aquaculture and near-shore fisheries have adapted to distributions of temperature and precipitation over
millennia. In this sense, agriculture’s exposure to risks from day-to-day variations in weather and longer-term
patterns of seasonal and interannual shifts in temperature and precipitation are well recognized, not least by
farmers and commodity traders. It is the increasing rate and magnitude of these shifts and the prospects of
further changes within the next 50–100 years that are cause for concern, particularly for the rural poor who
have no alternative to agriculture for maintaining their livelihoods.
Despite the fact that the global food system has generally managed to meet growing demand for calories,
821 million people (or 11% of the global population) remain severely undernourished, and this number is
rising in absolute terms. While the impact of abrupt weather-related shocks is generally acknowledged,
chronic poverty, economic dislocation and market remoteness have made rural producers vulnerable to longterm climatic shifts. Drying trends, elevated night-time temperatures, frost incidence or increases in relative
humidity will have long-term impacts on agro-ecological functions, in addition to short-term weather-related
shocks. This disruption of food production patterns is not always substituted by alternative (imported) supply
at affordable prices, and the systems of food aid distribution are not always able to satisfy demand for basic
calories and nutritional supplements. It is therefore expected that increasing climate variability and weather
extremes will threaten food security, including people’s access to healthy and nutritious diets (FAO/IFAD/
UNICEF/WFP/WHO, 2018).
Under climate change, the specific challenges for agricultural water management are twofold. First, there is
the challenge to adapt existing modes of production to deal with higher incidence of water scarcity (physical
and economic) and water excess (flood protection and drainage). Second, the challenge to respond to the
policy drives to ‘decarbonize’ agriculture through climate mitigation measures that reduce greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions and enhance water availability. The role of agricultural water management is central to
agriculture’s adaptive response, allowing flexible crop production cycles in cash crops and some staple
foods, notably rice. Soil moisture management in rainfed soils is also crucial in maintaining soil structure and
promoting root growth and plant establishment to sequester carbon.
The global scale of these challenges is not trivial. Agriculture, forestry and other land use, termed the AFOLU
‘sector’ by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is estimated to account for 23% of total
anthropogenic GHG emissions for the period 2007–2016 (IPCC, 2019b). Reported agricultural statistics
(FAOSTAT, n.d.) indicate that by 2016, 37% (48.7 million km²) of the total land area (130.1 million km²) was
under some form of agricultural management. This includes cultivated land, permanent crops, pasture and
managed wetlands. The rate at which land use conversion is occurring and the trend in higher-intensity
agricultural inputs on land (inorganic fertilizer in particular) set a high bar for the adoption of sustainable
adaptation measures and effective mitigation measures, which are crucial if the sector is to make a positive
contribution to reaching climate targets.

Agriculture and food security

79

The detrimental environmental outcomes from the current food production system have been raised,
particularly with respect to emissions, biodiversity loss and natural resource depletion, as part of the
so-called ‘planetary boundaries’ (Springmann et al., 2018; Willet et al., 2019). Given these established land
and water limits, global initiatives in the sustainable intensification of agriculture, maintaining levels of
growth in agricultural production while reducing the growth in inputs and emission levels, are already in
evidence under the umbrella term ‘Climate-Smart Agriculture’ (CSA) (Box 6.1).

There are still
2.1 billion poor
people and
767 million
people living in
extreme poverty,
80% of whom
live in rural areas

CSA is a recognized suite of well-informed approaches to land and water management,
soil conservation and agronomic practice that anticipate climatic variability, can sequester
carbon and reduce GHG emissions. In many cases, these are well established conservation
agriculture practices (Corsi, 2019) that can be packaged to retain soil structure, organic
matter and moisture under drier conditions, but they also include agronomic techniques
(including irrigation and drainage) to adjust or extend cropping calendars to adapt to seasonal
and interannual climate shifts. The flexibility offered by irrigation and drainage makes water
management an attractive adaptive response with excellent carbon sequestration for both
temporary and permanent crops. However, this flexibility can come at a cost in terms of
local water resource depletion and water quality deterioration. Nature-based solutions (NBS)
to water scarcity and water quality deterioration also have to be taken into account. These
include landscape restoration as part of agricultural practice (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018).

There are still 2.1 billion poor people and 767 million people living in extreme poverty, 80% of whom live in
rural areas, with the global distribution of poverty highly skewed (95% of rural poor) toward Sub-Saharan
Africa and South/Southeast Asia (World Bank, 2016b). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO) estimates that some 475 million smallholder farms (up to 2 hectares in size) produce
subsistence and cash crops on only 12% of global farmland (FAO, 2015b).
Climate change is expected to increase the incidence of rural poverty. Even small shifts in seasonality
can prompt food insecurity (as food prices rise) and also result in increased incidences of plant, animal
and human disease. The aggregation of such weather-related shocks can then progressively lower rural
incomes and economic growth, severely compromising the rural poor’s access to land, water, forest and
fish resources. With the overall reduction of their primary asset base, the long-term resilience of the rural
poor decreases (FAO, 2019).
The combined impacts of changes in temperature and incidence of extreme weather in tropical zones are
expected to push these already vulnerable populations further into extreme poverty or out of agriculture
altogether. As such, climate change is recognized as an obstacle to ending rural poverty. With 80% of the
impacts of drought absorbed by rural producers, the pressure on local water resources and reliance on
water-lifting technology in particular is expected to increase (FAO, 2019).
It is therefore significant that climate–land interactions and the role of agricultural management in
generating or offsetting GHG emissions are the subject of an IPCC Special Report on climate change and
land (IPCC, 2019b). It is also significant that agricultural water management is now an explicit part of the
climate negotiations, given the commitments made under the Decision 4/CP.23 Koronivia Joint Work on
Agriculture (UNFCCC, 2017) (Box 6.2).

6.2

Climate impacts and the agriculture baseline: sorting out
shocks from trends
The immediate effect of global warming in accelerating the hydrological cycle and raising the evaporative
power of the atmosphere is expected to result in increased demand for water resources, as the agriculture
sector strives to keep pace with growth in demand for production (FAO, 2011b). The range of climate
impacts on agriculture and the implications for agricultural water management have been set out in a
comprehensive typology indicating the relative vulnerability and adaptability across the major agricultural
systems (Table 6.1), including the risk-sensitive areas highlighted in the Prologue. Water management
response options indicate the range of adaptive approaches applicable to each case.

“Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is an approach for developing actions needed to transform and reorient agricultural
systems to effectively support development and ensure food security under climate change. CSA aims to tackle three main
objectives: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes; adapting and building resilience to climate change;
and reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas emissions, where possible.” (FAO, n.d.a).
“CSA is not a set of practices that can be universally applied, but rather an approach that involves different elements
embedded on-farm and beyond the farm and incorporates technologies, policies, institutions and investment.” (FAO, 2017b).
Selected adaptation measures include:
• Alternate wetting and drying of irrigated rice;
• Intercropping to reduce canopy temperatures;
• Climate-smart pest management;
• Index-based risk management tools.
Selected mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions include:
• Solar-powered pumping to reduce petroleum-based energy inputs and related emissions;
• Site-specific nutrient management to reduce inorganic fertilizer input and increase soil organic matter (carbon) 		
retention.
Measures with co-benefits include:
• Conservation agriculture* techniques to increase soil carbon sequestration, retain soil moisture and avoid soil 		
disturbance;
• Soil fertility management to reduce GHG emissions from inorganic fertilizers, to improve water-holding capacity.

*“Conservation agriculture is a farming system that promotes maintenance of a permanent soil cover, minimum soil disturbance (i.e. no tillage, seed drilling)
and diversification of plant species. It enhances biodiversity and natural biological processes above and below the ground surface, thereby contributing to
increased water and nutrient use efficiency and to improved and sustained crop production” (FAO, n.d.b).

Box 6.2 Making agricultural water use visible in the United Nations Climate Change Conferencing process
At the 23rd Conference of the Parties (United Nations Climate Change Conference 2017, COP23), Parties reached
a decision on next steps for agriculture within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC). Known as the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture (KJWA), this landmark decision represents an
important step forward in the negotiations within the UNFCCC related to agriculture and food security.
Parties and stakeholders are invited to work together under this decision to make sure that agricultural
development ensures both increased food security in the face of climate change and a reduction in emissions.
The KJWA will address six topics across the agricultural sectors related to food security and socio-economic
impacts of climate change on soil, livestock, nutrients and water management.
Work under the KJWA will bring water into the negotiations process of the UNFCCC for the first time, since ‘water
management’ in agriculture cannot be done in isolation of other sectors. Therefore, an integrated water resources
management approach will be applied, meaning that ‘other non-agricultural water uses’ will also be reflected in
the discussions.

In general, the impacts of changing temperature distributions can be anticipated and long-term adaptation
approaches adopted on the basis of climate model projections. However, the increased volatility of
precipitation, and rainfall in particular (intensity, duration and frequency), challenges adaptive responses
in some of the most productive agricultural systems. It also impedes attempts to incorporate atmospheric
moisture in General Circulation Models (GCMs). The range of modelled water stress attributed to
agricultural water withdrawals in the IPCC Special Report on land is illustrative of the uncertainty
associated with the various model projections that have been assessed (IPCC, 2019b). Nonetheless,
global warming, combined with increased climatic variability and an accelerated hydrological cycle,
will offer new agro-climatic opportunities (e.g. extended growing seasons) for some, while creating
impediments for others (e.g. prolonged or shifted periods of soil moisture deficit). These shifting patterns
of production are occurring in an economic context that is constrained by narrowing natural resource
options and intersectoral competition for land and water. The structural transformation of agriculture in
general (working populations coming out of agriculture plus uptake of new technology) will also influence
the types and processes of adaptation and the opportunities for GHG mitigation.
The global production of food, fibre and industrial crops continues to grow broadly in line with demand.
Medium-term projections to 2027 for agricultural production and consumption suggest a general
deceleration of growth as demand progressively diminishes (OECD/FAO, 2018). Longer-term projections
to 2050 (FAO, 2017a) point to higher rates of growth in demand for calories in low- and middle-income
countries, together with heightened production risks resulting from incremental changes in climatic
regimes and associated extreme events, particularly in the Middle East (FAO, 2017a). The anticipated
impact of climate change on all aspects of agricultural production are recognized in these macroeconomic projections. IPCC (2014a) and Ray et al. (2015) conclude that up to a third of global crop yield
variability can be explained by climate variation, but it has not proved possible to quantify those impacts
comprehensively through climate modelling. Changes in agricultural water demand also remain difficult
to project. For instance, the 2019 IPCC Assessment on climate and land points to a very wide range in
modelled projections for irrigation water demand, from a current baseline of around 2,500 km3/yr in 2005
to between 2,900 and 9,000 km3/yr by 2100 (IPCC, 2019b).
Anticipated climate forcing of large agri-food systems under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)
scenarios has been examined in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC, 2014a). It suggests that some
shifts between rainfed and irrigated production will be required to accommodate the aggregate impact
of water limitations and CO2 enrichment (Elliot et al., 2014). Further, changes in regional precipitation
patterns impacting agricultural production have been projected to emerge by 2040 for four major crops:
wheat, soya, rice and maize (Rojas et al., 2019). This points to some urgency in the adoption of adaptation
measures with mitigation co-benefits in order to maintain levels of agricultural production.

6.2.1 Agricultural water demand
Irrigation land, which is responsible for 69% of global water withdrawals (AQUASTAT, 2014), is where the
impact of elevated temperatures and aridity will be felt most. Although the current extent of this type of
land (about 3,3 million km2) accounts for only 2.5% of the total land area (Figure 6.1), it does represent
20% of cultivated land and generates some 40% of the global agricultural output (FAOSTAT, n.d.). It is
also where the process of water withdrawal, diversion, application and drainage can produce a set of
long-term environmental externalities, notably aquifer depletion, soil salinization and pollution from runoff
and drainage. Statistical estimates of the area serviced by groundwater are in the order of 1,250,000 km2
(Siebert et al., 2013), most of which is powered by non-renewable energy. This is in addition to the
proliferation of energized pumping for distribution and drainage on surface irrigation schemes.

The use of water by agriculture dominates global water use, but competition from other sectors is
slowing the growth of freshwater allocations to the agriculture sector. The global baseline from aggregate
reported statistics for the year 2010 estimated agricultural withdrawals at 2,769 km3/yr, up from an
estimated 2,300 km3/yr in 1990 (AQUASTAT, 2014) (see Figure 15).
Expansion and intensification of crop production on irrigated land is the most significant driver of
agricultural water demand, while locally, agro-forestry and water storage for livestock and aquaculture
have also impacted basin and catchment water accounts. The Comprehensive Assessment of Water
Management in Agriculture (2007) and the report Managing Systems at Risk (FAO, 2011a) pointed to
mounting evidence of river basin closure and breakdown of large-scale agricultural systems, such as
irrigated deltas and alluvial plains dependent upon groundwater. In the case of irrigated production,
incremental evaporation over and above natural rates has been calculated by Hoogeveen et al. (2015) at
1,268 km3/yr, which indicates global irrigation application efficiencies of around 50% when set against
water withdrawals of 2,769 km3/yr. This difference between withdrawals from surface and groundwater
and the volumes consumed through beneficial evaporation (transpiration, cooling and weed suppression)
is either recycled through return flows or aquifer recharge, or lost to non-beneficial evaporation from
canals and off-line storage or the drained margins of irrigation schemes. While the management of rainfed
land (including pasture) has generally neutral effects on evaporation processes, the impact on runoff and
direct recharge processes can be significant if soil structure is lost through tillage and compaction, losing
infiltration and soil moisture-holding capacity.
Annual growth rates of areas equipped for irrigation have been slowing, as indicated by agricultural
statistics up to 2016 (Seibert et al., 2015; FAO, 2017a). Still, the growth is positive and within this
expanding area, the intensification of water consumption is apparent as cropping intensities increase and
irrigation technology, including pressurized drip and sprinkler methods, are adopted where they suit field
crops and cropping conditions. However, assumptions that the adoption of irrigation technology will result
in reduced water withdrawals appear to be ill-founded. Evidence from national initiatives intended to ‘save’
water through the introduction of pressurized irrigation suggests that the effect is quite the reverse and
that adoption of irrigation technology tends to expand irrigated areas and increase the rate of water
consumption (Perry et al., 2009; Lopez-Gunn et al., 2012; Scott et al., 2014; Molle and Tanouti, 2017;
Grafton and Wheeler, 2018). This growth in agricultural water withdrawals in relation to advanced irrigation
technologies has been apparent in river basin water accounts and particularly in the depletion of both
confined and unconfined aquifer storage (Molle and Wester, 2009).

The role of
groundwater
in agriculture
and rural
development
is often
underestimated

The role of groundwater in agriculture and rural development is often underestimated
(IAH, 2019) and economic competition for high-quality groundwater from other sectors,
notably industry and municipal supplies, is impacting adjacent rural areas (Flörke et al.,
2018), where millions of smallholders rely on access to shallow groundwater circulation
to buffer for dry-season recessions and extended periods of drought. The extent of
shallow and deep groundwater extraction structures, together with small dam structures
for irrigation, aquaculture and stock watering purposes, is not systematically recorded
at subnational levels, making the estimate of areas equipped for irrigation and water
withdrawals from areas that are actually irrigated subject to a degree of uncertainty
(Siebert, et al., 2015).

The water footprint of livestock is not just limited to the consumptive evapotranspiration on grazing land,
but now involves extensive systems of water supply for watering and cooling of live animals as well as
irrigation water for production of fodder and imported protein concentrate (notably soya) or grain (poultry
feed) (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2012; Ray et al., 2015). The growth projections in meat production to 2030
are remarkable – a 77% increase in beef, pork, poultry and sheep is projected for developing countries
and a 23% increase from 2015–2017 levels for developed countries (FAO, 2017a). Non-ruminants (pigs
and poultry) are expected to see the highest growth rates. Given this expected growth, the extent of
grazing land and its sensitivity to drought are important, since feed substitutes (soya and cereals) are
predominantly rainfed and are likely to be impacted, unless production is buffered by irrigation. The feedlot
model of zero grazing with irrigated legumes and grasses is employed both in in the Middle East and the
United States of America (USA), but also gaining broader hold in semi-arid and temperate climates where
pasture would otherwise be damaged under dry and waterlogged conditions. As consumption of animal
86

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

protein and dairy products drives a growing livestock population (Gerber et al., 2013; FAO, 2017a), the
production of feed/forage/crop residues (in both rainfed and irrigated systems) plus direct consumption
of surface and groundwater for livestock watering and cooling is resulting in a continued growth of water
withdrawals by the animal husbandry sector.
Production of inland capture fisheries is reported at nearly 12 million tonnes (FAO, 2018c) with the
majority of production coming from Africa, Asia and China (FAO, 2018d) as a mix of lake, river, wetland and
aquaculture sources. Inland fisheries can benefit from nutrient enrichment derived from agricultural runoff,
but they are also extremely sensitive to eutrophication, pollution, habitat degradation and interruption of
water flows (FAO, 2018d). Inland capture fisheries as well as freshwater aquaculture systems (including
rice-fish systems) are increasingly stressed by pollution loads and the hydraulic management of inland
waterways and water bodies, including dams and reservoirs that are created for irrigation systems,
hydropower engines, as well as agricultural water demands and runoff. In all, combinations of reduced
flow, higher concentrations of pollutants and higher temperatures have significant impacts on fish
mortality (FAO, 2018d). This is a concern since freshwater ecosystems have relatively low buffering
capacity compared with marine ecosystems, and are therefore comparatively sensitive to climate-related
shocks (FAO, 2018d).
Biofuel production (ethanol and biodiesel) is estimated to have only a small (1.7%) impact on agricultural
water withdrawals (De Fraiture et al., 2008) since most sugarcane feedstock is rainfed. Growth projections
are also modest (OECD/FAO, 2019), given the effect of current blending mandates in the main producing
countries and the depressed crude oil prices globally. The irrigation of biofuels (notably from sugarcane
and sugar beet) need careful water and energy accounting to establish net technical benefits in offsetting
fossil fuel consumption and related emissions (see Box 9.1).
As agricultural productivity has increased (relative to both land and water), crop selection and cropping
calendars have become finely tuned to relatively stable meteorological conditions. Where high-value crop
production is limited by temperature and aridity, precision production is taken ‘indoors’ to minimize the
effect of climatic variability. Such irrigated areas under shade netting, plastic mulch and greenhouses
are expanding, and the proliferation in the Mediterranean and North China is such that disposal of
plastic and plastic waste residue in soils is now producing a large environmental externality (Gao et al.,
2019). Adaptation to higher temperatures is also influencing all forms of livestock production, with
intensive production being taken ‘indoors’ and driving demand for irrigated fodder and feed cereals, while
concentrating point demand for energy and water supply as well as point sources of pollution from animal
waste (Gerber et al., 2013).

6.3

The role of agricultural water management in adaptation
6.3.1 Scope for adaptation
Under the umbrella of CSA, a range of adaptive approaches and technologies are being promoted to
maintain levels of agricultural production as warming occurs and precipitation patterns change (Box 6.1).
The scope for adaptation in rainfed agriculture is determined largely by the ability of crop varieties to
cope with shifts in temperature and to manage soil water deficits. Conditioning of soils to optimize
soil moisture retention may include many conservation-agricultural techniques, including no-tillage and
surface mulching with crop residues, thereby temporarily raising soil organic carbon. Where root crops are
grown in temperate latitudes, the uptake of plastic mulching has become commonplace to protect early
crops from frost and retain soil moisture by inhibiting evaporative loss to the atmosphere. Plant breeding
(for drought tolerance, lodging inhibition), cropping calendar (phenological) adjustments, nutrient targeting
and specific plant protection/integrated pest management are additional elements of CSA that can be
applied. Certainly, for rainfed agriculture, the climate risks remain. No matter how much land and soil
preparation is undertaken, if rainfall is inadequate to maintain acceptable soil moisture deficits across the
growing season, crops will fail and the chances of the initiative being repeated will be small. This points to
the importance of communicating seasonal and daily forecasts to the smallholders who are making the
direct investment in land preparation, improved seed varieties and fertilizer.

Agriculture and food security

87

Irrigation allows cropping calendars to be rescheduled and intensified, thus providing a key adaptation
mechanism for land that previously relied solely on precipitation (i.e. rainfed) (Box 6.3). Adaptation here
may simply be the acceleration of planned performance enhancements (modernization of both hardware
and software) to improve the efficiency of water delivery and drainage services. These are the no-regrets
options detailed in the irrigation and drainage literature (e.g. FAO, 2011b; De Vries et al., 2017), which can
include building in system redundancy to protect against flood damage and enhance recharge and return
flows. In-field adaptation to higher temperatures and evaporation is limited to either net shading or the
introduction of planted shade (including intercropping or agroforestry).

6.3.2 Practical agricultural water management responses that can be taken to scale
The water-related elements of CSA have been elaborated into a set of land and water management
techniques that conserve soil moisture content over the growing season and can be implemented at local
scale as a package of climate-informed measures (Figure 6.2) (Aggarwal et al., 2018). Precision irrigation
under many forms of climate control (shade netting, plastic mulching and greenhouses) and the deliberate
use of deficit irrigation to improve the quality of horticultural products are widely practiced. Uptake of
solar power to substitute diesel or petrol-based pumping is now occurring at scale, particularly when
incentivized through subsidies (Shah et al., 2018). Many locally applicable agronomic practices that have
been standardized for the prevailing climate can simply ‘tweaked’ or rescheduled as a reaction to higher
quality and frequency of agrometeorological information.

What are the shifts in approach that can sharpen these adaptive responses? One key area where water
resource management and agrometeorology can progress is through the development of operational
information products that can be disseminated at scale and linked to field-level monitoring by farmers
themselves. These include the following:
• Seasonal climate forecasts for upcoming months and even years are now widely available (WMO,
2016). Timely, actionable and reliable climate forecasts can play a crucial role in both short-term and
long-term decision-making for farmers. The choice of planting dates and seasonal cropping calendars
for high-yielding crop varieties offers a level of precision adjustment in planning the most weatherdependent economic sector (CIE, 2014).

Box 6.3 Potential of deficit and supplemental irrigation under climate variability in a semi-arid area: a savannah
region in Togo
In the context of a growing population in West Africa and frequent yield losses due to erratic rainfall, it is necessary
to improve stability and productivity of agricultural production systems, for instance by introducing and assessing the
potential of alternative irrigation strategies that may be applicable in this region. For this purpose, a set of irrigation
management strategies, ranging from no irrigation (NI) to controlled deficit irrigation (CDI) and full irrigation (FI), were
evaluated in a dry savannah of Togo. The results show high variability in rainfall during the wet season, which leads to
considerable variability in the expected yield for rainfed conditions (NI). This variability was significantly reduced when
supplementary irrigation was introduced to top up rainfall shortfalls at critical points in the plant development, requiring
a reasonably low water demand of about 150 mm. For the dry season, it was shown that both irrigation management
strategies (CDI and FI) increased yield potential for the local maize varieties with up to 4.84 tonnes/ha and decreased
the variability of the expected yield at the same time. However, even with CDI management, more than 400 mm of water
would be required to introduce irrigation during the dry season in northern Togo. Substantial rainwater harvesting and
irrigation infrastructure would thus be needed to introduce full irrigation in the dry season, which points to the input cost
risk in trying to bridge rainfall shortfalls.

• Near-real-time weather information is now becoming readily accessible, allowing farmers to make
decisions over crop protection (damaging rainfall, frost, disease) and crop insurance cover. These
types of services are being extended where mobile telephone networks extend into rural areas (Asia
and Southeast Asia particularly).
• At field level, in-situ soil moisture monitoring technology is advancing with the deployment of lowcost electromagnetic sensors and in combination with high-resolution remote sensing techniques
(Manfreda et al., 2018). While current technology may be only applicable to high-value precision
agriculture or research projects, the deployment of real-time soil moisture monitoring to schedule
irrigation is expected to come down in cost.
• The integration of operational water accounting into CSA has already helped local agriculture water
budgeting to be linked to basin-level hydrology and recharge regimes. But a linkage to agronomy
programmes such as integrated pest management, vermiculture and rice intensification at field scale
is essential if water management is to prove effective at scale. Evidence from related initiatives
have indicated willingness of farmers to use improved agrometeorological services/information
and be involved in the gathering of local agrometeorological data. More elaborate water accounting
at irrigation system and sub-basin level, assisted by periodic satellite overpasses, is making the
assessment of consumptive use and irrigation performance possible, together with the regulation of
water use rights. The FAO WaPOR portal10 and the Water Accounting+11 approach of the International
Water Management Institute (IWMI) have proved effective tools. Seasonal comparisons are already
assisting national governments with adjustments of water use policies.
• Investment planning in agricultural water management is now much more likely to assess climate
risks. In particular, methods of decision-making are being adopted as a means to manage risk from
the bottom up by assessing the ‘breaking points’, in particular agricultural systems reliant upon water
infrastructure (World Bank, 2016b).
Beyond the generation of relevant information and software/hardware adjustments in existing irrigation
schemes, the use of saline water and wastewater, treated to appropriate levels, is being deployed as
agronomic techniques and regulatory provisions permit (see Chapter 3). While systems of desalination
are energy-intensive, lower marginal costs have triggered use in irrigation where no freshwater alternative
exists and markets for early-season horticulture products are favourable. The use of wastewater
technology packages is seeing broad application (FAO, 2010) where use can comply with biosafety
regulation, such as limiting use to irrigated fodder (see Chapter 5). In addition, partially treated wastewater
reuse in agriculture augments supply in otherwise water-scarce areas and also delivers plant nutrients.

All adaptation processes involve hydro-environmental and economic trade-offs. For example, the depletion
of groundwater storage and degradation of water quality from return flows is becoming progressively
concentrated on irrigated land (Böhlke, 2002; FAO/IWMI 2018). There is also concern for the future of
marginal producers, particularly smallholders in semi-arid zones, where capital resources and access
to market-based solutions such as crop insurance are limited. The use of traditional rainfall-harvesting
techniques and aquifer recharge enhancement, including sand dams, have applications in both rural water
supply and the development of irrigated production. Such interventions in remote locations are generally
labour-intensive and thus may suit local job creation schemes (ILO, 2019). These techniques, when
implemented in combination with soil conservation measures through enhanced water management, can
extend soil moisture availability to cover critical periods of crop development (e.g. flowering). However,
without access to local aquifers that do not drain during dry-season recessions, these measures are still
inherently risky if annual rainfall does not allow replenishment.
Adaptation opportunities are scale-dependent and it is important to distinguish between production
systems characterized by large-scale, commercial producers in specific food and fodder sectors, as
opposed to millions of diverse smallholders with highly distributed and variable access to water. The
necessary investment costs may be zero in many cases, such as for adjustments to the cropping calendar.
In other cases, such as wholesale protection of irrigation systems to deal with more extreme flood events,
investments in additional water control infrastructure can be significant. How the incremental cost of
adaptation is financed through individual farmer investment, state subsidy or capital expenditure in rural
development is a policy matter that needs to be conformable with technical interventions. From a water
perspective, the central concern is whether that level of investment reduces the water resource risk to
agricultural producers and all the users of environmental services related to water in the long term.

6.4

Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, forestry and
other land use
The IPCC Summary for Policy Makers notes: “Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) activities
accounted for around 13% of CO2 , 44% of methane (CH4), and 82% of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions
from human activities globally during 2007–2016, representing 23% (12.0 +/- 3.0 GtCO2e/yr) of total net
anthropogenic emissions of GHGs (medium confidence)” (IPCC, 2019b, p. 7).
The relative share of agriculture’s GHG emissions has dropped from an estimated 30% at the end of the
20th century to about 20–25% in 2010, largely due to high increases in emissions from the energy sector
(FAO, 2017a). The breakdown of emissions from the AFOLU ‘sector’ is presented in Figure 6.3. Biomass
growth in forested areas removes GHG from the atmosphere and makes a net positive contribution of
around 2 Gt/yr to carbon sequestration, therefore showing as a negative emission in Figure 6.3. However,
the removal of GHG by forested land is estimated to have fallen from some 2.8 Gt/yr in the 1990s to
1.8 Gt/yr by 2014, as burning and conversion of forested land for grazing, palm oil and grain staples has
accelerated (FAO, 2016a).
Agriculture (excluding forestry and land use) is estimated to make a net contribution of ~6.2 GtCO2e/yr,
accounting for between 10 and 12% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions, which is estimated at around
51 GtCO2e/yr (IPCC, 2019b). Nonetheless, net agricultural emissions are expected to grow further. Under
plausible development pathways, agriculture is only expected to reach some 21–40% of the assumed
reduction of ~1 GtCO2e/yr by 2030 to reach the Paris Agreement target (2°C above pre-industrial levels) by
2030 (Wollenberg et al., 2016). Figure 6.4 points to the significance of enteric fermentation from livestock
as a source of methane in GHG emissions (Gerber et al., 2013). The patterns of GHGs from global
livestock chains show clear differences between production activities and products.
The risks of draining natural wetlands and wetland forests to convert to dry-foot crops or palm plantations
have been evident. The release of carbon stored in wetland peat accumulations in Southeast Asia as a
result of deliberate fires to clear land for plantation development has been confirmed by recent research

(Wiggins et al., 2018). High-resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) mapping has pointed to the
influence of drainage in exposing peat soils to the risk of combustion (Konecny et al., 2016). However, the
release of carbon from peat combustion can also occur on drained organic soils in temperate latitudes.
Drainage management is therefore an area that should not be ignored, particularly if the productivity of
wetlands and wetland forests is also taken into account.

6.5

The role of agricultural water management in mitigation
6.5.1 Scope for mitigation
Agriculture has two main avenues for mitigation of GHGs: carbon sequestration through biomass
accumulation above and below the ground, and emission reduction through land and water management,
including adoption of renewable energy inputs such as solar pumping. Agronomic practice to mitigate
the emission of GHGs is linked primarily to afforestation and drainage control of organic soils that might
otherwise decompose or even combust if drained extensively and cleared by burning. Both interventions
have direct consequences for water management.
The largest mitigation potential from forestry is expected from reducing emissions attributable to
deforestation and forest degradation. More than 90% of national REDD+ results (United Nations
Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing
Countries) reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) come from
reduced deforestation (FAO, 2016a). In the long term, progressive carbon sequestration from afforestation
and reforestation is expected to maintain a similar level of mitigation (Griscom et al., 2017).

However, in terms of equivalent tonnes of CO2, the largest contribution to agricultural GHG emissions is
made by the release of livestock methane through enteric fermentation and manure deposited on pasture
– some 3.5 Gt CO2e/yr (see Figure 6.3). It might not be immediately apparent that extensive rainfed
pasture constitutes a problem from a water management perspective.
Trends in zero grazing of livestock, particularly in the Middle East and the Midwest of the USA, are already
resulting in the concentration of water demand in fewer locations, straining local and regional aquifer
systems, notably groundwater, for the production of fodder and the watering/cooling of livestock (Shah,
2009; Alqaisi et al., 2010; Dieter et al., 2018).
The extent of cultivated land in the rainfed subsector, comprising 11 million km2 under temporary rainfed
crops and 33 million km2 under permanent meadows and pastures (FAOSTAT, n.d.), presents a prime
opportunity for improved soil management to retain soil moisture and promote root growth, thereby
making net additions to the soil carbon pool (effectively sequestering carbon). However, the scope to
make positive net reductions will be limited by the availability of soil moisture to establish a store of year-

92

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

round soil organic material under cropped regimes and sufficient soil moisture and shallow groundwater to
establish woody vegetation. Irrigation and water harvesting in dryland areas already contributes to carbon
sequestration on land that would otherwise be barren and depleted of organic carbon through desiccation
and wind erosion. The extension of irrigated production in drylands can be taken as a future contribution to
carbon sequestration but is extremely limited by long-term availability of freshwater.

6.5.2 Taking practical agricultural water management solutions for mitigation to scale
The functional links between soil organic matter and soil moisture provide the main area for mitigation
opportunities. Conservation agriculture techniques and their regional variants are being promoted on the
basis of a no-regrets approach to improve productivity as much as reduce GHG emissions (FAO, 2016b).
However, the economic feasibility of such measures has to be judged carefully. Scaling of investment and
application of some techniques such as no-tillage and seed drilling is not possible on all soils. For example,
the initial state of soil health in the marginal/skeletal soils most affected by aridity may not be amenable
to substantial improvement without high levels of nutrients and imported organic material together with
periodic irrigation.
Widespread adoption of conservation agriculture is dependent upon the type of crop being grown and the
availability of seed drills, harvesting mechanization and the availability of residue biomass for mulching.
Real yield increases are then dependent upon the availability of improved seed varieties. Lastly, the
increased labour inputs or labour substitution through farm mechanization and changes in cultivation
practice have to be available and affordable. Underpinning such adoption is the role of extension agents,
input providers, farmer field schools and integrated pest management practitioners.
Specific agroforestry and agronomic practice targeted at carbon sequestration and emission reduction can
be grouped into five main types:
• Agroforestry, which exists in multiple forms, from productive trees for fruit products, to native trees for
wind breaks and shade, to extensive plantations for energy feedstock. Agroforestry can have positive
impacts on soil water infiltration, soil water storage, groundwater recharge, runoff and erosion control,
soil nutrient cycling, and biodiversity (FAO, 2018e). In pure water budget terms, the conversion of
cultivated land or grassland to afforested land will increase consumptive use, particularly if high growth
rates are achieved (Hofer and Messerli, 2006; Pugh et al., 2019). However, the climatic context must also
be taken into account and in temperate zones where forests attract high levels of occult precipitation
and bind upland soils, forested catchments may be promoted/protected as a mitigation measure, since
they can also sustain higher levels of baseflow for urban water supply (Ellison et al., 2017).
• Treatment of degraded dryland soils through active drainage management (contour bunds, tree pits,
etc.) and uptake of no-tillage systems to reduce release of sediment and nutrients have been effective
in bringing about temporary increases in soil organic carbon. Such treatment at scale can also produce
a positive effect downstream by attenuating and diffusing small flood peaks. The key is in maintaining
soil moisture deficits at tolerable levels for plant growth and improving soil structure and hydraulic
conductivity to increase infiltration rates, promote deep percolation and direct recharge to aquifers.
• ‘Mild’ alternate wet–dry cultivation of rice has been shown to reduce methane emissions, maintain
yields and potentially reduce water demand by up to 24% when compared with continuous flooding
(Corrijo et al., 2017). Other co-benefits can include reductions in pumping costs and lower arsenic
concentrations in the grain. However, this has to be set against increased emissions of N2O from
periodically dry soil surfaces, a reduced rate of nitrogen being forced into the root zone (as a result
of submergence), loss of aquaculture and related ecosystem functions, and the reduction in weed
suppression and groundwater recharge associated with continuous flooding.
• Afforestation to sequester carbon may have advantages since regrowth appears to have higher
sequestration potential compared with mature forest cover (Pugh et al., 2019). Again, there are tradeoffs in river basins where upstream forest regrowth will increase water consumption in transpiration
and can reduce downstream flows. There is also the additional consideration that in semi-arid zones
where water tables are moderately deep, additional water inputs may be required to initiate growth.
More moderate carbon sequestration through the adoption of agroforestry techniques may be viable
where shade is beneficial to field or perennial crops.

Agriculture and food security

93

• Emerging solar pumping technologies (and related energy contributions to supply grids) and their
application to farm production can play an important role in mitigating GHG emissions (Box 6.4).
Supplying power and energy is critical to the development of rural economies, and the degree of this
dependence is indicated by the level of energy subsidies to highly productive groundwater-reliant areas
in India, which has resulted in bankrupt power supply utilities (Shah, 2009). Despite higher capital
outlay costs compared with diesel equivalents, the prices of solar photovoltaic system are dropping
and evidence of large-scale uptake has started to emerge (Zou et al., 2013). However, in terms of water
management, the location of solar-powered pumping may prove critical. In zones with shallow water
tables (e.g. East Ganges, parts of Indus basin), the combined benefit of drainage/salinity control and
irrigation water supply may need to be offset against the hazards of mobilizing natural groundwater,
notably the mobilization of arsenic from tainted aquifers. Also, the wholesale substitution of the
energy source to boreholes for farmers currently enjoying subsidized thermal power will not always
be technically or financially viable, particularly if powering deep borehole pumps requires three-phase
power supply. If not adequately managed and regulated, such technology also comes with the risk of
supporting unsustainable water use (FAO/GIZ, 2018).

6.6

Conclusions
The agricultural ‘responses’ to a changing climate will be led by climate information applied at appropriate
scales in ways that appeal to different farming communities. In this sense, adaptation and mitigation
measures will be information-rich rather than hardware-intensive.
Focusing only on the water variable in agriculture will not necessarily produce desired results in agricultural
productivity. Broader consideration of water in relation to other inputs, through a package of climate-smart
measures, is necessary. The adjustments need to match the scale of the hydrological system if they are to
produce positive outcomes in agricultural system performance (in relation to climate variability) and lead to
net reductions in GHG emissions.

Box 6.4

Uptake of solar pumping

Following various successes of solar-based irrigation projects (SIPs) in Africa and Asia, the investment in solar
technology to transform agricultural development is rapidly expanding, providing a cost-effective and sustainable
energy source to secure food production and sustain livelihoods (FAO/GIZ, 2018). Ensuring environmentally sustainable
SIP development, both on and off the grid, will require stronger regulatory frameworks and policies, given the current
near-zero cost of water lifting (Closas and Rap, 2017). In India, from just around 18,000 in 2014–2015, SIPs have
increased to nearly 200,000 in recent years, an annual growth rate of 68%. The piloted Solar Power as a Remunerative
Crop (SPaRC) model in Gujarat provides smallholder farmers with a remunerative incentive (US$109.7/MWh) to sell
solar energy to the grid in an attempt to reduce groundwater abstraction for irrigation (Shah et al., 2018). The Indian
Government has incorporated the model in its US$21 billion KUSUM (Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan –
Farmer Energy Security and Development Mission) scheme, which aims at installing two million SIPs.
Several government and donor initiatives are promoting SIPs through various subsidy modalities with the aim of
reaching the poor. Examples are the support for 50,000 SIPs by 2025 under a 50% subsidy and 30% loan modality
in Bangladesh (Verma et al., 2018), finance modalities adapted to female land ownership to support the growing
feminization in agriculture in Nepal (Mukherji et al., 2017), and collective solar modalities to support landless and
marginalized farmers in India (Sugden et al., 2015).
Solar potential has not gone unnoticed in Africa. In Morocco, Crédit Agricole combines subsidies for solar energy with
drip irrigation, in a programme of less than US$220 million, to promote sustainable water use. The scaling of off-grid
solutions in Sub-Saharan Africa has seen a slower pace compared to other regions, despite its huge potential and
successful pilots (FAO/GIZ, 2018; Otoo et al., 2018). In Ethiopia, for example, solar photovoltaic pumps for irrigation
could transform 18% of the rainfed agricultural land (Schmitter et al., 2018). Identified barriers for solar scaling in SubSaharan Africa are related to weak supply chains, high import taxes and lack of financial mechanisms (FAO/GIZ, 2018).

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

The signals from general circulation models indicate that despite the elevated CO2 fertilization boost
to yields, many productive farming systems in temperate and semi-arid zones will be operating at agroclimatic margins in terms of heat and moisture. This will impact farmers who may have to invest in
measures to adapt or exit agriculture and find alternative sources of livelihoods as a result of water
scarcity. Sustainable water management will be the primary adaptation measure where shifts in seasonal
rainfall patterns and higher temperatures make rainfed agriculture too unreliable to meet levels of demand
for food staples. As a result, the pressure on the freshwater resource base is expected to intensify and
agronomy is expected to become more productive with respect to water as the impacts of aridity and
water scarcity are felt by producers. Widespread adoption of conservation agriculture approaches on
rainfed land is expected to be a longer-term response that reduces inputs, sequesters carbon, and favours
soil moisture retention and percolation in order to enhance freshwater storage and water quality.
To be climate-smart, a first-order requirement is the extension of agrometeorological services and
information to farmers who would otherwise have no reliable access. Adjustments in local and basin
agricultural water management will be led by software: climate information tools suited to specific
sets of producers. In many cases, efforts will be needed to counteract gender bias and ensure that
female farmers have equal access. Where withdrawals are intensifying, operational (field-based) water
accounting will complement these services in order to prepare annual crop plans and manage surface
and groundwater flows/storage/allocation. Adoption of technology packages and extension/farmer field
school support have to yield positive returns to farmers, bearing in mind that the institutional context is
highly variable and users may be indifferent to guidance if benefits are not demonstrable or sustained. To
take CSA to scale, a set of technical water policy messages can be summarized at respective levels.
At national/international levels:
• Promote agro-climate-based tools to anticipate increased climate risks (rainfall intensity, duration and
frequency, as well as diurnal temperature range, humidity and evaporative power);
• Extend incentives linked to adaptation and mitigation practices, including weather-related crop
insurance;
• Enhance water governance measures that anticipate allocation under scarcity; and
• Overcome institutional/social rigidity with respect to adaptation and mitigation measures.
At basin levels:
• Declare accurate operational agricultural water accounts to place against other sectoral claims and
identify the scope for adjustment of baseflow management to sustain instream benefits (including
fisheries and recharge) under climate variability; and
• Effect transition from conjunctive use to conjunctive management in order to keep groundwater
systems in play.
At irrigated-system levels:
• Implement climate-proof infrastructure and field production systems, including phasing in of irrigation
and drainage system redundancy on the basis of no-regrets measures; and
• Enhance irrigation management capacities of operational staff and user groups through access to
climate service and CSA practices.
At farmer levels:
• Deploy packages of CSA and irrigation through socially inclusive farmer field school approaches; and
• Carefully assess labour and mechanization costs, including monitoring and pumping/pressurizing
technologies, and link to term (fixed period) finance mechanisms.
At producer organization levels:
• Advocate models for sustainable intensification and emissions reduction within specific crop sectors.

This chapter identifies the risks, challenges and opportunities for water-related
adaptation, mitigation and resilience to climate change for energy and industry.

7.1

Context
The industry and energy sectors prefer to operate in an atmosphere of certainty – and though climate
change is certain, its impacts on water are particularly uncertain. Given that industry (including the energy
sector for thermoelectric and nuclear power plant cooling) withdraws 19% of the world’s freshwater
resources (AQUASTAT, n.d.), and more recently energy alone was estimated as taking about 10% (IEA,
2016), the pressure of this unpredictability is a serious challenge and one that is mounting as emissions of
greenhouse gases (GHGs) are increasing.
Moreover, the industry and energy sectors’ share in global water demand (Table 7.1) has been projected
to grow to 24% by 2050, with the biggest absolute increases in Asia and Europe (mainly for industry), and
North America being the only region predicted to show a decrease (Burek et al., 2016). Projections by the
International Energy Agency (IEA) using their main scenario (New Policies)12 anticipate that global water
withdrawals by the energy sector will increase by less than 2% by 2040, but consumption will increase by
nearly 60% (IEA, 2016). In water-stressed areas this will contribute to increasing scarcity, as less water will
be returned to the hydrological cycle for other sectors to use.

Challenges and risks
According to the World Economic Forum, since 2014 extreme weather events have been the first or
second global risk in terms of likelihood, and water crises have been in the top five in terms of impact
(WEF, 2019). Water-related shocks in emerging economies have already led to massive insurance
losses, supply chain failures and price shocks with global implications. Failure to address these risks
could lead to a dramatic drop in business investment, with stark consequences for enterprise and for
development (IIASA, n.d.). Water challenges and business risks will become apparent for the energy
and industry sectors, and will be generally similar for both. The four top water risk drivers for companies
recently reported are water scarcity, flooding, drought and water stress (CDP, 2017a).

7.2.1 Water Challenges
Water Stress: The reliability of water supply in terms of availability (quantity), quality as affected
by pollution, and accessibility (allocation, competition and conflict) are key to the continued and
successful functioning of business (Figure 7.1). These factors are complicated by the uncertainty
and unpredictability, as well as the increasing variability, of both surface water replenishment and
groundwater recharge as a result of climate change. A simplification indicates that dry areas will get
drier and it is in these subtropical regions that water stress, expressed through physical drought, will
likely be felt the most severely. This will have impacts on the energy generation and industry sectors,
including their supply chains, as heavy water users.

Energy generation is potentially impacted by all types of water stressors (Table 7.2) (IEA, 2012). For
example, river and water levels can fall below intakes at thermal stations and hydropower facilities,
stopping operations. Moreover, increased water temperatures affect cooling, lowering thermal
efficiency which reduces or, if exceeding critical thresholds, even halts power output. The exposures
exist in many different geographic areas and for many forms of energy production. Even with good
overall water availability, seasonal variations can be troublesome, and countries with a lot of thermal
generation capacity using once-through cooling and/or hydropower are especially susceptible. For
electricity generation on a global scale, streamflow and temperature changes will vary as a result of
climate change: accounting for time and climate factors, climate change could produce a reduction in
hydropower in the 2050s of 1.2 to 3.6%, especially in Australia and South America, and a 7 to 12% in

Location (Year)

Power generation

Kenya (2017)

The drought that began in 2017 has caused repeated power shortages and higher electricity prices.

USA (2016)

The Hoover Dam’s generating capacity was reduced to 30% due to drought.

Brazil (2016)

Drought affected hydroelectric power producers such as the Itaipu Dam, forcing the country to turn to more
expensive and polluting thermoelectric plants.

Ghana (2016)

The Akosombo Dam, the country’s main source of energy, operated at minimum capacity due to drought.

India (2013–2016)

Water shortages caused shutdowns in 14 of India’s 20 largest thermal utilities, costing the companies
US$1.4 billion. In 2016, 14 Terawatt-hours of potential thermal power generation were lost – equal to the
annual electricity demand of Sri Lanka.

India (2012)

A delayed monsoon raised electricity demand (for pumping groundwater for irrigation) and reduced
hydropower generation, contributing to blackouts lasting two days and affecting over 600 million people.

Romania (2011)

State-owned hydropower producer Hidroelectrica cut production by 30% due to depleted reservoirs caused by
a prolonged drought.

China (2011)

Drought limited hydropower generation along the Yangtze River, contributing to higher coal demand (and
prices) and forcing some provinces to implement strict energy efficiency measures and electricity rationing.
In Yunnan Province, extreme drought cut hydropower output by half and forced 1 000 dams to suspend
operations.

Viet Nam, Philippines
(2010)

The El Niño weather phenomenon caused a drought that lasted several months, reducing hydropower
generation and causing electricity shortages.

Southeast USA (2007)

During a drought, the Tennessee Valley Authority curtailed hydroelectric power generation to conserve water
and reduced output from nuclear and fossil fuel-based plants.

Midwest USA (2006)

A heat wave forced nuclear plants to reduce their output because of the high water temperature of the
Mississippi River.

France (2003)

An extended heat wave forced electricity company Électricité de France (EdF) to curtail nuclear power output
equivalent to the loss of 4–5 reactors, costing an estimated €300 million to import electricity.
Primary energy production

China (2008)

Dozens of planned coal-to-liquid (CTL) projects were abandoned, due in part to concerns that they would place
heavy burdens on scarce water resources.

Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, Public concern about the potential environmental impacts of unconventional gas production (including on

Extreme events: Flooding and drought are water-related effects exacerbated in time and space by
climate change. They are increasingly frequent and intense, with consequently more pressure on power
generation and industry. For instance, the 2011 flooding in Thailand affected 800 facilities employing
450,000 workers and caused a global disruption in the supply of disc drives (Winn, 2011). Moreover,
slow onset disasters such as sea level rise will affect extensive coastal areas where energy utilities and
industry are commonly located.

7.2.2 Business risks
The water-related effects of climate change generate risks to business and power generation from several
perspectives.13 Climate change impacts (many related to water) are illustrated for the mining and metals
sector in Figure 7.2, where three levels of broadening risk are shown. The inner level is site-specific primary
impacts to core operations; the next level includes risks that affect the value chain, such as the ones
regarding raw materials; the outer level shows third-party impacts, including energy supply (ICMM, 2013).
Climate change can also be a ‘threat multiplier’ for business risks. For instance, water scarcity connects
and affects energy, industry and food. Businesses will face difficulty in addressing and managing all these
facets. Indeed, the majority of risk for industry and power generation originates outside the fence line and
is beyond their sole control and influence (Table 7.3).
Operational risks: Water stress can stop manufacturing or energy generation, purely through a lack of
water. Impacts will also carry into operational aspects, affecting the supply of raw materials, disrupting
supply chains, and causing damage to facilities, equipment, and also infrastructure. This in turn could
interrupt transport and affect energy (e.g. transmission lines and pipelines) and communications.
The results may be reflected in human terms with unsafe working conditions, health effects, more
absenteeism and lower productivity. Moreover, major climate change may produce fast changes in
consumer demand, such as for energy. To address that increased demand, usually water for generation
will be needed.

Illustrative risks

Concerns

Energy and utilities

Reputational risk; physical risk due to extreme
weather events; peak demand could outstrip
capacity; hot weather may reduce efficiency of
extraction.

• Potential physical damage to personnel and equipment,
potential disruption of the production activities of offshore
installations.
• Significant climate changes (mainly from temperature, but also
wind and water conditions) from one year to another can cause
substantial variations in the balance of supply and demand for
electricity and gas.
• Water shortages and heat waves can reduce hydroelectric
power production.

Manufacturing and
consumer goods

Higher prices of raw materials and freshwater;
higher energy prices; unanticipated changes in
customer preferences; supply chain disruptions.

• Dramatically rising energy prices will have a negative impact on
operating costs.
• Reduced availability, supply and quality of raw materials and
freshwater.
• Production bottlenecks due to functional failures in supply
chains.

Mining and industrial
metals

Regulatory risk; vulnerability to energy and water
shortages due to intensity of use; rainfall and
flooding leading to potential overflow of storage
reservoirs containing contaminants.

Food and beverage

Water scarcity; crop damage due to weather
extremes; increased exposure to new pests and
disease; transportation problems.

• Increasing regulatory pressure will impact the steel industry
in terms of impacts on the process, location of facilities and
availability of raw materials.
• Concerns about energy security where power comes from large
hydroelectric plants via national power companies, and water
security.
• Water scarcity is the primary vulnerability.
• The impact of climate change on agricultural products is
increasing.

Regulatory risks: Adaptation to climate change will promote corresponding regulatory changes governing
water use, water allocation, pricing, effluent, development, disaster risk and so on. Compliance is likely to
affect the energy and industry sectors by increasing operational costs and requiring additional reporting
on their climate risks and adaptation measures. Yet conversely, regulatory risk is arguably higher where
there are inadequate regulations and control on water resources, resulting in uncertain circumstances.
Reputational risks: When people, particularly as consumers but also as investors and stakeholders,
become more aware of climate change and the ways it affects them, they may look more critically at
corporate operations and behaviour, and at mitigation and adaptation measures with respect to GHG
emissions and water use. Negative perceptions of companies may result in a range of consequences,
from bad press and poor reputation to being unable to operate.
Other risks: Financial, market and political risks driven by water are also part of the overall equation.
For instance, companies may find financing increasingly difficult if they locate to low-income countries
prone to water stress, aggravated by climate change. Moreover, demographic changes and population
movement related to water issues can change the customer base. This might have a positive effect by
increasing demand for more energy- and water-efficient products, but spending power may be reduced in
low-income countries as more money will go to the process of adapting to increasing water stress. The
struggles with climate change and its associated issues, including water, may produce political instability
and even conflict. This presents not only uncertainty, but even threats to business, particularly those that
are heavily invested in a particular country.

Reactions and opportunities
Notwithstanding the increasing recent emphasis on climate change impacts within the energy and industry
sectors, the issue has been recognized for some time. This is witnessed in water-related initiatives by
many companies working with The CEO Water Mandate and the CDP (the global disclosure system for
investors, companies, cities, states and regions, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project), as well
as in early reports from organizations such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development
(WBCSD, 2009) and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC/Goldman Sachs, 2009). The private sector
is ‘waking up’ to the importance of water security and recognizing the significant impacts climate change
could have on commercial success (CDP, 2017a). A large and growing number of companies are now
acting to achieve positive outcomes, for example by reducing the amount of water used in manufacturing,
which in turn reduces energy required for water treatment. Reactions to climate change broadly encompass
measures involving mitigation or adaptation and sometimes a combination of both. For companies, there are
consequences attached to action as well as inaction. Such consequences can be monetarized in a net effect
by comparing the costs of action (e.g. flood protection of buildings) that might be shared or shifted (e.g. to
insurance) with the cost of inaction (e.g. energy disruption due to floods) (ISO, 2019).
Over 50 corporate signatories to the Business Alliance for Water and Climate (BAFWAC)14 report manage
and act on their water and climate impacts through CDP (Box 7.1). CDP annually benchmarks each of these
companies to track their progress towards a low-carbon, water-secure future. Overall, the data suggest that
companies cannot take action on these issues in silos.
Global decarbonization efforts could depend on how companies manage water (CDP, 2016). In 2016, CDP
reported a cost of US$14 billion from water-related impacts of climate change, a fivefold increase from the
previous reporting year. Moreover, CDP analysed emissions reduction activities disclosed by companies
and found that nearly a quarter (24%) of these activities depended on having a reliable supply of water for
their success. These activities, which included improvements in energy efficiency and low-carbon energy
purchases, could cut 125 million metric tonnes of CO2 emissions annually – equivalent to closing 36 coalfired power plants for a year. Furthemore, over half the companies reported lower GHG emissions through
improved water management. Figure 7.3 shows the relationship between water and energy intensity for
some major industries.

BAFWAC was jointly launched by CDP, The CEO Water Mandate, SUEZ, and the WBCSD in December 2015 and has since been endorsed
by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Each year, BAFWAC tracks and reports the progress of
signatory companies towards the commitment at the UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP). BAFWAC will dissolve at the end of 2020.

Box 7.1 Companies and climate change
Companies report significant business risks from water and climate issues.
• Colgate Palmolive reports that in 2016, El Niño caused a severe drought in Southeast Asia, impacting palm fruit yield
and reducing palm oil production by 27% in the first half of the year versus the same period in the previous year.
These changes impacted Colgate’s supply chain, and the company now assesses the future implications of water
scarcity on key commodities.
• Climate change affects the demand for and supply of electricity. French energy supply company ENGIE reports
that increasing temperatures in some regions can reduce energy requirements for heating homes and buildings,
and therefore the demand for ENGIE’s services. On the supply side, water is essential to ENGIE’s hydropowering
processes, and significant changes in precipitation, such as droughts, will substantially affect the company’s
electricity production.
• Other companies are working to reduce their dependence on water resources in recognition of a changing climate.
Ford Motor Company set a target of a 30% reduction in water use per vehicle produced by 2020, compared to base
year of 3.9 m3 per vehicle in 2015. The company is making progress towards this target and secured a place on
CDP’s Water A list in 2018.

production and use

7.3.1 Greenhouse gas mitigation, energy and water use
Energy is in the spotlight of climate change initiatives as about two-thirds of the
world’s anthropogenic GHGs come from energy production and use (IEA, 2015), and
CO2 emissions from energy rose by 1.6% in 2017 (IEA, 2018). Over 90% of energy’s CO2
emissions are from fossil fuels (IEA, 2015). Since 1988, only 100 private and stateowned enterprises were responsible for 71% of the global industrial GHGs15 produced
by fossil fuel companies (CDP, 2017b). Fossil fuels are primarily used in coal-, oil- and
natural gas-fired thermal power generating stations, which are substantial users of
cooling water and globally used 58% of total energy water withdrawals in 2014 (IEA,
2016). This is at the heart of the water–energy nexus that is further discussed in a
broader context in Chapter 9.

There are a number of opportunities to mitigate GHGs and reduce water use at the same time. Reducing
energy demand and increasing energy efficiency are starting points – yet global energy demand is
projected to increase by more than 25% under the IEA New Policies Scenario. However, the demand would
be about twice as much if it were not for improvements in energy efficiency (IEA, 2018).
The most promising direction is the increased use of low-carbon renewable energy technology with
little water requirements, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind (Figure 7.4). It has been estimated
that in 2030 these renewable energy sources could be responsible for about a 50% reduction in water
withdrawals in the United Kingdom, over 25% in the United States of America (USA), Germany and
Australia, and above 10% in India (IRENA, 2015). In the European Union (EU), it was estimated that wind
energy in 2012 saved as much water as used annually by seven million people in average households, and
by 2030 – with increased deployment replacing some fossil fuel and nuclear generation – the amount of
water saved will be approximately three to four times more (EWEA, 2014). These numbers provide an idea
of the scale of water savings that could be possible using renewable energy in areas of scarcity in lowincome countries as well.
Renewables are primarily a response to clean energy/low-carbon initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions. In
this regard, renewable energy sources do not always reduce water use (IEA, 2016). Sources that use heat,
such as concentrating solar power and geothermal, often require cooling water, which drives up

15

Broadly, this includes the production and downstream combustion of fossil fuels in all sectors, except agriculture for the most part.

consumption. In addition, carbon capture and storage, a technology to extend the life of fossil fuel plants,
could nearly double water requirements (IEA, 2016). Similarly, increases in nuclear power production,
debatably renewable but seen by some as clean, sustainable energy, will contribute to more water use.

A comprehensive
assessment
of hydropower
as a clean and
environmentally
friendly energy
source needs to
take GHG emissions
from reservoirs into
consideration

Hydropower, which provides 16% of the world’s electricity (IEA, 2016) and 70% of
renewable power (IEA, 2017a), requires a substantial water supply. However, it differs
from cooling water in the sense that, after passing the turbines, the water remains
available for other purposes downstream (e.g. irrigation or other hydropower plants).
The net water use of hydropower can be reduced if the respective reservoir system is
multipurpose. Moreover, hydropower plays a role in integration of other (intermittent)
renewables such as wind (Hülsmann et al., 2015). A comprehensive assessment of
hydropower as a clean and environmentally friendly energy source needs to take GHG
emissions from reservoirs into consideration, which is not an easy task (World Bank,
2017b). Water quality is an additional issue: it relates to GHG emissions, since they
were shown to be linked to eutrophication, with methane estimated as comprising 80%
of GHG emissions from dam reservoirs (Deemer et al., 2016). Moreover, concentrations
of methylmercury increase rapidly in reservoir water after impoundment and persist for
a long time, affecting fish and the populations consuming them (Calder et al., 2016).

Maintaining sufficient water levels in reservoirs is critical for maximizing hydropower efficiency, as
illustrated by the example of the Hoover Dam in the USA, the capacity of which dropped over 20% as
reservoir levels dropped 40 m between 1999 and 2014 due to prolonged drought (Capehart, 2015).
Moreover, water consumption by evaporation from large reservoir surface water areas, though difficult
to estimate, can be significant in arid and semi-arid areas. For example, the annual mean water budget
for Lake Tahoe (USA) includes 60% for evaporation (Friedrich et al., 2018). In areas of existing and

104

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

projected water scarcity and variability due to climate change, the decision regarding hydropower involves
balancing the necessity to store large quantities of water with the water needs of those living and working
downstream. On the upside, the flexibility of reservoirs in power generation allows for better integration of
variable electricity delivery by wind and solar power into the grid (IEA, 2016). Overall, while hydropower will
continue playing a role in climate mitigation and adaptation of the energy sector, the overall sustainability
of single projects needs to be assessed, taking account of the above-mentioned points. In addition,
ecological and social issues such as deforestation, biodiversity loss, changes in river ecology and
hydrology, interference with sediment transport, displacement of people, and impacts on livelihoods must
be taken into consideration to avoid repeating known problems (Moran et al., 2018).
Increasing the share of renewables in the final energy mix will have a direct impact on reducing GHG
emissions, yet the effect on reducing water use might not be so pronounced. Biofuels, while they offer
potential, emphasize the renewable energy conundrum of reducing GHGs and water use (see Chapter 9).
The notable exceptions are wind and solar PV, which also have the additional advantage of becoming
increasingly competitive with fossil fuel energy generation. From another perspective, while the 10% of
water withdrawn globally for energy may look small compared to agriculture, this quantity is still
considerable. A saving of 1% per year by better energy use or efficiency could provide water for 219 million
people based on 50 L/day, depending on location and other factors. This offers an important opportunity
for the energy sector to combat water scarcity while mitigating climate change (United Nations, 2018a).

Industry has a
significant role in
the mitigation of
climate change and
the fulfilment of
the targets of the
Paris Agreement

7.3.2 Decarbonizing industry
Industry has a significant role in the mitigation of climate change and the fulfilment
of the targets of the Paris Agreement. Such mitigation efforts would also contribute
to reducing water-related climate change impacts over the long term. While creating
about 25% of the world’s gross domestic product and employment, industry also
produced (in 2014) about 28% of global GHG emissions (with CO2 comprising
over 90%), and between 1990 and 2014 industrial emissions increased by 69%.16
Ammonia, cement, ethylene and steel manufacturing produced nearly half of
industry’s CO2 emissions (McKinsey & Company, 2018).

The challenges to decarbonization in these four industries lie in abatement. Feedstocks produce about
45% of the CO2 emissions, and this can only be lowered by process changes, not by replacing fuel.
Also, these industries require high-temperature heat produced by burning fossil fuels (35% of the CO2
emissions). Opportunities exist to reduce emissions to near zero, one of the most significant being the
availability of low-cost zero-carbon electricity17 for high-temperature electric furnaces. It is estimated
that four to nine times more zero-carbon clean energy would be required to fully decarbonize these four
industries than the conventionally generated energy they currently use. This would require big changes
in energy supply. For example, at present nuclear and hydropower most likely would be the main sources
of power that could meet the larger demand. With present prices for commodities, carbon capture
and storage is the cheapest decarbonization option, particularly for the cement industry (McKinsey &
Company, 2018).
Such industrial GHG mitigation is facing a trade-off with water use, depending on the mix of renewable
zero-carbon energy. Water use will increase with nuclear and hydropower, and even carbon capture and
storage comes with increased water use.

16

The IEA reports that in 2016, industry’s global CO2 emissions would increase from 19% to 36% if emissions from the electricity it
uses were reallocated to it (IEA, 2017b).

A recent report (UNIDO, 2017a) notes that clean energy in manufacturing can be accelerated through
the advent of Industry 4.018 and thus contribute to meeting global challenges – such as climate change
mitigation – through renewable energy, reduced carbon emissions and optimization of energy use.
Opportunities exist to encourage renewable energy and overcome its intermittency if production is
matched to peak generation. As such, the industry and energy sectors could integrate with regard to grid
load balance to their mutual benefit, resulting in smart grids that use information and communication to
manage supply and demand from a variety of generators to many users. This would allow solar and wind
to be part of larger networks. The next step might be Virtual Power Plants (VPP), which are mixtures of
various energy sources with a cloud-based control centre.

7.3.3 Adaptation and circular water management
With respect to water, climate change adaptation presents industry with two contrasting dilemmas –
water stress usually meaning too little water and water disasters resulting in damage from too much.
Disasters, particularly flooding, and the regional ‘climate proofing’ required for all sectors are discussed
in Chapter 4. For water stress, industry has a particular and significant contribution to make in reducing
water use and becoming more water-efficient. Data indicate opportunities for industry to decrease water
consumption overall by up to 50% (Andrews et al., 2011 as cited in WBCSD, 2017).
In preparing for potential water scarcity risks, businesses may adopt circular water management, where
the use of water changes from a linear process with increasing contamination (becoming wastewater)
into a circular one where water recirculates and loops back for continual use (Stuchtey, 2015). At the
plant level, circular water management is typified by the 5Rs approach: reduce, reuse, recycle, restore
and recover (WBCSD, 2017) (Figure 7.5). The first three of these Rs are emphasized, as they can reduce
costs (Box 7.2). The benefits of treated wastewater are particularly noted by the WBCSD, as they are by
the EU in its Water Reuse Action Plan, which includes industry (EC, n.d.). The potential for improvement is
significant – in 2010, globally 16% of freshwater withdrawals became industrial wastewater and in many
countries only a low percentage is treated (WWAP, 2017).

Industry 4.0 represents the next (4th) industrial revolution and connects physical industrial production with digital information
technology in cyber-physical systems. It is also referred to as the industrial internet (of things), advanced manufacturing or digital
manufacturing (UNIDO, 2017a).

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

Box 7.2 Examples of industrial circular water management
Recycling: The Pearl Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) complex in Ras Laffan, Qatar, is the largest plant of its kind in the world,
producing 140,000 barrels/day of oil equivalent. Shell and its partner, Qatar Petroleum, have made a decision to reach
zero liquid discharge and recycle 100% of the water in a closed-loop system. Besides water savings, the benefits
include strict regulatory compliance, smaller environmental footprint and greater community acceptance (Oxford
Business Group, 2014).
Reuse: The Springvale Mine in Lithgow, New South Wales, Australia produces the coal used by the nearby Mount Piper
Power Station, which provides approximately 15% of New South Wales’ power. The mine water is treated and delivered
via a 16 km pipeline to the power station for reuse as cooling water. This ensures environmental and operational
compliance in relation to water outflows and, most importantly, enables continued operations of both the mine and the
power station (New South Wales Government Department of Planning and Environment, 2017).
Treated wastewater: Tangshan Iron & Steel (TIS) in China plans to build a new coking plant (1.5 million tonnes per year)
and a gas liquefaction plant. Being in a water-scarce environment with limited intake and discharge volumes, to support
its production TIS has water treatment facilities that allow for 60% reuse of industrial water. In addition, it complies with
strict regulation and saves costs through reduced freshwater intake (Veolia, 2014).

The use (or reuse) of the energy contained in flowing water, which is frequently dissipated for
operational reasons, contributes to the circularization of the energy cycle. Decarbonization of energy
sources includes mining this lost energy, which is hidden in much existing infrastructure used primarily
for other purposes (agriculture, water supply, wastewater treatment, industry, etc.). The development of
alternative strategies and technical solutions represents an additional low-impact and lucrative solution
for energy generation. For example, there is a high potential for hydropower in existing irrigation systems
(Marence et al., 2018) and in the USA more than 80,000 non-powered reservoirs offer a possible
additional 12 GW of power (Hadjerioua et al., 2012).

7.3.4 Eco-Industrial Parks and the circular economy
Past editions of the World Water Development Report have outlined the benefits of water reuse and
industrial symbiosis in industrial parks (WWAP, 2017), and effective water and effluent management
in Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs) (WWAP, 2015). Moreover, the WBCSD notes that the 5Rs approach
encourages collaboration across sectors, and resource recovery from wastewater is part of circular
economy thinking (WBCSD, 2017). The circular economy19 is concerned with avoiding or minimizing the
production of waste, including wastewater.
Within both the concepts of circular economy and green economy, inclusive and sustainable industrial
development plays a large role, as promoted through energy and water efficiency measures in
programmes such as the Green Industry Initiative (UNIDO, n.d.b) with Resource Efficient and Cleaner
Production (RECP). EIPs (Box 7.3) include many of the foregoing efforts in a local circular economy.
There are synergies between the green economy and adaptation to climate change (UNGC/UNEP/
Oxfam/WRI, 2011).

7.3.5 Corporate adaptation
For climate change, the risk to business associated with water stress is one of the main drivers for water
reuse and efficiency (WBCSD, 2017). Depending on the level of treatment required, the technologies are
well known and based on variations of, for example, phase separation, precipitation, flotation, biological
treatment, filtration and separation, and nature-based solutions (NBS) such as constructed wetlands.
In addition, there are many new and emerging technologies. In concert with technology, a facility could

19

A circular economy aims to change the existing linear system from raw material to manufacturing to waste, into one where
“everything is reused, remanufactured, recycled back into a raw material, used as a source of energy, or as a last resort, disposed of.”
(UNIDO, n.d.a, p. 3).

Energy and industry

107

Box 7.3 Eco-Industrial Parks
The Eco-Industrial Park (EIP) concept is gaining momentum as a form of collaboration between industries located on a
common property towards inclusive and sustainable industrial development that goes beyond conventional arrangements
(UNIDO, 2017b). EIPs address the environmental, social, and economic pillars of sustainable development, for which water
plays an important role. A recent framework for EIPs sets out performance requirements (UNIDO/World Bank Group/GIZ,
2017). One of the key environmental topics is adapting to climate change risks. Water performance standards, involving
circularity, for consumption, efficiency and treatment are part of this direction. For example, the targets for wastewater
treatment are 95%, with 50% reused responsibly in or outside the EIP. As a result of pilot projects on EIPs in developing
and emerging economies, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) reported that between 2012
and 2018 almost two million m3 of water were saved per year (UNIDO, 2019).

look at day-to-day operations such as the use of wash water, better monitoring and leak detection. On an
expanded scale a company might evaluate its water footprint and include those of its suppliers, which may
have far-reaching effects if they are large water users.
Technology is not a significant barrier to circular water management, unlike regulation, financial resources,
awareness and dialogue (WBCSD, 2017). Regulations need revising in order to allow the use of wastewater
and to build public confidence. Financial resources reflect the cost and return on investment – low-cost
water and high-cost infrastructure often work against circular water management – and the economics
of the true cost and value of water need to be better understood. Awareness of reusing water needs to be
present among all parties, from those in business to decision-makers and other stakeholders. Information
and data are also important in this respect. Dialogue promotes awareness and lack of it impedes
collaborative action when a number of stakeholders are involved.
The perspectives, influence and impact of women in the response of business and industry to climate
change are potentially very significant. It has been noted that women have a more comprehensive approach
to mitigation and support broader actions regarding climate change. The dominance of men in energy,
transportation and industry results in a more technological focus than a behavioural one (OECD, 2008). If
women had a greater role in decision-making, holistic mitigation solutions could have more weight. In OECD
countries, women are more likely than men to look at the environmental practices of the companies whose
products they buy (OECD, 2008).
Case studies and surveys from UNGC/UNEP (2012) and WBCSD (2017) have identified some general
features relating to companies and adaptation to climate change that have met with success when applied
to water. Several relate to internal personnel efforts such as providing senior-level support, establishing
teams to focus on climate change, and rewarding innovation and the realization of set goals. Others address
company direction, for instance by linking adaptation to core business and company initiatives. This could
include planning and designing for wastewater treatment early in a project, to ensure that wastewater is
recognized as a value and a saving rather than a cost. Also significant is including the community interests
in a participatory way and not simply as corporate philanthropy. Basin governance includes consideration for
all users, including industry. This hinges on effective communication and good relationships, which are also
important within a business. Businesses face a broad set of issues related to climate change. As water is
very important in this regard, it must be part of an overall strategy and action plan.
Regarding corporate behaviour, water stewardship for companies is the next stage beyond water
management, in order to recognize the shared use and long-term sustainability of water in river basins
(Newborne and Dalton, 2016). It goes ‘beyond the factory fence’ and beyond conventional corporate
social responsibility, addressing water withdrawal and allocation as more important issues than simple
replenishment, which tends to preserve the business status quo. This may require compromises, tradeoffs or water use reductions in water-stressed areas. Water stewardship efforts are tied to integrated
water resources management (IWRM), which is often led by governments, as these need to foster room
for dialogue with the private sector. Moreover, a human rights focus should be integrated into water
stewardship and IWRM, taking a lead from the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (HRC,
2011), to influence the direction of companies in these areas.

Moving forward
“Delivering a water secure future will require a complete transformation of our global economy”
(CDP 2018, p. 11). Success will require companies to realign their business models, products
and practices in ways that decouple production and consumption from the depletion of water
resources. Responding to the global water and climate crises not only means better water
management but, importantly, also better business management.
The way forward in managing water to mitigate and adapt to climate change points to some
significant changes and large moves away from business-as-usual (Figure 7.6). “Proactive
companies can develop strategies to address climate change risks in their operations and supply
chains, as well as strategies to capture new market opportunities and engage customers and
communities to meet needs amid changing climate conditions” (UNGC/UNEP/Oxfam/WRI, 2011,
p. 28). One of the largest shifts will be seeing climate change as an opportunity. This will require
an understanding of how adaptation can improve business prospects and why it is not just
another unwanted costs, as well as recognition that climate change mitigation and adaptation
are everyone’s responsibility, and that energy and industry have important roles to play through
many players. Owners, shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and communities are in
this together and will be affected both communally and personally. This will require a long-term
approach with pre-emptive planning and actions both inside and outside the fence (UNGC/UNEP/
Oxfam/WRI, 2011). Business will need to move away from the ‘quarterly capitalism’20 mindset
(Barton, 2011). This is already evident with the idea of inclusive capitalism.21 “It is much smarter to
anticipate and address climate change impacts and build resilience up front than to simply respond
to the human and economic costs after impacts occur” (UNGC/UNEP/Oxfam/WRI, 2011, p. 16).

20

This is a focus on quarterly (short-term) earnings targets, as opposed to long-term thinking and investment.

21

‘Inclusive capitalism’ is a global movement to engage leaders across business, government and civil sectors and
encourage them to practice and invest in ways that extend the opportunities and benefits of our economic system to
everyone.” (Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism, n.d.).

This chapter describes the links between water, climate and human settlements,
highlighting the need for increased resilience through flexible, long-term urban
planning.

8.1

Introduction
A majority of the world’s population (4.2 billion out of 7.6 billion in 2018) lives in cities. Projections of
human settlements in the future (with a world population of 8.6 billion in 2030 and 9.8 billion in 2050)
show that up to 60% of the world’s population will live in cities by 2030, and 66.4% in 2050 (Figure 8.1).
In 2018, three times as many urban dwellers were estimated to live in the less developed regions than
in the more developed ones (3.2 billion versus 1.0 billion), and this ratio is expected to rise as the vast
majority of urban population growth is expected to occur within the world’s least developed regions
(UNDESA, 2019).

As human settlements continue to expand, pressure upon scarce resources, like water, is building
up and further exacerbated by climate change impacts. Although cities are a hub for economic
development, income generation and innovation, they are punctuated by inequities in health, water,
sanitation and economic opportunities. For instance, haphazard and unsustainable urbanization has
saturated water-provisioning service and infrastructure as well as existing wastewater treatment
facilities, often time exposing people to health risks related to water quality and availability.

It is important to realize that the threats to water scarcity will be felt most keenly in the short term due to
rapid urbanization, while the impacts of climate change will unfold over a longer time horizon. No explicit
climate change signal has been detected in flood disasters in the historical records up to 2010. Population
growth and economic development were the dominant drivers of increases in the numbers of people
affected and economic losses suffered due to coastal and river floods (PBL Netherlands Environmental
Assessment Agency, 2014).

8.2

Water, climate and urban development
Urban settlements are where the impacts of climate change on water systems are most keenly felt. These
impacts include extremes in climate change from higher temperatures, reduced precipitation and drought
on the one hand, and increasing heavy precipitation and flooding events on the other. It is precisely these
extremes that make the planning of urban space and provision of infrastructure so difficult.

Reduced water availability will mean that by 2050 3.9 billion people (over 40% of the
world’s population) are projected to live under severe water stress (PBL Netherlands
Environmental Assessment Agency, 2014). Climate change affects all parts of
the water cycle. The areas of the world most affected in term of changes in water
availability will include the Middle East, East Asia and much of Africa (IPCC, 2014a).
The physical impact of flooding and resulting landslides will significantly affect urban
settings, not just in damage to infrastructure but also loss of life and irreversible land
destruction (see Chapter 4). Even in the developed world there is little resilience.
In the United Kingdom, costs of flooding during the winter of 2015–2016 reached
US$7.5 billion (Miller and Hutchins, 2017). About 50% of Asia’s population (2.4 billion
people) reside in low-lying coastal areas. The rising sea level will intensify the floodrelated impacts of extreme climate events. Additionally, some agricultural land will
be rendered unsuitable for use as a result of increased salination. In the Asia-Pacific
region, storms, floods and landslides kill 43,000 people annually (UNESCAP, 2018).

The physical infrastructure for delivery of water and sanitation facilities can also be disrupted, leading
to contaminated water supplies, and discharge of untreated wastewater and stormwater into living
environments. Access to safe water is affected, with significant loss of life. Aside from waterborne
diseases, many other health risks are exacerbated. Vector-borne diseases such as malaria, rift valley
fever, and leptospirosis and others are often observed after flooding events (Okaka and Odhiambo, 2018).
Groundwater sources are also significantly affected by flooding.
Although statistics indicate that water supply and sanitation coverage levels in urban areas are often
higher than in rural areas, there are significant challenges associated with services provisioning (WHO/
UNICEF, 2017). Most importantly, their environmental and financial sustainability is critical as countries
strive to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Urbanization patterns in a number of cities
have become increasingly complex due to conflict-related migration, meaning that even the best planned
service provision systems can be thrown into disarray by a rapid influx of people. Aside from the delivery
of water and sanitation, other basic services, such as telecommunications and transportation, are also
significantly affected.

8.3

The increased need for urban water resilience
Close to 70% of the world’s population will live in urban agglomerations by 2050. The size, density and
number of urban centres have increased considerably in the last few decades. By 2030, the world is
projected to have 43 megacities with more than ten million inhabitants, the majority of which will be in
developing regions. However, the fastest-growing urban agglomerations will be cities with less than one
million inhabitants (many are located in Africa and Asia). Although about one in eight people lived in the
33 megacities worldwide in 2018, about 50% of the world’s urban dwellers reside in settlements with fewer
than 500,000 inhabitants (UNDESA, 2019). Many of these cities are vulnerable to the impacts of climate
change. For example, the Indonesian capital city of Jakarta – with a population of 10.6 million in 2018

112

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

(UNDESA, 2018) – lies next to a large bay and sits on subsiding lands and floodplains, making it extremely
vulnerable to floods and extreme climate events. Events that hamper access to clean water and extreme
water situations are becoming increasingly frequent, an alarming call for the state to strengthen efforts
for managing the resultant human migration. For example, flooding in 2007 forced 340,000 to 590,000
residents of Jakarta to migrate (Lyons, 2015).
The body of scientific evidence now categorically shows how climate change, particularly changes in
precipitation and extremes in temperature, has exacerbated water management challenges (IPCC, 2014a).
Many cities have experienced problems with water resources, as well as extreme flooding events. Without
a more systematic approach to water management in cities, the actions planned in the past will rapidly
become insufficient. The destruction of resources, reduced services and the commensurate impacts on
health and the environment will be the result.
Key to a more effective approach is the understanding of urban development in the wider sense. Many
of the factors influencing urban development are not currently well understood by the water community.
Given that a combination of these factors exerts a huge influence, against a background of uncertainty,
planning for different future scenarios will be necessary, rather than adopting a fixed and rigid approach.
Through better engagement of the various stakeholders in cities, it should be ensured that they understand
the different scenarios, so that difficult choices can be made and justified.
Urban water resilience goes way beyond the traditional city boundaries, including the potential reliance on
distant watersheds. In some cases, several cities or a group of urban agglomerations will draw from the
same aquifer, or there may be transboundary exchanges. In such cases, national, regional or international
water resources issues can come into play.

8.4

Critical areas for action
8.4.1 Planning for the future
If cities are to adapt to climate change and survive, they will need to diversify their planning, going beyond
a linear approach focused on service provision alone, while minimizing costs. This will necessitate a much
broader assessment of water resources and a resilient system designed to protect against shocks. Such
shocks may not only be caused by climate change, but can also be affected – for better or for worse – by
multiple other factors, including:
• Population growth and urbanization (including climate- and conflict-induced migration);
• Technological advances;
• Economic growth;
• Land use planning; and
• Managing competition between sectors.
There are some examples where action in a related sector can indirectly impact water resources. For
example, housing regulations can influence runoff from residential areas and thus help mitigate against
flood risks. Planning for multiple scenarios is therefore a much better strategy, but it must be undertaken
in an open and inclusive manner.
Effective consensus-building cannot be bypassed. Multi-stakeholder frameworks, institutionalized at
the city level, are an effective way to support decision-making, particularly when faced with several
different scenarios for the future. The recent drought in Cape Town, South Africa, clearly underscores the
importance of a committed ‘whole city’ strategy (Box 8.1). Having the city authority as the enabler provides
a reference point to which other stakeholders can peg their own commitments and promotes the idea of
responsibility and ownership.
There is no prescriptive solution to address urban water resilience. Each situation varies and requires an
independent analysis.

Box 8.1 Cape Town’s post-drought collaborative water strategy
The water crisis in Cape Town, South Africa, was brought upon by a regional shortage in the Western Cape. Reservoir
levels had been reducing since 2015, and between mid-2017 and mid-2018 the water levels were between 15 and 30%
of their total capacity (CSAG, n.d.).
The crisis led to the development of a long-term strategy to protect resources, using a holistic approach. The strategy
sets out the commitments of the metropolitan municipality of Cape Town and its citizens. Collaborative relationships
are based on trust, and trust is built where there is transparency and mutual accountability, and where stated intentions
of all partners are consistently translated into actions. The strategy is based on the following principles:
1.

Safe access to water and sanitation. The City of Cape Town metropolitan municipality will work hard to provide
and facilitate safe access to water and sanitation for all its residents in terms of well-defined minimum standards.
In particular, the City will work with communities in informal settlements and with other stakeholders to improve
the daily experience of access to water and sanitation, with an emphasis on building trust and increasing safety
within these communities.

2.

Wise use. Cape Town will promote the wise use of water by all users. This will include: a) pricing water based on
the cost of providing additional supply, while retaining the commitment to provide a basic amount of water for free
for those not able to afford paying for it; b) revising by-laws and planning requirements, and using other incentives
to support water efficiency and the treatment and reuse of wastewater; c) supporting active citizenship by
substantially improving customer management and engagement; and d) managing the water network effectively
to reduce losses and non-revenue water.

3.

Sufficient, reliable water from diverse sources. Cape Town will develop new and diverse supplies of water (which
could include groundwater, and reused and desalinated water) in a cost-effective and timely manner to increase
resilience and substantially reduce the likelihood of severe water restrictions in the future. It is committed to
increasing the available supply by approximately 300 million litres per day over the next ten years, and in suitable
increments thereafter, in a way that is adaptable and robust to changes in circumstances.

4.

Shared benefits from regional water resources. Cape Town will work with key stakeholders and partners, including
other urban and agriculture water users, and other spheres of government, to make the most of the opportunities
to optimize the economic, social and ecological benefits of regional water resources, and to reduce the risks. This
will be done through collaborative processes.

5.

A water-sensitive city. Cape Town will actively facilitate its transformation over time into a water-sensitive city
that makes optimal use of stormwater and urban waterways for the purposes of flood control, aquifer recharge,
water reuse and recreation, based on sound ecological principles. This will be done through new incentives and
regulatory mechanisms, as well as through investments in new infrastructure.

8.4.2 Identifying critical areas of water scarcity
While climate change is already significantly impacting water resources, the demands of increased
population and urbanization will further exacerbate water stress (defined here as a water exploitation
rate of more than 40%) in many basins across the world, particularly those in densely populated
areas in developing economies. By 2050, 40% of the world’s population is projected to live under
severe water stress (Figure 8.2), including almost the entire population of the Middle East and South
Asia, and significant parts of China and North Africa. Globally, the rate of groundwater depletion has
doubled between 1960 and 2000, equalling 280 km³ per year in 2000 (PBL Netherlands Environmental
Assessment Agency, 2014). Without good management strategies, these factors will entail huge risks
to life (OECD, 2012).
Scarcity can be due to source limitation and/or increasing demand, as well as failure to invest in a
diversity of sources, but also to institutional and management challenges. Limited capacity of local
authority service providers results in high levels of ‘unaccounted for’ water, which in turn reduces
revenue collection, resulting in a lack of resources for operations and maintenance. This vicious circle
is a reality in many smaller utilities in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Scarcity is often perceived due to competition for resources. In small urban and rural settlements, use of
water for agriculture and in some cases industrial applications results in reduced availability for domestic
uses. Scarcity in one sector is sometimes best addressed by actions in another sector. Improved irrigation
practices, or industrial process optimization can free up water for domestic users. A key issue in this
respect is that domestic supplies must be prioritized under the human rights to water and sanitation.
The example of Cape Town, presented in Box 8.1 shows how a climate-induced shortage was dealt with by
adopting a new management approach.

8.4.3 Accounting for urbanization footprints on water resources
In many settings, urbanization can damage the ecosystems that provide the water and other natural
resources necessary for sustainable growth. As a city grows and expands, pressure on the local
ecosystems can increase to the point where, to survive, the city needs to look further afield, increasing
its footprint. In practice, this can mean exploiting catchments that are distant or yet to be developed.
A good example is the city of Dakar, where the city draws on the Lac de Guiers, which is approximately
250 km away. The authorities responsible for water supply are not always the ones that are responsible
for catchment management. The mainly rural communities who survive on fishing and subsistence
farming around the Lac de Guiers have a potentially larger impact on the water resource than the city
dwellers in Dakar. Interventions to secure the water supply for Dakar are therefore directly related to the
livelihood activities of distant riparian communities (Cogels et al., 2001). In this kind of cases, payment
for environmental services schemes can be beneficial for both the urban population and the communities
who live around the source (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018).

Human settlements

115

On the other hand, discharge of wastewater can also significantly impact downstream users. The AccraTema conurbation in Ghana draws water from the Densu River. Due to activities upstream, particularly sand
mining, car-washing and wastewater treatment plant effluent discharges, the water quality in the river is so
poor that it is close to the limits of economic treatment as a drinking water source (Yeleliere et al., 2018).
Rapid urban expansion frequently results in land of marginal quality being used for building houses and
infrastructure. This may occur in wetlands, swamps and floodplains at the boundaries of a city. Destruction
of such natural systems can have a significant impact on water storage and buffering capacity during
periods of extreme precipitation or drought.
Consequently, those planning for improved urban water resilience need to look well beyond the boundaries
of a city and consider the long-term impacts of urban expansion on water security. This will necessitate a
wider consultation to include the ecological knowledge that is often locally available, based on or gained
though decades of observation and good practice.

8.4.4 Innovative ways for local authorities and utilities to embrace resilience
Water and wastewater utilities can drive and lead change if they move from a business-as-usual approach
focusing on service delivery at the lowest cost to a forward-looking strategic plan. Such plans must cover
both short-term solutions and long-term actions to promote efficient delivery of services whilst addressing
emergency preparedness and long-term capital investment.
Short-term solutions can include demand management, one of the most cost-effective tools to mitigate
against scarcity. Water demand management effectively combines leakage reductions with the promotion
of a water-saving culture and other commercial and institutional instruments. As a result, additional
investments to develop new water resources supply projects are less urgently needed, so that money is
saved in the longer term. In a situation where system losses are high, this should be a prerequisite for any
future water resource supply projects. The water scarcity situation in São Paulo, Brazil is a clear case in
point (Box 8.2).

Box 8.2 Analysis of the water shortage in São Paulo, Brazil
In 2015, the water distribution system of the Metropolitian Region of São Paulo (MRSP) was at the brink of collapse.
Homes that were supplied exclusively by the Cantareira reservoir were especially vulnerable. According to data of
the Companhia de Saneamento Básico do Estado de São Paulo S.A (Basic Sanitation Company of São Paulo State –
SABESP), on 23 April 2015 the six main river springs that supply the MRSP contained 305 billion litres of water, while
the same sources had amounted to 558 billion litres at the same time of the year in 2014. This means that even with
above-average rainfall in January and February, the situation was critical. While in 2014 there still was a serviceable
volume in the Cantareira system, in 2015 the city had to rely on the technical reserve.
A water crisis like this can become an opportunity to achieve more efficient and sustainable water consumption,
avoid losses and pollution, and promote citizen involvement. For this to occur, the suggested measures and projected
scenarios must be clear enough to obtain the trust and support of citizens, through information about the ‘real’ extent
of the crisis and the measures to be taken.
It is important to analyse the issue from the perspective of opportunities, as the crisis has demonstrated a catalysing
potential for structural advances the country needed. The crisis enabled a channel for the definition of major structural
works for the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, to be sponsored mostly by funds from the Federal Government.
The water crisis also sped up deep discussions about polemic issues like the transposition of rivers (the drought
in northeastern Brazil had lasted for at least three years), the high losses in the supply network (estimated around
37%), conflicts of interest in the concession model for private or mixed-capital companies, political interference
on technical issues, government negligence, the need for alternative sources of water (such as reclaimed water,
rainwater, groundwater and even desalination technologies), evaluation of individual and collective behaviour towards
sustainability, and the need for improvement in the institutional and social communication model.

8.5

Getting locked into long-term expensive, inappropriate capital-intensive investments
can greatly constrain future responses, reduce resilience and render cities extremely
vulnerable. The uncertainty related to future scenarios means that every effort
should be made to adopt flexible approaches, focusing on low-regret, short-term
actions. The same applies to capacity-building. From the experience of São Paulo, it
becomes clear that the element of trust between the authorities and citizens is also
very important.
In summary, in many countries and cities, the development of strategic frameworks
is desperately needed. Who in government is responsible, and which actions are
necessary, is difficult to assess and depends on the existing structures. It is very
likely, given the integrated nature of needed actions, that the responsibility should
rest with a national planning ministry or agency.

Conclusions and recommendations
1.

Understanding the wider issues related to sustainable urban development are critical if we are to
fully understand the direct and indirect impacts of urban water management on climate resilience.
The impacts of urbanizing communities on local ecosystems both close-by and distant, including
the critically important wetlands, also need careful consideration (Fitzgerald, 2018).

2.

Future planning for the various scenarios to support urban water and climate resilience is
necessary to ensure the right combination of short-term, low-regret interventions. Longerterm large-scale investment plans can address the real concerns facing cities and urban
agglomerations. There is a wide range of technological, engineering and nature-based solutions
(NBS) to ensure urban resilience. The best solutions to adopt are, however, context-specific.

3.

It is important for city-level actors, and in particular local authorities and utilities, to lead and guide
other stakeholders in a unified approach, making the best use of multi-stakeholder consultations
and ensuring that campaigns and advocacy are successful. It is critical to emphasize consultations
with all stakeholders, particularly the people most affected by climate change, water scarcity and
discrimination.

4.

A full analysis of future scenarios can be enabled by a greater understanding of the ecological
conditions upstream and downstream, in the areas where water is abstracted and wastewater
discharged. In cases of inter-basin transfers, a full analysis of impacts is necessary, including the
participation of communities, citizens or city managers to ensure the longer-term viability of such
schemes.

Building on the information and analyses provided in Chapters 3 through 8,
this chapter expands on the interlinkages between the main water use sectors,
describing how decisions made by one can have significant repercussions on the
others. It highlights the need for a consolidated approach to addressing climate
change through water in order to maximize co-benefits and address trade-offs.

9.1

Accounting for interlinkages
The previous chapters of this report have focused on what can be done to adapt to and mitigate
climate change through improved water management across different water use sectors and
stakeholders. Addressing climate change through water management should build on a coordinated
response that strikes a balance between different sectoral objectives and the needs of all water
users, including the environment. However, different sectors and stakeholders can face a variety of
challenges with respect to both water management and climate change adaptation and mitigation.
The often strong interlinkages between these groups can, in some cases, lead to synergies and
cross-benefits, and in other cases require trade-offs. The scope and magnitude of opportunities and
trade-offs will also vary based on the particular disciplinary knowledge, capacity, needs and
objectives of the different groups. Analyses across sectors and boundaries are therefore important
in order to maximize overall benefits. Furthermore, while the nexus approach is theoretically
symmetrical, it still needs to be approached through different water and climate change perspectives
in order to better understand the linkages and bridge the knowledge gaps across different disciplines
(Lui et al., 2017).

Water use requires energy. In 2014, the abstraction, distribution and treatment
of water and wastewater accounted for an estimated 4% of global electricity
consumption, along with 50M t.o.e.22 of thermal energy23 (mainly diesel used
for irrigation pumps and gas in desalination plants) – and the amount of
electricity used in the water sector has been projected to almost double by 2040
(see Figure 3.2). The energy requirements for irrigation and drinking water
further increase when the water has to be brought from greater distances
or from deeper groundwater bodies, or as the source quality decreases. The
largest predicted growth in electricity consumption is for desalination as well
as wastewater treatment (IEA, 2016), although the latter can be an energypositive process (sludge to energy) and modern technology should rather lead
to a decrease of energy use in the coming years (see Section 9.1.4). Therefore,
any reduction in water use, through greater water savings (i.e. demand
management) or improved water use and processing efficiency (e.g. leak
reduction) has the potential to reduce the energy demand from the water sector
and thus help mitigate climate change, if said energy source is from fossil fuels.

Energy consumption by the water sector [in 2014] is roughly equal to all energy used by Australia (IEA, 2016).

Conversely, energy production also requires water. Although this is probably most evident for growing
biofuels or for mining fossil fuels (e.g. hydraulic fracturing, or ‘fracking’), cooling processes in thermal
power generation actually account for the largest energy sector water use in terms of withdrawals (see
Section 7.3.1). Whereas cooling can affect water availability through evaporative losses, hydropower
reservoirs can also ‘consume’ large amounts of water through evaporation (Hogeboom et al., 2018).
Dams and artificial reservoirs also alter hydrological systems, which can in turn impact on the
functioning of ecosystems and their services, further affecting the availability and quality of water.
Irrigation for biofuel production (Box 9.1) not only consumes water, but can also impact water quality
through runoff of sediments, nutrients and agrochemicals, making it less suitable for other uses. With
their very low water requirements, renewables such as wind, solar photovoltaic (PV) and certain types of
geothermal power generation are by far the best energy alternatives from a water demand perspective
(WWAP, 2014).

9.1.2 The food and agriculture perspective
Water efficiency measures in agriculture can increase water availability and reduce the energy needed
for pumping, in turn further reducing the water needed for energy production. Such lower energy demand
can also lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thus mitigating climate change. In
this way, cross-benefits can lead to positive reinforcements. Similarly, increased use of renewable
energy in agriculture (e.g. solar PV pumps), as well as greater energy efficiency also provide additional
opportunities to lower GHG emissions and to support the livelihoods of smallholders (see Box 6.4).

Box 9.1 Biofuels
Biofuel production has been estimated to use about 2–3% of all water and agricultural land globally (Rulli et al., 2016).
Biofuels also account for 7% of all energy-related water withdrawals (more than oil and gas in primary energy production),
including significant amounts for steam in fermentation (IEA, 2016). The water requirements for biofuels depend on
whether crops are irrigated or rainfed (IEA, 2016). If irrigated, there are different requirements depending on the region
and the crop grown – sugarcane, corn and soybean being the most water-demanding – and the efficiency of the irrigation
systems.
Second-generation biofuels, manufactured from various types of non-food biomass, offer some promise in terms of
lowering the amount of water used. At present, they mainly include agricultural, food and municipal waste, with water
being used for the original purpose of the crop. However, when dedicated crops are grown for advanced biofuels, the
water use figures would rise.
In theory, biofuels can mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in relation to fossil fuels because the CO2 they emit
when combusted is balanced by the CO2 they capture while growing (Biofuel, n.d.a). However, they are not carbon-neutral
because of the energy that is required to grow and process the crop, including clearing the land, cultivating the ground,
planting and irrigation. If this is added to the GHG emissions from biofuel combustion and distribution to the customer,
the result is a net addition to CO2 emissions (Biofuel, n.d.a; n.d.b). This is further compounded by land use changes,
because more CO2 is released when native land is cleared and drained, and the CO2 uptake by the original plants is
lost. Since original forest is usually more efficient at capturing and storing CO2 than biofuel crops, deforesting native
land can actually produce a carbon ‘debt’ that may take hundreds of years to reverse (Biofuel, n.d.b). While the most
conventional biotechnology has been reported to produce less than a 40% reduction in GHG emissions compared to fossil
fuels (Doornbosch and Steenblik, 2007), other life cycle analyses suggest that such metrics come with a high degree of
uncertainty (Hanaki and Portugal-Pereira, 2018).
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2012) pointed out that the growth in biofuel production is more
problematic to project than the growth in other renewable energies, because of the many feedback mechanisms and
potentially large regional differences, leading to significant uncertainties. For example, large-scale bioenergy production
(without complementary measures) can result in negative effects with respect to deforestation, as well as higher CO2
emissions from land use change, nitrogen losses and higher food prices (Humpenöder et al., 2018). While biofuels offer
potential, the balance between their net water use and net GHG emissions needs to be considered, and decisions should
be made for each case individually, based on local circumstances, to address broader trade-offs.

120

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

In reality, however, increased irrigation efficiency (e.g. drip irrigation) at farm scale has often not led to
water savings at larger scales (FAO, 2017c; Koech and Langat, 2018) – rather, it is the crop production
that has increased by using the same overall volumes of water. This reinforces the critical importance
of conservation agriculture (see Chapter 6), which allows soils to retain more water (thus further
reducing water and energy demand), organic matter (carbon) and nutrients (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018).
In this way, conservation agriculture directly contributes to climate change mitigation and adaptation,
with additional ecological benefits and sustainable food and fiber production.

Avoiding the loss
and waste of food
provides another
path to reducing
GHG emissions

Avoiding the loss and waste of food provides another path to reducing GHG
emissions. An estimated 25–30% of total food produced is lost or wasted across
all stages of the food supply chains (FAO, 2013b; IPCC, 2019c). As food waste
decomposes, it releases GHGs. Between 2010 and 2016, global food loss and
waste contributed 8–10% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions24 (IPCC, 2019c),
a ratio that could rise above 10% by 2050 (Hiç et al., 2016). Since agriculture
accounts for 69% of global water withdrawals (AQUASTAT, 2014), reducing food
waste could also have significant repercussions on water (and energy) demand,
thus providing a means of adaptation (relieving water stress) and mitigation
(through reduced energy use).

9.1.3 The land use and ecosystem perspective
The biomass and soils of properly managed forests, wetlands and grasslands provide mitigation
opportunities through carbon sequestration (IPCC, 2019c), with significant additional benefits in
terms of nutrient cycling and biodiversity. However, while healthy ecosystems have the potential
to capture carbon at a rate which far exceeds many related human efforts, degraded ecosystems
can turn from carbon sinks to carbon sources. Improved water management for maintaining and/
or rehabilitating healthy ecosystems is critical in this respect, most notably in the case of wetlands,
which accommodate the largest carbon stocks among terrestrial ecosystems (GIZ/adelphi/PIK,
forthcoming). These ecosystems also provide high-value ‘green infrastructure’ for enhancing source
water protection, playing important roles in regulating water flows and maintaining water quality.
However, “there is a high degree of variation in the impacts of ecosystems on hydrology both within
and between ecosystem types or subtypes, their location and condition, climate and management …
for example, trees can increase or decrease groundwater recharge according to tree type, density and
location” (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018, p. 27).
It is therefore imperative that the impacts of land use change, including re/afforestation in particular,
on the local hydrological systems be taken fully into account. In July 2019, an article by Bastin et al.,
describing the enormous potential GHG mitigation effects of a massive afforestation effort (more
than one trillion trees over 900 million hectares), received worldwide attention through various forms
of media. Although the results were hotly debated,25 neither the initial paper nor its adversaries
provided any in-depth consideration of the water requirements and eventual hydrological impacts (or
potential benefits, if any) of such a scheme. This further illustrates the general disconnect between
the climate and water science communities.
As described in the Prologue, climate projections at different time and spatial scales may or may
not translate to real trends on the ground, in large part due to the complexity of interconnections
and feedback loops between water and land use at local and regional scales. Various hydrological
processes (infiltration, soil water storage, recharge, plant water use, other water uses) add to this
complexity, such that simplistic cause–effect chains are not necessarily applicable in many ‘realworld’ cases. For example, although General Circulation Models (GCMs) might predict an overall
increase in precipitation over a year (or even a season), this may not translate to increased water
availability, especially when the increased precipitation comes in the form of heavy rainfall events,

24

This estimate includes the GHG emissions related to the production of food, as well as from the decomposition process itself.

and may even result in more frequent and/or prolonged periods of drought – hence the importance of
sustainable land use (Box 9.2). Indeed, “the successful implementation of response options depends on
consideration of local environmental and socio-economic conditions. Some options such as soil carbon
management are potentially applicable across a broad range of land use types, whereas the efficacy of land
management practices relating to organic soils, peatlands and wetlands, and those linked to freshwater
resources, depends on specific agro-ecological conditions (high confidence)” (IPCC, 2019c, p. 19).

9.1.4 The water supply, sanitation and wastewater treatment perspective
Beyond the energy savings related to more efficient water use mentioned above, improved approaches to
the treatment of water, and especially wastewater, offer an even broader range of mitigation opportunities.
For example, the reuse of untreated or partially treated wastewater can reduce the amount of energy
associated with water extraction, advanced treatment and, in cases where the wastewater is reused at/or
near the release site, transportation.

The reuse of untreated or
partially treated wastewater
can reduce the amount of
energy associated with
water extraction, advanced
treatment and, in cases where
the wastewater is reused
at or near the release site,
transportation

As described in Section 3.3, untreated wastewater is an important source
of GHGs. With more than 80% of all wastewater globally released to
the environment without treatment (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018), treating
its organic matter prior to its release can reduce GHG emissions. The
biogas produced from wastewater treatment processes can be recovered
and used to power the treatment plant itself, rendering it energy-neutral
and further enhancing energy savings. Advanced wastewater treatment
systems also provide opportunities for the recovery of other raw materials,
such as nutrients that can then be transformed into fertilizer and sold on
the market, thus further increasing the return on investment by generating
new revenue streams (WWAP, 2017), with additional benefits to human
health and the environment.

However, wastewater treatment can itself lead to the release of certain types of GHGs. Nitrous oxide (N2O),
for example, is a potent26 GHG emitted during wastewater treatment processes. Although these emissions
are relatively small (3% of the estimated total anthropogenic N2O emissions), they can account for an
estimated 26% of the GHG footprint of the total ‘water chain’ (Kampschreur et al., 2009). N2O emissions
vary substantially between plants, due to different designs and operational conditions, as well as the
concentrations of nitrogen-rich compounds (e.g. urine) contained in the wastewater itself. In general,
plants that achieve high levels of nitrogen removal emit less N2O, indicating that high water quality can
be achieved in conjunction with lower N2O emissions (Law et al., 2012). Increased understanding of the
fundamental processes responsible for N2O production in wastewater treatment systems should lead to
improved plant design and operation. Furthermore, nitrogen recovery from wastewater does not negatively
affect the recovery of phosphorus and cellulose, nor the production of biogas (Van der Hoek et al., 2018).
Constructed wetlands can be effective in treating wastewater (with little or no additional energy inputs),
particularly in settings where low technology and low maintenance represent operational constraints,
providing a relatively inexpensive source of water for irrigation. While the biomass harvested from
constructed wetlands can be used as a renewable fuel source for second generation biofuels (Box
9.1) (Avellán and Gremillion, 2019), some evidence suggests that these systems act as net sources of
atmospheric GHGs (Picek et al., 2007; Tao, 2015), although the opposite has also been reported (De Klein
and Van der Werf, 2014).

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

Box 9.2 How climate change and sustainable land management affect water availability
In the semi-arid Segura River catchment (Southeast Spain), climate change is expected to cause a decrease in total
precipitation as well as, more importantly, an increase of extreme precipitation. A model-based study examined how
increases in extreme rainfall affect the distribution between water stored in the soil (green water) and water stored in
reservoirs (blue water). The results showed a redistribution of water within the catchment, with less green water, as a
result of prolonged drought periods, but more blue water, as a result of increased extreme precipitation and decreased
infiltration. Extreme rainfall also caused an increase of flood discharge and soil erosion, threatening water security in
this catchment (Eekhout et al., 2018).
Sustainable land management (SLM) practices are increasingly promoted to contribute to climate change mitigation
and adaptation. Eekhout and De Vente (2019) showed that the impacts of climate change are almost entirely reversed
by large-scale implementation of SLM (see Figure). The evaluated SLM scenarios were defined in close collaboration
with stakeholders, who identified reduced tillage and organic amendments as the most promising SLM practices in
rainfed agriculture. SLM increases the water-holding capacity of the soil, leading to increased infiltration and reduced
plant water stress. When extreme rainfall increases under climate change, the implementation of SLM mitigates this
effect on rainfall by reducing surface runoff and related processes, such as flood discharge, soil erosion and reservoir
sedimentation.
These results emphasize that projected changes in total precipitation alone are not enough to infer how water
availability will change over time. Extreme events and land management practices have a significant impact on the
distribution of water between the surface and the soil. These changes may affect the potential of rainfed in comparison
to irrigated agriculture, which rely on different water sources. SLM may have a positive impact on soil water and on
flood prevention, but also affect surface water and economic activities that rely on it.

Co-benefits
Besides the water, climate, energy and agriculture nexus, linkages to other sectors and stakeholder
groups are often strong. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development explicitly recognizes
that social, economic and environment systems are symbiotic. The United Nations (2018a)
demonstrated that Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 (the water goal) is interlinked to all
other SDGs, and that water is often an enabler for making progress in achieving other SDGs, while
in some cases trade-offs have to be realized (see Chapter 2). Conversely, progress towards SDG 6
also depends on progress in most of the other SDGs and, particularly, SDG 13 (climate action).
Such interconnectedness is exemplified by the case of improving wastewater treatment, which not
only directly serves the interests of SDGs 6 (both in terms of addressing the sanitation and water
quality Targets 6.1 and 6.3) and 13 (as well as the Paris Agreement), but also other SDGs (see
Figure 2.1). Human health and human settlements (see Chapters 5 and 8) are among the key areas
through which water-related climate interventions can generate multiple co-benefits. This points to
the importance of policy coherence and the appropriate timing and sequencing of policies, reforms
and related investments, as described in Chapters 2, 11 and 12.
An analysis of the co-benefits of water-related projects under the Green Climate Fund (Tänzler and
Kramer, 2019) revealed the extent to which they are embedded into the broader socio-economic
context of the respective countries. While employment and income opportunities are identified
as a co-benefit in more than half of the projects, a number of other co-benefits, ranging from
education and capacity development/training to biodiversity and food security, are also regularly
acknowledged (Figure 9.1). Yet many project proposals remain far too concentrated on the
central objective and fail to fully describe the broader (and often very strong) development focus.
Proposals for water-related projects that identify several specific (and realistic) co-benefits that
can be attained, and that describe how these co-benefits will be measured, are more likely to
obtain social, political and financial support (see Chapter 12).
In summary, adaptation and mitigation actions by one sector can directly influence water demand,
which can in turn augment or reduce the local/regional water availability (including quality) for
other sectors. In cases of reduced water demand, such actions can lead to multiple benefits
across sectors and boundaries, whereas increased water demand can result in the need for tradeoffs over the allocation of limited supplies.

This chapter describes how the nature and scale of water-related impacts of climate
change go beyond national borders, as do the potential responses. Deeper insights
into priority challenges and opportunities are drawn from country- and region-level
examples, to demonstrate why and how opportunities for action arise in each region.

10.1

Overview
Adapting to impacts of climate change on water first and foremost deals with how water is managed –
with what policies, institutions, management tools and resources. Water-related impacts of climate
change ignore administrative borders between and within countries. Therefore, climate-smart water
management has the greatest impact when developed and coordinated across national borders. Some
responses, such as water-sharing arrangements that can adapt to changing flow regimes, necessitate
a basin perspective, more often than not crossing national or subnational political and administrative
borders. For others, such as the development of early warning systems that are able to deal with
precipitation extremes, which are driving more intense and frequent floods or droughts (Chapter 4), there
is need to look still further: to the subcontinental or even continental scale. This chapter takes a look at
the implications of the regional and transboundary dimensions of the water–climate interface.
Regional perspectives are typically missing from global climate dialogue, agreements, funding
mechanisms and action. To date, the majority of climate change policy and action is framed at the
national level and driven by national governments: the negotiations under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are led by and focused on sovereign states, as are many
climate finance mechanisms (Chapter 12) and the majority of targets set under the 2030 Agenda, the
Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Building on the rationale
presented in Chapter 2, this chapter presents water as the international ‘climate connector’ that will
lead to new collaboration and coordination mechanisms, and help achieve the interlinked global
agreements on development, climate change and disaster risk reduction (DRR) (UN-Water, 2019). It
considers regional readiness to address these challenges, with reference both to countries’ maturity in
water resources management and their strategies for climate adaptation, taking nationally determined
contributions (NDCs) as a proxy, and looking across countries covered by the Regional Commissions
(RECs) of the United Nations (UN).27 It also underscores the crucial role for international organizations
operating at the transboundary basin or regional level. Over decades, water agencies have created such
players, which can support coordinated and coherent climate mitigation and adaptation action at the
water–climate interface.

27

These include the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA); the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE); the UN
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UNECLAC); the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific (UNESCAP); and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (UNESCWA).

Regional perspectives

127

There are enormous differences within and between regions in terms of how the climate is changing
and how these changes interact with water. The 2014 report of Working Group II for the Fifth
Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2014a) remains IPCC’s latest
region-by-region global assessment. It provides important context on the physical science, in terms of
changes in heavy precipitation, dryness and drought at a subcontinental scale. These broad changes
will themselves have regionally varying water-related impacts, including on runoff, evapotranspiration,
flood risk and water quality, which are mediated by local factors including land use and hydrogeology.
However, as described in the Prologue, there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to the
future impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle, particularly at the basin and sub-basin level.
And little is known about the climate–water interface insofar as groundwater is concerned (Taylor,
2009; Gleeson et al., 2012).

decision-making contexts

10.2

To support countries, regional policy communities need to assess impacts,
vulnerabilities and adaptation pathways within their geographical and decisionmaking contexts (IPCC, 2014a). A good example is the Regional Initiative for
the Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on Water Resources and SocioEconomic Vulnerability in the Arab Region (RICCAR), established by UNESCWA
together with ten other organizations. The Initiative has a strong emphasis
on engaging and strengthening institutions for climate change assessment
at the national as well as regional scale, and the RICCAR Arab Domain has
been adopted as the Middle East and North Africa Domain of the Coordinated
Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) (UNESCWA et al., 2017).

Addressing water-related impacts of climate change across
countries and regions
The water-related physical impacts of climate change are only one source of variation between and
within regions. What also varies is adaptive capacity, including policies, plans and management
capacities for addressing climate change impacts on water resources and water-dependent sectors.

10.2.1 Integrated and transboundary approaches
Addressing climate change via water requires taking integrated approaches – investing in better and
more accessible information, stronger and more flexible institutions, and natural and built infrastructure
to store, transport and treat water; taking action at all levels – local, national, river basin, and global;
balancing and sequencing soft and hard investments; managing intersectoral and geographic
trade-offs; avoiding maladaptive consequences; balancing equity, environmental and economic
priorities; and harnessing both adaptation and mitigation benefits. The core components of a water
resources management system that can respond to climate change are well known and include,
for example, water-sharing arrangements based on robust water resource assessment and water
accounting systems that can respond to climatic shifts and variability (GWP, 2019a). Over 15 years
ago, Mauritania’s National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) already recognized integrated
water resources management (IWRM) as one of the “appropriate solutions to adaptation to climate
change”, noting practices and actions such as “regular assessment of availability of water resources and
requirements”, “monitoring and mitigation of impacts related to … sustainable development … respecting
the conservation of the environment”, and “management regulations to prevent conflict of use” (Islamic
Republic of Mauritania, 2004, pp. 26–27).
The 2030 Agenda recognized that IWRM practices would be needed to bring about availability and
sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, as formulated under Sustainable Development
Goal 6 (SDG 6). A particular indicator was set to monitor the management practices (6.5.1). Although a
country’s SDG 6.5.1 score does not specifically focus on whether its water resources management
practices are adequate to address impacts of climate change, it does reflect its self-assessment of the
maturity of its water management systems, particularly by taking integrated approaches. The first
global SDG 6.5.1 progress report, released in 2018, not only revealed massive, persistent and growing
gaps in achieving the water goal, it also highlighted countries’ self-perceptions of rather limited maturity

in managing water resources (UN Environment, 2018). In all UN REC regions, the majority of countries lack
a solid foundation for IWRM (Figure 10.1). No countries in the ECA region report levels of implementation
scored as ‘high’ or ‘very high’, and in ECLAC, only one did so. Under a fifth did so in ESCWA and ESCAP, and
even in ECE, less than half claimed high or very high levels of implementation.28

Climate change features more clearly in the baseline assessment for SDG
Indicator 6.5.2, which focuses on transboundary water resources management.29
The baseline shows there is still significant room to increase commitments to
climate change adaptation, and to the reduction of climate-related disasters,
in transboundary cooperation: less than half (48%) of responses included
climate change adaptation as part of the tasks and activities of the joint bodies
responsible for transboundary cooperation. A similar share of responses (52%)
included adaptation as an area of cooperation under operational transboundary
arrangements. Around 75% included DRR (with a focus on floods and droughts) as
part of tasks and activities of joint bodies, but flood was more emphasized as an
area of cooperation under transboundary arrangements (78%) than drought (58%)
(UNECE/UNESCO/UN-Water, 2018).

10.2.2 Water in nationally determined contributions
Chapter 2 of this report notes that water is the most often-cited priority sector in NDCs for adaptation
actions (UNFCCC, 2016). A closer look, however, reveals the significant variations in how water features in
NDCs. A region-by-region assessment of 80 countries’ NDCs (GWP, 2018b) helps shed some light.30

Box 10.1 Transboundary and regional climate–water initiatives – a European perspective
As 60% of global freshwater flows cross national boundaries, transboundary cooperation is essential for effective
measures towards climate change adaptation (UNECE/INBO, 2015). The United Nations Economic Commission
for Europe (UNECE) has emphasized this challenge clearly, publishing guidance on water and adaptation to
climate change in 2009 (UNECE, 2009), and on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), water and adaptation in 2018
(UNECE/UNDRR, 2018).
Since the publication of the UNECE Guidance of 2009, numerous adaptation strategies and plans have been
developed and implemented across basins in the ECE region (including the Chu-Talas, the Danube, the Dniester, the
Neman and the Rhine) as well as globally (including Lake Chad, Lake Victoria, the Mekong and the Niger). These
experiences show the potential for transboundary cooperation to enable enhanced adaptation planning at the
country level by pooling resources, enlarging the planning space and reducing uncertainties. The ingredients for
success include good communication, monitoring and data sharing, sectoral cooperation, capacity support, and
funding mechanisms (UNECE/INBO, 2015). Sharing good practices in DRR and climate change adaptation more
generally (including from a transboundary perspective) also helps build expertise, allowing countries and basins to
learn from one another. While governments play a leading role, experience points to increasing engagement from
civil society and private sector actors, either lobbying for certain interests (e.g. Dutch farmers’ organizations on the
Rhine) or as observers of international river commissions, such as the International Commission on the Protection
of the Rhine (ODI/ECDPM/GDI, 2012).
Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) has been a driving force in framing and funding adaptation action at the
regional level. A 2018 evaluation of the EU Adaptation Strategy identified water as one of six key sectors for
integrating climate adaptation, and it found that the EU’s Water Framework and Floods Directives provided for this
(EC, 2018). Other analyses, however, point to the need for further integration of water policy and climate change
adaptation in implementation of the EU’s water-related Directives (Carvalho et al., 2019).

Water is less likely to feature in developed countries’ NDCs, which have tended to focus on mitigation,
with few including an adaptation component at all. Not embedding water in an NDC does not necessarily
signify a wider lack of water–climate integration. The ECE region, for example, comprises many developed
countries with little emphasis on water in their mitigation-focused NDCs, but has some of the strongest
examples of transboundary and regional climate–water initiatives (Box 10.1). However, although water
does not present the greatest opportunities for emissions reduction – as compared to energy, agriculture,
forestry, land use or industry, for example – it is still surprising that water so rarely features as a central
element in mitigation activities. There are crucial considerations and untapped opportunities: from the
impacts of water-related climate change on mitigation efforts in other sectors (e.g. in hydropower, forestry),
to emissions reduction in water distribution and wastewater treatment (New Climate Economy, 2018).
Good news: Institutional reforms are often prioritized along with infrastructure investments. In
ECA, ESCAP and ESCWA countries, more than half of the NDCs that mention water-related measures
describe activities that relate to both institution-building and infrastructure (Figure 10.2).31 Investments
to improve institutional capacity for water governance are an essential counterpart to investments in
built infrastructure (GCA, 2019). While the specific type and sequencing of institutional vs. infrastructure
investments necessarily varies between countries at different levels of development, an appropriate
balance between the two ensures that trade-offs between equity, environmental and economic objectives
can be managed in a changing climate (Sadoff and Muller, 2009; Shah, 2016). However, given that NDCs
are partly used to set out needs for climate finance, which can incentivize countries to prioritize more costly
infrastructure at the expense of institution-building, there is still room to improve the balance in all regions.

130

Institutional measures include: water pricing; analysis or modelling to inform planning; regulation, standards and enforcement; and
institutional development. Infrastructure measures include natural and built storage, infrastructure protection and desalination.
Countries also mention actions that are harder to categorize as infrastructural or institutional, including general water resources
management; water conservation measures (including ecosystem conservation, e.g. wetlands, water recycling, water use efficiency,
and water harvesting); and actions relating to specific subsectors such as agricultural or urban water management, groundwater,
and disaster risk reduction.

Ambiguous news: In several cases, countries’ climate change strategists are aware of water sector
plans – but in a good half of the countries this is not the case. Explicitly, water sector plans are mentioned
in just over a third of the NDCs reviewed in the ECLAC countries, close to half of those in ECA and ESCAP,
and four of six of the countries analysed in ESCWA (Figure 10.3). A further 14–20% of countries in each of
these regions expressed an intention to prepare a water policy statement or plan, within their NDCs. This
is testament to what can often be observed anecdotally: that in many countries, policy makers formulating
the NDCs neither know nor are aware of the work done in the water sector. The agenda for action seems
clear: ensuring that planning for water is adequately reflected within climate strategies.

Concerning news: Significant regional differences in committing to water conservation. Water
conservation measures are mentioned in 60% of the NDCs analysed in ECA and ECLAC, and in all of the
NDCs analysed from ESCWA countries. However, only 24% of the ESCAP countries’ NDCs mention them.
Such water conservation measures include those based on natural infrastructure, such as wetlands and
rainwater harvesting, both of which can help to smooth the variability of rainfall by storing water, with
benefits for flood protection as well as water availability (Browder et al., 2019).
Most worrisome news: Across all regions there are few concrete project proposals that relate to waterrelevant climate adaptation. Over 80% of the countries reviewed in ECA and ESCWA specify a broad
portfolio of proposed actions in water in their NDCs, while only just over half of the countries in ECLAC
and ESCAP do so (Figure 10.4). Across all regions, however, the share of countries referring to detailed
water-related project proposals in their NDCs is much lower – under 20% of countries in ECA and ESCAP,
two of the six countries analysed in ESCWA, and none of the countries in ECLAC, nor the eight countries

considered in ECE.32 Since a robust pipeline of projects is a precondition for accessing needed finance
(WWC/GWP, 2018), the limited mention of such projects in the first round of NDCs (pre-2020) does
not bode well for swift implementation of these commitments. In all regions, countries are more likely
to include (usually high) estimates of the costs of their intended adaptation actions than they are to
mention detailed water project proposals. Importantly, while such costing exercises are essential, they
very much depend on attention paid to methodological challenges, which is difficult to confirm in the
absence of methodological details in many NDCs (Hedger, 2018a).

10.3

Sub-Saharan Africa – ECA perspective
10.3.1 Water-related climate change impacts on sectors and SDGs
Impacts of climate change on Africa’s water resources are already acute. For example, numerous
studies find that rainfall in southern Africa has decreased recently, probably as a result of climate
change (IPCC, 2014a; Bellprat et al., 2015; Funk et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2018). Such impacts will also
increasingly interact with multiple non-climate-related drivers of water scarcity and water pollution, such
as a growing population, economic development, and conflict and fragility, which are posing serious
challenges for meeting not only the water targets but also the other development targets defined in the
2030 Agenda and the Africa Union’s Agenda 2063. The impact of population increase will be particularly
pronounced on the African continent, where the population has been predicted to grow by more than
a half billion by 2050, increasing water stress, particularly in urbanizing regions (SDG 11) (Taylor et al.,
2009). Water-related impacts of climate change on human health are also expected, through vector- and
waterborne diseases (including by further challenging access to safe drinking water, sanitation and
hygiene) and via malnutrition, given expected impacts on food security (SDGs 3 and 2) (IPCC, 2014a).
Generally, existing economic and livelihood practices, like natural ecosystems, are vulnerable in the face
of climate change and poorly prepared to adapt without intervention. In agricultural systems, especially
in semi-arid areas, conventional livelihood-based approaches appear not robust enough to deal with the
long-term impacts of climate change (SDG 2) (IPCC, 2014a). Terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as well
as coastal areas, are highly vulnerable to sea level rise, land-based runoff and storms and storm surges
(SDGs 14 and 15) (CDKN, 2012; IPCC, 2014a).

32

132

Findings for the ECE region are likely an artefact of the low emphasis on adaptation action in this region’s NDCs and the limited
number of countries analysed.

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

The regional dimension of water-related climate change challenges is very strong across Sub-Saharan
Africa, and it translates across multiple other challenges – including those relating to security and peace.
Regional interdependence through hydropower in shared basins is high. By 2030, 70% and 59% of
hydropower capacity in eastern and southern Africa is set to be located in one cluster of rainfall variability,
respectively, increasing risks of concurrent disruption to power generation (Conway et al., 2017). At the
same time, climate change drives migration within the region. Some of the current patterns of
displacement can be directly linked to severe droughts (Owain and Maslin, 2018).

10.3.2 Policy responses: progress and challenges
The experience of water-related impacts of climate change in Sub-Saharan Africa is
exacerbated by policy contexts that suffer from challenges in coordination as well as
gaps in monitoring and research (IPCC, 2014a). This said, there have been important
advances since the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment (2014a), including efforts to build
capacity for policy, implementation and evidence-informed decision-making through
regional cooperation. One example is the Climate Resilient Infrastructure Development
Facility (CRIDF), which aims to provide long-term solutions to water issues affecting
poor communities in southern Africa. The facility has a strong emphasis on
cross-border action, supporting national and regional stakeholders to undertake
transboundary water sector projects by providing project preparation support,
facilitating access to funding, and technical assistance (CRIDF, 2018). Another is the
Climate Research for Development (CR4D) in Africa initiative, which seeks to tackle the
persistent gap between climate data and decision-making across the region (Conway
et al., 2015) by strengthening links between African climate science researchers and
policy-makers (UNECA/ACPC, 2019).

It is possible to prioritize water resources management in the context of climate change in key strategies,
including adaptation plans, national economic development plans and NDCs, as indicated by a more
in-depth review of three countries – Cameroon in Central Africa, Ghana in West Africa and Kenya in East
Africa (Table 10.1). In all three countries, water resources management is prioritized in the NDCs, climate
adaptation plans or planning frameworks. Importantly, water-related climate change is also recognized as
a cross-sectoral issue in Cameroon’s NDCs and Ghana’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Framework – not
as a concern for the water sector only, but for the country’s economy as a whole. Ghana and Kenya also
draw links between climate change and water resources management in their national development plans,
though they are still generally addressed as separate sectors or themes.
The modest levels of IWRM implementation in all three countries nonetheless point to challenges ahead
for multi-sectoral and integrated approaches to climate, water and development. Of concern is that
water is not given adequate attention, beyond a brief mention, as a climate connector in the context of
transboundary cooperation in the national development plans, NDCs or NAPs, despite the important
context of shared rivers and lakes in all of the three countries.

10.3.3 Opportunities to accelerate water–climate action at national and regional scale
The list of policies and actions towards climate change adaptation and mitigation that include or involve
water aspects is long. It includes supporting resilience to droughts and floods through investing in and
improving the climate resilience of water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities (Oates et al.,
2014); expanding social protection and introducing financial products like insurance (New Climate
Economy, 2018); enhancing gender equality in the use and management of water resources (Das, 2017);
and improving water availability for agriculture, including through water harvesting, mulching and reduced
tillage in rainfed systems (Keys and Falkenmark, 2018).
Finding windows of opportunity to turn these priorities from a wish list into actions means paying close
attention to political economy dynamics. Often, these have both national and regional dimensions, which
determine the space for collaboration in institution-building, information and investment. For example,
regional energy integration through power pools could reduce some of the climate vulnerabilities for
hydropower in southern and eastern Africa, allowing for trade across pools and diversification of the
energy generation mix within them. Energy is politically important to fulfil the ambitions of many African

Regional perspectives

133

countries in terms of economic transformation. As such, it could provide a catalyst to encourage
regional cooperation to address challenges at the water–energy–climate nexus, possibly opening
up investment in regional power pools and the institutional mechanisms for energy trading.
Political economy challenges to such solutions will need to be navigated, including national policies
towards energy sovereignty, entrenched interests, inefficiencies in state monopolies and years of
underinvestment in most countries (Conway et al., 2017).
There will always be opportunities where a clear business case for complementarity can drive
regional cooperation. Regional insurance pools such as that developed by the African Risk Capacity
(ARC) – a specialized agency of the African Union, of which Kenya, Ghana and 31 other states
are members – allow countries to share the financial risk of drought with their neighbours. At the
same time, the experiences of the countries in the sample show the importance of combining and
sequencing regional-scale and national-scale action. The regional insurance mechanism needs to
be backed up by country-level systems to channel pay-outs to those in need – for example, social
protection systems that can transfer the pay-outs to poor farmers or pastoralists, before they have
to sell off their assets in the event of drought (New Climate Economy, 2018). For such systems
to be viable in the long term, members of the insurance facility need to be sufficiently dispersed
geographically and climatically, so that droughts are unlikely to arise in all countries at once.
At the subregional scale, there are also opportunities to improve cooperation across river basins.
Cameroon, Ghana and Kenya, as well as other African countries, participate in international projects
in transboundary basins, including in the Niger, Volta and Lake Victoria basins (Table 10.1), in spite
of the limited explicit attention to water–climate action with a transboundary character in their
national climate and economic development strategies. This highlights the important role of basin
and regional organizations as facilitators and implementers of water-related adaptation actions.
It also indicates that there may be potential for transboundary cooperation on climate change
to become a catalyst for strengthening the water dimension of national climate and economic
planning (World Bank, 2017c).

10.4

Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia – ECE perspective
10.4.1 Water-related climate change impacts on sectors and SDGs
Climate projections indicate increasing precipitation in northern Europe and decreasing
precipitation in southern Europe. A marked increase in high-temperature extremes, meteorological
droughts and heavy precipitation events is projected, but with variations across Europe. Uncertainty
is higher in Central Asia, with spatial variation in historic trends and inconsistency in projected
changes for both precipitation and dryness/droughts. The IPCC highlights increasing challenges for
irrigation, hydropower, ecosystems and human settlements in the Europe region (SDGs 2, 7, 11 and
15) (IPCC, 2014a). The possibility for both floods and droughts to amplify health challenges, such as
water-related diseases, is also a key issue for the region (SDG 3) (UNECE/WHO Regional Office for
Europe, 2011).
As in other regions, the water-related impacts of climate change also overlay regionally important
social, economic and political drivers and stressors. Most important for the ECE region are the
high and increasing level of development in many basins. For irrigation, for example, this means
that demand will increase, but potential will be constrained not only by reduced runoff but also
by increasing demand from other sectors (IPCC, 2014a). Other regionally important drivers can
potentially facilitate climate–water integration – for example the comparatively strong political
incentive provided by European Union (EU) membership and the resulting encouragement to comply
with the Water Framework and Floods Directives (Box 10.1).

10.4.2 Policy responses: progress and challenges
The region comprises mainly advanced economies, with generally high levels of IWRM implementation
(Figure 10.1). However, this is not universally the case. A deeper look at three middle-income countries –
Kazakhstan, The Republic of North Macedonia and Ukraine (Table 10.2) – shows, firstly, that these countries
have self-rated their progress in implementing IWRM as ‘low’ or ‘medium low’, indicating the need to improve
water policies, institutions, management instruments and resources as a foundation for managing climate
responses and impacts through water. Secondly, climate and economic strategies in Kazakhstan and Ukraine
do not deal specifically with the links between climate change and water. While improving water management
is recognized as a priority in the national development plans of all three countries, an explicit link to climate
change is only made by the Republic of North Macedonia.
The Republic of North Macedonia’s NDC is also the only one to mention water issues, namely hydropower.
This lack of emphasis on water in the NDCs is partly explained by the fact that in all three countries the NDCs
focus on mitigation – Kazakhstan and Ukraine, in particular, have high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
The National Communications are generally more detailed, and in Kazakhstan and the Republic of North
Macedonia they treat water issues more extensively. Although no separate national-level adaptation plan
was identified in either country, a concept for adaptation has been developed for Ukraine, containing several
measures that relate to water.
Furthermore, Kazakhstan and Ukraine have been attempting to tackle climate and water as integrated issues
at a regional level, within transboundary basins. The Dniester River is one of the largest basins in Ukraine
and the largest in the Republic of Moldova, supplying water to a significant population and supporting a
wide range of industries, including food, forestry and hydropower production. In 2015, high-level government
representatives from the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine jointly signed a Strategic Framework for Adaptation
to Climate Change, which was developed by expert representatives in consultation with environment, water
and sectoral authorities from both countries, with the support of UNECE and the Organisation for Security
and Co‑operation (OSCE). The Strategic Framework identifies areas of joint actions at the basin level that
require transboundary cooperation. The measures were further developed and financially assessed in
the implementation plan for the Strategic Framework, and some have already been implemented. These
activities have not only increased the adaptive capacity in the basin, but also promoted transboundary water
cooperation more broadly, by facilitating the entry into force of the transboundary Dniester Treaty in 2017 and
the establishment of the Dniester Commission in 2018.
In the case of Kazakhstan, meanwhile, climate adaptation planning in the Chu-Talas basin, shared with
Kyrgyzstan, was enabled by careful facilitation and sequencing of activities, policy developments backed
with concrete adaptation measures on the ground, and the engagement of local stakeholders as a route to
influencing national decision-makers (Box 10.2).
These examples are not necessarily representative of the ECE region as a whole though. National reports
on transboundary cooperation under the Water Convention (UNECE, 2018b) show that in less than a third of
the responses climate change adaptation was included as an area of cooperation under the activities of the
joint bodies and operational transboundary arrangements. At the same time, there was frequent inclusion of
flood and drought risk management (up to 85% of the responses) as an area for cooperation under both joint
bodies and operational transboundary arrangements. While recent climate extremes have therefore been a
focus for transboundary cooperation, there is room to increase the focus on adaptation in many basins.

10.4.3 Opportunities to accelerate water–climate action at the national and regional scale
The key actions for more effective adaptation and more resilience to extremes in the region, both within
individual countries and in transboundary basins, include: integrated management of water resources,
including across country boundaries; enhanced water efficiency and water saving strategies (IPCC, 2014a);
monitoring and data sharing on water quantity and quality as well as disasters as a basis for climate change
adaptation strategies, plans and measures; improving coherence of climate change adaptation and waterrelated DRR (UNECE/UNDRR, 2018); translating strategies and agreements into practice through traditional
and innovative actions, including nature-based solutions (NBS) (UNECE/INBO, 2015); and attracting and
combining funding from multiple sources (e.g. international, national and private), including for climate
change adaptation in transboundary basins (World Bank, 2019).

Box 10.2 Lessons from integrating climate change adaption into planning processes in the Chu-Talas basin in
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan
The Chu and Talas Rivers are the major sources of water for agriculture and they support the livelihoods of more than
three million people in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The Chu-Talas basin is highly vulnerable to climate change, with a
likelihood of increasing aridity and overall declining water availability (UNECE/UNDP, 2018).
Initial climate change adaptation activities started in the basin in 2010 with modelling of climate change impacts and a
vulnerability assessment, which was then elaborated into a set of climate change adaptation measures, covering issues
from water quality to monitoring and education. These were further assessed against their cost/effectiveness and
integrated into a transboundary diagnostic analysis (TDA) and a Strategic Action Program (SAP). The SAP, when approved,
will become the main document for transboundary management in the basin, facilitating cooperation, planning, funding
and implementation. Lessons from the process include:
• Joint bodies play a crucial role for climate change adaption in transboundary basins. A Joint Bilateral Chu-Talas Water
Commission allowed for discussing problems and finding solutions.
• Transboundary adaptation strategies can support national adaptation, sectoral strategies and nationally determined
contributions (NDCs), and vice versa. For example, sectoral climate change adaptation plans for disaster risk reduction,
forestry, biodiversity, agriculture and water resources in Kyrgyzstan were developed in coordination with (and
complemented by) the transboundary adaptation activities in the Chu-Talas basin.
• Strategic documents can be backed by demonstrated implementation of adaptation measures. Reforestation, public
awareness and sustainable irrigation on the ground in Kyrgyzstan complemented the integration of climate change into
the TDA and SAP.
• Involving local stakeholders in discussing adaptation measures helps communication with decision-makers at national
and transboundary levels, given that implementation of the adaptation measures often takes place at the local level.

However valid they are, these prescriptions remain a wish list for many countries in the region. Costs of
adaptation in the water sector of the ECE region can be high. Assessment of adaptation costs, performed
as part of the adaptation strategies and plans for selected basins (the Chu-Talas, the Dniester and the
Neman River basins), revealed that the approximate costs for adaptation among the water-related sectors
amounted to roughly €200 million each (UNEP/UNECE, 2015; UNECE, 2017; ENVSEC/UNECE/OSCE, 2017).
However, the funding gap can also be lower, given that the region is comparatively wealthy and the costs
are (or will be) already partly covered by the relevant sectoral programmes and projects.
This points to a window of opportunity created by the diversity of economies in the region. When it comes
to improving water–climate integration in transboundary basins, technical and financial assistance can
be shared up- or downstream, from wealthier to poorer riparian countries. As an example, the Danube
basin is shared by some of the wealthiest as well as some of the poorest countries in Europe. Here, the
International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) is a leader among transboundary
river basin commissions in responding to climate change. The first Strategy on Adaptation to Climate
Change for the Danube basin was developed in 2012. Based on this, the ICPDR fully integrated climate
adaptation issues in the Danube River basin and Flood Risk Management Plans in 2015. The strategy
was updated in 2018, including a review of the knowledge base, stakeholder consultations and necessary
efforts, in order to reflect the latest science as well as evolving legislative and policy instruments at the EU
and the country levels. To encourage integration of climate change adaptation into Danube basin planning
processes, the ICPDR has made climate change adaptation a mandatory issue to incorporate into updated
Danube River basin and Flood Risk Management Plans. The strategy also promotes multilateral and
transboundary cooperation action in the context of climate change adaptation (ICPDR, 2019), serving as a
common reference for national policy-makers from countries at different stages of development.
This said, even where funds are available, transboundary water management can be politically difficult.
This points to the need to find a politically salient entry point around which to build cooperation. In
some cases, climate change itself can be the factor that opens up the opportunity for cooperation on
transboundary management – as was the case on the Dniester.

10.5

Latin America and the Caribbean – ECLAC perspective
10.5.1 Water-related climate change impacts on sectors and SDGs
Changes in climate variability and extreme events already severely affect Latin America and the Caribbean.
In South and Central America, streamflow and water availability changes are observed and projected
to continue, affecting already vulnerable regions. In South America, retreat of the Andean cryosphere
will change seasonal streamflow distribution. The IPCC predicts with high confidence that water supply
shortages will increase in already vulnerable semi-arid regions, with reduced precipitation and increased
evapotranspiration, affecting cities, hydropower generation and agriculture (SDGs 11, 7 and 2) (IPCC,
2014a). Increasing dryness is also expected in Central America and Mexico, though with lower confidence
in the south of the subregion. In the Caribbean subregion, drought risk is projected to increase, especially
if temperatures rise with more than 1.5°C. The Caribbean islands also face threats from sea level rise,
including salinization, flooding and pressure on ecosystems (SDG 14) (IPCC, 2018b).
Rapid urbanization, economic development and inequality are among the key socio-economic drivers of
pressure on water systems in Latin America and the Caribbean with which water-related climate impacts
intersect. Poverty is persistent in most countries in the region, contributing to the vulnerability to climatic
change. Economic inequality also translates into inequality in access to water and sanitation, and vice
versa. Increasing risks of waterborne diseases with climate change (IPCC, 2014a) have a greater impact on
poor people (SDGs 1 and 3). In the face of economic development priorities, water is needed to meet both
sectoral (domestic, agriculture, energy) and ecosystem needs, posing persistent challenges for sustainable
water resources management. Countries in South and Central America meet 60% of their energy demand
through hydropower, while at the same time land use change for food production and bioenergy exerts
pressure on water resources (SDG 15) (IPCC, 2014a). Over 80% of the region’s population lives in urban
areas (UNDESA, 2019), and droughts have been linked to reduced employment and labour incomes in Latin
American cities (SDGs 8 and 11) (Desbureaux and Rodella, 2019). Vulnerability to water-related impacts
of climate change is also high in rural areas, with climatic factors limiting economic options and driving
out-migration. For example, in 2014, a significant increase in the number of Guatemalans seeking access
to the United States of America (USA) coincided with the onset of El Niño-related drought conditions in the
Central American Dry Corridor (Steffens, 2018). Climate change is expected to intensify drought risk here,
forcing more poor rural families to migrate out of the region (SDG 10) (UNECLAC, 2018).

10.5.2 Policy responses: progress and challenges
A more in-depth assessment of three countries from across the region – Chile in South America, Grenada
in the Caribbean and Guatemala in Central America (Table 10.3) – illustrates some of the progress and
remaining challenges facing ECLAC countries in tackling climate change through water. The countries’
climate strategies – as evidenced in Adaptation Plans and NDCs – reveal some positive intentions.
For example, Chile and Guatemala’s NDCs recognize water-related impacts and response measures
across multiple sectors. Grenada’s NAP’s Programme of Action 3 (out of 12) aims to establish a ‘climateresponsive water governance structure’, recognizing the need for institutional development across
planning, policy and information systems, alongside infrastructure.
The selected countries’ national development plans tend to recognize water-related impacts of climate
change and in some cases the importance of water management to economic development. However, they
do not explicitly treat water management and climate change as interlinked sectors requiring integrated
responses. Moreover, despite the cross-sectoral treatment of water issues in the countries’ climate
strategies, their progress in implementing IWRM suggests there will be challenges in integrating water
and climate action in practice. All three countries self-rate ‘low’ in IWRM implementation in the SDG 6.5.1
baseline assessment, as do close to half of the countries across the region (Figure 10.1).
Considering transboundary aspects, none of the three strategies examined for Chile and Guatemala
address water as an international climate connector across transboundary basins (Grenada has no
transboundary basins).

10.5.3 Opportunities to accelerate water–climate action at the national and regional scale
For many countries in the region, climate change occurs against a backdrop of high levels of intersectoral
competition for water, including between urban areas, the energy and agriculture sectors, and ecosystem
needs. These countries therefore need to avoid the risk of maladapted responses. Modelling of NDC
commitments in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico identified that mitigation pledges could exacerbate
conflicts regarding the use of energy, water and land resources – principally due to increased water demand
for electricity generation and crop and biomass irrigation (Da Silva et al., 2018). The nascent signs of policy
integration across water, climate and other SDGs in the countries in Table 10.3 are a first step towards
managing trade-offs. However, slow progress implementing IWRM suggests a need for renewing effort. In this
respect, UNECLAC and the German Agency for International Cooperation GmbH (GIZ) have had some success
utilizing water–energy–food nexus framings as an entry point for policy dialogue in the region – for example
in helping Costa Rican policy-makers tackle long-running conflicts between different uses such as hydropower
and irrigation in the Reventazón River basin (Jouravlev, 2018).
Countries in the region will also need to find additional funds to make progress towards their water goals
while ensuring that enough water is available for their other development goals, and while adapting their
water-related systems and infrastructure to climatic changes. Climate Change Policy Assessments (CCPA),
jointly supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, can help countries manage
their climate response through a macroeconomic and fiscal lens. A recently completed CCPA for Grenada
suggests that the Government needs to improve its fiscal position and reduce debt levels and financing needs,
by making further reforms to its Fiscal Responsibility Law. This would in turn provide more space for climaterelated investment, for example in resilient infrastructure. Grenada’s policy and legal frameworks can also be
improved to attract private investment into relevant sectors for climate change adaptation and mitigation (IMF,
2019), including water.
At the regional level, the limited explicit mention of transboundary water–climate issues in Chile and
Guatemala’s climate and development strategies is symptomatic of wider challenges in cooperation on
transboundary waters in Latin America and the Caribbean – at least as defined against SDG Indicator 6.5.2.
The Indicator 6.5.2 baseline assessment estimated that only a quarter of transboundary basin areas (river,
lake or aquifer) were covered by operational arrangements for water cooperation.33 Only one country, Ecuador,
has operational agreements in place for all its transboundary basins (UNECE/UNESCO/UN-Water, 2018).
The very same baseline assessment points to opportunities to couple efforts to enhance transboundary
cooperation with other issues, including climate change, helping to catalyse dialogue and to ensure
that synergies are maintained. Central American countries have already had some success embedding
transboundary water cooperation arrangements within wider treaties, for example on environmental
protection. Examples include the arrangements between Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, and between
Guatemala and Mexico (UNECE/UNESCO/UN-Water, 2018). The progress of using climate change as an entry
point to broader transboundary cooperation, like the cooperation in the Dniester River basin highlighted in the
preceding section, points to similar potential in the ECLAC region.

Asia and the Pacific – ESCAP perspective
10.6.1 Water-related climate change impacts on sectors and SDGs
There is high variation and low confidence in projected water-related impacts of climate change at the
subregional scale in Asia and the Pacific (IPCC, 2014a). Water-related climate impacts intersect with other
socio-economic trends that impact water quality and quantity, including industrialization (which is reshaping
sectoral demand for water and increasing pollution), population growth and rapid urbanization. The latter
have also increased exposure to water-related natural hazards such as floods (UNESCAP/UNESCO/ILO/
UN Environment/FAO/UN-Water, 2018).

Regional perspectives

The region is highly vulnerable to climate-induced disasters and extreme weather events, which
are disproportionately burdening poor and vulnerable groups (SDGs 1 and 11) (UNDRR/UNFCCC/
UN Environment Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, 2019). In August 2017 alone, intense monsoon
rains affected 40 million people in Bangladesh, India and Nepal, claiming nearly 1,300 lives and putting
1.1 million people in relief camps. Floods could cost South Asia as much as US$215 billion each year by
2030 (UNESCAP/ADB/UNDP, 2018). Floods are also expected to contaminate water sources, destroy water
points and sanitation facilities, and therefore pose a challenge to universal access to sustainable water and
sanitation services (SDG 6) (UNESCAP/UNESCO/ILO/UN Environment/FAO/UN-Water, 2018).
Climate change and increasing demand for water will put stress on the region’s groundwater resources, as
the availability of surface water is affected by increasing climate variability. Groundwater use in the region
could increase by 30% by 2050 (ADB, 2016). The increase in demand for irrigation has already led to severe
groundwater stress in some areas, especially in two of Asia’s major ‘food baskets’ – the North China Plain
and Northwest India (SDG 2) (Shah, 2005).

10.6.2 Policy responses: progress and challenges
A more in-depth assessment of three countries across the region – Bangladesh, China and Indonesia –
illustrates the differing degrees of progress on tackling water and climate change in an integrated manner
(Table 10.4). Bangladesh and Indonesia rate their progress on implementing IWRM lower than China.
Concluding from its national development plan, NDC and adaptation plans, Bangladesh appears to have
gone relatively far in ensuring that water and climate change are approached synergistically. Water issues
are also recognized in China and Indonesia’s climate strategies, even though integrated treatment of water
and climate is less evidenced in their national development plans than it is for Bangladesh.
The desk-based analysis for this chapter did not identify any transboundary initiatives with a strong climate
change dimension in the three countries of the sample, though this may correspond with a wider gap
in reporting on transboundary cooperation across the Asia region (UNECE/UNESCO/UN-Water, 2018).
Transboundary water issues are briefly mentioned in the national development plans of Bangladesh and
China, but were not identified in their respective climate strategies.

10.6.3 Opportunities to accelerate water–climate action at the national and regional scale
At the national level, identified priorities include: enhancing water governance and water productivity to
manage competition between the water needs of agriculture, energy, industry, cities and ecosystems (ADB,
2016; IPCC, 2014a); promoting NBS that can curb emissions and increase resilience (IPCC 2018b); and
integrating climate change and DRR across the entire project and policy cycle (UNDRR/UNFCCC/
UN Environment Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, 2019).

Climate change can

policy reforms

wider pressures on
water, and open up
opportunities for
action on these kinds

challenges for water
management

142

Climate change could have a negative effect on the required integration of policymaking and delivery, adding uncertainty and complexity, and making it harder to
achieve these priorities. However, climate change can also help catalyse policy
reforms that respond to wider pressures on water, and open up opportunities for
action on these kinds of long-standing challenges for water management. One
example comes from the North China Plain, one of China’s most important foodgrowing areas and home to more than 400 million people (Kang and Eltahir, 2018).
Here, the threat of climate change partly justifies a concerted response to declining
groundwater levels, even though the immediate driver of change is intensive irrigation.
In Hebei province, for example, abstraction is being measured indirectly via energy
consumption (electricity meters on pumps); new hydrogeological models are being
used to predict the response of the groundwater system to changes in abstraction,
rainfall and longer-term climatic conditions; and economic and regulatory levers are
being used to bring withdrawals in line (gradually) with projected water availability. Not
all actions are popular with farmers, but climate change provides a politically neutral
rationale to drive water policy dialogue and reform (Li et al., 2018).

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

As in other regions, cooperation between countries will help drive and strengthen national actions. In the
area of investment, an estimated incremental investment of US$21–47 billion by 2030 is needed to make
water and sanitation infrastructure climate-resilient across Asia and the Pacific. Many countries, including
Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), face not only a shortfall in
finance but also difficulty in accessing and attracting funds. These countries will need support to increase
investment readiness, for example in order to help prepare a pipeline of fundable projects. This assistance
can come from international and regional organizations but can also be further enhanced through crosscountry exchanges among countries in Asia and the Pacific (UNDRR/UNFCCC/UN Environment Regional
Office for Asia and the Pacific, 2019).
Regional cooperation on investment and information, as well as on institutional areas such as governance,
capacity and partnerships, is urgently needed in Asia’s transboundary basins. These basins face enormous
challenges resulting from development – including urbanization, hydropower and pollution – and from
climate change.
Bangladesh, for example, comprises the largest delta in the world. It lies at the confluence of three major
global rivers draining land in Bhutan, China, India and Nepal, but has only 7% of the catchment area of
these basins (Rasheed, 2008). The current national development plan recognizes that Bangladesh cannot
undertake meaningful water resource development programmes on its own and aims to strike new
transboundary agreements (Table 10.4). So far, however, a water-sharing agreement is in place for only
one of its 57 transboundary rivers – the Ganges, with India (UN Environment, 2017). More progress has
been made on tackling water-related climate issues in the Mekong River basin, which is expected to be
home to 83 million people by 2060 (MRC, 2016). This shows how climate change has provided a focal
point for regional cooperation, but also illustrates how it can further complicate integrated management,
for example by creating additional trade-offs around hydropower (Box 10.3).

Box 10.3 Climate change – complicating and driving transboundary cooperation on the Mekong
The Mekong River basin has seen energetic efforts to develop transboundary responses to climate change, especially in
the lower basin. Here, significant infrastructural and socio-economic changes are already exerting huge pressure, including
dams that disrupt environmental flows, as well as fish migration (Evers and Pathirana, 2018). In addition, the El Niño effect
and climate change are causing the monsoon season to shorten. In 2019, water levels dropped to their lowest level in
100 years, although water management decisions upstream, including retention of flows for hydropower, were also an
exacerbating factor (Lovgren, 2019).
In the Lower Mekong basin, member countries of the Mekong River Commission (MRC) – Cambodia, Lao People's
Democratic Republic, Thailand and Viet Nam – developed the Mekong Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and Action
Plan (MRC, 2018). As an example of climate change adaptation, offering a focal point and enabler for transboundary
cooperation on water, the Strategy sets out seven strategic priorities, including: mainstreaming climate change into
national and regional policy, planning and programming; supporting access to adaptation finance; and enhancing regional
and international partnerships and cooperation on adaptation (MRC, 2018).
Implementing full transboundary adaptation on the Mekong will be challenging. China, whose territory constitutes around
a fifth of the basin and which contributes 16% of the Mekong River basin flow is not a member of the MRC, and nor
is Myanmar, which also accounts for a small share of the territory and flow (Evers and Pathirana, 2018). All countries
have justified development ambitions, for which water is essential. While energy security is often a major consideration
for countries developing their hydropower resources, emissions mitigation can also be used to justify hydropower
developments, illustrating how climate change can complicate existing trade-offs in water management. The science on
the climate-related benefits and costs of hydropower are, moreover, uncertain: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from
the Mekong’s hydropower have been found to vary significantly (Räsänen et al., 2018), as have the projected impacts of
climate change on hydropower production, via changes in runoff (MRC, 2018). Such uncertainties need to be properly
addressed through appropriate and robust options appraisal, which must also incorporate the value of ecosystem services
as well as the species that depend on the river and its natural flows. The MRC and member countries’ efforts on climate
change adaptation are an important start, however, and offer a signal for scaling up cooperation on climate change in
transboundary basins across Asia.

The Seventh Five Year Plan (2016–2020) includes
separate strategies for agriculture and water resources,
and sustainable development, environment and climate
change. Climate change is recognized as one of the ten
challenges for the water sector and one of the fourteen
water sub-strategies. In the context of the 100-year
Delta Plan (BDP 100), building a climate-resilient society
is recognized as a first challenge for the water sector
(Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh,
2015). Climate change screening tools have also been
integrated into Annual Development Plans (ADPs).

The NDC identifies an adaptation
goal with ten key areas of action,
of which eight relate to water
management issues, even though
water linkages are not always
explicitly stated. These areas
include food security, disaster
management, coastal zone
management, and communitybased conservation of wetlands
and coastal areas.

Bangladesh was one of the first LDCs to submit
its National Adaptation Programme of Action
(NAPA) in 2005. It was updated in 2009. The
Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and
Action Plan (BCCSAP) was approved in 2009,
and ran until 2018. Most of the 44 priority
programmes have direct or indirect links to water
management. They include crop improvement,
drought management, disaster management,
and infrastructure and knowledge management
(Ministry of Environment and Forests of
Bangladesh, 2009). A National Adaptation Plan is

Water resources is a key area
of focus for adaptation, where

In the National Adaptation Strategy (NAS),

priority area. A variety of conservation, ecological
restoration and use strategies are being promoted
to help the water sector adapt while managing
complex demands (National Development and
Reform Commission, 2013).

In China’s Five-Year Plan (2016–2020), a priority is
to strengthen water security, including through a

Other areas of intervention include protection of water
resources and the control of water pollution through
IWRM.

Indonesia’s Five-Year Strategic Plan (RPJMN 2015–2019)
recognizes climate change as a cross-sectoral threat.
Water security is a priority goal. The document lists
activities to improve watershed conservation, water
availability, and access to drinking water and sanitation

Western Asia and North Africa – ESCWA perspective
10.7.1 Water-related climate change impacts on sectors and SDGs
Vulnerability to climate change is moderate to high across the region, with a generally increasing gradient
from north to south. This is a headline finding of the RICCAR, an important example of a region-specific
impact and vulnerability assessment with a strong focus on water-related impacts. RICCAR projects largely
decreasing precipitation trends across the region until the end of the century. Runoff and evapotranspiration
generally follow the same trends as precipitation, although evapotranspiration is limited by water scarcity
constraints in some areas. Temperatures in the Arab region are increasing, and under a high-emissions
scenario are expected to continue to increase until the end of the century to up to 4–5°C above their
preindustrial levels (FAO/GIZ/ACSAD, 2017; UNESCWA et al., 2017).
Areas with highest vulnerability to climate change are in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel and the southwestern
part of the Arabian Peninsula. These are adaptation hotspots, irrespective of the sector studied or the
projected climate scenario, and they comprise several of the region’s LDCs. While their exposure to climate
change varies, they all exhibit low adaptive capacity. Even where areas are expected to witness increases in
precipitation and moderate average temperature rises – as is the case in most of the Horn of Africa – low
levels of adaptive capacity leave people highly vulnerable. Based on projected change in water availability
and adaptive capacity, areas most vulnerable in relation to water are the upper Nile Valley, the southwestern
part of the Arabian Peninsula and the northern part of the Horn of Africa (UNESCWA et al., 2017).
Intersecting with broad challenges of climate change and limited adaptive capacity are complex socioeconomic and political dynamics, affecting water at the regional, national and subnational levels.
Politicization and weaponization of water resources, displacement, and degradation of water infrastructure
have been major challenges for countries affected by conflict (UNESCWA/IOM, 2017; UNESCWA, 2018).
Inequalities in access to and control of water resources persist, especially across urban–rural and gender
lines (UNESCWA/BGR, 2013; UNESCWA, 2018). Almost all Arab states are highly interdependent, as they
often rely on shared, strategically important transboundary surface and groundwater resources. This
compounds the challenges of achieving coherent, integrated water policy at the national level (UNESCWA
et al., 2017).
The water-related impacts of climate change, exacerbated by these other water management challenges,
threaten the achievement of numerous SDGs besides SDG 6. For example, the World Bank has identified
Western Asia and North Africa as the regions facing the greatest economic threats from water scarcity
exacerbated by climate change – costing up to 6% of gross domestic product by 2050 (SDG 8) (World Bank,
2016a). In the agriculture sector, over half the surface area of the Arab region’s major cropland systems
are in the two highest-vulnerability classes according to the RICCAR assessment, with the Nile valley, the
southwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula, the Tigris-Euphrates basin and western parts of North Africa
being the most vulnerable. The combined changes in temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration
will also threaten the food resource base for livestock, may induce the collapse of certain fish stocks, and
could potentially reduce forest productivity (SDG 2) (FAO/GIZ/ACSAD, 2017). Changes in temperature could
increase the risk of some water-related diseases, including diarrhoea and schistosomiasis. Where women
and children bear the burden of water-related household tasks, gender-based vulnerabilities may also arise
(SDG 3 and 5) (UNU-INWEH, 2017).

10.7.2 Policy responses: progress and challenges
A more in-depth assessment of three countries across the region – Jordan, Mauritania and Tunisia – shows
a commitment to integrating water-related climate challenges in key strategy documents (Table 10.5).
Jordan’s national development plan recognizes water-related impacts of climate change as a threat to
development, while its NDC stands out for including water-related mitigation actions, rather than treating
water only as an adaptation issue. Mauritania’s NDC prioritizes water-related adaptation actions and, as
noted, its NAPA gives prominence to IWRM as an adaptation solution. Tunisia and Jordan’s NDCs both
mention water-related actions across other sectors, besides the water sector, implicitly acknowledging the
contribution to other SDGs. However, the examples also point to certain gaps. In Tunisia and Mauritania’s
national development plans, the relevance of water management for addressing climate change is not
mentioned. Despite the emphasis on IWRM and related institutional measures in Mauritania’s NAPA,
the NDC does not explicitly prioritize institutional strengthening for water management. The level of

IWRM implementation in all three countries suggests that significant action is needed to improve water
management as a foundation for managing climate change impacts. Tunisia and Jordan’s self-rated
implementation progress scores ‘medium high’, and Mauritania’s ‘medium low’ (UN Environment, 2018).
Beyond the national level, mention of transboundary water issues in a context of climate change is limited,
despite their relevance for the countries considered. For example, in the Medjerda basin shared by Algeria
and Tunisia, RICCAR modelling projects significantly drier conditions, with an increase in severe and
extreme droughts in the high-emissions scenario. The Medjerda River contributes to the water supply of
half the Tunisian population and underpins food security. Both countries meanwhile are grappling with
the implications of utilizing this shared resource for development purposes, including plans for expanding
hydropower, and dealing with already challenging issues of sedimentation and pollution. No adaptation plan
would be entirely complete without building transboundary cooperation in the Medjerda basin.
The other two countries, however, have embarked on some regional projects that seek to harness the
role of water as a ‘climate connector’. One example is the Senegal River Basin Climate Change Resilience
Development Project, which aims to strengthen transboundary management of water in the basin, including
through climate change adaptation, across Guinea, Mali, Mauritania and Senegal. Another example seeks
to address climate change-related water challenges facing displaced people in urban host settlements in
Jordan, recognizing that water also acts as a ‘climate connector’ through human displacement (Table 10.5).

10.7.3 Opportunities to accelerate water–climate action at the national and regional
scale
At the Regional Consultation on Climate Change for the 2019 Arab Forum for Sustainable Development
(AFSD) and the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) (UNESCWA, 2018), regional stakeholders identified many
priorities and opportunities relating to water, including:
• Sustainable urban development, to ensure water supply, sanitation and wastewater treatment, and
manage flood risk in a changing climate;
• Enhancing data, research and innovation, including seasonal and subseasonal climate predictions at
the regional level, research on climate-adapted agriculture, and development and use of adaptation
monitoring tools and metrics;
• Increasing the resilience of vulnerable communities exposed to floods and droughts, and threatened
by food insecurity, including through the use of social protection mechanisms such as weather index
insurance, and economic diversification;
• Policy integration between mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development, and between climate
and the water–food–energy nexus; mainstreaming of climate change into national strategies, policies
and programmes; and policy enforcement (e.g. for water efficiency policies); and
• Increasing access to finance, including via international climate funds and through the development
of local markets and investment products, such as green sukuk bonds,34 with appropriate capacity
support for developing bankable projects.
Although these priorities point to the means of implementation, country stakeholders will need to seize
windows of opportunity in the national political economy to convert them into action, starting in areas
where the co-benefits of addressing water and climate together can be demonstrated relatively easily,
and build a case that can convince others. On the investment theme, Jordan’s experience in wastewater
management offers an example, with impacts across many of the above priorities. In terms of increasing
access to finance in order to address water-related climate change, Jordan’s initiatives to attract blended
finance for wastewater show how targeted public and international support can enable a return on
investment for private investors in water reuse and efficiency projects.

Bank, 2019).

The As-Samra Wastewater Treatment was initially designed in 2003 to treat wastewater for 2.3 million
inhabitants of Amman and supply treated wastewater for irrigation to the surrounding region. Upgrading
the plant became necessary, due to rapid population growth and an influx of refugees. This was completed
in 2015, utilising US$223 million in blended finance sourced from the Government of Jordan (9%), the
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) (42%), and private debt and equity financing (49%). As well as
providing international funding that addressed a ‘viability gap’ for private investors, MCC also acted as
transaction advisors in preparing the project (World Bank, 2016c), again underscoring the importance
of project preparation support from international or regional organizations. Existing water scarcity and
population growth, rather than climate change, provided the original motive (World Bank, 2016c). However, in
2018, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the EU agreed to support a further
expansion in capacity, aiming for multiple co-benefits: increasing local communities’ resilience, recovering
energy from treated sludge and water flows (thus increasing energy security and climate change mitigation),
and addressing additional needs created by the Syrian refugee crisis (Zgheib, 2018). Across the ESCWA
countries, climate change could act as an additional motivator for blended finance to invest in water reuse
and efficiency (especially where water scarcity is set to increase) and in energy recovery from wastewater.
Looking at opportunities at the regional level, the 2019 Regional Consultation Outcome Document
(UNESCWA, 2018) emphasizes opportunities for regional climate outlook forums to strengthen the
interaction between climate-sensitive sectors and climate information service providers. This speaks to the
information theme, and RICCAR is itself a positive example cited in the Document. Though not mentioned in
the Outcome Document, addressing water-related climate change impacts at the transboundary basin scale
will be crucial for ESCWA countries, including with regards to the transboundary aquifers on which many are
dependent (UNECE/UNESCO/UN-Water, 2018).

10.8

Conclusion: fostering water and climate action through
regional learning and collaboration
This chapter reviewed the NDCs of 80 countries across the UN REC regions. Fifteen countries were
analysed in greater depth, also covering national development strategies and adaptation plans. This
analysis leads to clear implications for strategy formulation, and for closing the gap between strategy and
implementation, with tasks falling to both national and regional-level stakeholders.
Three clear gaps emerge in the NDCs and other strategies considered – relatively easy wins for the next
round of NDCs to address. Firstly, water-mediated climate risks and responses are too often framed as
water sector issues, rather than cross-sectoral challenges that span across the SDGs – affecting areas
such as agriculture, energy, health, industry, cities and ecosystems. Secondly, water’s role in mitigation
is overlooked, despite the need to manage water-related trade-offs in mitigation choices (for example
in hydropower development), and exploit co-benefits, such as emissions reduction through wastewater
treatment (via biogas), or water efficiency measures. The third and most important gap, from the regional
perspective, is water’s role as a climate connector, both in transboundary basins and in communities linked
by shared climates. Migration, energy and food flows will also be importantly reshaped by the water-related
impacts of climate change.
Beyond these gaps, other lessons point to the ways in which strategies can better lay the ground
for leveraging the water–climate relationship in practice – i.e. with an eye to securing finance and
moving to implementation. For example, some countries still need to resist the temptation to prioritize
costly infrastructure in their NDCs as a means of attracting international climate finance, without the
corresponding institutional strengthening and reform. Many countries could also make better use of
existing water strategies when framing their climate strategies, given that climate invariably interacts with
multiple drivers and stressors that water managers are already familiar with. Alternatives and complements
to infrastructure and supply side measures, including demand management and NBS, should also feature
more strongly in efforts to manage climate variability and change through water – not only in climate plans
but also in land use, urban development and river basin plans (Browder et al., 2019). Finally, the precision
and quality of project proposals in the water–climate space needs to improve if climate finance is to flow in
the volumes needed to address the challenges ahead (see Chapter 12).

While the national
level will continue
to be instrumental
in tackling climate
change, regional
approaches
to support
transformative shifts
in implementation at
the national level can
play a critical role

Ensuring that water–climate action is appropriately framed in NDCs, NAPs, and in
national economic and sectoral strategies is a critical first step, but the gap between
strategy and implementation cannot be closed with words alone. The 2018 review
of SDG Indicator 6.5.1 and 6.5.2 showed that many countries have struggled to
implement IWRM (even under an implicit assumption of climate stationarity) and to
establish agreements with their neighbours to govern management of transboundary
basins. The urgency imposed by climate change increases the need to accelerate
implementation on both counts – to avoid maladaptation and to tap into both
mitigation and adaptation co-benefits.
While the national level will continue to be instrumental in tackling climate change,
regional approaches to support transformative shifts in implementation at the
national level can play a critical role. Three areas emerge as important: improving
collaboration and coordination between responsible institutions; ensuring that action
is based on sound information and evidence; and increasing access to both public
and private finance for climate-resilient investment.

On institutions, climate change has been shown to offer an entry point for regional dialogue and
cooperation on water, whether at the project or strategy level (e.g. in the Chu-Talas, Mekong, Niger, Volta
and Victoria basins) or, at its most powerful, in catalysing establishment of broader transboundary
agreements and institutions, as in the Dniester basin.
Regional organizations have an obvious role here to commission and disseminate knowledge and
information on climate and water. The RICCAR and CR4D initiatives highlighted in this chapter also point
to the benefits of involving scientists and promoting uptake of information by key decision-makers from
the outset, to ensure efforts are grounded in national and regional decision-making contexts, and to ensure
water-related climate information is actually used. Collaboration on information-sharing has long provided
an important anchor for broader collaboration on transboundary issues – as for example between
Bangladesh and India on flooding – and climate change is likely to increase the imperative for this.
In terms of investment, regional cooperation on water-related climate change is especially important
as it can create opportunities for economies of scale, especially where it taps into common political
and economic priorities. CRIDF in southern Africa deliberately targets climate–water initiatives in
transboundary basins to allow for this, helping countries with project preparation and identifying viable
funding options. Transboundary basins offer a natural unit to encourage cooperation between wealthier
and poorer basin states, as in the Danube, potentially facilitating flows of investment as well as technical
assistance. A strong interface between regional and national levels is, again, vital. The sovereign disaster
insurance mechanism established by the ARC shows how regional initiatives for facilitating financing are
most effective when they are well linked to national systems – in this case, social protection systems that
can route insurance payouts to drought-affected communities. Finally, besides facilitating access to and
providing international climate finance, regional and international organizations can help countries make
fiscal reforms and improve their creditworthiness, improving the domestic environment for financing
climate-resilient water infrastructure – as shown by the World Bank and IMF’s Climate Change Policy
Assessments.
Just as the submission of new and updated NDCs by individual countries offers a window of opportunity
at the national level, there are specific entry points for regional-level action in all of these three areas. One
is the UN development system reform and its reflections at the regional level, which are ongoing and aim
for a more coherent and better-coordinated utilization of regional capacities and resources in support
of national priorities (ECOSOC, 2018). Other entry points are the regional fora and negotiating groups
within international climate negotiations and processes, such as the UNFCCC regional climate weeks held
annually in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Asia and the Pacific, which could highlight the role
of water as a regional climate – and development – connector (UN-Water, 2019).
Without a significant expansion of regional approaches to tackling climate-related water challenges, the
interlinked goals of the Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework and the 2030 Agenda will not be achieved.

This chapter outlines legal, institutional and political means to support climate change
adaptation and mitigation, to enhance resilience, and to reduce vulnerability through
more inclusive water management, especially at the country level.

11.1

Introduction
This chapter argues for the importance of good governance and more just and inclusive water resources
management under the mounting pressures from climate change. As droughts are prolonged and water
becomes scarcer, technical fixes and supply augmentation may not prove sufficient. Instead, more efficient
use (and reuse) of water and more equitable processes for sharing the benefits of its use need to be
fostered through participatory, just and transparent approaches. The chapter emphasizes the importance of:
• Political will, leadership and action – which may be mounting in the area of climate, not least thanks to
agency by the world’s youth.
• The cross-cutting nature of water and climate through the entire economy. Trade-offs and conflicting
interests need to be addressed at all levels to negotiate solutions across sectors. Policy integration and
coordination may need to be centrally placed.
• Participation and transparency can help inclusiveness and legitimacy in decision-making by way of
allowing different perspectives to be brought to bear. Broader agreements enable the necessary buy-in
for more effective implementation and collective action towards desired goals.
• Poverty and inequality exacerbate vulnerability to shocks and stressors, including climate-related water
crises. Greater equality in water/climate action (and more generally) not only helps alleviate poverty, but
also builds resilience to the effects of climate change as well as every-day crises.

11.2

Integrating climate change concerns in water management
Climate change adaptation and mitigation need to deal with increasingly complex interactions between
energy, land, water and biodiversity (IPCC, 2014d), adding additional complexity to the realm of water
resources management. Ameliorating the effects of climate change through water management also involves
politics, since there are many trade-offs and often conflicting interests regarding resource management.

11.2.1 Integrated and inclusiveness in water governance
Climate change adaptation and mitigation, like water management, are about action on the ground. The
quality and direction of action is shaped by social rules and relations, also known as the governance
framework. Water governance determines “who gets water, when, and how much” (UNDP-SIWI WGF, 2015, p. 4;
Iza and Stein, 2009).

Water governance for resilience to climate change

151

It has long been clear that governments alone are not able to take on the full responsibility of ‘providing’ water
services to all, especially in low-income settings (Franks and Cleaver, 2007; Jiménez and Pérez-Foguet, 2010),
and that a broader ‘whole-of-society’ approach is required. While governments are the main drivers of policysetting and regulation, the actual provision of water services is increasingly carried out by non-state actors
(Finger and Allouche, 2002; Kjellén, 2006). This trend has motivated the use of the term ‘governance’ rather
than ‘government.’

Climate policies,

and influential
locations

Increasing competition over water resources also reinforces the importance of governance
in water management and reuse (Niasse, 2017). With increasing competition and
resulting pressure on water resources, the way that water is allocated in society warrants
‘renegotiation.’ According to Hall et al. (2014), adapting to hydrologic variability involves
matters of institutions, infrastructure and information. Institutions are needed to undertake
the planning and development of legal and economic instruments to manage and share risks.
The management of both climate and water requires mechanisms for oversight and
coordination. It is important, though by no means easy, for such bodies to keep the
overview to ensure necessary integration of issues and coordination between actors.
Sectoral fragmentation and bureaucratic competition may pose serious challenges for the
integration across scales (Koch et al., 2006; Lebel et al., 2011). This calls for 1) greater
public participation to discuss and manage climate risk; 2) building adaptive capacities at
multiple levels (see e.g. Cap-Net UNDP/UNITAR/REDICA/WMO/UN Environment-DHI/IHEDelft, 2018); and 3) prioritizing risk reduction for socially vulnerable groups (see final section
of this chapter) (Tompkins and Adger, 2005; Oliveira, 2009; Lebel et al., 2011; Ayers et al.,
2014; Coirolo and Rahman, 2014).

For national and local authorities, to manage water resources in a way that fosters resilience to climate change,
it is essential to improve governance. Good governance involves adhering to principles of human rights, including
effectiveness, responsiveness and accountability; openness and transparency; participation in the performance
of key governance functions relating to policy and institutional arrangements; planning and coordination; and
regulation and licensing (UNECE, 1998; OECD, 2015). For the integration of substance, integrated water resources
management (IWRM) provides a process for involving stakeholders across society, the economy and the
environment (Cap-Net UNDP/UNITAR/REDICA/WMO/UN Environment-DHI/IHE-Delft, 2018).

11.2.2 Integrated water resources management for climate resilience
The call for IWRM in the 2030 Agenda, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 6.5, is a recognition of how
water cuts across all sectors of society. With increasing competition for available water, and the additional
unpredictability and variability brought on by climate change, the IWRM process for water allocation and
use efficiency becomes more acute than ever. Yet, there is no magical solution and sectoral fragmentation
is not easy to overcome (Smith and Jønch Clausen, n.d.). Fully in line with the broader societal trend
from governments (alone) towards governance (including all sectors of society), IWRM builds on multistakeholder processes. This brings a diversity of perspectives, as well as improved and innovative ideas and
coping strategies, although it does not necessarily address power imbalances between different interests.
Participation of stakeholders is a human rights obligation, and can also enhance legitimacy of the process and
the resulting choices (Saravanan et al., 2009; Schoeman et al., 2014). Gender mainstreaming – an integral part
of IWRM – also stands to improve IWRM processes and outcomes. As stated below, climate processes also
increasingly rely on the involvement of and claims from youth.
Butterworth et al. (2010) suggest that practical problem-solving can be a useful entry point for IWRM. With
more engagement of non-water professionals (decision-makers outside the water sector), the potential for
fruitfully engaging around climate change mitigation and adaptation increases (Smith and Jønch Clausen,
2018; n.d.). Transboundary cooperation also helps to share costs and benefits of adaptation and to increase
the overall efficiency and effectiveness of adaptation in a basin (UNECE/INBO, 2015).

11.2.3 Linking water policy and climate change at the country level
The nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are at the heart of the Paris Agreement as the means for
achieving its long-term goals (see Section 2.1.2). The NDCs embody efforts by each country to reduce
emissions and to adapt to the impacts of climate change. All Parties are requested to submit the next round of
NDCs (new, updated or enhanced) by 2020 and every five years thereafter.

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

In 2019, a joint analysis by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations
Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) gauged country progress in establishing the
governance architectures needed for the successful implementation of climate change mitigation and
adaptation measures. Almost 90% of countries surveyed had a coordination mechanism in place. In 80%
of the countries, a governance mechanism was in place to coordinate and engage non-governmental parts
of society. Moreover, climate policies, traditionally overseen by environment ministries which often have
limited power, are increasingly moving towards more central and influential locations. Whereas 60% of
coordination to guide NDC implementation remains with environment or natural resources management
ministries, over a third of the countries surveyed had NDC implementation coordinated by either the
Cabinet or the Office of the President or Prime Minister (UNDP/UNFCCC, 2019) (Figure 11.1).

The UNFCCC’s 2016 synthesis of the aggregate effect of 161 intended nationally determined contributions
(INDCs)35 highlighted the link between climate change and development priorities. This includes
“adaptation measures with mitigation co-benefits” on integrated water resources management, such
as watershed protection, waste- and stormwater management, water conservation, recycling and
desalination (UNFCCC, 2016, p. 75), with water emerging as a leading domain for adaptation action
(see Figure 2.3). With various types of action related to the protection of water resources included in the
adaptation components, this speaks for ‘water security’ as a key development priority for most Parties
(UNFCCC, 2016).
While two-thirds of countries outline a general portfolio of water projects in their INDCs, only one in ten cites
what could be called a detailed project proposal, and these originated either from domestic water planning
processes or had emerged from previous climate funding proposals (Hedger and Nakhooda, 2015). A
recent survey of the NDCs of 80 countries from a water perspective found that over 70% of the individual
water actions planned for adaptation involved some form of management or governance instrument, while
63% noted the need for general water resources management (GWP, 2018b) (Figure 11.2). The report also
found that ‘no-regret’ options – measures that make sense in their own right regardless of future weather
patterns, could be explored further.
More generally, for countries to implement internationally agreed commitments, it is critical to adopt
or update national law to align with international commitments (Burchi, 2019). Domestic regulation of
water resources development, use, conservation and protection forms the foundational pillar of water
governance and is the prime instrument for the implementation of NDCs under the Paris Agreement.

The concrete steps to realize the mitigation and adaptation objectives of the NDCs are indicated through
Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs). The NAP
process helps countries, essentially the least developed ones (LDCs), to elaborate medium- and long-term
climate adaptation plans, beyond the more immediate or short-term National Adaptation Programmes of
Action (NAPAs). With an emphasis on the bottom-up approach, some countries take this to the local level
in developing their Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA) (Dazé et al., 2016). For example, Bhutan has
combined local water security with long-term planning for climate change adaptation (Box 11.1).
The NAPA stepwise process, as outlined in the manual for climate change adaptation and IWRM (Cap-Net
UNDP/UNITAR/REDICA/WMO/UN Environment-DHI/IHE-Delft, 2018), takes existing coping strategies at
the grassroots level into account and builds on them to identify priority activities, rather than focusing on
scenario-based modelling to assess future vulnerability and long-term policy at state level. NAPAs should
also include short profiles of projects or activities intended to address the most urgent and immediate
adaptation needs of the LDC Parties to the Climate Framework Convention (McGray et al., 2007).
The longer-term planning through the NAPs is supported through the recently updated NAP Water
Supplement. This considers water as a means to an end: a critical input to economic development,
livelihood security and environmental sustainability. It considers water resources broadly, to include water
supply along with all water-related sectors such as agriculture, energy, transport, public health and disaster
risk management (GWP, 2019b). Over 90 developing countries are at various stages of preparing NAPs
and 13 have formally submitted theirs (UNDP/UNFCCC, 2019). UNFCCC (n.d.b) suggests that the NAP
process should be “continuous, progressive and iterative” and follow a “country-driven, gender-sensitive,
participatory and fully transparent approach.”

11.3

Public participation in agenda-setting, decision-making and
monitoring
Climate change fundamentally alters the way in which water must be managed. Traditionally, water
managers have made predictions about future water availability based on historical water trends, but as
warming temperatures affect all aspects of the hydrologic cycle (Rodell et al., 2018), historical baselines
are in many cases no longer a reliable indicator of water availability (Milly et al., 2008).

Box 11.1 National Adaptation Programme of Action for local water security in Bhutan
The vulnerabilities and challenges faced by local communities in Bhutan are further exacerbated by climate-induced
threats, ranging from flash floods and landslides to forest fires and seasonal water shortages. Due to traditional gender
roles, the burden of water becoming scarcer and more difficult to access falls disproportionately on women.
With the objective of finding sustainable
solutions, the Government of Bhutan, with
support from the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP), developed and revised the
country’s National Adaptation Programme of
Action to incorporate new emerging hazards.
With funding from the Global Environment
Facility-Least Developed Countries Fund (GEFLDCF), climate change adaptation projects have
enabled local/indigenous communities to build
resilience. Improved access to running water
and the construction of concrete-based water
storage units have enhanced water security.
The formation of water user groups has also
increased communities' capacity to protect
water sources, while at the same time enhancing
community bonding.

Even with increasingly sophisticated models, climate impacts cannot be confidently predicted at the
river basin, lake or aquifer scale. This new level or depth of uncertainty underscores that planning cannot
be treated as a technical fix or as an equation to be resolved. Indeed, water governance research has
highlighted the important role of participation to address complex water issues (Von Korff et al., 2010;
Bryson et al., 2012; Kirschke and Newig, 2017). As highlighted above, the paradigm shift from government
to governance takes decision-making out of the sole hands of experts in water or natural resources
management. Linking environmental and human rights, Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration on Environment
and Development (UNGA, 1992) stresses the need for citizen participation in environmental issues. This
principle sets out three fundamental rights: access to information, access to public participation and
access to justice, as key pillars of sound environmental governance.
Apart from the scientific base that all approaches for managing risks and ecosystems should have,
resilient water management and IWRM are also firmly rooted in the multi-stakeholder approach, involving
citizens, the private sector and civil society in the process of water governance (Saravanan et al., 2009;
Schoeman et al., 2014). Greater public participation to manage climate risk is suggested as a way to build
adaptive capacities at multiple levels, avoid institutional traps and prioritize risk reduction for socially
vulnerable groups (Tompkins and Adger, 2005; Oliveira, 2009; Lebel et al., 2011; Ayers et al., 2014; Coirolo
and Rahman, 2014). This requires the incorporation of a bottom-up approach in river basin planning
processes to ensure the incorporation of communities’ diverse views on climate risk and adaptation,
and to the links to income generation and livelihoods. At the same time, scientific information and data
also need to be made available at the local level and included as information into local multi-stakeholder
decision processes.

Water governance for resilience to climate change

155

New means of communication facilitated by information technology and social media have enabled citizens
to collect and hold information (see Chapter 13), acting as watchdogs towards their decision-makers. This
relatively new channel of communication has also enabled ‘citizen science’ with knowledge generation and
sharing. Citizen science generally refers to the involvement of citizens in scientific projects, mostly in the
generation of data (Conrad and Hilchey, 2011; Jollymore et al., 2017). Recent examples involve on-farm crop
variety evaluation using crowdsourced citizen science, assigning small experimental tasks to volunteering
farmers across the world (Van Etten et al., 2019), or using cellphones to maintain information about water
points location, functionality and quality. However, gathering scientifically sound water quality data is a
challenging process, requiring requisite funding, training, motivation and feedback to citizens (Conrad and
Hilchey, 2011; Jollymore et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018).
While governments remain responsible for leading national climate mitigation and adaptation measures
as well as water governance, the process of change is always coproduced. In line with the concept of
governance, those leading or spurring action, the ‘agents of change’, may come from many different places –
they may be within government or in other sectors. The following section highlights initiatives by a diverse
set of groupings, like youth, cities, private sector and indigenous peoples, which in different ways can help
drive or coproduce the process towards climate change adaptation or mitigation, sometimes as forerunners.

11.3.1 Agents of change
There are many indications that young people are increasingly concerned about climate change. As actions
are taking place all over the world to initiate policy change and push for action, the younger generations
are beginning to change the narrative. In March 2019, the Global Youth Climate Strike was carried out by
students across the globe who, mobilized through social media, were skipping classes to protest against
governments’ inaction to address global warming. The protests were among the largest international
actions yet, involving around 1.4 million students and young adults in more than 120 countries (Leach,
2019), pushing decision-makers to react. During the UN Climate Action Summit in September 2019, youth
and adults left schools and workplaces in over 150 countries to join the ‘Fridays for Future school strikes
manifestation. Initiated by Greta Thunberg,36 a Swedish teenager, the movement became global. For
example, during the Africa Climate Week in Accra, in March 2019, several youth groups, drawn from across
Africa, under the leadership of the Ghana Youth Environment Movement, peacefully marched through the
streets to the conference centre where government leaders and policy-makers were engaged in discussions.
The youth’s message on placards was simple: there have been so many talks already and the time for
climate change action is now.
Youth are also mobilized and supported by several water-focused networks, such as the World Youth
Parliament for Water, the Water Youth Network and Young Water Solutions. Many try to pair local initiatives
with raising awareness and policy recommendations.
Cities have also become forerunners of climate action in many countries. There are several networks or
initiatives that spur their members to act, like Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI), the C40 network
of megacities committed to addressing climate change, and the 100 Resilient Cities, pioneered by the
Rockefeller Foundation. A major share of the action seems to be underpinned by improved knowledge: a
review of over 2,000 watersheds and 530 cities by McDonald and Shemie (2014) found that cities that had
conducted water risk assessments were considerably more likely to take action, with the most common type
of action being to reduce leakage in the water supply. This is echoed by the recent ranking of leading cities in
terms of environmental action by Carbon Disclosure Project-Disclosure Insight Action (CDP, n.d.). Examples
of action include fixing water leaks to tackle drought, which was the focus of Taipei, the Taiwan province of
China (Scott, 2019). As climate change reveals underlying threats to urban water, it urges cities to undertake
this kind of no-regret measures (Kjellén, 2019).
Also, leading companies have made commitments to reduce their water footprint and greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions in order to address their contribution to water stress and climate change (see Chapter 7).
With regards to companies’ handling of water, the CDP Global Water Report 2018 found that despite a greater

“For more than 30 years the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away, and come here saying that you are
doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight… And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive
you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is
coming, whether you like it or not.” – Greta Thunberg, speaking at the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit (Thunberg, 2019).

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

awareness of water risks and targets to reduce water withdrawals, self-reported withdrawals have increased
significantly in recent years, especially among food, beverage, agriculture, manufacturing and mineral
extraction companies in Asia and Latin America (CDP, 2018).
In the United Kingdom (UK), water companies, regulators, academics and non-governmental organizations
have worked together to create a long-term planning framework for water resources. Looking 50 years
ahead, the study's results suggested that England and Wales may face longer, more frequent and more acute
droughts than previously thought. This study has led to a more strategic approach to securing water supplies
by balancing enhanced supply infrastructure and demand management (Water UK, 2016).
While most sectors of society need to reorient themselves in the face of climate change, indigenous peoples,
who have often lived in marginal and challenging environments, already implement what could be termed both
mitigation and adaptation strategies as part of ancestral or traditional natural resources management. These
include traditional responses to drought and other disasters, or carbon fixation (e.g. preservation of forests)
(Kelles-Viitanen, 2018). Chanza and De Wit (2016) and many others suggest that indigenous knowledge needs
to be much more effectively drawn into climate governance.

11.3.2 Decision-making under uncertainty
‘Adaptive management’ is a structured process of decision-making in the face of uncertainty, aiming to
manage uncertainty in natural resource and ecosystem management (Holling, 1978; Allen and Stankey, 2009).
It is increasingly applied to water resources management (Pahl-Wostl et al., 2010; Schoeman et al., 2014).
While governance and decision-making under conditions of uncertainty are not new, climate change presents
a new spectrum of uncertainties: ‘deep uncertainty’ rather than ‘known risks’ (World Bank, 2016a). Maintaining
flexibility in governance arrangements and frameworks over time is critical to coping with high levels of
climate uncertainty.
One way to deal with uncertainty is to prioritize ‘no-regret’ measures in the application of policies and to take
actions that make sense in their own rights. This includes efficiency-increasing measures like repairing leaks
in urban systems and ensuring that water in irrigation systems actually reach the crop. Such measures help
reduce waste and save resources, irrespective of climate change or future weather patterns.
‘Bottom-up’ risk assessment approaches constitute a new generation of methodologies for addressing
decision-making under uncertainty. They are designed to ensure robust, context-specific and flexible decisionmaking in water management (Brown et al., 2011; Wilby, 2011; Haasnoot et al., 2015). They place a strong
emphasis on avoiding chronic failure of the system’s performance (Mendoza et al., 2018). Early stakeholder
involvement is essential for finding more comprehensive solutions and policy responses, which are ultimately
easier to implement and better received (OECD, 2015), ensuring that local contexts are fully incorporated into
the process. One example is the stepwise Climate Risk Informed Decision Analysis (CRIDA) (Figure 11.3)
(Mendoza et al., 2018).
Data integration and analysis are important and need to be strengthened in order to help reduce the risks
and impacts of water-related disasters, including floods, landslides and droughts, the prediction of which rely
greatly on science and technology for early warnings. Further, hydrological data need to be integrated with
social and economic analyses, since behaviour and resilience depend greatly on who has access and control
over different resources (2030 WRG/UNDP, 2019).
An example of transdisciplinary approaches connecting science and technology with society is the
establishment of the Platform on Water Resilience and Disasters, a worldwide project promoted by the
International Flood Initiative.37 Further efforts at enhancing accessibility of water-related societal information
is the UN-Water SDG 6 data portal38 and the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas,39 a global water risk mapping tool
that helps companies, investors, governments and other users understand where and how water risks and
opportunities are emerging worldwide.

11.4

Reducing vulnerability and enhancing resilience by combatting
poverty and inequality
Climate change impacts countries and local populations differently, depending on their wealth, social
status and other factors affecting their ability to adapt (Eakin and Luers, 2006; UNDP, 2019). Strategies
need to distinguish between different social groups and strata, and give specific attention to those already
marginalized (Mobjörk et al., 2016). In fact, sudden or gradual crisis events tend to reinforce already
existing vulnerabilities, exposure and inequalities (Schaar, 2018).
Poverty, discrimination and vulnerability are closely related and typically intersect. Women and girls
from minority ethnic groups, remote or disadvantaged areas may suffer multiple forms of exclusion and
oppression. When disasters hit, such inequalities can become exacerbated and poor people are more likely
to be affected. Poor people are also more likely to lose relatively more than the non-poor (Hallegatte et
al., 2016),40 as gender and power dimensions affect disaster responses. For example, gender-perspective
studies from Bhutan found that women are often not reached by early warning systems, in part due to
cultural norms that restrict their freedom of movement and autonomous decision-making, having to wait
for men’s permission before evacuating (Shrestha et al., 2016; Davison, 2017). In other settings, successful
evacuation may be affected by matters like having access to a vehicle.
Indigenous peoples’ cultural and geographical existence across periods and throughout colonization often
places them in antagonistic situations with dominant political and economic actors and the mainstream
of society and politics (WWAP, 2019). This history can induce discrimination. Indigenous peoples are often
overlooked in water allocation decisions and may be marginalized in conventional water management
systems and disproportionately affected by water conflicts (Barber and Jackson, 2014). Indigenous
peoples often share strong cultural ties with their ecosystems and depend for their livelihoods on
renewable natural resources that are endangered by climate variability and extremes (ILO, 2017).

40

158

Hallegatte et al. (2016) found that factors like low literacy rates, high dependency ratios and weak housing structures increase the
vulnerability of people affected by drought in rural India, while factors like access to social networks and basic services such as water
and sanitation, health, and education would play a significant role in reducing such vulnerability.

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

Box 11.2 Watershed management as part of disaster risk reduction – Restoring the basin slopes of Gonaïves, Haiti
In the aftermath of Hurricane Jeanne, in 2004, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) and the World Food Programme (WFP) worked closely with the Government of Haiti on a job creation
programme in Gonaïves. The programme created jobs through environment protection activities. Social dialogue and
development of institutional capacity of local and community actors contributed to lessening the effects of land erosion
and high demographic pressure on the environment.
Over 50,000 households benefited from labour-intensive activities like setting up tree nurseries, building anti-erosive
ditches and reinforcing bridges. Concretely, 210,000 tree seedlings were planted on slopes and 630,000 grass seedlings
were planted in anti-erosion ditches.
The project demonstrated that the use of local resource-based techniques and community contracting could prevent
the further deterioration of eroded catchments. The community contracting also helped clarify roles and responsibilities,
establish technical capacities for broader environmental protection, and promote cooperation among workers, local
organizations and their federations, local authorities, and regional technical departments.
Contributed by ILO.

Adopting a human rights-based approach (HRBA) to development can also help achieve climate justice in
relation to water. Such approaches are at the core of good governance, providing concerned stakeholders
with opportunities to voice their interests and to influence the agenda and the outcomes of the discussions.
The HRBA provides mechanisms to ensure that all people are brought into the communication process and
can participate in collectively addressing the root causes of vulnerability (Cap-Net UNDP/WaterLex/UNDPSIWI GWF/Radica, 2017; Cap-Net UNDP/UNITAR/REDICA/WMO/UN Environment-DHI/IHE-Delft; 2018).
Development, water management and vulnerability to climate change are all linked, and “prudent watermanagement policies can do much to secure growth, making people richer and thus more resilient to climate
stresses” (World Bank, 2016a, p. 14). Wealth creation among those who need it can help reduce overall
vulnerability in society, including water-related effects of climate change.
Poor people’s assets, for example their house, animals or crops, are less resistant to the effects of disaster.
Further, they may represent the totality of a poor household’s wealth, since poor households are less likely
to have financial savings or access to credit. These differences in exposure and vulnerability make natural
disasters increase inequality and may contribute to a detrimental decoupling of economic growth and poverty
reduction (Hallegatte et al., 2016). Poor people are disproportionately at risk from environmental change,
as they tend to be more directly dependent on ecosystems, relying for example on rainfed agriculture or the
gathering of wild plants and animals (McGranahan et al., 1999). Unless such socio-economic circumstances
be fully considered, adaptation policies stand to become considerably less effective.
An important consideration in reducing vulnerability to climate-induced water-related hazards is to view
risks, challenges, exposure and vulnerabilities in their totality. Wisner et al. (2003, p. 4) criticizes the “artificial
separation” between the risk from natural hazards and the many dangers inherent in ‘normal’ life. In this vein,
the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (2018) reminds us of the difference in magnitude
of the impacts from different types of disasters and the everyday effects of inadequate access to water
and sanitation. Everyday exposure to inadequate water and sanitation kills magnitudes more people –
mainly children – than conflicts, earthquakes and epidemics combined. This speaks for the importance
of combining development and humanitarian work, for example by joining livelihoods and disaster risk
prevention pursuits, as illustrated in Box 11.2.
Water governance has an important role in enhancing climate resilience through poverty alleviation. Water
policies that provide greater access to water for the use of poor people help reduce not only poverty and
inequality, but also vulnerability, by increasing resilience to climate change. Such ‘no-regret’ measures
may be fostered by an inclusive approach to climate and water management, allowing the voices of
disadvantaged groups to influence the agenda and decisions. Political will and determination are critical to
make things happen. Participation and transparency are crucial for ensuring that actions proceed in the right
direction and contribute to agreed goals.

This chapter addresses the current state of water and climate finance, the costs of
inaction versus the benefits of action, and several ways to access climate finance
flows to improve water management as well as water supply and sanitation services,
while synergistically mitigating and/or adapting to climate change.

12.1

Overview
Water resources management is currently underfinanced and in need of greater attention from
governments. Climate change, as described in earlier chapters, threatens water resources management,
increases the risk of weather-related events, and affects the availability and quality of water and sanitation
services around the world. However, it also presents an opportunity: to leverage climate finance
mechanisms to provide additional funding to improve water management, and by doing so improve safe
water and sanitation access through actions that also mitigate and/or increase resilience to climate
change, often providing other co-benefits at the same time.

12.2

The growing amount of global attention being paid to climate change offers
an unprecedented opportunity to put water in the spotlight of sustainable
development financing efforts. Connecting water to climate change could allow
the international community to leverage additional resources to address the wide
overlap between climate and water challenges, and thus improve the outlook
of meeting the overall water management goals as outlined in Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 6.

Why connect water and climate finance
12.2.1 The state of water financing
Current levels of financing are inadequate to reach the international community’s goal of universal
availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation, as embodied in SDG 6. In order to meet
the first two targets of SDG 6 – access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services for all
by 2030 – capital investments must reach US$114 billion per year. This is about three times the current
annual capital investment levels in WASH. In addition to the initial capital inflows, significant resources
are required to operate and maintain water and sanitation infrastructure and sustain universal coverage.
These costs are recurrent and will outweigh the capital costs by 1.4 to 1.6 times by 2029 (Hutton and
Varughese, 2016).
The above expenditures do not include the costlier Targets 6.3 through 6.6 of SDG 6, which include
improving water quality, increasing the proportion of treated wastewater, increasing water efficiency,
implementing integrated water resources management, and protecting and restoring water-related
ecosystems. It also does not explicitly include climate-resilient technologies. Thus, without significantly
increasing the levels of investment in water, it will be “nearly impossible” to reach SDG 6 (Fonseca and
Pories, 2017, p. 8).

161

12.2.2 Preventive action saves
Maintaining business as usual – that is, ignoring climate risks and failing to increase water investments –
would clearly threaten the chances of meeting SDG 6, and would have wider reverberations as well. Since
water is a critical factor of production in many sectors, increasing scarcity and vulnerability of water
supplies would threaten livelihoods around the globe. Water-related losses could send some regions “into
sustained negative growth,” with growth rates in some regions at risk of declining by 6% of gross domestic
product by 2050 (World Bank, 2016a, p. vi). These changes will burden poor households the most.
Thus, when considering the cost of financing water infrastructure, it is also necessary to evaluate “the
counterfactual risk of not financing infrastructure” (WWC, 2018, p. 15). Preventive action therefore could
have a positive return on investments in the form of avoided future losses (Box 12.1) while also improving
current water management practices. But for this to happen, water managers will need to properly
incorporate planning and investment design in the analytical methods that allow for the proper
identification of climatic and non-climatic risks and uncertainties. It is therefore essential to prioritize
adaptation strategies and investments that can manage those risks and uncertainties.

12.2.3 Connecting water to climate finance

Proponents of water
projects could aim
to increase the water
sector’s share of
climate finance and
emphasize water’s
ties to other climaterelated sectors in
order to ensure greater
funding for water
management

If current water financing is inadequate, and increasing water financing offers
considerable potential benefits, then what can be done to increase access to
financing and realize those benefits? While water management requires more
attention from traditional sources such as government and development finance,
the answer may also lie in adding climate finance. The Climate Policy Initiative (CPI)
reports that climate finance has been increasing in recent years, from US$360 billion
in 2012 to an estimated US$510–530 billion in 2017. Out of the US$455 billion
invested in 2016, US$11 billion went to water and wastewater management in
climate adaptation, and US$0.7 billion to water and wastewater management in
climate mitigation. This means only 2.6% of 2016’s climate finance went directly to
water management, even if this may mask water-related projects in other sectors,
such as disaster risk management; agriculture, forestry, land use, and natural
resource management; coastal protection; and other sectors (CPI, 2018). Proponents
of water projects could aim to increase the water sector’s share of climate finance
and emphasize water’s ties to other climate-related sectors in order to ensure greater
funding for water management.

12.2.4 Mitigation versus adaptation financing
Two promising trends will increasingly help water projects access climate finance. The first is the
increasing recognition of the mitigation potential within water and sanitation projects. This trend could
be particularly advantageous, as mitigation made up 93.8% of climate financing in 2016, but water

Box 12.1 Avoided flood losses in Mexico
An example of the losses that can be avoided by preventive action comes from the Mexican state of Tabasco. In a large
flood event in 2007, the State suffered significant damages and losses amounting to US$2.9 billion. This flood event
led the Federal and State Governments to design an Integrated Hydraulic Plan. The aim of the Plan was to implement
a set of solutions that guaranteed the safety of the population, the non-interruption of economic activities, and the
stability of ecosystems in the occurrence of flood events. The structural investments (embankments, reinforcements)
and non-structural investments (development of early warning systems, risk maps, capacity building) amounted to
approximately US$750 million, and the Plan was implemented between 2008 and 2010. Three years after the 2007
floods, Tabasco was flooded at an even greater magnitude than before. But this time, the measures taken by the
Integrated Hydraulic Plan drastically reduced the level of damages and losses of the State. The 2010 damages and
losses were in the order of US$585 million, 80% less than in 2007. The benefit of the disaster risk reduction measures
implemented in 2010 was three times higher than their cost.

projects consisted of a fraction of 1% of that sum (CPI, 2018). There may be a large untapped potential
in intentionally linking water and mitigation, attracting increased financing to water management goals.
Increasingly, however, the mitigation potential of water management options is being recognized.
Water and wastewater utilities can have large energy footprints, so there is significant mitigation potential
in increasing both water and energy efficiency, as well as in recovering energy, water and nutrients from
wastewater streams (Box 12.2; see also Chapters 3 and 9). Other solutions with benefits in both water and
climate include regenerative agriculture, green infrastructure, ecosystem restoration and other innovative
initiatives such as ‘floatovoltaics’ – solar panels that float on reservoirs and provide clean energy while
preventing water loss through evaporation.
The second trend is an increasing emphasis on financing climate adaptation. Climate finance is typically
heavily weighted toward mitigation rather than adaptation, but recently this has begun to change
(Figure 12.1). The Green Climate Fund (see section 12.5.1) has a target of financing 50% mitigation and
50% adaptation, the World Bank has dedicated US$50 billion to adaptation over the next five years, and the
criteria for certifying climate bonds include resilience investments (Tall and Brandon, 2019). With these
developments, water practitioners who integrate climate change analysis into their project planning will
increase their chances of accessing climate finance, be it for mitigation or adaptation.
Disaster risk management made up a little less than 14% of 2016’s climate financing for adaptation, about
US$3 billion (CPI, 2018).

Economic considerations of water and climate projects
12.3.1 The value of water
Water is immensely valuable. The value of access to safe water and to sanitation and hygiene services
goes well beyond the price paid at the tap, and is a vital input to thriving economies, stable communities
and healthy populations. Water is essential to human survival, a necessary component of food and energy
production, and both an input to and a recipient of the ecosystem services that sustain all life on Earth.
For these reasons, “water is the common currency which links nearly every SDG” (World Bank, 2016a, p. vi).
Given the increased scarcity and variability caused by climate change, “water management will be crucial
in determining whether the world achieves the Sustainable Development Goals” (World Bank, 2016a, p. vi).
Water also has intangible social, cultural and religious worth, and it is invaluable for human dignity. It is an
entitlement of all people.

Box 12.2 Mitigation in water and wastewater
The project Water and Wastewater Companies for Climate Mitigation (WaCCliM), financed by the German Government
and implemented by The German Agency for International Cooperation GmbH (GIZ) and the International Water
Association (IWA), introduces greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction technologies at utilities in Jordan, Mexico, Peru and
Thailand. These measures include energy consumption reduction, energy and nutrient recovery, water reuse, and water
loss reduction. The project also developed the Energy Performance and Carbon Emissions Assessment and Monitoring
(ECAM) tool to help water and wastewater utilities assess GHG emissions and mitigation opportunities, and aids
countries in improving the regulatory, institutional and financial framework for integrating emissions reductions into the
water supply and sanitation sector. These measures have allowed the affected utilities to reduce thousands of tonnes
of CO2e emissions while also producing financial savings and improving the quality of service.

There are ongoing efforts to measure the value of water. The High-Level Panel on Water released
Principles on Valuing Water with guidance for allocating, managing and pricing water services considering
the many different dimensions of value that water holds (HLPW, 2018b). Valuation of water, along with
strengthening governance and institutional capacity, is one of the most critical steps toward sustainable
development of water resources (Garrick et al., 2017).
There is no single value of water, nor even one single way to measure its value. But several projects and
modelling efforts illustrate the substantial benefits of improving water management in the context of
climate change. For example, the World Bank estimates that improving water resource management could
accelerate growth in some regions of the world by 6% (World Bank, 2016a). Various water-related climate
adaptation policies can also provide co-benefits such as job creation, improved public health, promotion of
gender equality, reduced household expenses and carbon sequestration, among others.

12.3.2 Water project bankability
Although climate finance is increasing, demand for it is also increasing, and current levels are not yet
adequate to meet the need. Accessing climate finance can be competitive and difficult, especially for
complex water projects that may transcend national boundaries. Practitioners must ensure that a project
is ‘bankable’, or likely to receive funding based on the project’s design, objectives, risk profile, enabling

164

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

environment and other factors. Bankable climate projects are those that have a “clearly articulated link
to climate change impacts, familiarity and strict compliance with funding procedures,” and sometimes
additional funding sources (World Bank, 2019, p. 11).
A project's bankability for climate finance differs slightly from its bankability for development finance in
general. Projects hoping to use climate finance must explicitly address the causes and/or consequences
of climate change to be considered bankable. Adaptation and resilience projects must also demonstrate
how the project will respond to and address expected climate impacts in the project’s area. These links
must be backed with scientific evidence, such as climate data. Climate financers such as the Green
Climate Fund also require all projects to address the gender dimensions of climate change and to
mainstream gender equality considerations into the project cycle. As with development financing, all
projects must respect human rights, including the right to participation.
Furthermore, to increase chances of accessing climate financing, project proponents should search for the
most compatible financing sources and match their project plan to the financer’s criteria and objectives.
Project proposals should align with related policies and plans already in place, such as national
development strategies, National Adaptation Plans, or river basin investment and management plans.
Projects that communicate and address risks, and projects that capture co-benefits in other areas such as
health, are also considered more bankable.

Project developers
must take the time to
form relationships, gain
insight into the climate
financing landscape and
advocate for the benefits
of their approach

Basin organizations have an important role to play in transboundary basins as
they can bring added benefits while implementing multi-country projects. However,
many basins organizations struggle in accessing funds for climate change
adaptation from different sources (UNECE/INBO, 2015). Understanding and
managing the special risks and complexities of transboundary river basin projects
are critical to preparing bankable project proposals that will attract public and
private financing partners. The example of the Niger basin (Box 12.3) demonstrates
that pooling projects, a rigorous scientific and planning process, and early
involvement of stakeholders and donors have enabled river basin organizations to
raise significant funds for climate change adaptation (World Bank, 2019).

Thinking about water projects in terms of their bankability to climate financers can help align climate and
water goals and ameliorate project funding gaps. It is important to note, however, that a bankable project
will not necessarily attract climate financing simply because it is a good project. Project developers must
take the time to form relationships, gain insight into the climate financing landscape and advocate for the
benefits of their approach.

Box 12.3 Pooling projects in African transboundary basins
The Niger basin counts nine riparian countries and is home to 112 million people who rely heavily on the natural
resources it provides. Those nine countries and the Niger Basin Authority will prepare and implement the
Investment Plan for the Strengthening of Resilience to Climate Change, which includes investments “targeting
vulnerability to water stress, variability, soil, land, and ecosystem degradation, and strengthening resilience.” These
measures were taken from the Niger Basin Authority’s Operational Plan, countries’ National Adaptation Plans and
National Adaptation Programmes of Action, and country proposals. The Plan is expected to cost US$3.11 billion
and will be financed by the Niger Basin Authority member countries, the World Bank, the African Development Bank
and private sources.
Pooling projects is a way to avoid maladaptation and the negative consequences that could result from
considering only one fragment of an interconnected basin ecosystem. It can also promote resource efficiency and
cost-effectiveness. For example, reforestation efforts upstream can improve water quality and reduce erosion and
flood risk downstream.

12.3.3 Pro-poor climate–water finance strategies
People living in poverty are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and water insecurity.
Therefore, differentiated strategies that specifically consider the resilience needs of marginalized
groups must be built into larger water–climate plans and projects. People who live below the poverty
line and have low financial reserves are the least prepared to adapt to intense climate events such as
flash floods or prolonged droughts. Comprehensive climate plans, particularly those discussed later in
this chapter, that incorporate national mitigation and adaptation efforts alongside more specific water
management projects need to incorporate financing structures that can assist at-risk populations to
recover from these intense climate events. In addition, access to finance can be a critical component
of mitigation and adaptation strategies, allowing low-income people to invest in climate-resilient
technologies like rainwater harvesting.

12.4

Types of climate investments for water projects
12.4.1 No-regret and low-regret investments
Climate impacts are not always certain, especially at the micro-level. Scientific knowledge and
predictive climate modelling continue to improve, but decisions must be made in the meantime to
help communities prepare and adapt. No-regret and low-regret investments are a response to this
uncertainty.
No-regret investments are investments that are beneficial regardless of the climate impacts – they
would provide benefits even in the absence of climate change, as well as across a range of potential
climate hazards. Low-regret investments “may incur an additional cost to offset climate change risks, but
these costs are small in comparison to the benefits of avoiding future costs” (GWP-Caribbean/CCCCC,
2014, p. 1). Such projects increase resilience. They also tend to bring co-benefits to multiple sectors and
stakeholders, have built-in flexibility for future adjustments, and minimize trade-offs.
No-regret interventions for water and climate change could include rainwater harvesting, sustainable
groundwater management, micro-irrigation technologies, wastewater reuse and improved water storage
(Vermeulen et al., 2013). Any intervention that improves efficiency and conservation, by reducing leaks
for example, is also generally considered a low- or no-regret choice. These interventions also tie into
both mitigation and adaptation, since efficiency and conservation both reduce energy use and increase
water availability.

12.4.2 Results-based climate financing
Results-based climate financing is a type of investment in which “funds are disbursed by an investor or
donor to a recipient upon the achievement of a pre-agreed set of [mitigation or adaptation] results, with
achievement of these results being subject to independent verification” (World Bank, 2017d, p. 1). It can
be used on its own or together with upfront financing, and it can be deployed at different scales and with
different project entities.
There are several different ways to approach results-based climate financing, but as a modality it has
the potential to improve monitoring, reporting and verification capacity, strengthen domestic institutions,
mobilize the private sector, and create or strengthen markets to produce climate results. Most resultsbased investments thus far have been made in climate mitigation projects, since carbon emissions are a
well-defined and measurable indicator, but this type of financing can also be used for climate adaptation
goals. In this regard, new results-based climate mechanisms can target nature-based solutions (NBS),
where the funding gap is expected to be the greatest (WWC/GWP, 2018). Projects that find synergies
between water management goals and climate mitigation or adaptation can take advantage of this
promising financing modality.

Using multilateral climate finance for water
Three multilateral funding institutions exist specifically for financing climate and environmental
projects: The Green Climate Fund, the Global Environment Facility and the Adaptation Fund. In addition,
development banks have begun to prioritize climate change and integrate it into their development
activities, and some have climate-specific funds. Water managers could look to these funds, which in 2016
provided US$51 billion, or 11% of all climate financing (CPI, 2018).

12.5.1 The Green Climate Fund
The Green Climate Fund was established as a financing mechanism of the Paris Agreement, to help
developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change. As of 2019, it has received US$10.3 billion in
pledges, out of the goal of US$100 billion per year, and the Fund has committed about US$5 billion of that
to approved climate projects (Box 12.4). Though most if not all their results areas and investment priorities
involve water management, the clearest result area for water is health, food and water security, which falls
under adaptation (Green Climate Fund, n.d.).

12.5.2 The Global Environment Facility
The Global Environment Facility provides grants for several types of environmental projects, including
climate change mitigation and adaptation. It also serves as the financial mechanism for the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Since its founding in 1992, it has funded
almost 1,000 climate mitigation projects and 330 adaptation projects. A recent project with both climate
and water benefits “helped generate tools to assess the effects of glacier retreat and integrate climate
change considerations into strategic planning”, and “addressed pressing development issues related to
water supply or irrigation in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru” (GEF, n.d.).

12.5.3 The Adaptation Fund
The Adaptation Fund was originally set up under the Kyoto Protocol and finances projects that help
developing countries adapt to climate change. It has supported over 80 adaptation projects since 2010
and has committed US$564 million to climate adaptation and resilience activities (Adaptation Fund, 2019).
During the 24th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24) in December 2018, country Parties
decided that the Adaptation Fund would serve the Paris Agreement starting in 2019. Water management is
one of the Adaptation Fund’s project sectors, and it accepts transboundary project proposals.

Several multilateral

12.5.4 Development banks
Climate change is a threat to development and anti-poverty goals, while acting on
climate can bring development and equity co-benefits. For those reasons, at COP24
the World Bank committed to doubling its climate investments to US$200 billion from
2021–2025 to support countries taking ambitious climate action (World Bank, 2018b).
Of that sum, US$50 billion will be dedicated to adaptation finance. The World Bank
aligns its internal processes and metrics to consider climate risks and opportunities,
and evaluates its operations for climate impacts and co-benefits. So, it is worthwhile
for water managers hoping to access World Bank funds to mainstream climate
mitigation and/or adaptation into their plans (World Bank/IFC/MIGA, 2016).

Box 12.4 The Green Climate Fund and water management in Sri Lanka
A Green Climate Fund project in Sri Lanka will upgrade village irrigation systems in vulnerable communities and
promote climate-smart farming practices in three river basins. It will also enhance climate-resilient water supply
management and strengthen climate and hydrological forecasting to enhance water management and adaptive
capacity. The climate-smart agriculture component provides both climate adaptation and mitigation benefits, while also
conserving water and protecting drinking water sources.

Several multilateral development banks have formulated guidelines to mainstream climate analysis into
planning and investment design. Furthermore, over the past few years, multilateral development banks
have also formulated guidance notes to help operational teams move towards climate-smart portfolios of
investments and to maximize the climate adaptation and mitigation results of each investment.
Regional development banks also have climate change initiatives that water practitioners could tap
into. The members of the International Development Finance Club, a global network of 23 national and
regional development banks, committed US$196 billion to climate finance in 2017, primarily for climate
mitigation. Of the US$10 billion allocated to climate adaptation, 58% went to water ‘preservation’, which
includes catchment management, rainwater harvesting, and rehabbing water distribution networks. The
International Development Club’s provided 72% of its green finance commitments (including climate
and other environmental financing) to the East Asia and Pacific region, while the European Union (EU)
received 14% of green finance, and Latin America and the Caribbean received 6%. Green financing
commitments to Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and
Sub-Saharan Africa were smaller, at 1–3% per region (IDFC, 2018).

12.6

Using national climate finance for water
12.6.1 Bilateral climate finance
Climate financing initiatives or development agencies with climate objectives exist in many countries
and regions, including the EU, Germany (Box 12.5), Japan, the Nordic countries, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom, The United Arab Emirates, the United States of America and others. There are also regional
and national climate funds in developing countries, such as the Amazon Fund, the Bangladesh Climate
Change Trust Fund, the Green Fund in South Africa, and the Southern Africa Trust (ACT Alliance, 2018).
Bilateral public climate finance from developed to developing countries grew overall from US$22.5 billion
in 2013 to US$27 billion in 2017 (OECD, 2018). As is the trend with most climate financers, bilateral
sources primarily financed mitigation (66% of bilateral finance in 2017) over adaptation (21%), with
cross-cutting activities more common among bilateral sources (14% in 2017) than multilateral ones (4%)
(OECD, 2018).

12.6.2 National and subnational climate finance
As each country’s nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement becomes
mainstreamed into government spending plans, domestic expenditures by national governments may
be a growing source of climate finance. The UNFCCC estimates that US$232 billion of domestic public
finance was spent per year in 2015 and 2016, with US$157 billion per year in developing countries and
US$75 billion in developed countries. However, “comprehensive data on domestic climate expenditures are
not readily available, nor are such data collected regularly or using a consistent methodology” (UNFCCC,
2018, p. 62). If water managers can align their projects to their country’s NDCs, they may be able to
access these domestic sources of climate financing. But without comprehensive data, it is difficult to
draw conclusions that could guide water and sanitation financing efforts.

Box 12.5 Bilateral climate finance for water management in Nepal, Peru and Uganda
An example of water sector involvement in a bilateral climate project took place in Nepal, Peru and Uganda between 2011
and 2016. The Global Ecosystems Based Adaptation in Mountains Programme was funded by the German Government’s
International Climate Initiative and implemented by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources (IUCN), with local government partners. The programme’s activities included ecosystem restoration and
management, soil nutrient management, water conservation and management, and irrigation measures. These measures
helped secure water supplies and build resilience to droughts in the three project areas, among other benefits.

168

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change

National domestic finance institutions may also offer climate financing. In Latin America and the
Caribbean, national development banks such as the Brazilian Development Bank “are already the single
largest source of public climate finance in domestic markets” (NRDC, 2017, p. 4).
Several countries and subnational jurisdictions have begun establishing green investment banks, also
known as green banks, in recent years. Green banks “are publicly capitalized, domestically focused,
specialist financial institutions specifically established to crowd in private capital” to climate and
environmental investments (NRDC, 2017, p. 1). While green banks were initially established almost
exclusively in OECD countries, current efforts are expanding the model to countries in Africa, Asia and
Latin America (Green Bank Network, 2018). As green banks begin to proliferate, water project managers
may wish to monitor this area for future financing opportunities.

12.7

Alternative finance sources
12.7.1 Private sector finance
Private sector finance accounted for a majority (54%, or US$230 billion) of climate finance flows in 2016,
the bulk of which came from project developers (CPI, 2018). Other sources of private finance could include
carbon markets, foreign direct investment, insurance, or commercial financial institutions. An estimated
US$15.7 billion of private financing was mobilized by multilateral development banks (UNFCCC, 2018). But
the sources and destinations of private financing are not well documented.
One emerging source of private financing that may be useful to water practitioners is the green bond
market. Pioneered in 2007, green bonds and climate bonds offer “significant global opportunities to
mobilize capital at scale for low carbon, climate resilient infrastructure and development efforts” (World
Bank, 2018c). The green bond market has grown rapidly, from US$3.4 billion in 2012 to US$168 billion in
2018. The Climate Bonds Standard, a labelling scheme akin to FairTrade certification, has released Water
Infrastructure Criteria (Box 12.6) to certify water-related bonds for low-carbon and climate-resilient water
management standards (Climate Bonds Initiative, 2018).
In 2018, the Global Green Bond Partnership was launched to accelerate the issuance of green bonds.
The Partnership plans to develop toolkits for companies, subnational entities and other groups that are
interested in issuing green bonds, so water managers can take advantage of those resource as they
come out (World Bank, 2018c). There are also other types of environmental bonds emerging, such as
catastrophe bonds, environmental impact bonds and resilience bonds.

Box 12.6 Water infrastructure criteria for climate bonds
Certification for the water infrastructure criteria under the Climate Bonds Standard is based on two components:
1.

Mitigation: Greenhouse gas emissions from water projects do not increase and comply with business-as-usual
baselines or aim at emissions reduction to be delivered over the operational lifetime of the water asset or project.

2.

Adaptation and resilience: Water infrastructure and its surrounding ecosystem are resilient to climate change and
have sufficient adaptation to address climate change risks. To demonstrate that, issuers must address the following:
a.

Allocation: How water is shared by users within a given basin or aquifer;

b.

Governance: How/whether water will be formally negotiated and governed;

c.

Technical diagnostics: How/whether changes to the hydrologic system are addressed over time;

d.
		

For nature-based and hybrid infrastructure only: Whether issuers have sufficient understanding of 		
ecological impacts at/beyond project site with ongoing monitoring and management capacity;

e.
		

Assessment of the Adaptation Plan: Checking the completeness of the coping mechanisms to address 		
identified climate vulnerabilities.

12.7.2 Public-private partnerships
Climate-smart public–private partnerships are another potential way to meet financing needs for
climate-resilient water infrastructure investment. The Public–Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility
(PPIAF) has defined climate change as a strategic priority for fiscal years 2018–2022. The Facility
will focus on climate change initiatives and embed climate activities in its technical assistance
and knowledge work (Suriyagoda, 2017). The PPIAF Climate Change Trust Fund for Infrastructure
will promote climate-smart models and enabling environments for climate-smart public–private
partnerships. Water supply and sanitation is one of the sectors included in the Fund’s planned
programmatic initiatives.
While climate change does not currently play a significant role in public–private partnerships, the
World Bank and PPIAF’s mainstreaming of climate change into their initiatives and knowledge
activities will define future infrastructure trends and is another area for water managers to watch.

12.7.3 Blended finance
Blended finance “incorporates different types of financing into a single project or fund” (World Bank,
2019, p. 24). Blended finance can have a crowding-in effect by using concessional loans (i.e. loans
with below-market rates) or grants to make projects more attractive for traditional sources of
capital, and it can help project proponents better manage risks. Several development banks, climate
funds and bilateral funds have begun using this paradigm to attract commercial finance and support
projects that have a potentially high impact but must overcome barriers to be commercially viable.
The bankability criteria of the Green Climate Fund and other prominent sources of climate financing
tend to screen out smaller-scale, subnational-level projects. To address this financing gap, R20
Regions of Climate Action and BlueOrchard Finance are, as of early 2019, in the process of setting
up a Subnational Climate Fund for Africa. The Fund will leverage blended finance to fund subnational
infrastructure projects with positive climate impacts in emerging markets (R20 for Climate Action,
2018). For water project developers, especially in Africa, this may be a financing source to watch for
future opportunities.
Special attention must be paid to low-income countries, because “countries that have the greatest
need for investment are often perceived as risky and as having governance issues”. Only 3.6% of the
private finance mobilized by using blended finance in 2012–2015 flowed to low-income countries
(Hedger, 2018b, p. 6).

Conclusion
Growing interest in climate finance, as well as its variety of sources, instruments and destinations, make
it an attractive opportunity for water project proponents and organizations hoping to reach SDG 6. The
challenge lies in their ability to establish the water–climate connection and access this finance.
Since most climate financers primarily fund mitigation activities, finding alignment between water
development goals and climate mitigation may offer more immediate opportunities for future funding than
adaptation activities. Up until now, the connection between water management and adaptation has been
more apparent and more readily developed than mitigation. However, the mitigation potential of various
water management interventions is increasingly being recognized. Policy and technical solutions that
align water management goals and climate mitigation goals should be a growing topic for research and
knowledge sharing, to help both climate and water practitioners take advantage of these connections.
Climate finance architecture is complex and evolving. There are multiple mechanisms, institutions,
programmes and activities at various scales. For this reason, increasing coordination among these actors
would minimize duplication and inefficiencies as well as facilitate access to funding. Potential sources of
growth in climate finance will be national institutions hoping to finance their NDCs and the Green Climate
Fund with its push to reach US$100 billion in financing per year. Green banks, green bonds, subnational
climate funds and public–private partnerships are other emerging areas to watch for future climate
financing opportunities.
It must be stated, however, that water management and climate action are both underfinanced. Although
it is increasing, climate financing is not as abundant as needed to address climate change (CPI, 2018).
Competition for climate financing is high, as there is not enough to go around. Therefore, to meet both
climate and water goals, it may not be enough to encourage water–climate synergies and help water
developers access climate finance. Structural changes may also be needed, such as giving water a higher
priority within climate funds, designing linking mechanisms between the water and climate communities,
and identifying strategies to bring blended finance to the countries with the greatest need. Water
practitioners could become climate advocates as well, encouraging greater funding for addressing climate
change. Since water links all the SDGs and climate change threatens them, it is critical to plan and invest
in sustainable water management that properly incorporates climate resilience and robustness against
multiple futures.

This chapter highlights the challenges and opportunities in promoting research,
innovation and science to support informed decision-making.

13.1

Introduction
Climate change questions our ability, as societies, to predict, anticipate and absorb perturbations.
In other words, it challenges us to develop mechanisms for reducing uncertainty, mitigating risk
and improving resilience, in order to adapt to a changing environment. As described in previous
chapters, improved water management offers several opportunities in terms of both climate
change adaptation and mitigation. The challenges, in terms of technological innovation, knowledge
management, research and capacity development, are to promote the generation of new tools and
approaches through advanced research and development, and, equally as important, to accelerate
the implementation of existing knowledge and technologies across all countries and regions.
However, these actions alone will not lead to expected outcomes unless they are also accompanied
by awareness-raising, as well as educational and capacity development programmes aimed at widely
disseminating this knowledge and stimulating the uptake of new and existing technologies. Access
to knowledge and information is essential, and all persons have a right to benefit from science and its
applications (UNGA, 1966, Article 15).
Various adaptation and mitigation measures have the potential to foster water management systems’
resilience to climate change and to enhance water security, contributing directly to sustainable
development. Such measures can only be effective and durable if they strengthen the knowledge
interface on climate and water systems and services, and identify needs, practices, priorities,
challenges and gaps. Policy-makers and scientists are faced with the challenge of evaluating and
measuring change and its potential consequences. Uncertainty about the extent of the impacts of
climate change on water resources management and societies in general can hamper the ability
to successfully implement adaptation measures into national development and into environmental
protection plans and policies. Another challenge derives from the fact that adaptation and mitigation
require interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral and multidimensional approaches, which in turn require
the setting-up of a shared framework. Multidisciplinary approaches, tools and methodologies are
therefore necessary.
Science, technology and innovation have proven to be key drivers of economic and social
development, transforming water resources governance and management at an unprecedented pace.
The integration of science, technology and innovation policies into water resources development
strategies, as well as its combination with institutional and organizational changes, can valuably
contribute to raising efficiency, improving resilience, and fostering the transition to sustainability within
and beyond the water sector. Such achievements offer new opportunities and responses to support
sound decision-making in the governance and management of water resources while minimizing
the impact of climate change. Innovation provides more affordable and efficient technological tools,
enables their implementation, and is indeed central to translating water-related scientific knowledge
and technological know-how into useful processes, services and employment.

Technological innovation and citizen knowledge

13.2

Technological innovation
Science, technologies and innovation are rapidly evolving and continue to support a number of water
resources management activities, including i) overall assessment and monitoring of water resources
and hydrological processes; ii) conservation, recovery and reuse of water resources; iii) adaptation
of infrastructures; iv) cost reduction in treatment and distribution processes; v) efficiency of water
supply delivery and use; and vi) access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Several innovations in the
water sector have over the past years deepened our understanding of climate-related challenges, and
provided new ways to adapt in a flexible way to climate change and to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. Some of these innovations are listed in this section.
Earth observation and space technologies generate data and information on weather, climate and the
evolution of water resources at various levels. Satellite-based earth observation can help identify trends
in precipitation, evapotranspiration, snow and ice cover/melting, as well as runoff and storage. For
example, information on changes in land water storage, including in aquifers, is obtained through an
analysis of gravity variation by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission
operated by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the German Aerospace
Center (DLR). Since its launch in 2002, GRACE recorded a threefold increase of the mass of ice lost
in the polar and mountainous regions. It also observed that of the 37 largest land-based aquifers,
13 have undergone critical mass loss, which has been induced both by climate-related change and
anthropogenic pressure (Tapley et al., 2019).
Advances in satellite technologies over the past decades have also helped improve the understanding
of climate change impacts on water quality by monitoring river, marine and coastal ecosystems with
high levels of accuracy (Skoulikaris et al., 2018). For instance, satellite monitoring of environmental
parameters such as turbidity, suspended solids, Chlorophyll-a, dissolved organic matters and water
surface temperature helps identify areas potentially affected by eutrophication and algal blooms
(UNESCO-IHP, 2018).
Remote sensing conducted through satellites can also be a powerful tool for monitoring. While it can
reveal large-scale processes and features that are not easily observable via traditional methods, the
temporal and spatial resolution may not be fully adequate for smaller-scale applications and data
analysis. However, when backed with national statistics, field-based observations and numerical
simulation models, remote sensing can contribute to a comprehensive assessment of climate change
impacts related to water and thus support decision-making with regard to potential adaptation
responses.

Evolutions in the field
of data acquisition have
been facilitated by highspeed internet networks
and global coverage, as
well as cloud computing
and the enhancement
of virtual storage
capabilities

Advanced sensor technologies can support smart water management, notably
by enabling online and real-time monitoring of water availability and quality.
Wireless sensors for monitoring water consumption have been developed
and are increasingly used in combination to allow for remote water metering.
In Alicante, Spain, the smart metering of water consumption data has helped
meeting supply and end-use information needs, contributing to the city’s
sustainable urban water management objectives (March et al., 2017). Water
quality monitoring at different stages of wastewater treatment processes is
essential for ensuring its safe reuse for various purposes, thus helping to reduce
overall water stress (see Box 3.2). Such monitoring is also vital for detecting
chemical leakages or pollution spills in a timely manner, as well as for analysing
the effectiveness of decontamination measures.

Major information and communication technologies (ICT) evolutions in the field of data acquisition
have been facilitated by high-speed internet networks and global coverage, as well as cloud computing
and the enhancement of virtual storage capabilities (i.e. cloud backup and storage services with
multiple functions) (Skoulikaris et al., 2018). New technologies such as Internet-of-things (IoT), big data,
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are also emerging, with diverse applications in reducing
uncertainty, mitigating risk and improving resilience to climate change.

The IoT designates a computing concept in which every-day physical objects are connected to the internet
and/or to each other, forming a network of interrelated devices that can communicate and transfer data
without requiring human intervention. As water loss management is becoming increasingly important with
more and more water stress-affected regions, the IoT deployed in the framework of smart cities can collect
critical water-related data required to enhance water management systems, and contribute to water savings.
For example, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission in the United States of America (USA) has
installed one of the largest pilot programmes of smart water meters, with 178,000 water meters equipped
with smart sensors to record hourly water consumption. The data are transmitted automatically, four times
a day, over a wireless network, and used to detect leakages in the water supply network as well as to analyse
patterns in water consumption (San Francisco Water Power Sewer, n.d.). In rural areas, the IoT can improve
water use efficiency in irrigation through sensors sending data on weather and soil moisture conditions to
the irrigation system in order to optimize watering.
Big Data analytics examines large amounts of data to uncover hidden patterns, correlations and other
insights. Applications of big data analytics can help in knowledge gain by processing the collection of
continuous streams of water-related information and data, to extract actionable information and insights
for improved water management. For example, NASA and the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) have collaborated in the SERVIR-Mekong project to develop a historical flood analysis
tool, which analyses satellite imagery from 1984 to 2015 using big data analysis tools and techniques, in
order to provide historical patterns of surface water across spatial extents (SERVIR-Mekong, n.d.). The
service provides customized information regarding flood-prone areas (e.g. frequency of seasonal flooding
cycles) to countries in the Lower Mekong region and supported other disaster preparedness efforts in the
greater Mekong region.
Big Data also offers the possibility to integrate additional data to the water-related ones, such as trade
patterns or electricity consumption, generating a broader understanding of the evolution of processes that
impact on water resources and thus improving the management of water in a changing context, using a
cross-sectoral approach.
Various AI-based techniques, models and machine-learning algorithms for effective water quality
management are being explored, in particular for the simulation, prediction and forecasting of water quality,
for statistical analyses of water quality data, and for the identification of pollution sources (Sarkar and
Pandey, 2015; Sengorur et al., 2015; Srivasta et al., 2018). For example, Mohammed et al. (2018) evaluated
the use of machine-learning algorithms for the predictive analysis of microbial water quality (the counts of
the faecal indicator organisms in raw water) in Lake Maridal in Norway. AI is also emerging as forecasting
and optimizing technology for predicting the efficiency of different desalination technologies (Cabrera et al.,
2017), developing flood resilience and preparedness (Saravi, et al., 2019), managing aquifers (Moazamnia,
et al., 2019), and water use efficiency (Chen, et al., 2017).
Advances in AI and machine-learning techniques may further enhance satellite- and earth observation-based
water management and quality monitoring, by enabling and improving the analysis and interpretation of
satellite images and geospatial data to support decision-making or to predict water availability and quality
parameters (El Din et al., 2017).

13.3

From data to decision-making: bridging the science–policy gap
Knowledge consists of contextualized information, which itself is based on raw data that have been
processed, organized, structured and presented so as to make it meaningful and useful. It forms the basis of
an informed, science-based decision-making process.

13.3.1 Integrating data into decision-making
ICT tools have helped to generate a large amount of data on climate change, as well as information on
mitigation and adaptation responses for water management. However, such data need to be processed,
analysed and presented in ways that can be understood and used by decision-makers. The limited use
of information and knowledge to inform water resource management policies continues to represent a
major challenge for stakeholders in the water sector (whether governments, scientists, the private sector,

Technological innovation and citizen knowledge

175

civil society, etc.). Reasons include a shortage of financial and human resources, a lack of awareness
and commitment from the political leadership, gaps in technical skills, and an absence of clearly defined
strategies and mechanisms to support overall knowledge management.
One of the main challenges utilities have to contend with is integration. Data acquisition systems may
be outdated or insufficiently documented, and they may produce data formats that are idiosyncratic and
therefore incompatible with one another. As a result, parallel systems develop, and data gathered by each
cannot be cross-processed. A key need for all water-related domains is the fostering of integration and
the further development of intersectoral systems, understanding and collaboration. Professionals in each
sector need to know more about and understand the thinking and methods applied in the other sectors, in
order to continue innovating in a more collaborative, operation-oriented way.
Furthermore, there is also an absolute need to foster the processing of data into information and to
encourage the dissemination of knowledge in order to support decision-making (Box 13.1). Promoting
openness in content, technology and processes through awareness-raising, policy formulation and
capacity-building is a way to broaden access to information, knowledge and technologies. Free and Open
Source Software (FOSS) is becoming increasingly popular in low- and middle-income countries where high
license costs for paid software may be difficult to overcome. Such tools contribute to greater transparency
and accountability in the sector. Visualization tools are also helpful in making climate change-related data
intelligible and providing decision-makers with clear, straightforward information.

13.3.2 Citizen science
In the face of climate change, inclusive approaches can empower all water users to take part in the
collection, sharing and use of information for mitigation and adaptation purposes. For example, citizen
science and crowdsourcing have the potential to contribute to early warning systems and can also provide
data for validating flood forecasting models (See, 2019).
For instance, FOSS for knowledge management encourages the participation of civil society in the
collection, supply and use of information. Access to information and knowledge has the ability to empower
users, including youth, women and the most vulnerable groups, to manage water resources and to
contribute to informed decision-making.

Engaging citizens in science contributes to speeding scientific discovery, while
democratizing reasearch and, potentially, improving or influencing stakeholder decisions
(Ryan et al., 2018). Even though citizen science has been widely acknowledged only
recently, some historical observations and traditional knowledge records date back
centuries. Weather and climate models in the USA have their roots in citizen science
efforts that began in the 1800s (Fiebrich, 2009). Such historical observations and
records from citizens can be particularly helpful in understanding trends and changes
over a longer time. Indeed, individuals can support scientific research by documenting
impacts of climate change, in particular by observing and recording changes in
ecosystems and natural phenomena, such as the weather, animal and plant behaviours,
or certain species prevalence. Citizen science data can also support the calibration
of weather instruments and the collection of data on cloud cover, temperature and
precipitation to improve the understanding of microclimatic variation (Cifelli et al., 2005;
Clark et al., 2015; See et al., 2016; Rajagopalan et al., 2017).

There is a long history of citizens monitoring the water levels in lakes and rivers, and engagement in
the water sector has been growing. Citizen science in this area includes, for example, water quality
monitoring, with voluntary water quality testing campaigns by local communities and schools (Jollymore
et al., 2017; Carlson and Cohen, 2018). There is a large potential to increase the involvement of citizens in
hydrology and water resources data collection because of the availability of inexpensive, robust and highly
automated sensors, and the possibility to combine them with powerful environmental models to create
rich and interactive visualization methods. However, implementation challenges need to be addressed
(Buytaert et al., 2014).

Box 13.1 Water Information Network System for bridging the science–policy interface
The UNESCO Intergovernmental Hydrological Programme’s Water Information and Network System (IHP-WINS) online
platform incorporates data on water resources that are generated with geographical information systems (GIS) into a
cooperative and open-access participatory database to foster knowledge-sharing and access to information. IHP-WINS
is freely accessible to all, with the aim of encouraging contributors to share information on water. IHP-WINS offers
different sets of spatial information that can be overlaid to cross information and highlight new data through maps.
Transparency and respect of ownership is guaranteed as all information benefits from metadata in a standardized
format and from a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). This allows for an accurate identification and crediting of any
contribution, and makes it easier to share information later. The platform is contributing to closing the gap between
North and South in terms of access and the sharing of knowledge.
For further information about the IHP-WINS platform, see ihp-wins.unesco.org/.

Scientists are increasingly recognizing the importance of citizen science and crowdsourcing for data
collection and recovery in studying climate change and its impacts. For example, projects led by the
Pyrenees Climate Change Observatory (OPCC) include components aimed at engaging the public through
data collection on flora in the transboundary ecosystems of the Pyrenees and on the nutrient enrichment
in peatlands and lakes (OPCC, n.d.). The British Natural Environment Research Council is funding a citizen
science project to rescue and digitize two to five million historic meteorological and weather records
that were collected by the Meteorological Services of the United Kingdom (UK) between 1860 and 1880
(NERC, 2019). These data could prove helpful in the development and refinement of climate models and
scenarios.
Individuals can also contribute to climate action and adaptation through voluntary action and increased
awareness. Examples include climate change guidebooks for citizen action (Apel et al., 2010; UNESCO,
2017) and citizen science/action projects. The UNESCO project Sandwatch (UNESCO, 2017) has
developed a handbook for climate change adaptation and education in sustainable development in order
to engage school students, teachers and local communities in the monitoring of coastal environments
in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) (such as beach erosion, pollution, sediment, water quality, etc.)
and the development of sustainable approaches to address them. The EarthWatch ‘FreshWater Watch’
and similar projects foster public engagement through hands-on action in the observation of freshwater
quality, pollution and wildlife. Since 2012, the FreshWater Watch community has gathered more than
20,000 water quality samples from around the world, which have been contributed by volunteers, research
organizations and schools in Africa, Europe and the UK (EarthWatch Institue, n.d.).
In combining scientific research with public education, citizen science also addresses broader societal
impacts in a profound way, by engaging the public in research experiences at various stages in the
scientific process and using modern communications tools to involve them (Dickinson et al., 2012). As
such, it contributes to closing the science–policy gap.

This closing chapter constitutes an urgent call for action.

14.1

From adaptation to mitigation
Some of the water-related impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle can be quite obvious,
as exemplified by the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events such as storms, floods
and droughts. But the overall impacts run much deeper. Food security, human health, urban and rural
settlements, energy production, industrial development, economic growth, and ecosystems are all
water-dependent and thus vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. When climate change impacts
upon water resources and water-related services, it deprives people of the exercise of their rights to safe
drinking water and sanitation and threatens livelihoods, particularly those of the world’s most vulnerable
women, men and children.
The interlinkages between water and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been clearly
demonstrated (United Nations, 2018a; 2019; UN-Water, 2019). As such, failure to adapt to climate change
not only puts the realization of SDG 6 (the ‘water goal’) at risk, it also jeopardizes the achievement of most
other SDGs. This, in and of itself, would seem sufficient to garner the attention of societies and decisionmakers in all sectors and at appropriate levels of government, and to prompt the water and climate change
communities to take greater, focused and concerted action in collaboration with other water-dependent
sectors, especially in terms of adaptation across the water domain.
Such a call for action is nothing new. In 2003, a global initiative called the Dialogue on Water and Climate
sought to bridge the knowledge and communication gaps between water managers and climate
scientists, and to promote water-related adaption measures through a series of 18 multi-stakeholder
dialogues at regional, national and basin levels, collectively highlighting the need to prepare for and adapt
to the effects of climate variability and the likely implications of climate change (Kabat and Van Schaik,
2003). Although recognized by some, this call for action, and others like it, have gone widely unheeded.
Nearly two decades later, the research has matured and the evidence has accumulated to the point where
the process of climate change is accepted as a ‘certainty’ by all but a very few lone voices among the
scientific community. Yet again, however, concrete actions remain largely insufficient.
One thing that has begun to change is the recognition and understanding that water, and more specifically
improved water management, can be a very important part of the solution to climate change.
There has been a long-held belief that mitigation is mainly about energy, whereas adaptation is mainly
about water. While somewhat true, this perspective greatly oversimplifies things. Of course, water
management needs to adapt to climate change – from countering the effects of floods to addressing
increasing water stress for agriculture, industry and other uses. But water management can also play
a very important role in climate change mitigation. As described throughout this report, specific water
management interventions such as wetland protection, conservation agriculture and other nature-based
solutions (NBS) can help to sequester carbon in biomass and soils, while improved wastewater treatment
can help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and produce biogas as a source of renewable energy.
Converting this knowledge into action is entirely possible, but getting there will require adopting a series
of practical and cost-efficient responses, and creating an enabling environment through which positive
transformative change can happen.

14.2

Fostering an enabling environment for change
14.2.1 Uniting climate action and water governance
Water is the medium through which societies experience the most severe impacts of climate change. That
makes water and climate change everyone’s business. Chapter 11 highlights the importance of an equitable,
participatory, multi-stakeholder approach to water governance in the context of climate change. Given the
cross-cutting nature of water and climate through different economic sectors and across society, trade-offs
and conflicting interests need to be addressed at all levels in order to negotiate integrated and coordinated
solutions.
Chapter 2 described water as a ‘connector’ among the global commitments adopted in 2015: Agenda 2030
and the SDGs, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk
Reduction. The recognition of water’s central role in achieving different international agreements can trickle
down into national priorities that in turn support local actions by communities, stakeholders and citizens.
As detailed in Chapter 10, regional and transboundary (basin) cooperation mechanisms offer potential
opportunities to further advance climate change adaptation and mitigation components into water
development planning and vice versa. Regional and transboundary cooperation can allow for the pooling
of resources and can benefit participating entities through improved communication, monitoring and data
sharing, sectoral cooperation, capacity support, and (potentially) greater access to funding mechanisms.

14.2.2 Expanding funding opportunities via the climate change agenda
An in-depth examination of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) submitted by countries as
part of the Paris Agreement reveals that, in many cases, water is recognized in terms of policy statements
or broad plans (Chapter 10). However, only a very limited number of NDCs actually include the ‘intention’
of preparing a specific water plan. And while a majority of countries acknowledge water in their NDC’s
‘portfolio of actions’, fewer have estimated the related costs of these actions, and even fewer have included
detailed water-related project proposals.
This situation relates directly to finance – an absolutely critical issue as water resources management and
water supply and sanitation services have remained notoriously underfunded. Although there is quite a bit of
funding available from the climate change funds, most of that funding has been earmarked for mitigation,
and has thus not been accessible as a source of financing for water-related projects. Yet, as described in
Chapters 3 and 9, a number of water management interventions can and do have aspects of both mitigation
and adaptation. Connecting water to climate change would allow countries to leverage additional resources
to address the wide overlap between climate and water challenges, and thus improve the outlook of meeting
the overall water management goals as outlined in SDG 6.

180

As detailed in Chapter 12, there are increasing opportunities to more genuinely and
systematically integrate adaptation and mitigation planning into water investments,
rendering these investments and associated activities more appealing to climate
financiers. Furthermore, various water-related climate change initiatives can also provide
co-benefits such as job creation, improved public health (Chapter 5), reducing poverty
(Chapter 11), promotion of gender equality, reduced household expenses, and carbon
sequestration, among others. Human settlements (Chapter 8), agriculture (Chapter 6),
energy and industry (Chapter 7), and disaster risk reduction (Chapter 4) are all critical
sectors in which the water–climate connection can be highlighted as part of the NDCs.
Underlining such potential synergies as part of the planning process, where applicable,
would increase a project’s ‘bankability’ when presented to financiers. All the more
so when presented in the context of a ‘results-based’ framework that incorporates
modalities to manage climatic and non-climatic risks and uncertainties.
Moreover, investing in water management pays off in terms of improved availability
of water in sufficient quality and quantity, and in avoided costs from extreme events
(Chapter 12). Indirectly, a more secure environment in terms of both availability of water
and resilience against extreme events provides incentives for increased economic
investments.

14.2.3 Enhancing knowledge, capacity and cooperation
Despite the mounting evidence that climate change is affecting the global hydrological cycle, much
uncertainty remains when projecting its impacts over smaller geographical and temporal scales
(Prologue). However, this uncertainty must not be seen as an excuse for inaction. Rather, it should serve
as an impetus to expand research, to promote the development of practical analytical tools and innovative
technologies (Chapter 13), and to build the institutional and human capacity required to foster informed,
science-based decision-making, and thus be prepared for a changing environment.
As described in Chapter 9, different sectors and stakeholders can face a variety of challenges with respect
to both water management and climate change adaptation and mitigation. The often strong interlinkages
across the water–climate–energy–food–environment ‘nexus’ can lead to synergies and cross-benefits
in some cases, and in others impose difficult choices and trade-offs. Open, interdisciplinary approaches
are therefore required to ensure that the various perspectives and knowledge from different disciplines
feed into the analyses and inform the decision-making process. The examples of conservation agriculture
(Chapter 6) and sustainable land management (Chapter 9) clearly demonstrate how locally applied
soil management techniques can have positive effects on water availability and flood control across a
catchment (adaptation), while at the same time enhancing soil carbon storage (mitigation).
The need for greater cooperation between the water and climate communities exists well beyond the
realm of scientific research. The disconnect remains abundantly clear at the policy level as well – most
obviously in the fact that the term ‘water’ is completely absent from the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2015).
On the one hand, it is imperative that the climate change community, and climate negotiators in particular,
give greater attention to the role of water and recognize its central importance in addressing the climate
change crisis. On the other hand, it is equally (if not more) essential that the water community focuses its
efforts to promote the importance of water in terms of both adaptation and mitigation, develop concrete
water-related project proposals for inclusion in NDCs, and strengthen the means and capacities to plan,
implement and monitor water-related activities in NDCs (prior to the 2020 NDC review and beyond).

14.3

Coda
Combining climate change adaptation and mitigation, through water, is a win-win-win proposal. First,
of course, it benefits water resources management and improves the provision of water supply and
sanitation services. Second, it directly contributes to combating both the causes and impacts of climate
change, including disaster risk reduction. Third, it contributes, directly and indirectly, to meeting several of
the Sustainable Development Goals (hunger, poverty, health, energy, industry, climate action and so on –
not to mention SDG 6, the ‘water goal’ itself) and a host of other global objectives.
In an era characterized by a host of ‘gloom and doom’ studies and articles on climate change and other
global environmental crises, and in light of the perceived setbacks of the COP25 meeting, this report
proposes a series of practical responses, in terms of policy, financing and action on the ground, to support
our collective objectives and individual aspirations to achieve a sustainable and prosperous world for all.

UN-WATER REPORTS

UN-Water coordinates the efforts of United Nations entities and international organizations working on water and
sanitation issues. By doing so, UN-Water seeks to increase the effectiveness of the support provided to Member States
in their efforts towards achieving international agreements on water and sanitation. UN-Water publications draw on the
experience and expertise of UN-Water’s Members and Partners.
United Nations World Water Development Report
The United Nations World Water Development Report (WWDR) is UN-Water’s flagship report on water and sanitation issues,
focusing on a different theme each year. The report is published by UNESCO, on behalf of UN-Water and its production is
coordinated by the UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme. The report gives insight on main trends concerning the
state, use and management of freshwater and sanitation, based on work done by the Members and Partners of UN-Water.
Launched in conjunction with World Water Day, the report provides decision-makers with knowledge and tools to formulate
and implement sustainable water policies. It also offers best practices and in-depth analyses to stimulate ideas and actions
for better stewardship in the water sector and beyond.
Sustainable Development Goal 6 Synthesis Report 2018 on Water and Sanitation
The SDG 6 Synthesis Report 2018 on Water and Sanitation was published in June 2018 ahead of the High-level Political
Forum on Sustainable Development where Member States reviewed SDG 6 in depth. Representing a joint position from the
United Nations family, the report offers guidance to understanding global progress on SDG 6 and its interdependencies with
other goals and targets.
Sustainable Development Goal 6 Indicator Reports
This series of reports shows the progress towards targets set out in SDG 6 using the SDG global indicators. The reports are
based on country data, compiled and verified by the United Nations agencies serving as custodians of each indicator.
UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS)
GLAAS is produced by the World Health Organization (WHO) on behalf of UN-Water. It provides a global update on the policy
frameworks, institutional arrangements, human resource base, and international and national finance streams in support of
sanitation and drinking water. It is a substantive input into the activities of Sanitation and Water for All (SWA).
The progress report of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP)
This report is affiliated with UN-Water and presents the results of the global monitoring of progress towards access to safe
and affordable drinking water, and adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene. Monitoring draws on the findings of
household surveys and censuses usually supported by national statistics bureaus in accordance with international criteria
and increasingly draws on national administrative and regulatory datasets.
Policy and Analytical Briefs
UN-Water’s Policy Briefs provide short and informative policy guidance on the most pressing freshwater-related issues that
draw upon the combined expertise of the United Nations system. Analytical Briefs provide an analysis of emerging issues
and may serve as basis for further research, discussion and future policy guidance.
