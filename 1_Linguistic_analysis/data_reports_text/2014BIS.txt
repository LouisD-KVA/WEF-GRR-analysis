BIS 84th Annual Report

84th Annual Report

submitted to the Annual General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements
held in Basel on 29 June 2014

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to submit to you the 84th Annual Report of the Bank for
International Settlements, for the financial year which ended on 31 March 2014.
The net profit for the year amounted to SDR 419.3 million, compared with
SDR 895.4 million for the preceding year. The figure for the preceding year has
been restated to reflect a change in accounting policy for post-employment benefit
obligations. The amended policy is disclosed under “Accounting policies” (no 26)
on page 184, and the financial impact of the change is disclosed in note 3 to the
financial statements on pages 186–8. Details of the results for the financial year
2013/14 may be found on pages 167–9 of this Report under “Net profit and its
distribution”.
The Board of Directors proposes, in application of Article 51 of the Bank’s
Statutes, that the present General Meeting allocate the sum of SDR 120.0 million in
payment of a dividend of SDR 215 per share, payable in any constituent currency of
the SDR, or in Swiss francs.
The Board further recommends that SDR 15.0 million be transferred to the
general reserve fund and the remainder – amounting to SDR 284.3 million – to the
free reserve fund.
If these proposals are approved, the Bank’s dividend for the financial year
2013/14 will be payable to shareholders on 3 July 2014.

Overview of the economic chapters

I. In search of a new compass
The global economy has shown encouraging signs over the past year. But its
malaise persists, as the legacy of the Great Financial Crisis and the forces that led
up to it remain unresolved. To overcome that legacy, policy needs to go beyond its
traditional focus on the business cycle. It also needs to address the longer-term
build-up and run-off of macroeconomic risks that characterise the financial cycle
and to shift away from debt as the main engine of growth. Restoring sustainable
growth will require targeted policies in all major economies, whether or not they
were hit by the crisis. Countries that were most affected need to complete the
process of repairing balance sheets and implementing structural reforms. The
current upturn in the global economy provides a precious window of opportunity
that should not be wasted. In a number of economies that escaped the worst effects
of the financial crisis, growth has been spurred by strong financial booms. Policy in
those economies needs to put more emphasis on curbing the booms and building
the strength to cope with a possible bust, and there, too, it cannot afford to put
structural reforms on the back burner. Looking further ahead, dampening the
extremes of the financial cycle calls for improvements in policy frameworks – fiscal,
monetary and prudential – to ensure a more symmetrical response across booms
and busts. Otherwise, the risk is that instability will entrench itself in the global
economy and room for policy manoeuvre will run out.

II. Global financial markets under the spell of monetary policy
Financial markets have been acutely sensitive to monetary policy, both actual
and anticipated. Throughout the year, accommodative monetary conditions kept
volatility low and fostered a search for yield. High valuations on equities, narrow
credit spreads, low volatility and abundant corporate bond issuance all signalled a
strong appetite for risk on the part of investors. At times during the past year,
emerging market economies proved vulnerable to shifting global conditions; those
economies with stronger fundamentals fared better, but they were not completely
insulated from bouts of market turbulence. By mid-2014, investors again exhibited
strong risk-taking in their search for yield: most emerging market economies
stabilised, global equity markets reached new highs and credit spreads continued to
narrow. Overall, it is hard to avoid the sense of a puzzling disconnect between the
markets’ buoyancy and underlying economic developments globally.

III. Growth and inflation: drivers and prospects
World economic growth has picked up, with advanced economies providing most of
the uplift, while global inflation has remained subdued. Despite the current upswing,
growth in advanced economies remains below pre-crisis averages. The slow growth
in advanced economies is no surprise: the bust after a prolonged financial boom
typically coincides with a balance sheet recession, the recovery from which is much

weaker than in a normal business cycle. That weakness reflects a number of factors:
supply side distortions and resource misallocations, large debt and capital stock
overhangs, damage to the financial sector and limited policy room for manoeuvre.
Investment in advanced economies in relation to output is being held down mostly
by the correction of previous financial excesses and long-run structural forces.
Meanwhile, growth in emerging market economies, which has generally been strong
since the crisis, faces headwinds. The current weakness of inflation in advanced
economies reflects not only slow domestic growth and a low utilisation of domestic
resources, but also the influence of global factors. Over the longer term, raising
productivity holds the key to more robust and sustainable growth.

IV. Debt and the financial cycle: domestic and global
Financial cycles encapsulate the self-reinforcing interactions between perceptions
of value and risk, risk-taking and financing constraints, which translate into financial
booms and busts. Financial cycles tend to last longer than traditional business
cycles. Countries are currently at very different stages of the financial cycle. In the
economies most affected by the 2007–09 financial crisis, households and firms have
begun to reduce their debt relative to income, but the ratio remains high in many
cases. In contrast, a number of the economies less affected by the crisis find
themselves in the late stages of strong financial booms, making them vulnerable to
a balance sheet recession and, in some cases, serious financial distress. At the same
time, the growth of new funding sources has changed the character of risks. In this
second phase of global liquidity, corporations in emerging market economies are
raising much of their funding from international markets and thus are facing the
risk that their funding may evaporate at the first sign of trouble. More generally,
countries could at some point find themselves in a debt trap: seeking to stimulate
the economy through low interest rates encourages even more debt, ultimately
adding to the problem it is meant to solve.

V. Monetary policy struggles to normalise
Monetary policy has remained very accommodative while facing a number of
tough challenges. First, in the major advanced economies, central banks struggled
with an unusually sluggish recovery and signs of diminished monetary policy
effectiveness. Second, emerging market economies and small open advanced
economies contended with bouts of market turbulence and with monetary policy
spillovers from the major advanced economies. National authorities in the latter
have further scope to take into account the external effects of their actions and the
corresponding feedback on their own jurisdictions. Third, a number of central banks
struggled with how best to address unexpected disinflation. The policy response
needs to carefully consider the nature and persistence of the forces at work as well
as policy’s diminished effectiveness and side effects. Finally, looking forward, the
issue of how best to calibrate the timing and pace of policy normalisation looms
large. Navigating the transition is likely to be complex and bumpy, regardless of
communication efforts. And the risk of normalising too late and too gradually
should not be underestimated.

VI. The financial system at a crossroads
The financial sector has gained some strength since the crisis. Banks have rebuilt
capital (mainly through retained earnings) and many have shifted their business
models towards traditional banking. However, despite an improvement in aggregate
profitability, many banks face lingering balance sheet weaknesses from direct
exposure to overindebted borrowers, the drag of debt overhang on economic
recovery and the risk of a slowdown in those countries that are at late stages
of financial booms. In the current financial landscape, market-based financial
intermediation has expanded, notably because banks face a higher cost of funding
than some of their corporate clients. In particular, asset management companies
have grown rapidly over the past few years and are now a major source of credit.
Their larger role, together with high size concentration in the sector, may influence
market dynamics and hence the cost and availability of funding for firms and
households.

I. In search of a new compass

The global economy continues to face serious challenges. Despite a pickup in
growth, it has not shaken off its dependence on monetary stimulus. Monetary policy
is still struggling to normalise after so many years of extraordinary accommodation.
Despite the euphoria in financial markets, investment remains weak. Instead of
adding to productive capacity, large firms prefer to buy back shares or engage in
mergers and acquisitions. And despite lacklustre long-term growth prospects, debt
continues to rise. There is even talk of secular stagnation.
Why is this so? To understand these dynamics, we need to go back to the Great
Financial Crisis. The crisis that erupted in August 2007 and peaked roughly one year
later marked a defining moment in economic history. It was a watershed, both
economically and intellectually: we now naturally divide developments into pre- and
post-crisis. It cast a long shadow into the past: the crisis was no bolt from the blue,
but stemmed almost inevitably from deep forces that had been at work for years, if
not decades. And it cast a long shadow into the future: its legacy is still with us and
shapes the course ahead.
Understanding the current global economic challenges requires a long-term
perspective. Such a perspective should extend well beyond the time span of the
output fluctuations (“business cycles”) that dominate economic thinking. As
conceived and measured, these business cycles play out over no more than eight
years. This is the reference time frame for most macroeconomic policy, the one that
feeds policymakers’ impatience at the slow pace of economic recovery and that
helps to answer questions on how quickly output might be expected to return to
normal or how long it might deviate from its trend. It is the time frame in which the
latest blips in industrial production, consumer and business confidence surveys or
inflation numbers are scrutinised in search of clues about the economy.
But this time frame is too short. Financial fluctuations (“financial cycles”) that
can end in banking crises such as the recent one last much longer than business
cycles. Irregular as they may be, they tend to play out over perhaps 15 to 20 years
on average. After all, it takes a lot of tinder to light a big fire. Yet financial cycles
can go largely undetected. They are simply too slow-moving for policymakers and
observers whose attention is focused on shorter-term output fluctuations.
The fallout from the financial cycle can be devastating. When financial booms
turn to busts, output and employment losses may be huge and extraordinarily
long-lasting. In other words, balance sheet recessions levy a much heavier toll than
normal recessions. The busts reveal the resource misallocations and structural
deficiencies that were temporarily masked by the booms. Thus, when policy
responses fail to take a long-term perspective, they run the risk of addressing
the immediate problem at the cost of creating a bigger one down the road.
Debt accumulation over successive business and financial cycles becomes the
decisive factor.
This year’s BIS Annual Report explores this long-term perspective.1 In taking
stock of the global economy, it sets out a framework in which the crisis, the policy

response to it and its legacy take centre stage. The long-term view complements
the more traditional focus on shorter-term fluctuations in output, employment and
inflation – one in which financial factors may play a role, but a peripheral one.
The bottom line is simple. The global economy has shown many encouraging
signs over the past year. But it would be imprudent to think it has shaken off its postcrisis malaise. The return to sustainable and balanced growth may remain elusive.
The restoration of sustainable growth requires broad-based policies. In crisis-hit
countries, there is a need to put more emphasis on balance sheet repair and
structural reforms and relatively less on monetary and fiscal stimulus: the supply side
is crucial. Good policy is less a question of seeking to pump up growth at all costs
than of removing the obstacles that hold it back. The upturn in the global economy
is a precious window of opportunity that should not be wasted. In economies that
escaped the worst effects of the financial crisis and have been growing on the back
of strong financial booms, there is a need to put more emphasis on curbing those
booms and building strength to cope with a possible bust. Warranting special
attention are new sources of financial risks, linked to the rapid growth of capital
markets. In these economies also, structural reforms are too important to be put on
the back burner.
There is a common element in all this. In no small measure, the causes of the
post-crisis malaise are those of the crisis itself – they lie in a collective failure to get
to grips with the financial cycle. Addressing this failure calls for adjustments to
policy frameworks – fiscal, monetary and prudential – to ensure a more symmetrical
response across booms and busts. And it calls for moving away from debt as the
main engine of growth. Otherwise, the risk is that instability will entrench itself in the
global economy and room for policy manoeuvre will run out.
The first section takes the pulse of the global economy. The second interprets
developments through the lens of the financial cycle and assesses the risks ahead.
The third develops the policy implications.

The global economy: where do we stand?
The good news is that growth has picked up over the past year and the consensus
is for further improvement (Chapter III). In fact, global GDP growth is projected to
approach the rates prevailing in the pre-crisis decade. Advanced economies (AEs)
have been gaining momentum even as their emerging counterparts have lost some.
On balance, though, the post-crisis period has been disappointing. By the
standards of normal business cycles, the recovery has been slow and weak in crisishit countries. Unemployment there is still well above pre-crisis levels, even if it has
recently retreated. Emerging market economies (EMEs) have stood out as the main
engines of post-crisis growth, rebounding strongly after the crisis until the recent
weakening. Overall, while global GDP growth is not far away from the rates seen in
the 2000s, the shortfall in the GDP path persists. We have not made up the lost
ground.
Moreover, the longer-term outlook for growth is far from bright (Chapter III).
In AEs, especially crisis-hit ones, productivity growth has disappointed during the
recovery. And this comes on top of a longer-term trend decline. So far, productivity
has held up better in economies less affected by the crisis and especially in EMEs,
where no such long-term decline is generally evident. That said, demographic
headwinds are blowing strongly, and not only in the more mature economies.
What about inflation? In a number of EMEs, it is still a problem. But by and
large, it has stayed low and stable – this is good news. At the same time, in some
crisis-hit jurisdictions and elsewhere, inflation has been persistently below target. In

8

BIS 84th Annual Report

some cases, new concerns have been voiced about deflation, notably in the euro
area. This raises the question, discussed below, of how much one should worry.
On the financial side, the picture is one of sharp contrasts.
Financial markets have been exuberant over the past year, at least in AEs,
dancing mainly to the tune of central bank decisions (Chapter II). Volatility in equity,
fixed income and foreign exchange markets has sagged to historical lows.
Obviously, market participants are pricing in hardly any risks. In AEs, a powerful and
pervasive search for yield has gathered pace and credit spreads have narrowed. The
euro area periphery has been no exception. Equity markets have pushed higher. To
be sure, in EMEs the ride has been much rougher. At the first hint in May last year
that the Federal Reserve might normalise its policy, emerging markets reeled, as did
their exchange rates and asset prices. Similar tensions resurfaced in January, this
time driven more by a change in sentiment about conditions in EMEs themselves.
But market sentiment has since improved in response to decisive policy measures
and a renewed search for yield. Overall, it is hard to avoid the sense of a puzzling
disconnect between the markets’ buoyancy and underlying economic developments
globally.
The financial sector’s health has improved, but scars remain (Chapter VI). In
crisis-hit economies, banks have made progress in raising capital, largely through
retained earnings and new issues, under substantial market and regulatory pressure.
That said, in some jurisdictions doubts linger about asset quality and how far
balance sheets have been repaired. Not surprisingly, the comparative weakness of
banks has supported a major expansion of corporate bond markets as an alternative
source of funding. Elsewhere, in many countries less affected by the crisis and on
the back of rapid credit growth, balance sheets look stronger but have started to
deteriorate in some cases.
Private non-financial sector balance sheets have been profoundly affected by
the crisis and pre-crisis trends (Chapter IV). In crisis-hit economies, private sector
credit expansion has been slow, but debt-to-GDP ratios generally remain high, even
if they have come down in some countries. At the other end of the spectrum,
several economies that escaped the crisis, particularly EMEs, have seen credit and
asset price booms which have only recently started to slow. Globally, the total debt
of private non-financial sectors has risen by some 30% since the crisis, pushing up
its ratio to GDP (Graph I.1).
Particularly worrying is the limited room for manoeuvre in macroeconomic policy.
Fiscal policy remains generally under strain (Chapter III). In crisis-hit economies,
fiscal deficits ballooned as revenues collapsed, economies received emergency
stimuli and, in some cases, the authorities rescued banks. More recently, several
countries have sought to consolidate. Even so, government debt-to-GDP ratios
have risen further; in several cases, they appear to be on an unsustainable path. In
countries that were not hit by the crisis, the picture is more mixed, with debt-toGDP ratios in some cases actually falling, in others rising but from much lower
levels. The combined public sector debt of the G7 economies has grown by close to
40 percentage points, to some 120% of GDP in the post-crisis period – a key factor
behind the 20 percentage point increase in total (public plus private sector) debtto-GDP ratios globally (Graph I.1).
Monetary policy is testing its outer limits (Chapter V). In the crisis-hit economies
and Japan, monetary policy has been extraordinarily accommodative. With policy
rates at or close to the zero lower bound in all the main international currencies,
central banks have eased further by adopting forward guidance and aggressive
balance sheet policies such as large-scale asset purchases and long-term lending.
Never before have central banks tried to push so hard. The normalisation of the
policy stance has hardly started. In other countries, post-crisis interest rates have

also been quite low and central banks have vigorously expanded their balance
sheets, in this case reflecting foreign exchange interventions. Mainly as a result of
the market turbulence, several EME central banks have raised rates in the past year.
The overall impression is that the global economy is healing but remains
unbalanced. Growth has picked up, but long-term prospects are not that bright.
Financial markets are euphoric, but progress in strengthening banks’ balance sheets
has been uneven and private debt keeps growing. Macroeconomic policy has little
room for manoeuvre to deal with any untoward surprises that might be sprung,
including a normal recession.

The global economy through the financial cycle lens
How did we get here? And what are the macroeconomic risks ahead? To understand
the journey, we need to study the nature of the past recession and the subsequent
policy response.

A balance sheet recession and its aftermath
The prologue to the Great Recession is well known. A major financial boom
developed against the backdrop of low and stable inflation, turbocharged, as so
often in past such episodes, by financial innovation. Credit and property prices
soared, shrugging off a shallow recession in the early 2000s and boosting economic
growth once more (Chapter IV). Spirits ran high. There was talk of a Great
Moderation – a general sense that policymakers had finally tamed the business cycle
and uncovered the deepest secrets of the economy.
The recession that followed shattered this illusion. As the financial boom turned
to bust, a financial crisis of rare proportions erupted. Output and world trade
collapsed. The ghost of the Great Depression loomed large.
The policy response was haunted by that ghost. To be sure, the first signs of
trouble were misread. When interbank markets froze in August 2007, the prevailing

10

BIS 84th Annual Report

view was that the stress would remain contained. But matters changed when
Lehman Brothers failed roughly one year later and the global economy hit an air
pocket. Both monetary and fiscal policies were used aggressively to avoid a repeat
of the 1930s experience. This echoed well beyond the countries directly hit by the
crisis, with China embarking on a massive credit-fuelled expansion.
At first, the medicine seemed to work. Counterfactual statements are always
hard to make. But no doubt the prompt policy response did cushion the blow
and forestall the worst. In particular, an aggressive monetary policy easing in
crisis-hit economies restored confidence and prevented the financial system
and the economy from plunging into a tailspin. This is what crisis management is
all about.
Even so, as events unfolded, relief gave way to disappointment. The global
economy did not recover as hoped. Growth forecasts, at least for crisis-hit
economies, were repeatedly revised downwards. Fiscal policy expansion failed to
jump-start the economy. In fact, gaping holes opened up in the fiscal accounts.
And in the euro area, partly because of the institutional specificities, a sovereign
crisis erupted in full force, threatening a “doom loop” between weak banks and
sovereigns. Globally, concerns with fiscal unsustainability induced a partial change of
fiscal course. In the meantime, in an effort to boost the recovery, monetary policy
continued to experiment with ever more imaginative measures. And regulatory
authorities struggled to rebuild the financial system’s strength. The global economy
was not healing.
With hindsight at least, this sequence of events should not be surprising. The
recession was not the typical postwar recession to quell inflation. This was a balance
sheet recession, associated with the bust of an outsize financial cycle. As a result, the
debt and capital stock overhangs were much larger, the damage to the financial
sector far greater and the room for policy manoeuvre much more limited.
Balance sheet recessions have two key features.
First, they are very costly (Chapter III). They tend to be deeper, give way to
weaker recoveries, and result in permanent output losses: output may return to its
previous long-term growth rate but hardly to its previous growth path. No doubt,
several factors are at work. Booms make it all too easy to overestimate potential
output and growth as well as to misallocate capital and labour. And during the
bust, the overhangs of debt and capital stock weigh on demand while an impaired
financial system struggles to oil the economic engine, damaging productivity and
further eroding long-term prospects.
Second, as growing evidence suggests, balance sheet recessions are less
responsive to traditional demand management measures (Chapter V). One reason
is that banks need to repair their balance sheets. As long as asset quality is poor
and capital meagre, banks will tend to restrict overall credit supply and, more
importantly, misallocate it. As they lick their wounds, they will naturally retrench. But
they will keep on lending to derelict borrowers (to avoid recognising losses) while
cutting back on credit or making it dearer for those in better shape. A second, even
more important, reason is that overly indebted agents will wish to pay down debt
and save more. Give them an additional unit of income, as fiscal policy would do,
and they will save it, not spend it. Encourage them to borrow more by reducing
interest rates, as monetary policy would do, and they will refuse to oblige. During a
balance sheet recession, the demand for credit is necessarily feeble. The third reason
relates to the large sectoral and aggregate imbalances in the real sector that build
up during the preceding financial boom – in construction, for instance. Boosting
aggregate demand indiscriminately does little to address them. It may actually make
matters worse if, for example, very low interest rates favour sectors where too much
capital is already in place.

To be sure, only part of the world went through a full balance sheet recession
(Chapter III). The countries that did so experienced outsize domestic financial cycles,
including, in particular, the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain and Ireland,
together with many countries in central and eastern Europe and the Baltic region.
There, debt overhangs in the household and non-financial company sectors went
hand in hand with systemic banking problems. Other countries, such as France,
Germany and Switzerland, experienced serious banking strains largely through their
banks’ exposures to financial busts elsewhere. The balance sheets of their private
non-financial sectors were far less affected. Still others, such as Canada and many
EMEs, were exposed to the crisis largely through trade linkages, not through their
banks; their recessions were not of the balance sheet variety. This was also true of
Japan, a country that has been struggling under the weight of a protracted demand
shortfall linked to demography; its own balance sheet recession was back in the
1990s: this hardly explains the country’s more recent travails. And only in the euro
area did a “doom loop” between banks and sovereigns break out.
This diversity also explains why countries now find themselves in different
positions in their domestic financial cycles (Chapter IV). Those that experienced full
balance sheet recessions have struggled to manage down their overhangs of private
debt amid falling property prices. That said, some of them are already seeing
renewed increases in property prices while debt levels are still high, and in some
cases growing. Elsewhere, the picture varies, but credit and property prices have
generally continued to rise post-crisis, at least until recently. In some countries, the
pace of financial expansion has remained within typical historical ranges. But in
others it has gone well beyond, resulting in strong financial booms.
In turn, the financial booms in this latter set of countries reflect in no
small measure the interplay of monetary policy responses (Chapters II, IV and V).
Extraordinarily easy monetary conditions in advanced economies have spread to the
rest of the world, encouraging financial booms there. They have done so directly,
because currencies are used well beyond the borders of the country of issue. In
particular, there is some $7 trillion in dollar-denominated credit outside the United
States, and it has been growing strongly post-crisis. They have also done so
indirectly, through arbitrage across currencies and assets. For example, monetary
policy has a powerful impact on risk appetite and risk perceptions (the “risk-taking
channel”). It influences measures of risk appetite, such as the VIX, as well as term
and risk premia, which co-move strongly worldwide – a factor that has gained
prominence as EMEs have deepened their fixed income markets. And monetary
policy responses in non-crisis-hit countries have also played a role. Authorities there
have found it hard to operate with interest rates that are significantly higher than
those in the large crisis-hit jurisdictions for fear of exchange rate overshooting and
of attracting surges in capital flows.
As a result, for the world as a whole monetary policy has been extraordinarily
accommodative for unusually long (Chapter V). Even excluding the impact of central
banks’ balance sheet policies and forward guidance, policy rates have remained well
below traditional benchmarks for quite some time.

Current macroeconomic and financial risks
Seen through the financial cycle lens, the current configuration of macroeconomic
and financial developments raises a number of risks.
In the countries that have been experiencing outsize financial booms, the risk is
that these will turn to bust and possibly inflict financial distress (Chapter IV). Based
on leading indicators that have proved useful in the past, such as the behaviour of
credit and property prices, the signs are worrying. Debt service ratios appear

12

BIS 84th Annual Report

somewhat less worrisome, but past experience suggests that they can surge before
distress emerges. This is especially so if interest rates spike, as might happen if it
became necessary to defend exchange rates under pressure from large unhedged
foreign exchange exposures and/or monetary policy normalisation in AEs.
Moreover, compared with the past, specific vulnerabilities may have changed in
unsuspected ways (Chapter IV). Over the past few years, non-financial corporations
in a number of EMEs have borrowed heavily through their foreign affiliates in the
capital markets, with the debt denominated mainly in foreign currency. This has
been labelled the “second phase of global liquidity”, to differentiate it from the precrisis phase, which was largely centred on banks expanding their cross-border
operations. The corresponding debt may not show up in external debt statistics or,
if the funds are repatriated, it may show up as foreign direct investment. It could
represent a hidden vulnerability, especially if backed by domestic currency cash
flows derived from overextended sectors, such as property, or used for carry trades
or other forms of speculative position-taking.
Likewise, the asset management industry’s burgeoning presence in EMEs could
amplify asset price dynamics under stress (Chapters IV and VI). This is especially the
case in fixed income markets, which have grown strongly over the past decade,
further exposing the countries concerned to global capital market forces. Like an
elephant in a paddling pool, the huge size disparity between global investor
portfolios and recipient markets can amplify dislocations. It is far from reassuring
that these flows have swelled on the back of an aggressive search for yield: strongly
procyclical, they surge and reverse as conditions and sentiment change.
To be sure, many EMEs have taken important steps to improve resilience over
the years. In contrast to the past, these countries have posted current account
surpluses, built up foreign exchange reserves, increased the flexibility of their
exchange rates, strengthened their financial systems and adopted a plethora of
macroprudential measures. Indeed, in the two episodes of market strains in May
2013 and January 2014, it was the countries with stronger macroeconomic and
financial conditions that fared better (Chapter II).
Even so, past experience suggests caution. The market strains seen so far have
not as yet coincided with financial busts; rather, they have resembled traditional
balance of payments tensions. To cushion financial busts, current account surpluses
may help, but only up to a point. In fact, historically some of the most damaging
financial booms have occurred in countries with strong external positions. The
United States in the 1920s, ahead of the Great Depression, and Japan in the 1980s
are just two examples. And macroprudential measures, while useful to strengthen
banks, have on their own proved unable to effectively constrain the build-up
of financial imbalances, especially where monetary conditions have remained
accommodative (Chapters V and VI). Time and again, in both advanced and
emerging market economies, seemingly strong bank balance sheets have turned out
to mask unsuspected vulnerabilities that surface only after the financial boom has
given way to bust (Chapter VI).
This time round, severe financial stress in EMEs would be unlikely to leave AEs
unscathed. The heft of EMEs has grown substantially since their last major reverse,
the 1997 Asian crisis. Since then, their share has risen from around one third to half
of world GDP, at purchasing power parity exchange rates. And so has their weight in
the international financial system. The ramifications would be particularly serious if
China, home to an outsize financial boom, were to falter. Especially at risk would be
the commodity-exporting countries that have seen strong credit and asset price
increases and where post-crisis terms-of-trade gains have shored up high debt and
property prices. And so would those areas in the world where balance sheet repair is
not yet complete.

BIS 84th Annual Report

13

In crisis-hit economies, the risk is that balance sheet adjustment remains
incomplete, in both the private and the public sectors. This would increase their
vulnerability to any renewed economic slowdown, regardless of its source, and it
would hinder policy normalisation. Indeed, in the large economies furthest ahead
in the business cycle, notably the United States and United Kingdom, it is somewhat
unsettling to see growth patterns akin to those observed in later stages of financial
cycles, even though debt and asset prices have not yet fully adjusted (Chapter IV).
For example, property prices have been unusually buoyant in the United Kingdom,
and segments of the corporate lending market, such as leveraged transactions, have
been even frothier than they were before the crisis in the United States (Chapter II).
Reflecting incomplete adjustment, in both cases private sector debt service ratios
appear highly sensitive to increases in interest rates (Chapter IV). Meanwhile,
especially in the euro area, doubts persist about the strength of banks’ balance
sheets (Chapter VI). And all this is occurring at a time when, almost everywhere,
fiscal positions remain fragile when assessed from a longer-term perspective.

Policy challenges
On the basis of this analysis, what should be done now? Designing the near-term
policy response requires taking developments in the business cycle and inflation
into account, which can give rise to awkward trade-offs. And how should policy
frameworks adjust longer-term?

Near-term challenges: what is to be done now?
The appropriate near-term policy responses, as always, have to be country-specific.
Even so, at some risk of oversimplification, it is possible to offer a few general
considerations by dividing countries into two sets: those that have experienced a
financial bust and those that have been experiencing financial booms. It is then
worth exploring a challenge that cuts across both groups: what to do where
inflation has been persistently below objectives.

Countries that have experienced a financial bust
In the countries that have experienced a financial bust, the priority is balance sheet
repair and structural reform. This proceeds naturally from three features of balance
sheet recessions: the damage from supply side distortions, the lower responsiveness
to aggregate demand policies and the much narrower room for policy manoeuvre,
be this fiscal, monetary or prudential. The objective is to lay the basis for a selfsustaining and robust recovery, to remove the obstacles to growth and to raise
growth potential. This holds out the best hope of avoiding chronic weakness.
Policymakers should not waste the window of opportunity that a strengthening
economy affords.
The first priority is to complete the repair of the banks’ balance sheets and to
shore up those of the non-financial sectors most affected by the crisis.
Disappointingly, despite all efforts so far, banks’ stand-alone ratings – which strip
out external support – have actually deteriorated post-crisis (Chapter VI). But
countries where policymakers have done more to enforce loss recognition and
recapitalise, such as the United States, have also recovered more strongly. This is
nothing new: before the recent crisis, the contrasting ways in which the Nordic
countries and Japan dealt with their banking crises in the early 1990s were widely
regarded as an important factor behind the subsequent divergence in their

14

BIS 84th Annual Report

economic performance. The European Union’s forthcoming asset quality review and
stress tests are crucial in achieving this objective. More generally, banks should be
encouraged to further improve their capital strength – the most solid basis for
further lending (Chapter VI). The completion of the post-crisis financial reforms, of
which Basel III is a core element, is vital.
This suggests that failure to repair balance sheets can sap the longer-term
output and growth potential of an economy (Chapter III). Put differently, what
economists call “hysteresis” – the impact on productive potential of the persistence
of temporary conditions – comes in various shapes and sizes. Commonly, hysteresis
effects are seen as manifesting themselves through chronic shortfalls in aggregate
demand. In particular, the unemployed lose their skills, thus becoming less
productive and employable. But there are also important, probably dominant,
effects that operate through misallocations of credit and other resources as well as
inflexible markets for goods, labour and capital. These are hardly mentioned in the
literature but deserve more attention. As a corollary, in the wake of a balance sheet
recession, the allocation of credit matters more than its aggregate amount. Given
the debt overhangs, it is not surprising that, as empirical evidence indicates, postcrisis recoveries tend to be “credit-less”. And even if overall credit fails to grow
strongly on a net basis, it is important that good borrowers obtain it rather than
bad ones.
Along with balance sheet repair, targeted structural reforms will also be
important. Structural reforms play a triple role (Chapter III). First, they can facilitate
the required resource transfers across sectors, so critical in the aftermath of balance
sheet recessions, thereby countering economic weakness and speeding up the
recovery (see last year’s Annual Report). For instance, it is probably no coincidence
that the United States, where labour and product markets are quite flexible, has
rebounded more strongly than continental Europe. Second, reforms will help raise
the economy’s sustainable growth rate in the longer term. Given adverse
demographic trends, and aside from higher participation rates, raising productivity
growth is the only way to boost long-term growth. And finally, through both
mechanisms, reforms can assure firms that demand will be there in future, thus
boosting it today. Although fixed business investment is not weak globally, where
it is weak the constraint is not tight financial conditions. The mix of structural
policies will necessarily vary according to the country. But it will frequently include
deregulating protected sectors, such as services, improving labour market flexibility,
raising participation rates and trimming public sector bloat.
More emphasis on repair and reform implies relatively less on expansionary
demand management.
This principle applies to fiscal policy. After the initial fiscal push, the need to
ensure longer-term sustainability has been partly rediscovered. This is welcome:
putting the fiscal house in order is paramount; the temptation to stray from this
path should be resisted. Whatever limited room for manoeuvre exists should be
used, first and foremost, to help repair balance sheets, using public funds as
backstops of last resort. A further use, where the need is great, could be to catalyse
private sector financing for carefully chosen infrastructure projects (Chapter VI).
Savings on other budgetary items may be needed to make room for these priorities.
And the same principle also applies to monetary policy. More intensive repair
and reform efforts would help relieve the huge pressure on monetary policy. While
some monetary accommodation is no doubt necessary, excessive demands have
been made on it post-crisis. The limitations of policy become especially acute when
rates approach zero (Chapter V). At that point, the only way to provide additional
stimulus is to manage expectations about the future path of the policy rate and to
use the central bank’s balance sheet to influence financial conditions beyond the

BIS 84th Annual Report

short-term interest rate. These policies do have an impact on asset prices and
markets, but have clear limits and diminishing returns. Term and risk premia can
only be compressed up to a point, and in recent years they have already reached or
approached historical lows. To be sure, exchange rate depreciation can help. But, as
discussed further below, it also raises awkward international issues, especially if it is
seen to have a beggar-thy-neighbour character.
The risk is that, over time, monetary policy loses traction while its side effects
proliferate. These side effects are well known (see previous Annual Reports). Policy
may help postpone balance sheet adjustments, by encouraging the evergreening
of bad debts, for instance. It may actually damage the profitability and financial
strength of institutions, by compressing interest margins. It may favour the wrong
forms of risk-taking. And it can generate unwelcome spillovers to other economies,
particularly when financial cycles are out of synch. Tellingly, growth has disappointed
even as financial markets have roared: the transmission chain seems to be badly
impaired. The failure to boost investment despite extremely accommodative financial
conditions is a case in point (Chapter III).
This raises the issue of the balance of risks concerning when and how fast to
normalise policy (Chapter V). In contrast to what is often argued, central banks
need to pay special attention to the risks of exiting too late and too gradually. This
reflects the economic considerations just outlined: the balance of benefits and costs
deteriorates as exceptionally accommodative conditions stay in place. And political
economy concerns also play a key role. As past experience indicates, huge financial
and political economy pressures will be pushing to delay and stretch out the exit.
The benefits of unusually easy monetary policies may appear quite tangible,
especially if judged by the response of financial markets; the costs, unfortunately,
will become apparent only over time and with hindsight. This has happened often
enough in the past.
And regardless of central banks’ communication efforts, the exit is unlikely to
be smooth. Seeking to prepare markets by being clear about intentions may
inadvertently result in participants taking more assurance than the central bank
wishes to convey. This can encourage further risk-taking, sowing the seeds of
an even sharper reaction. Moreover, even if the central bank becomes aware of
the forces at work, it may be boxed in, for fear of precipitating exactly the
sharp adjustment it is seeking to avoid. A vicious circle can develop. In the end, it
may be markets that react first, if participants start to see central banks as being
behind the curve. This, too, suggests that special attention needs to be paid to
the risks of delaying the exit. Market jitters should be no reason to slow down
the process.

Countries where financial booms are under way or turning
In the countries less affected by the crisis and that have been experiencing financial
booms, the priority is to address the build-up of imbalances, which could threaten
financial and macroeconomic stability. This task is a pressing one. As shown in May
last year, the eventual normalisation of US policy could trigger renewed market
tensions (Chapter II). The window of opportunity should not be missed.
The challenge for these countries is to seek ways to curb the boom, and to
strengthen defences against any eventual financial bust. First, prudential policy
should be tightened, especially through the use of macroprudential tools. Monetary
policy should work in the same direction while fiscal measures should preserve
enough room for manoeuvre to deal with any turn in the cycle. And, just as
elsewhere, the authorities should take advantage of today’s relatively favourable
climate to implement needed structural reforms.

16

BIS 84th Annual Report

The dilemma for monetary policy is especially acute. So far, policymakers have
relied mostly on macroprudential measures to dampen financial booms. These
measures have no doubt strengthened the financial system’s resilience, but their
effectiveness in constraining the booms has been mixed (Chapter VI). Debt burdens
have increased, as has the economy’s vulnerability to higher policy rates. After
rates have stayed so low for so long, the room for manoeuvre has narrowed
(Chapter IV). Particularly for countries in the late stages of financial booms, the
trade-off is now between the risk of bringing forward the downward leg of the
cycle and that of suffering a bigger bust later on. Earlier, more gradual adjustments
are preferable.

Interpreting recent disinflation
In recent years, a number of countries have experienced unusually and persistently
low inflation or even an outright fall in prices. In some cases, this has occurred
alongside sustained output growth and even some worrying signs that financial
imbalances are building up. One example is Switzerland, where prices have actually
been gradually declining while the mortgage market booms. Another is found in
some Nordic countries, where inflation has sagged below target and output
performance has been a bit weaker. The most notorious instance of long-lasting
price declines is Japan, where prices started to fall after the financial bust in the
1990s and continued to edge down until recently, albeit by a mere 4 percentage
points cumulatively. More recently, concerns have been expressed about low
inflation in the euro area.
In deciding how to respond, it is important to carefully assess the factors driving
prices and their persistence as well as to take a critical look at the effectiveness and
possible side effects of the available tools (Chapters III and V). For instance, there
are grounds for believing that the forces of globalisation are still exerting some
welcome downward pressure on inflation. Pre-crisis, this helped central banks to
keep inflation at bay even as financial booms developed. And when policy rates
have fallen to the effective zero lower bound, and the headwinds of a balance sheet
recession persist, monetary policy is not the best tool for boosting demand and
hence inflation. Moreover, damaging perceptions of competitive depreciations can
arise, given that in a context of generalised weakness the most effective channel for
raising output and prices is to depreciate the exchange rate.
More generally, it is essential to discuss the risks and costs of falling prices in a
dispassionate way. The word “deflation” is extraordinarily charged: it immediately
raises the spectre of the Great Depression. In fact, the Great Depression was the
exception rather than the rule, in the intensity of both its price declines and the
associated output losses (Chapter V). Historically, periods of falling prices have
often coincided with sustained output growth. And the experience of more recent
decades is no exception. Moreover, conditions have changed substantially since the
1930s, not least with regard to downward wage flexibility. This is no reason to be
complacent about the risks and costs of falling prices: they need to be monitored
and assessed closely, especially where debt levels are high. But it is a reason to avoid
knee-jerk reactions prompted by emotion.

Longer-term challenges: adjusting policy frameworks
The main long-term challenge is to adjust policy frameworks so as to promote
healthy and sustainable growth. This means two interrelated things.
The first is to recognise that the only way to sustainably strengthen growth is
to work on structural reforms that raise productivity and build the economy’s

BIS 84th Annual Report

17

resilience. This is an old and familiar problem (Chapter III). As noted, the decline in
productivity growth in advanced economies took hold a long time ago. To be sure,
as economies mature, part of this may be the natural result of shifts in demand
patterns towards sectors where measured productivity is lower, such as services. But
part is surely the result of a failure to embark on ambitious reforms. The temptation
to postpone adjustment can prove irresistible, especially when times are good and
financial booms sprinkle the fairy dust of illusory riches. The consequence is a
growth model that relies too much on debt, both private and public, and which
over time sows the seeds of its own demise.
The second, more novel, challenge is to adjust policy frameworks so as to
address the financial cycle more systematically. Frameworks that fail to get the
financial cycle on the radar screen may inadvertently overreact to short-term
developments in output and inflation, generating bigger problems down the road.
More generally, asymmetrical policies over successive business and financial cycles
can impart a serious bias over time and run the risk of entrenching instability in the
economy. Policy does not lean against the booms but eases aggressively and
persistently during busts. This induces a downward bias in interest rates and an
upward bias in debt levels, which in turn makes it hard to raise rates without
damaging the economy – a debt trap. Systemic financial crises do not become less
frequent or intense, private and public debts continue to grow, the economy fails
to climb onto a stronger sustainable path, and monetary and fiscal policies run out
of ammunition. Over time, policies lose their effectiveness and may end up fostering
the very conditions they seek to prevent. In this context, economists speak of “time
inconsistency”: taken in isolation, policy steps may look compelling but, as a
sequence, they lead policymakers astray.
As discussed, there are signs that this may well be happening. The room for
policy manoeuvre is shrinking even as debt continues to rise. And looking back, it
is not hard to find instances in which policy appeared to focus too narrowly on
short-term developments. Consider the response to the stock market crashes of
1987 and 2000 and the associated economic slowdowns (Chapter IV). Policy,
especially monetary policy, eased strongly in both cases to cushion the blow and
was tightened only gradually thereafter. But the financial boom, in the form of
credit and property price increases, gathered momentum even as the economy
softened, responding in part to the policy easing. The financial boom then
collapsed a few years later, causing aggravated financial stress and economic harm.
Paradoxically, the globalisation of the real economy added strength and breadth
to the financial booms: it raised growth expectations, thus turbocharging the
booms, while keeping a lid on prices, thereby lessening the need to tighten
monetary policy.
This also has implications for how to interpret the downward trend of interest
rates since the 1990s. Some observers see this decline as reflecting deeper forces
that generate a chronic shortfall in demand. On this interpretation, policy has
passively responded to such forces, thus preventing greater economic damage. But
this analysis indicates that policies with a systematic easing bias can be an important
factor in themselves, as they interact with the destructive force of the financial
cycle. Interest rates are hindered from returning to more normal levels by the
accumulation of debt, together with the distortions in production and investment
patterns associated with those same unusually low interest rates. In effect, low rates
validate themselves. By threatening to weaken balance sheets still further, the
looming downward pressure on asset prices linked to negative demographic trends
can only exacerbate this process.
What would it take to adjust policy frameworks? The required adjustments
concern national frameworks as well as the way they interact internationally.

18

BIS 84th Annual Report

The overall strategy for national policy frameworks should be to ensure that
buffers are built up during a financial boom so that they can be drawn down in the
bust. Such buffers would make the economy more resilient to a downturn. And, by
acting as a kind of sea anchor, they could also dampen the boom’s intensity. Their
effect would be to make policy less procyclical by rendering it more symmetrical
with respect to the boom and bust phases of the financial cycle. This would avoid a
progressive loss of policy room for manoeuvre over time.
For prudential policy, this means strengthening the framework’s systemic or
macroprudential orientation. Available instruments, such as capital requirements or
loan-to-value ratios, need to be adjusted to reduce procyclicality. For monetary
policy, this means being ready to tighten whenever financial imbalances show signs
of building up, even if inflation appears to be under control in the near term. And
for fiscal policy, it means extra caution when assessing fiscal strength during
financial booms, and taking remedial action. It also means designing a tax code that
does not favour debt over equity.
Following the crisis, policies have indeed moved in this direction, but to varying
degrees. And there is still more to do.
Prudential policy is furthest ahead. In particular, Basel III has introduced a
countercyclical capital buffer for banks as part of a broader trend towards
establishing national macroprudential frameworks.
Monetary policy has shifted somewhat. It is now generally recognised that price
stability does not guarantee financial stability. Moreover, a number of central banks
have adjusted their frameworks to incorporate the option of tightening during
booms. A key element has been to lengthen policy horizons. That said, no consensus
exists as to whether such adjustments are desirable. And the side effects of
prolonged and aggressive easing after the bust continue to be debated.
Fiscal policy lags furthest behind. There is little recognition of the huge
flattering effect that financial booms have on the fiscal accounts: they cause
potential output and growth to be overestimated (Chapter III), are particularly
generous to the fiscal coffers, and mask the build-up of contingent liabilities needed
to address the consequences of the busts. During their booms, for example, Ireland
and Spain could point to declining government debt-to-GDP ratios and to fiscal
surpluses that turned out, after all, not to be properly adjusted for the cycle.
Similarly, there is scant appreciation of the limitations of an expansionary fiscal
policy during a balance sheet recession; indeed, the prevailing view is that fiscal
policy is more effective under such conditions.
For monetary policy, the challenges are especially tough. The basic idea is to
lengthen the policy horizon beyond the two years or so that central banks typically
focus on. The idea is not to mechanically extend point forecasts, of course. Rather,
it is to permit a more systematic and structured assessment of the risks that the
slower-moving financial cycles pose to macroeconomic stability, inflation and the
effectiveness of policy tools. Concerns about the financial cycle and inflation would
also become easier to reconcile: the key is to combine an emphasis on sustainable
price stability with greater tolerance for short-run deviations from inflation
objectives as well as for exchange rate appreciation. Even so, the communication
challenges are daunting.
Turning to the interaction of national policy frameworks, the challenge is to
tackle the complications that ensue from a highly integrated global economy.
In such a world, the need for collective action – cooperation – is inescapable.
National policies, taken individually, are less effective. And incentive problems
abound: national policymakers may be tempted to free-ride, or they may come
under political pressure to disregard the unwelcome impact of their policies on
others.

BIS 84th Annual Report

19

Cooperation is continuously tested; it advances and retreats. Post-crisis, it has
advanced considerably in the fields of financial regulation and fiscal affairs. Witness
the overhaul of financial regulatory frameworks, most notably Basel III and the
efforts coordinated by the Financial Stability Board, as well as the recent initiatives
on taxation under the aegis of the G20. In these areas, the need for cooperation has
been fully recognised.
By contrast, in the monetary field the own-house-in-order doctrine still
dominates: as argued in more detail elsewhere,2 there is clearly room for
improvement. The previous discussion indicates that the interaction of national
monetary policies has raised risks for the global economy. These are most vividly
reflected in what have been extraordinarily accommodative monetary and financial
conditions for the world as a whole, and in the build-up of financial imbalances
within certain regions. At a minimum, there is a need for national authorities to take
into account the effects of their actions on other economies and the corresponding
feedbacks on their own jurisdictions. No doubt, the larger economies already seek
to do this. But if their analytical frameworks do not place financial booms and busts
at the centre of the assessments and if they fail to take into account the myriad of
financial interconnections that hold the global economy together, these feedback
effects will be badly underestimated.

Conclusion
The global economy is struggling to step out of the shadow of the Great Financial
Crisis. The legacy of the crisis is pervasive. It is evident in the comparatively high
levels of unemployment in crisis-hit economies, even as output growth has regained
strength, in the disconnect between extraordinarily buoyant financial markets and
weak investment, in the growing dependence of financial markets on central banks,
in rising private and public debt, and in the rapidly narrowing policy room for
manoeuvre.
This chapter has argued that a return to healthy and sustainable global growth
requires adjustments to the current policy mix and to policy frameworks. These
adjustments should acknowledge that the post-crisis balance sheet recession is less
amenable to traditional aggregate demand policies and puts a premium on balance
sheet repair and structural reforms, that financial booms and busts have become a
major threat to macroeconomic stability, and that the only source of lasting
prosperity is a stronger supply side, notably higher productivity growth. And they
should be based on the premise that, in a highly integrated global economy,
keeping one’s own house in order is necessary but not sufficient for prosperity: for
this, international cooperation is essential.
In the near term, the main task is to take advantage of the window of
opportunity presented by the current pickup in world growth. There is a need to rely
relatively less on traditional aggregate demand stimulus and more on balance
sheet repair and structural reforms, especially in crisis-hit economies. Monetary
policy, in particular, has been overburdened for too long. After so many years of an
exceptional monetary expansion, the risk of normalising too slowly and too late
deserves special attention. And, where applicable, the response to surprising
disinflationary pressures needs to carefully take into account the nature and
persistence of the forces at work, diminished policy effectiveness and its side effects.

BIS 84th Annual Report

In countries experiencing strong financial booms, the priority is to strengthen defences
to face a potential bust. There, too, structural reforms should not be delayed.
In the longer term, the main task is to adjust policy frameworks so as to make
growth less debt-dependent and to tame the destructive power of the financial
cycle. More symmetrical macroeconomic and prudential policies over that cycle
would avoid a persistent easing bias that, over time, can entrench instability and
exhaust the policy room for manoeuvre.
The risks of failing to act should not be underestimated. The global economy
may be set on an unsustainable path. And at some point, the current open global
trade and financial order could be seriously threatened. So far, institutional setups
have proved remarkably resilient to the huge shock of the financial crisis. But we
should not take this for granted, especially if serious financial stress were to
resurface. The intermittent noise about “currency wars” is particularly worrying:
where domestic expansionary policies do not work as expected, exchange rate
depreciation may come to be seen as the only option. But competitive easing can
be a negative sum game when everyone tries to use this weapon and the domestic
costs of the policies exceed their benefits. Also worrying is the growing temptation
for nation states to withdraw from the laborious but invaluable task of fostering
international integration.
Meanwhile, the consensus on the merits of price stability is fraying at the edges.
And, as memories of the costs and persistence of inflation fade, the temptation
could grow to void the huge debt burdens through a combination of inflation,
financial repression and autarky.
There is a lot of work to do. A new policy compass is conspicuously lacking. This
introductory chapter has outlined the broad direction of travel. Major analytical and
operational challenges remain to be solved if policies are to adequately address
financial booms and busts. Some of the possible tools are described in the pages
that follow, but much more needs to be done. And the political economy challenges
are even more daunting. As history reminds us, there is little appetite for taking the
long-term view. Few are ready to curb financial booms that make everyone feel
illusively richer. Or to hold back on quick fixes for output slowdowns, even if such
measures threaten to add fuel to unsustainable financial booms. Or to address
balance sheet problems head-on during a bust when seemingly easier policies are
on offer. The temptation to go for shortcuts is simply too strong, even if these
shortcuts lead nowhere in the end.
The road ahead may be a long one. All the more reason, then, to start the
journey sooner rather than later.

II. Global financial markets under the spell
of monetary policy

The acute sensitivity of financial markets to monetary policy was a hallmark of the
period under review. Asset prices responded to shifts in the policy outlook of major
advanced economies to an even greater extent than in previous years. Expectations
regarding US monetary policy were central: the Federal Reserve’s first steps towards
normalising monetary policy ushered in a bond market sell-off in May–June 2013
that reverberated around the globe. Yet the bout of turbulence did little to
undermine the longer-term trend of investors searching for yield in an environment
of low volatility and low funding costs.
Highly accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies played a
key role in lifting the valuations of risk assets throughout 2013 and the first half of
2014. Low interest rates and subdued volatility encouraged market participants to
take positions in the riskier part of the investment spectrum. Corporate and sovereign
spreads in advanced economies drifted to post-crisis lows, even in countries mired in
recession. Buoyant issuance of lower-rated debt met with strong demand, and equity
markets reached new highs. Some asset valuations showed signs of decoupling
from fundamentals, and volatility in many asset classes approached historical lows.
Emerging market economies (EMEs), however, proved more vulnerable to
shifting global conditions. EME assets shouldered heavier losses than did those in
advanced economies in the wake of the 2013 sell-off, with persistent declines in
bond, equity and currency markets. The broad-based retrenchment came at a time
of adverse domestic conditions for a number of EMEs. Those with stronger
fundamentals fared better but were not completely insulated. Advanced economies
could see glimmers of economic recovery, but the overall growth outlook for EMEs
weakened relative to earlier expectations embodied in asset prices; that outlook
recovered somewhat in the first half of 2014.
The next section describes the main developments in global financial markets
since April 2013. The focus then shifts to EMEs and the extent to which investors
differentiated between them during two distinct episodes of market pressure. The
final section explores how central bank policy affected financial market activity and
asset prices and examines the ways investors navigated the low interest rate
environment in their search for yield.

The year in review: a bumpy ride in the search for yield
The central banks of the major advanced economies were still very much in easing
mode in the early months of 2013 (Graph II.1). Policy rates remained at the effective
lower bound (Graph II.1, left-hand panel), while central bank balance sheets
continued to expand (Graph II.1, centre panel, and Chapter V). In early 2013,
nominal benchmark yields were still near the record lows they had reached in 2012
after several years of monetary policy accommodation (Graph II.1, right-hand panel).
Although long-term bond yields rose in mid-2013, the prospect of continued low
rates in core – ie major sovereign – bond markets contributed to a persistent search
for yield.
The search for yield moved into riskier European sovereign bonds, lower-rated
corporate debt and emerging market paper (Graph II.2). Bond spreads of lower-

rated European sovereigns continued to narrow, easing their funding conditions
and continuing a rally that had followed the announcement of the ECB’s programme
of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) in 2012 (Graph II.2, centre panel). The low
interest rate environment also boosted advanced economy equity markets, which
extended their rally in 2013 as the economic outlook in those economies gradually
improved and investors expected monetary accommodation to continue to support
asset prices (Graph II.2, right-hand panel).
Markets entered a more turbulent phase in early May 2013. After the release
of strong US labour market data, comments by Federal Reserve officials were
interpreted by investors as signals that the central bank would soon slow the pace
of asset purchases and end its quantitative easing policy. After a prolonged period
of exceptional monetary accommodation, the discussion of tapering caught many
market participants by surprise. The expectation of a significant policy shift triggered
a bond market sell-off. The short end of the US yield curve (up to two-year
maturities) remained anchored by current rates and forward guidance. But with new
uncertainty about the nature and timing of policy normalisation, long-term bond
yields rose by 100 basis points by early July, with a corresponding surge in trading
volume and volatility (Graph II.3, left-hand panel).
The sell-off in US Treasury bonds had global repercussions, battering a broad
range of asset classes in both advanced and emerging market economies. Yields
on core European sovereign bonds increased markedly, although neither inflation
nor ECB rate hikes were on the horizon; EME bond yields rose even more than
US yields (Graph II.3, centre panel). Prices of mortgage-backed securities fell,
followed by equities a few weeks later. Spreads on corporate bonds and bank
loans increased as well (Graph II.3, right-hand panel). Rising yields in advanced
economies, in combination with other factors, triggered a first wave of selling
pressure on EME assets. While investors in advanced economy investment funds
shifted from bonds to equity, they pulled out of EME funds of all asset classes
(see below).

Responding to mere perceptions of future changes in monetary policy, markets
thus induced tighter funding conditions well before major central banks actually
slowed their asset purchases or raised rates. To alleviate the market-induced
tightening, central banks on both sides of the Atlantic felt compelled to reassure
markets. The turbulence abated in early July when the Federal Reserve, the ECB and
the Bank of England issued or reiterated their forward guidance regarding the path
of monetary policy (Chapter V).
Markets in advanced economies quickly shrugged off the tapering scare, and
the search for yield resumed (Graph II.2). The bout of volatility did little to
undermine the relative appeal of higher-yielding asset classes, as benchmark yields
remained low by historical standards (Graph II.1, right-hand panel). The combination
of better growth prospects in the United States and the Federal Reserve’s decision
in September 2013 to postpone monetary tightening supported further gains in
bond and equity markets in the final quarter of 2013. Markets even brushed
aside the possibility of a technical default by the US government – which was
resolved in mid-October with the end of the 16-day federal government shutdown.
And when the Federal Reserve announced in December that it would steadily
reduce asset purchases beginning in January 2014, the market reaction was muted.
For 2013 as a whole, all the major stock exchanges gained 14–57% (Graph II.2,
right-hand panel).

In the first half of 2014, investor optimism continued to fuel higher asset
valuations in spite of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties (Graph II.2). In
late January 2014, concerns that weakness in US activity might be more than
weather-related and a second wave of selling pressure on EME assets put a dent in
investor confidence that lasted until mid-February. Market tensions rapidly subsided
when the authorities in the advanced economies reaffirmed their support for
policies designed to spur economic recovery (Chapter V). Financial conditions
eased further as the macroeconomic outlook improved in the advanced economies
(Chapter III). Markets remained resilient to stresses, including the geopolitical
tensions surrounding Ukraine – the Russian stock market and the rouble initially
declined by 15% and 10%, respectively, between January and mid-March, and then
recovered much of their losses. Once more, communication from the Federal
Reserve and the ECB, together with stronger economic data, helped support credit
and equity markets, with the major stock exchanges reaching record highs in May
and June 2014.
Sovereign borrowers in the euro area periphery benefited greatly from these
developments, which were reinforced by the new easing measures unveiled by the
ECB in early June 2014. Their spreads reached a post-crisis minimum relative to the
German 10-year bund, whose yield itself dropped below 1.5% (Graph II.2, centre
panel). Yields on Spanish and Italian 10-year debt thus fell below 3% in May and
early June, respectively. Taking advantage of the benign funding environment,
Greece issued an oversubscribed five-year bond in April, raising €3 billion at a yield
below 5%, in its first offering since losing access to bond markets in 2010. Similarly,
in its first regular debt auction since receiving official support in May 2011, Portugal

sold 10-year bonds at 3.57% in April 2014; and Ireland, which had already issued a
well received five-year bond in mid-2012, exited from official financing towards the
end of 2013.

Emerging market economies suffered sharp reversals
EMEs fared less well than advanced economies in the wake of the 2013 bond
market sell-off, suffering heavier losses for a longer period. The global financial
tightening contributed to two rounds of broad-based retrenchment from EMEs. The
two episodes differed in important respects, starting with the trigger. The first
episode was set off by a global shock – the bond market sell-off after the tapering
comments – and lasted from May to early September 2013; the second arose from
developments in the EMEs themselves, gathered pace in November 2013 and
peaked in January 2014.
The first episode was abrupt and generalised in nature, with sharp asset price
movements ending a period of fairly stable interest and exchange rates. As the selloff spilled over from advanced economies, EMEs experienced a sharp reversal of
portfolio flows, especially in June 2013 (Graph II.4, left-hand panel). EME equities
fell by 16% before stabilising in July, and sovereign bond yields jumped more than
100 basis points, driven by rising concerns over sovereign risk (Graph II.4, centre
and right-hand panels). At first, the indiscriminate retrenchment from EMEs affected
many currencies simultaneously, leading to correlated depreciations amid high
volatility (Graph II.5, left-hand panel). From July onwards, markets increasingly
differentiated between EMEs on the basis of fundamentals. The currencies of Brazil,

India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey depreciated by more than 10% against
the US dollar during the first episode (Graph II.5, centre panel); Brazil, India,
Indonesia and Russia each lost more than $10 billion in reserves. Countries with
rapid credit growth, high inflation or large current account deficits were seen as
more vulnerable and experienced sharper depreciations (Box II.A).
Compared with the first episode, the second round of retrenchment had a more
sustained and discerning character. In the period of relative calm in September and
October, EMEs recovered less than advanced economies did, and investors’ concerns
about EMEs built up in the final months of 2013. In this prelude to the second
episode, market pricing increasingly reflected a deteriorating macroeconomic
outlook in many EMEs and the gradual unwinding of financial imbalances in
some (Chapters III and IV). Government bond yields and credit spreads remained
elevated, and markets witnessed continuing losses amid persistent fund outflows
(Graph II.4). When market tensions escalated in January 2014, further losses on
equities and bonds were more contained than in the first episode; the focus had
turned to EMEs with poor growth prospects or political tensions. The pressure on
EME currencies reached a climax on 23 January 2014, when Argentina’s central
bank let the peso devalue by more than 10% against the US dollar. Although the
depreciations were comparable in magnitude to those in the first episode, they
reflected country-specific factors to a greater extent in the second episode
(Box II.A).
Central banks in several EMEs stepped up their defence against renewed
currency pressure by raising interest rates and intervening in foreign exchange
markets. Led by Turkey, the policy response was more forceful in the second
episode than in the first (Graph II.5, right-hand panel, and Chapter V). These actions

Determinants of recent currency depreciations in EMEs

In the period under review, emerging market economies (EMEs) experienced two rounds of currency depreciation. In
both episodes, investors differentiated between EMEs, but in the second round they did so to a greater extent and
focused on a somewhat different set of factors. To explore investor discernment across the two episodes, this box
considers various determinants of exchange rate movements against the US dollar in a sample of 54 EMEs.
In the first episode (early May to early September 2013), investors initially shed EME exposures indiscriminately
in response to Federal Reserve signalling regarding future policy normalisation. However, as the first episode
progressed, investors focused more on country-specific factors, which altered the pattern of depreciations across
EMEs. Investors began to discriminate more against countries with large financial imbalances, including rapid credit
growth and large current account deficits, which tend to rely on foreign capital inflows. A simple scatter plot
illustrates the effect in the case of real growth in domestic credit to the private non-financial sector, showing that
rapid growth accompanied greater depreciation (Graph II.A, left-hand panel). In the second round of depreciations
(early January to early February 2014), investors also differentiated between economies, but expected GDP growth
emerged as a strong factor. As shown again with a scatter plot, countries with better growth prospects for 2014
experienced less pressure on their exchange rates than other EMEs in that episode (Graph II.A, right-hand panel).

Multiple regression analysis supports these observations (Table II.A). Larger current account deficits, strong real
credit growth and high inflation stand out as the main drivers of currency depreciations in the first episode (as
indicated by the significant positive coefficients reported in the table). Depreciations also tend to be larger where
the ratio of government debt to GDP is higher and for countries with a large “market size” (a variable incorporating
GDP and portfolio inflows since 2010). These results still hold when increases to EME policy rates are taken into
account. The analysis of the second episode indicates a stronger role for expected GDP growth relative to episode 1.
As for factors that worsen depreciations in episode 2, inflation and market size remain important, and sovereign risk
– as captured by credit default swap (CDS) spreads – becomes more important. The determinants in episode 2
appear to be even more significant when the beginning of the period is extended back from 1 January 2014 to
include the build-up phase, starting on 31 October 2013 (episode 2’).

Overall, the regression explains a larger share of the second episode’s variation in depreciation rates across
countries (more than 80% of the variation as measured by R2), suggesting that country-specific factors were more
prominent in that episode.

helped to stabilise EME exchange rates and boosted the value of some currencies,
providing breathing space to local firms that had tapped international markets by
issuing foreign currency bonds (Chapter IV). Starting in February, EME currencies
and equities recouped much of their January losses, while bond spreads narrowed
again (Graphs II.4 and II.5). With the reversion to a low-volatility environment,
selected EME assets and currency carry trades regained popularity among investors
searching for yield.

Central banks left their mark on financial markets
The sensitivity of asset prices to monetary policy stands out as a key theme of the
past year. Driven by low policy rates and quantitative easing, long-term yields in
major bond markets had fallen to record lows by 2012. Since then, markets have
become highly responsive to any signs of an eventual reversal of these exceptional
conditions. Concerns about the course of US monetary policy played a central role –
as demonstrated by the mid-2013 bond market turbulence and other key events
during the period under review. But monetary policy also had an impact on asset
prices and on the behaviour of investors more broadly.

30

BIS 84th Annual Report

The events of the year illustrated that – by influencing market participants’
perceptions and attitudes towards risk – monetary policy can have a powerful effect
on financial conditions, as reflected in risk premia and funding terms. Put another
way, the effects of the risk-taking channel of monetary policy were highly visible
throughout the period.1

Financial markets fixated on monetary policy
The extraordinary influence of central banks on global financial markets manifested
itself most directly in core fixed income markets, where the shape of the yield curve
was particularly sensitive to any news or change in expectations regarding policy.
While the short end largely remained anchored by low policy rates, medium-term
yields responded to forward guidance, and the longer end was governed by asset
purchases, long-term expectations and perceived central bank credibility (Chapter V).
When the Federal Reserve – as the first of the major central banks to act – hinted at
a slowdown in asset purchases in mid-2013, long-term bonds incurred heavy losses.
Although bond prices fell less sharply than in the sell-offs of 1994 and 2003, overall
losses in market value were greater this time, because the stock of Treasury
securities was much larger (Box II.B).
Unconventional monetary policy and forward guidance assumed a critical role
in central bank communication (Box V.A). When the Federal Reserve signalled its
intent to keep the federal funds rate low even after ending asset purchases, investors
revised downwards their medium-term expectations of short-term rates, and the
dispersion of opinions narrowed (Graph II.6, left-hand panel). At the same time,
market participants were more in agreement that long-term rates would eventually
rise in the medium run (Graph II.6, centre panel).
The Federal Reserve’s actions also left their mark on the long end of the yield
curve. A yield decomposition suggests that changes in expected inflation or real
rates had little impact on the long end (Graph II.6, right-hand panel). Instead, the
mid-2013 surge in the 10-year yield largely matched the increase in the term
premium, ie the compensation for the risk of holding long-duration bonds
exposed to future fluctuations in real rates and inflation. Driven by unconventional
policies and periods of flight to safety, the estimated term premium on 10-year
US Treasuries became negative in mid-2011 and declined to unprecedented lows
by July 2012. The partial normalisation of this premium in 2013 was consistent
with the prospect of a reduction in asset purchases by the Federal Reserve, a major
source of demand in the Treasury market. That said, in early 2014 the estimated
term premium was around zero and thus more than 100 basis points below its
1995–2010 average.
Throughout 2013 and 2014, news about the prospect of an eventual exit from
easing triggered sharp price reactions across a range of asset classes (Graph II.7). The
response to the Federal Reserve’s tapering-related announcement on 19 June 2013
was particularly intense: long-term US yields spiked more than 20 basis points on
the announcement, while spreads on high-yield bonds and dollar-denominated

The 2013 sell-off in US Treasuries from a historical perspective

Box II.B

How significant was the sell-off in the market for US Treasury securities in May–June 2013? It depends on how one
measures losses. Valuation losses on individual securities were slightly less than those incurred during the sell-offs in
1994 and 2003, whereas the scale of aggregate losses on the stock of outstanding securities was greater in 2013,
both in absolute terms and relative to GDP.
In comparing the mark-to-market losses in mid-2013 with those of 1994 and 2003, we first adopt a securitylevel perspective and quantify the percentage losses for marketable Treasuries at each maturity (the results for a
selection of three Treasury maturities are shown in Graph II.B, left-hand panel, along with losses on certain private
sector debt securities). Then we estimate the aggregate mark-to-market losses on the total stock of outstanding
marketable Treasury securities, taking into account their specific maturity and cash flow profiles (Graph II.B, righthand panel).
The sell-off in 1994 was different from the 2003 and 2013 episodes in that, in 1994, not only did long-term
rates surge, but short-term rates also picked up significantly. In early February 1994, after a long period of monetary
accommodation, a modest but unexpected increase in the Federal Reserve’s policy rate produced strong upward
revisions in expected future inflation and short-term rates. Over the course of the following three months, the policy
rate increased by 75 basis points, and 10-year yields rose more than 140 basis points. By contrast, in both 2003 and
2013, the bond market stress was confined mostly to longer maturities, although the drivers of the 2003 event were
different from those in 2013. The 2003 surge in long-term yields was driven largely by a pickup in expected future
real rates and inflation; in 2013, the rise was due almost entirely to a lift-off of term premia from unprecedented lows
(see Graph II.6, right-hand panel, and discussion in the main text).
As illustrated in the left-hand panel of Graph II.B, mark-to-market losses of individual securities during the 2013
turmoil were not quite as great as those seen in 1994 and 2003. But the 2013 sell-off stands out because of
the massive expansion in the stock of debt in the wake of the financial crisis (Graph II.B, centre panel). Between
early 2007 and 2014, the stock of outstanding marketable US Treasury securities almost tripled, from $4.4 trillion to
$12.1 trillion, with an increasing share of the securities held in the Federal Reserve System Open Market Account
(SOMA).
Publicly available data on outstanding amounts, remaining maturities and coupon payments of marketable
Treasury securities permit the calculation of the cash flow profile and duration of both the Federal Reserve
holdings and those of the public for the 2003 and 2013 episodes. The duration of all outstanding securities – and
thus their sensitivity to sudden changes in interest rates – has increased from around 3.8 years to 4.8 years since 2007
as a result of debt management policies and the drop in yields to record lows (with corresponding valuation gains).
The duration of the Federal Reserve’s holdings has increased even more under its maturity extension programme
(MEP), introduced in late 2011, which in turn has helped keep the duration of debt held by the public largely
constant.
Because of the great rise in the stock of Treasury securities since the financial crisis, the 2013 bond market selloff generated a larger aggregate loss in both dollar and GDP terms than did the 1994 and 2003 episodes. Between
May and end-July 2013, all holders of marketable US Treasury debt incurred aggregate cumulative mark-to-market
losses of about $425 billion, or about 2.5% of GDP (Graph II.B, right-hand panel). Aggregate losses during the 2003
sell-off amounted to an estimated $155 billion, or 1.3% of GDP; and in 1994 about $150 billion, or about 2% of GDP.
However, in 2013, public holders incurred only about two thirds of the aggregate losses – some $280 billion, or
roughly 1.7% of GDP – and that GDP share of losses was probably no greater than the share in 1994. Hence,
because of the high amount of duration risk which the Federal Reserve had taken onto its own balance sheet, the
valuation losses for public holders of US Treasury securities in 2013 were relatively contained despite the much
larger amount of outstanding marketable Treasury securities.

  Treasury securities held within various US government accounts, including trust funds, are not marketable. In this box, we use the term
“public holders” of marketable Treasury securities to mean any domestic or foreign investor except the Federal Reserve. SOMA holdings are
reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the last Wednesday of each month; outstanding marketable Treasury securities from
Treasury Direct’s monthly statements of public debt are for the last day of each month. We abstract from the differences in outstanding
amounts and duration that may result from this time difference. The information on outstanding Treasuries is available in electronic form
only from April 1997 onwards.      To estimate mark-to-market losses in 2013 and compare them with losses incurred in the two earlier
episodes, we rely on security-level data on all marketable US Treasury securities outstanding as well as their maturity and cash flow profiles
and then quantify the monthly fluctuations in the aggregate market value of outstanding securities that were due to changes in the shape
of the US yield curve. For discount rates, we use linearly interpolated constant maturity yields from the Federal Reserve Board’s H.15 tables.
Estimates of the month-to-month losses in market value were obtained by comparing the present value of cash flows at the end of a given

32

BIS 84th Annual Report

month with the present value of cash flows for the same portfolio of securities at the end of the following month. When the level of the
yield curve increases or the slope steepens over the course of the month, the value of outstanding Treasuries declines because future cash
flows are discounted more heavily. To calculate the difference in the present value, we abstract from all cash flows occurring between the
end of a given month and the end of the following month. The analysis of estimated aggregate mark-to-market gains and losses prior to
April 1997 is based on less granular information, assuming a maturity structure of outstanding Treasury securities in line with that of
common US government bond market indices.      Federal Reserve holdings in 1994 are not likely to have exceeded $350 billion and
presumably had a duration no longer than that of the entire stock of outstanding Treasury securities. The conclusion for 1994 can be
inferred from data provided by J Hamilton and C Wu, “The effectiveness of alternative monetary policy tools in a zero lower bound
environment”, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol 44, February 2012, pp 3–46.

The three sell-off periods are 7 February–11 May 1994, 12 June–3 September 2003 and 2 May–5 July 2013. The panel shows mark-tomarket losses, in percentage terms, incurred over the three periods. 2 The panel depicts estimated aggregate mark-to-market gains and
losses on the stock of outstanding marketable US Treasury securities over a three-month horizon due to movements in the shape of the US
yield curve; the changes are measured in billions of US dollars and then expressed as a percentage of GDP. The underlying security-level
data cover all marketable US Treasury securities outstanding, including information on their maturity and cash flow profiles. Gains and
losses in market value over a given month are estimated by comparing the present value of the stream of cash flows at the end of a given
month with the present value of future cash flows of the same portfolio of securities at the end of the following month. For periods before
April 1997, the mark-to-market gains and losses were computed on the basis of data on total marketable Treasury debt outstanding and
duration and return information from the BofA Merrill Lynch US Treasury Master Index, which tracks the performance of US dollardenominated sovereign debt publicly issued by the US government. 3 Total return on the BofA Merrill Lynch Current US Treasury Index
for two-year, five-year and 10-year maturities. 4 Total return on the BofA Merrill Lynch United States Corporate Index, which tracks
investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. 5 MBS = mortgage-backed securities. JPMorgan MBS Index.

EME paper jumped 16 and 24 basis points, respectively (Graph II.7, left-hand panel).
The S&P 500 equity index lost about 4%, while implied volatility in equity markets
rose by 4 percentage points. However, subsequent Federal Reserve communications,
on 17 July and 18 September 2013, reassured markets that eventual tightening lay
further in the future than participants had anticipated. On that more accommodative
news, two-year yields dropped, while high-yield and EME bond spreads narrowed
(Graph II.7, right-hand panel). By the time the actual tapering was announced in
December 2013, markets were more prepared. Although long-term yields picked
up around 10 basis points, credit spreads declined, and US equity prices actually
rose, by 1.6% (Graph II.7, left-hand panel).

Low funding costs and volatility encouraged the search for yield
Through its impact on risk-taking behaviour, monetary accommodation had an
impact on asset prices and quantities that went beyond its effects on major
sovereign bond markets. Credit spreads tightened even in economies mired in
recession and for borrowers with non-negligible default risk. Global investors
absorbed exceptionally large volumes of newly issued corporate debt, especially
that of lower-rated borrowers. And, as the search for yield expanded to equity
markets, the link between fundamentals and prices weakened amid historically
subdued volatility and low risk premia.
In an environment of elevated risk appetite, buoyant issuance of lower-rated
debt met with strong investor demand. A considerable volume of debt has been
issued over the past few years, in both the investment grade and high-yield
segments (Graph II.8, left-hand panel). Firms have increasingly tapped capital
markets to cover their financing needs at a time when many banks were restricting
credit (Chapter VI). Gross issuance in the high-yield bond market alone soared to
$90 billion per quarter in 2013 from a pre-crisis quarterly average of $30 billion.
Investors absorbed the newly issued corporate debt at progressively narrower
spreads (Graph II.2, left-hand panel). The response of institutional investors to
accommodative conditions at the global level – taking greater risk, eg to meet
return targets or pension obligations – was consistent with the risk-taking channel
of monetary policy.2

More specifically, intermediaries with fixed liabilities (eg insurance companies and pension funds),
or asset managers promising clients a fixed return, may respond to the low-rate environment by
taking on more duration or credit risk (within the constraints of the regulatory framework or

Increased risk-taking also manifested itself in other credit market segments. In
the syndicated loan market, for instance, credit granted to lower-rated leveraged
borrowers (leveraged loans) exceeded 40% of new signings for much of 2013
(Graph II.8, right-hand panel). This share was higher than during the pre-crisis
period from 2005 to mid-2007. Fewer and fewer of the new loans featured creditor
protection in the form of covenants. Investors’ attraction to riskier credit also
spawned greater issuance in assets such as payment-in-kind notes and mortgage
real estate investment trusts (mREITs).
The ongoing search for yield may also have affected the relationship between
credit spreads and fundamentals. Low GDP growth typically goes hand in hand with
high default rates and wider credit spreads, and such was the case in the years
before 2011 (Graph II.9). After the crisis-related surge in 2009–10, default rates
declined and stayed low for three years, justifying tighter spreads, which have
continued to track falling default rates in the United States. Beginning in 2011,
however, default rates in the euro area edged up when the region entered a twoyear recession, but spreads there have still continued to decline. Low corporate
bond yields not only reflect expectations of a low likelihood of default and low
investment mandate). Compensation practices in the asset management industry linking pay to
absolute measures of performance may also play an important role in driving a search for yield
among fund managers. For a discussion of several institutional factors and incentives contributing
to the search for yield phenomenon, see eg R Greenwood and S Hanson, “Issuer quality and
corporate bond returns”, The Review of Financial Studies, vol 26, no 6, June 2013, pp 1483–525.

levels of risk premia, but also contribute to the suppression of actual default rates,
in that the availability of cheap credit makes it easier for troubled borrowers to
refinance. The sustainability of this process will ultimately be put to the test when
interest rates normalise.
Fuelled by the low-yield environment and supported by an improving
economic outlook, equity prices on the major exchanges enjoyed a spectacular
climb throughout 2013 (Graph II.2, right-hand panel). In many equity markets, the
expected payoff from dividends alone exceeded the real yields on longer-dated
high-quality bonds, encouraging market participants to extend their search for yield
beyond fixed income markets. Stocks paying high and stable dividends were seen
as particularly attractive and posted large gains.
As major equity indices in the advanced economies reached record highs, prices
rose by more than the expected growth in underlying fundamentals. Conventional
valuation metrics such as the price/earnings ratio and Tobin’s Q moved above their
longer-term averages (Graph II.10, top panels). The S&P 500 Index, for instance,
gained almost 20% in the 12 months to May 2014, whereas expected future earnings
grew less than 8% over the same period. The cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio
of the S&P 500 stood at 25 in May 2014, six units higher than its average over the
previous 50 years. Prices of European equities also rose over the past year, by more
than 15%, despite low growth in the aftermath of the euro area debt crisis and a
drop of 3% in expected earnings. Between June 2007 and September 2011, the
crisis-related plunge in equity prices and the subsequent rebound were associated
with shifts in investor expectations about growth in future corporate earnings
(Graph II.10, bottom left-hand panel, data in blue). Since then, earnings expectations
have been less influential in driving stock prices (as illustrated by the flatter slope of
the red line relative to the blue line in Graph II.10, bottom left-hand panel).
The recent rise in equity returns was accompanied by a growing appetite for
risk and historically subdued levels of volatility (Graph II.10, bottom right-hand
panel, and Graph II.11, left-hand panel). By early June 2014, the option-implied
volatility index (VIX) dipped under 11% – below its 2004 to mid-2007 average of

13.6% and some 10 percentage points lower than in mid-2012. The volatility of
actual stock market returns fell to levels last seen in 2004–07 and during the equity
boom in the late 1990s (Graph II.11, left-hand panel).
The strength of investors’ risk appetite is apparent from a comparison of two
risk measures, implied volatility and actual (“empirical”) volatility.3 Implied volatility,
a forward-looking measure derived from option prices, declined more than investors
would have expected when projecting actual volatility from past returns. A gauge
of risk premia, computed as the difference between implied and empirical volatility,
has recently fluctuated near post-crisis lows. This offers yet another sign of investors’
elevated appetite for risk, as it suggests that investors were relatively less inclined
to insure themselves against large price fluctuations via derivatives (Graph II.10,
bottom right-hand panel).
In fact, low levels of implied and actual volatility prevailed well beyond equity
markets (Graph II.11). While the ongoing recovery went hand in hand with lower
variability in macroeconomic and firm-specific fundamentals, central banks also
played an important role in keeping volatility low. Asset purchases and forward
guidance removed some of the uncertainty about future movements in bond yields
and thereby contained the amplitude of swings in bond prices. US bond market
volatility accordingly continued to fall, reaching its lowest level since 2007, after
spiking during the sell-off in mid-2013 (Graph II.11, right-hand panel). At the same
time, implied volatility in currency markets declined to levels last seen in 2006–07,
while the volatility in credit markets (computed from options on major CDS indices
referencing European and US corporations) fell to post-crisis lows.

The developments in the year under review thus indicate that monetary policy
had a powerful impact on the entire investment spectrum through its effect on
perceived value and risk. Accommodative monetary conditions and low benchmark
yields – reinforced by subdued volatility – motivated investors to take on more risk
and leverage in their search for yield.

III. Growth and inflation: drivers and prospects

Over the past year, global growth has firmed. Advanced economies provided most
of the uplift, supported by highly accommodative financing conditions. Thanks in
part to stronger exports to advanced economies, output growth in emerging market
economies (EMEs) stabilised in the second half of 2013.
Yet global growth still remains below pre-crisis averages. This is not surprising.
A number of advanced economies are still recovering from a balance sheet
recession. Households, banks and, to a lesser extent, non-financial firms have
been repairing their balance sheets and reducing excessive debt. Private sector
deleveraging is most advanced in the United States, while it is far from over in other
countries, including a large part of the euro area. Resources also need to move to
new and more productive uses. Meanwhile, many EMEs are in the late stage of
financial booms, suggesting a drag on growth going forward.
Restoring sustainable global growth poses significant challenges. In crisis-hit
countries, it is unrealistic to expect the level of output to return to its pre-crisis trend.
This would require the growth rate to exceed the pre-crisis average for several years.
Historical evidence shows that this rarely happens following a balance sheet
recession. Moreover, even the prospects for restoring trend growth are not bright.
Productivity growth in advanced economies has been on a declining trend since well
before the onset of the financial crisis, and the workforce is already shrinking in
several countries as the population ages. Public debt is also at a record high and
may act as an additional drag on growth. In many EMEs, the recent tightening of
financial conditions and late-stage financial cycle risks are also clouding growth
prospects.
Investment is still below pre-crisis levels in many advanced economies, but this
is unlikely to be a major drag on trend growth. Most of the shortfall is accounted
for by the construction sector in countries that experienced large property booms
and thus represents a necessary correction of previous overinvestment. That said,
spending on equipment is also below the pre-crisis average owing to the weak
demand and slow recovery typical of balance sheet recessions rather than the lack
of finance. At the global level, a trend rise in investment in EMEs has offset a long
downward trend in advanced economies.
Inflation has remained low, or declined further, in many economies. A low
utilisation of domestic resources is, however, unlikely to be the key driver. With
greater integration of trade, finance and production, inflation has become
increasingly influenced by conditions prevailing in globally integrated markets.
Global factors have helped to reduce the inflation rate as well as its sensitivity to
domestic conditions for a long time. Such forces may still be at play.
The rest of this chapter describes the main macroeconomic developments over
the past year, taking stock of the progress that crisis-hit countries have made in
recovering from the 2008–09 recession. It then reviews recent developments in
inflation, stressing the increasing role of global forces. Finally, the chapter discusses
the possible reasons for the weakness of investment and productivity growth.

Growth: recent developments and medium-term trends
A stronger but still uneven global recovery
Over the past year, global economic growth gathered strength. World GDP
growth increased from a 2% year-on-year rate in the first quarter of 2013 to 3%
in the first quarter of 2014 (Graph III.1, left-hand panel). This compares with
average growth of 3.9% in the period 1996–2006 (Annex Table III.1). Advanced
economies accounted for most of last year’s increase, while growth in EMEs
remained stable at a relatively low level (though still higher than that of the
advanced economies). This relative shift in growth momentum is even more
visible in survey indicators. The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI)
for advanced economies rose steadily during 2013, while that for EMEs has firmed
to levels that indicate steady growth (Graph III.1, centre panel). Reflecting improved
demand in advanced economies, world trade growth picked up gradually over
the past year, although it was still slower than pre-crisis (Graph III.1, right-hand
panel).
Growth picked up rapidly in the United States and the United Kingdom. Falling
unemployment, some stabilisation in housing markets and progress in private

investment,

also France, growth strengthened throughout 2013, with Italy and Spain recording
positive growth rates later in the year. This return to growth benefited, in some
countries, from some easing in the pace of fiscal consolidation, and was
accompanied by a remarkable turnaround in financial conditions (Chapter II). Yet
borrowing rates for firms and consumers remained persistently higher in Spain, Italy
and other vulnerable countries than elsewhere in the euro area.
Japan struggled to revive growth. GDP increased significantly in the first half of
2013, following the announcement of an ambitious economic programme. This
included open-ended Bank of Japan asset purchases (until inflation reaches 2%),
short-run fiscal stimulus alongside the phasing-in of tax hikes, and the commitment
to implement growth-enhancing structural reforms. However, growth slowed
markedly in the second half of 2013. The current account also deteriorated amid a
marked depreciation of the yen. Growth bounced back strongly in early 2014 in
anticipation of the first consumption tax hike in April, but the rise was expected to
be partly reversed.
In many EMEs, the upswing of financial cycles continued to boost aggregate
demand.1 Although well below previous years, credit growth was still positive and
continued to push up household and corporate non-financial debt (Graph III.2). At
the same time, growth in EMEs faced two major headwinds: a continued slowdown
of growth in China and a tightening of global financial conditions after May 2013
(Chapter II).
China’s growth has decreased by over 3 percentage points since it peaked in
2010, to about 7½% year on year in early 2014. Over the past year, in particular,
Chinese authorities became increasingly worried about strong credit growth and
introduced a number of restrictive financial measures, including tighter oversight

The financial cycle is different from the business cycle. It is best measured by a combination of
credit aggregates and property prices and lasts much longer, roughly 15 to 20 years. See Chapter IV

of lending in the shadow banking system. The slowdown dampened growth in
commodity exporters, including Russia and some Latin American countries,
exporters of intermediate inputs and capital goods located mainly in Asia, and
suppliers of high-tech goods such as Korea, Japan and Germany. However, the
recovery of exports to advanced economies since mid-2013 helped stabilise growth
somewhat in EMEs.
The tightening of global financial conditions since May–June 2013 initially
led to larger currency depreciations and capital outflows in countries that had
wider current account deficits, faster private credit growth and larger public debt.
Following the market sell-off of January 2014, the countries that were hit harder
were those with relatively high inflation and deteriorating growth prospects
(Chapter II). The initial sell-off prompted countries such as India, Indonesia and
Turkey to adopt restrictive measures, such as raising policy rates and tightening
capital controls, as well as macroprudential and fiscal policy measures. In contrast,
countries with positive external balances and low inflation rates, including
most of emerging Asia and central and eastern Europe, were able to maintain
accommodative monetary and fiscal policies or, in some cases, ease policy further
to offset worsening growth prospects (Chapter V).

The long shadow of the financial crisis
The global economy is still coping with the legacy of the financial crisis. Despite the
recent strengthening, the recovery remains weak by historical standards. In several
advanced economies, output and productivity remain below their pre-crisis peak
(Graph III.3), as does employment (Annex Table III.2). This is no surprise: financial
crises generally cause deeper and longer recessions and are followed by much
slower recoveries (Box III.A).

Recovery from a balance sheet recession

Box III.A

Severe financial or banking crises are typically accompanied by deeper and longer recessions and followed by much
slower recoveries compared with standard business cycle recessions. Such crises tend to occur after prolonged
financial booms and close to the peak of financial cycles (Chapter IV). The fundamental causes of these recessions
are large intertemporal and sectoral imbalances, the correction of which requires large and drawn-out changes in
patterns of spending. To distinguish them from ordinary business cycle recessions, they are referred to as balance
sheet recessions. This box discusses the factors that make recoveries from such recessions sluggish.
During financial booms, intertemporal and sectoral imbalances build up. Households, firms and often
governments accumulate debt based on optimistic expectations about their future income, asset prices and the
ease with which they are able to access credit. Banks overestimate the solidity of their assets, the solvency of their
borrowers and their own ability to refinance themselves by rolling over short-term debt. Meanwhile, the composition
of output – and hence the allocation of capital and labour across different sectors – may not match the composition
of sustainable demand. One clear example is the expansion of the construction sector in several countries, with its
legacy of large inventories of unsold properties. The public sector too may grow too large, and its debt may become
unsustainable.
Misplaced confidence and optimistic expectations sooner or later prove unfounded, triggering a collapse of
asset prices and a sharp output contraction. Some agents will no longer be able to service their debt and default,
imposing losses on their lenders – typically financial institutions. Others will begin reducing the stock of debt by
increasing net saving and selling assets to ensure they remain solvent and have sufficient funds to meet future
commitments and needs. Lenders will face soaring non-performing loans and assets. Thus, the crisis heralds a period
of balance sheet adjustment in which agents prioritise balance sheet repair over spending. As one agent’s spending
is another’s income, balance sheet repair by some agents depresses the income and value of asset holdings of others.
This inevitably keeps aggregate expenditure and income growth below pre-crisis norms until debt ratios have
returned to more sustainable levels and capital stock overhangs have been reabsorbed. Meanwhile, a significant
fraction of capital and labour becomes idle and needs to find new uses. This generally entails the financing of new
capital and creation of new firms as well as the need for unemployed workers to retrain, relocate and search for new
jobs. All of this requires time and effort.
The duration and intensity of the slump following a balance sheet recession depend on several factors. The first
is the extent of the initial imbalances. The larger the excess during the boom, the larger is the needed correction
afterwards. Financial busts tend to be associated with deeper recessions, and the speed of the recovery tends to be
inversely related to the size of the preceding boom in credit and real estate. Households and firms that accumulated
more debt tend to cut their spending by more than those which had less debt. The second is the extent of credit
supply disruptions. After the most acute phase of the crisis, lenders usually need time to recognise losses and rebuild
their capital ratios. Funding may be difficult because balance sheets are opaque and slow growth raises nonperforming loans. What matters, however, is not so much the overall amount of credit that banks supply but its
efficient allocation. After all, the debt overhang needs to be reabsorbed and credit demand is likely to be weak in
aggregate. Indeed, empirical studies find that output growth and credit growth are at best only weakly correlated in
the recovery – that is, so-called “credit-less” recoveries are the norm rather than the exception. Instead, key to a
speedier recovery is that banks regain their ability to allocate credit to the most productive uses. There is also
evidence that private sector deleveraging during a downturn helps induce a stronger recovery. The third factor
driving the severity of the slump is the extent of structural rigidities and inefficiencies. In the presence of large
sectoral imbalances, the recovery of output growth and employment tends to be stronger, other things equal, in
countries that have more flexible labour markets. Finally, the policies followed by governments in managing the
crisis and during the recovery phase can speed up or hinder a recovery (see Chapters I and V for a full discussion).
The empirical evidence confirms that recoveries from a financial crisis are drawn-out affairs. On average, it
takes about four and a half years for (per capita) output to rise above its pre-crisis peak, or about 10 years if the
Great Depression is taken into account. The recovery of employment is even slower (Reinhardt and Rogoff (2009)).
By comparison, in a standard business cycle recession, output takes about a year and a half to return to the prerecession peak. The evidence also points to wide dispersion around the mean, which supports the view that various
factors, including those mentioned above, play a role in speeding up or slowing the recovery. The GDP losses in
balance sheet recessions also tend to be larger (Box III.B).
  The term “balance sheet recession” was probably first introduced by R Koo, Balance Sheet Recession, John Wiley & Sons, 2003, to explain
Japan’s stagnant growth after the bursting of its equity and real estate bubble in the early 1990s. This box uses the same term to indicate

the contraction of output associated with a financial crisis that follows a financial boom. It also embeds the term in a somewhat different
analysis, which does not imply the same policy conclusions: see C Borio, “The financial cycle and macroeconomics: what have we learnt?”,

The crisis impact differed considerably across countries. Most directly hit were
the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain and Ireland, and also several
countries in central and eastern Europe. Following a boom in credit and property
prices, this group of countries experienced a housing market bust and a banking
crisis, leading to a full-fledged balance sheet recession. Another set of countries
was affected more indirectly, especially through financial exposures to the first
group. In particular, in Austria, France, Germany and Switzerland banks faced
strains due to their cross-border exposures. A third group of countries, including
most EMEs, commodity exporters such as Australia and Canada and Nordic
countries, was indirectly hit through trade channels but subsequently buoyed
by a strong increase in commodity prices. Japan and Italy did not suffer from
a domestic bust or excessive cross-border exposures, but had to deal with the
longer-term drag on growth resulting from high public debt, an ageing population
and long-standing structural inefficiencies.
While expansionary macro policies were instrumental in stabilising the global
economy, the recovery path of individual countries also depended on their ability
to tackle the root causes of the balance sheet recession. Among the countries that
suffered a full balance sheet recession, the United States has recovered relatively
fast. Since 2008, output has risen by over 10% and is now about 6% above its precrisis peak. To an important extent, this reflects the flexibility of the US economy,
progress in household deleveraging, and determined and credible measures to
strengthen bank balance sheets (Chapter VI). In the United Kingdom, which suffered
an initial drop of 7½%, output has increased by 6¾%, and after six years is still
about ½% below its pre-crisis peak. That said, unemployment has fallen rapidly,
thanks to a relatively high degree of labour market flexibility.
In the euro area, the sovereign debt crisis of 2010–12 aggravated the balance
sheet problems that had remained from the earlier financial crisis. Countries that
entered the euro area crisis with highly indebted households and weak banking
sectors witnessed a further fall in property prices and real credit. Banking and public
sector weakness reinforced each other through rising funding costs and declining
asset quality. The fall in credit and property prices was particularly large in Ireland
and Spain, but seems to have bottomed out recently. Italy, which had a less
pronounced boom, has more recently experienced some decline in both credit
aggregates and real estate prices (Chapter IV). Trade links within the euro area have
also contributed to the sluggish recovery in several countries. One major exception
was Germany, which suffered from the collapse of world trade in 2009 but also

46

BIS 84th Annual Report

benefited from its quick rebound as well as from safe haven inflows from troubled
euro area countries.
The financial crisis continues to cast long shadows. As Graph III.3 (left-hand
panel, dots) illustrates, the current level of output in advanced economies falls short
of where it would have been had the pre-crisis trend continued. For instance,
output is about 12½% below the path implied by a continuation of the pre-crisis
trend in the United States and 18½% in the United Kingdom. The shortfall is even
bigger for Spain at 29%.
There are two complementary explanations for this shortfall. First, the pre-crisis
trend is likely to have overestimated the sustainable level of output and growth
during the financial boom. Second, the financial crisis may have permanently
reduced the potential level of output. In either case, it would be a mistake to
extrapolate pre-crisis average growth rates to estimate the amount of slack in the
economy. To be sure, the output shortfalls shown in Graph III.3 are based on a
simple linear trend, which is probably too crude a measure of pre-crisis potential
growth. Yet even more sophisticated statistical measures find that, historically,
permanent output losses following crises are typically large: measured as the
difference between the pre-crisis trend and the new trend, the average shortfall is
in the region of 7½–10% (see Box III.B for more details).
Another long shadow is cast by high public debt. Although governments in
advanced economies have made significant headway in reducing their fiscal deficits
post-crisis, debt levels are at record highs and still rising (Graph III.4, left-hand
panel). On average, fiscal deficits have narrowed since reaching 9% of GDP in 2009,
and are expected to continue to shrink. Yet, at over or close to 6%, deficits are still
large in Spain, the United States and the United Kingdom, where the public finances
have deteriorated dramatically post-crisis (Graph III.4, centre panel). Debt has risen

to over 100% of GDP in most major economies (Graph III.4, right-hand panel) (see
Annex Table III.3 for further details).

Measuring output losses after a balance sheet recession

Box III.B

Not only are balance sheet recessions followed by slower recoveries than standard business cycle recessions
(Box III.A), but they also involve significant output losses. Such losses have in many cases been found to be
permanent – that is, output rarely returns to its pre-crisis path.
Graph III.B provides an illustration. It shows two examples of how GDP may evolve after a recession associated
with a financial crisis, or balance sheet recession. In both examples, point A indicates the peak reached just before
the start of the crisis; point B marks the trough; and point C shows the point at which the path of GDP regains its
pre-crisis trend growth rate. The difference between the two is that, in example 1, output gradually returns to the
path or trend that it followed before the crisis (at point D). This means that output grows at higher rates than the
pre-crisis average for several years (between points C and D). In example 2, output recovers, but not sufficiently to
return to the pre-crisis trend path. Instead, GDP settles on a new trend (the dashed red line) in which the growth
rate of output is the same as before the crisis, but the level is permanently lower than the pre-crisis trend (the
continuous red line). The distance between the two trends (indicated by δ) is a measure of the permanent output
Restricted
loss. In this case, if one were to estimate potential output by extrapolating pre-crisis trends, then the
output gap
would be overestimated by the amount δ.

Measuring the costs of crises: a schematic overview
Example 1

Graph III.B

Example 2

Point A: pre-crisis peak; point B: post-crisis trough; point C: GDP growth equals trend GDP growth for the first time after the crisis; point D:
the level of GDP returns to the pre-crisis level.

Studies find that initial losses of output in a balance sheet recession – either from peak to trough (A to B) or
from the peak to the point at which the growth rate returns to pre-crisis values (A to C) – are substantial, ranging
from 6% to 14% on average across countries. By contrast, in standard business cycle recessions in advanced
economies, output typically falls by around 2%. Most importantly, several studies find that these initial losses are
only partially eliminated during the recovery from a balance sheet recession. That is, most are permanent, consistent
with the scenario drawn in example 2. Unlike in Graph III.B, these studies do not rely on simple trend regressions,
but usually follow Cerra and Saxena (2008) in using panel regressions of GDP (or GDP growth) to trace the average
impact on output of a banking crisis. The estimated permanent losses are found to be large, between 7½% and
10%. These results appear robust to differences in samples, dating of crisis and methods of calculation, and in
particular to the possibility of reverse causation – the possibility that slowing output growth could have generated
the crisis.
Unlike permanent losses in the level of output, there is scant evidence that a financial crisis directly causes a
permanent reduction in the trend growth rate. There is, however, some evidence of indirect effects which may
work through at least two channels. The first is through the adverse effects of high public debt. Public debt increases
substantially after a financial crisis – by around 85% in nominal terms on average according to Reinhardt and Rogoff
(2009). High public debt can be a drag on long-term average GDP growth for at least three reasons. First, as debt
rises, so do interest payments. And higher debt service means higher distortionary taxes and lower productive
government expenditure. Second, as debt rises, so at some point do sovereign risk premia. Economics and politics
both put limits on how high tax rates can go. Thus, when rates beyond this maximum are required for debt
sustainability, a country will be forced to default, either explicitly or through inflation. The probability of hitting such

48

BIS 84th Annual Report

limits increases with the level of debt. And with higher sovereign risk premia come higher borrowing costs, lower
private investment and lower long-term growth. Third, as debt rises, authorities lose the flexibility to employ
countercyclical policies. This results in higher volatility, greater uncertainty and, again, lower growth. Cecchetti et al
(2011) as well as a number of studies which look at advanced economies in the post-World War II period find a
negative effect of public debt levels on trend growth after controlling for the typical determinants of economic
growth.
The second channel is an increase in resource misallocation. Market forces should normally induce less efficient
firms to restructure their operations or quit the market, making more resources available to the most efficient firms.
But the functioning of market forces is restricted, to an extent that varies from country to country, by labour and
product market regulations, bankruptcy laws, the tax code and public subsidies as well as by inefficient credit
allocation. As a result, an excessive number of less efficient firms may remain in the market, leading to lower
aggregate productivity growth (and hence lower trend GDP growth) than would be possible otherwise.
A financial boom generally worsens resource misallocation (as noted in Box III.A). But it is the failure to tackle
the malfunctioning of the banking sector as well as to remove barriers to resource reallocation that could make the
problem chronic. In the aftermath of a financial crisis, managers in troubled banks have an incentive to continue
lending to troubled and usually less efficient firms (evergreening or debt forbearance). They may also cut credit to
more efficient firms anticipating that they would in any case survive, yet depriving these firms of the resources
needed to expand. Policymakers might tolerate these practices to avoid unpopular large bailouts and possibly large
rises in unemployment from corporate restructuring. A few recent studies suggest that debt forbearance has been
at play in the most recent post-crisis experience, at least in some countries. There is, in addition, considerable
evidence of forbearance in Japan after the bursting of its bubble in the early 1990s. Capital and labour mobility
diminished compared with the pre-crisis period. And strikingly, not only were inefficient firms kept afloat, but their
market share also seems to have increased at the expense of that of more efficient firms. This shift is likely to have
contributed to the decline in trend growth observed in Japan in the early 1990s.

literature estimating the output losses, see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, An assessment of the long-term economic impact of
stronger capital and liquidity requirements, 2010. Not all studies, however, find a permanent shift in potential output. For instance, D Papell
and R Prodan (“The statistical behavior of GDP after financial crises and severe recessions”, paper prepared for the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston conference on Long-term effects of the Great Recession, October 2011) find more mixed evidence. In particular, after a severe crisis,
the United States (1929) and Sweden (1991) were able to return to pre-crisis trends after about 10 years. The return to pre-crisis trend,
however, may be due to other factors than the crisis (eg rearmament, structural reforms).      One exception is C Ramírez, “Bank fragility,

Inflation: domestic and global drivers
The pickup in world growth has so far not coincided with a sustained rise in inflation
(Graph III.5, left-hand panel). Since mid-2013, headline measures have remained
below or close to target in several countries. In particular, headline inflation stood at
0.7% in the euro area in April 2014, while it rose to 2% in the United States after being
below target for several months. Japan is an exception: both core and headline
inflation rates rose considerably following the announcement in early 2013 of a 2%
inflation target. Headline inflation has also remained below average in EMEs. Yet
inflation continued to be persistently high in Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and Turkey.

The recent stability of global inflation has largely echoed that of commodity
prices (Graph III.5, right-hand panel) and of core inflation (Graph III.5, centre panel).
In the United States and the euro area, core inflation continued to decline until
recently, but appears to have turned, rising to 1.8% in the United States and to 1%
in the euro area in April 2014. Over the past year, the extent of the inflation slowdown
in the euro area exceeded forecasts. The decline was particularly pronounced in
periphery countries and is likely to have been driven by structural adjustment and
the restoration of competitiveness.
The relative stability of inflation in advanced economies is remarkable when
compared with changes in output. Not only has inflation remained subdued recently
despite the recovery gaining traction, but it also fell less than many observers had
expected in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, despite the deep recession.
What are the factors that have kept inflation so stable? The standard framework
for analysing inflation, the so-called Phillips curve, relates price inflation to past and
expected inflation as well as the degree of slack within the economy – the difference
between actual output and a measure of potential output. A similar version,
sometimes referred to as the “wage Phillips curve”, relates wage inflation to price
inflation and the degree of slack in the labour market.
Unfortunately, economic slack is not directly observable and cannot be
measured precisely. Uncertainty about the true degree of slack is typically large in
normal times, and it is even larger after a balance sheet recession. The aftermath of
the Great Recession is no exception: while some indicators point to a substantial
closure of the output gap, others still signal the presence of considerable unutilised
capacity. Nonetheless, the dynamics of all estimates over the past year are similar:
they all point to shrinking slack. But this is at odds with the recent moderation in
inflation (Box III.C). Furthermore, the large output gaps observed during the 2008–09
downturn contrast with the lack of strong disinflationary pressures at that time.

This suggests that the degree of domestic slack is exerting a small influence
on inflation. This is not a new phenomenon: the flattening of the Phillips curve
seems to have started in the 1980s, and continued gradually over the subsequent
years. As an illustration, the left-hand panel of Graph III.6 plots the rate of inflation
against the output gap (as estimated by the Hodrick-Prescott filter) for a set of
advanced economies. The regression lines show that the slope of the curve has
decreased over different sample periods. The flattening is also evident when wage
inflation is plotted against an estimate of the cyclical component of the unemployment
rate (Graph III.6, right-hand panel).

Better-anchored inflation expectations?
The main factor behind a flatter Phillips curve is often considered to be greater
confidence in central banks’ commitment to keep inflation low and stable. If firms
and workers view this commitment as credible, they will look through temporary
inflationary surprises, be they positive or negative, and will reset prices and wages
less frequently. Thus, firmly anchored long-term inflation expectations will tend to
be associated with lower cyclical inflationary pressures. Similarly, stronger credibility
is also reflected in a reduced exchange rate pass-through into import and consumer
prices: insofar as movements in nominal exchange rates are perceived as temporary
and prices are costly to adjust, firms may simply let their margins fluctuate.
Long-term inflation expectations have so far remained well anchored in major
economies, contributing to the observed stability of their inflation. Even in Japan,
despite many years of mild deflation, long-term inflation expectations have hovered
around a positive rate of 1%. Past stability notwithstanding, financial market
measures of medium-term inflation expectations in the euro area (such as swapimplied inflation rates) have declined steadily since early 2013, suggesting that
market participants expect inflation to remain persistently below the upper end of

Box III.C

Measuring potential output and economic slack

Potential output is a key variable for policymakers. It conveys information about the sustainability of output and the
degree of economic slack. Unfortunately, potential output is not observable, not even ex post. In the past,
policymakers relied on the fact that an overheating economy would normally show up in rising inflation, as demand
puts increasing pressure on limited resources. Over the last few decades, however, the link between the output gap
and inflation has become ever more tenuous. As a result, with inflation not increasing as much as in previous
expansionary episodes, policymakers were tempted to believe that rising output could be sustained indefinitely. In
fact, the signs of an unsustainable expansion took the form of unsustainable increases in credit and asset prices. This
box reviews the traditional methods used for estimating potential output and compares them with a new method
that explicitly takes into account financial variables.
Traditional methods range from the purely statistical to those that are explicitly based on economic theory. At
one end of the spectrum, univariate statistical methods, and especially the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, are among
the most popular. These techniques decompose the output series into a cyclical component and a trend, which is
interpreted as potential output. Such methods are appealing in their simplicity and transparency but, being
completely data-driven, they suffer from the so-called endpoint problem: estimates of potential output usually
change substantially when new observations become available, even in the absence of any data revisions. The
problem is most severe around business cycle turning points, precisely when accurate estimates are most needed.
Other methods combine statistics with economic theory. A popular choice is to use models of the production
function, whereby an estimate of potential output is obtained as a function of the inputs of capital and labour.
Structural approaches are appealing in that movements in potential output can be attributed to economic factors.
Yet they are also prone to errors, reflecting misspecification of the underlying model, as well as uncertainties in
its parameter estimates and in the measurement of the variables. Furthermore, these methods, too, can entail
substantial endpoint problems, since they rely heavily on pure statistical filters to smooth out cyclical fluctuations in
factor inputs. Orphanides and Van Norden (2005) find that real-time estimates of output gaps have low explanatory
power for inflation developments compared with estimates based on ex post data, and that revisions could be as
large as the output gap itself.
Recently, Borio et al (2013) introduced a Kalman filter method for estimating the output gap which
incorporates information about credit and property prices (Chapter IV). Their approach accounts for the fact that
credit expansion and buoyant asset prices might push output to unsustainably high levels, but are not always
accompanied by rising consumer price inflation. One reason is that financial booms often coincide with temporary
expansion of supply capacity, which tends to dampen price pressures. Thus, including financial variables leads to

estimates of the trend component which are less affected by unsustainable financial booms. The corresponding
“finance-neutral” output gap indicates how far output is from its sustainable level.
Differences among different methods are illustrated in Graph III.C: the left-hand panel shows the output gap
for the United States estimated using the popular HP filter; the centre panel shows the same variable estimated
using the OECD production function approach; and the right-hand panel shows the “finance-neutral” estimate. The
first two measures failed to indicate in real time that the economy had been overheating in the run-up to the Great
Recession: the estimates of the output gap obtained with the same methods after having observed the recession
are significantly different. In contrast, both the real-time and ex post estimates of the output gap obtained with the
“finance-neutral” filter are much more aligned. And, more importantly, the real-time estimate was clearly signalling
that output was above sustainable levels well before the onset of the recession.
The uncertainty surrounding output gap estimates is likely to be much higher after a balance sheet recession
than a standard business cycle recession. Output losses are typically permanent, although there is uncertainty about
how large they could be (Box III.B). In this respect, estimates of the output gap based on different methods paint a
very different picture. The measure obtained with the HP filter suggests that the output gap in the United States has
been closed. By contrast, the measure based on the OECD production function continues to indicate ample
economic slack, at over 3% of potential output in 2013. The finance-neutral gap indicates a similar amount of slack,
but with a vigorous pickup over the most recent quarters, as credit growth resumed. It must be noted, however, that
the finance-neutral output gap too is likely to overestimate the true amount of slack in the aftermath of a balance
sheet recession to the extent that it adjusts only slowly to the permanent losses in output.

the ECB’s “below but close to 2%” definition of price stability (see Chapter V for a
discussion of the monetary policy implications of low inflation).

A bigger role for global factors?
Along with greater central bank credibility, an additional factor that can explain
why inflation has become ever less tied to domestic developments is the much
greater interconnectedness of the world economy. The last three decades have
seen the entry and growing integration into the global economy of China and India
(which together make up almost 40% of world population), former communist
countries and many other EMEs. Advances in communication technology and
logistics have facilitated the creation of extensive global production chains.
Many international firms, in particular, have relocated part of their production
processes to EMEs with an ample supply of labour. And further scope for relocation
remains.
Larger trade flows, and above all the greater contestability of both product and
factor input markets, have made domestic inflation developments more dependent
on international market conditions. More specifically, such conditions cannot be
fully captured by import price inflation – adding this variable to a standard Phillips
curve does not suffice. Not least, measures of global economic slack also matter.2
A reduction in trade barriers and transport costs has made tradable goods produced
in one country more substitutable with those produced elsewhere. In addition,

determinants of domestic inflation”, BIS Working Papers, no 227, May 2007, for more details.

technological advances have increased the range of tradable goods and services.
Hence prices of domestically produced tradables cannot diverge too much from
those of similar goods produced abroad. This means that changes in the price of
these goods should be more dependent on the degree of tightness or slack in
the use of resources globally, not just locally. Likewise, domestic wages cannot differ
too much from those prevailing in other countries producing similar goods for
international markets lest production be relocated abroad.3
Consistent with the importance of global factors, individual countries’ inflation
rates have been highly synchronous with each other: a common factor accounts
for over half of the total variability of inflation in a panel of advanced economies
(Graph III.7, left-hand panel).4
Swings in commodity prices are important drivers of global inflation. And these
are in turn increasingly related to global demand conditions, rather than idiosyncratic
supply developments. Strong growth and improvements in living standards in EMEs
have pushed up not only the prices of industrial commodities, but also those of

Greater migration flows seem to have had only a modest mitigating impact on wage demands in
destination countries. See eg G Ottaviano and G Peri, “Rethinking the effect of immigration on
wages”, Journal of the European Economic Association, February 2012, and S Lemos and J Portes,

wages in the U.K.”, The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis and Policy, January 2014, for evidence on
the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively.

Globalisation might have also contributed to reducing the measured degree of exchange rate
pass-through to domestic prices. Large manufacturing firms can distribute production over a larger
number of countries and rapidly switch suppliers, thereby minimising the impact on their final
product of currency movements in a single country. For a review of the literature, see eg J Bailliu,
W Dong and J Murray, “Has exchange rate pass-through really declined? Some recent insights
from the literature”, Bank of Canada Review, Autumn 2010.

food. In turn, higher commodity prices have fed into other countries’ inflation rates,
regardless of their relative cyclical position.
However, despite the upward pressure on commodity prices from demand in
EMEs, the overall impact of globalisation on advanced economies has been largely
disinflationary so far. The rapid industrialisation of large EMEs with a huge supply of
cheap labour has boosted productive capacity, holding down merchandise goods
prices. China’s role, in particular, has increased substantially over the past decade
and a half (Graph III.7, left-hand panel): the share of the variation in advanced
economies’ inflation explained by Chinese export price inflation doubled to over
30% in the period 1999–2013 compared with 1986–98. At the same time, the prices
of Chinese export goods remained remarkably subdued, even against the
background of rising compensation and unit labour costs: they are now still
relatively close to the 2005 level (Graph III.7, right-hand panel).
To further illustrate the growing role of global factors in driving inflation, one
can augment standard specifications of the Phillips curve with a measure of the
global output gap. The left-hand panel of Graph III.8 reports estimates of the slope
of the price Phillips curve with respect to the domestic and global output gap,
obtained over different samples from a panel of advanced economies. The coefficient
on the domestic output gap declines and becomes statistically insignificant from
the end of the 1990s onwards, while the coefficient on the global output gap gains
relevance. The results are very similar for a similarly augmented wage Phillips curve.
Looking ahead, it is unclear to what extent the greater role of global factors
will continue to affect domestic inflation. The strength of disinflationary tailwinds
crucially depends on differences in the levels of wages and unit labour costs across
Restricted
countries. These differences have been narrowing. In China, for example,

the manufacturing sector have increased steadily while labour productivity growth
appears to have slowed somewhat in recent years. If not met by similar gains in
productivity, wage rises will eventually put upward pressure on export prices.
Disinflationary tailwinds, however, do not appear to have run their full course yet.
And there is still scope for further integration into the global economy of lowincome countries with an ample supply of cheap labour.

Investment and productivity: a long-term perspective
Since 2009, investment and labour productivity growth have lagged behind previous
recoveries. Total gross fixed investment in advanced economies is generally lower
than before the crisis (Graph III.9, left-hand panel). The largest investment shortfall
has occurred in countries that experienced the strongest real estate booms:
14 percentage points in Ireland, 9 in Spain, 4 in the United States and 3 in the
United Kingdom. Construction accounts for most of the drop. But spending on
equipment is also below the pre-crisis average in many countries, reflecting
weakness of demand and the slow recovery typical of balance sheet recessions.
It is unrealistic to expect investment, as a share of GDP, to return to its precrisis level in advanced economies. The drop in construction spending is a necessary
correction of previous overinvestment and is unlikely to be entirely reversed.
Moreover, the investment share had been on a downward trend long before the
crisis, suggesting that, as output growth recovers, investment may settle below the
pre-crisis average.
This downward trend in advanced economies reflects a number of factors. One
is the decline in trend growth over the past few decades. Since the capital-to-output
ratio has generally remained stable or risen slightly in most countries, a smaller
share of GDP needs to be invested to keep the ratio constant over time. A second
factor is a shift in the composition of output from capital-intensive manufacturing
sectors towards less capital-intensive service sectors. Third, to the extent that
the decline in output growth is driven by exogenous factors, such as adverse
demographics, a slower pace of technological innovation or shifting long-run
patterns in consumer demand, the associated fall in the investment-to-GDP ratio
would be a natural consequence of this slowdown, rather than a driving force.
Moreover, the investment weakness may be overstated. Over the past few
decades, the relative prices of investment goods have been trending down: firms
have been able to keep their capital stocks constant by spending less in nominal
terms. In fact, in real terms, investment spending has fluctuated around a mildly
increasing, not decreasing, trend in advanced economies. In addition, official statistics
may underestimate intangible investment (spending on research and development,
training, etc), which has been gaining importance in serviced-based economies.
Finally, and most importantly, at the global level investment is not weak. The
secular drop in the investment-to-GDP share in advanced economies has been
offset by a trend increase in EMEs (Graph III.9, centre panel). Part of it reflects strong
investment in China, which at close to 45% of GDP looks unsustainably high
(Graph III.9, right-hand panel). But even excluding China, EME investment has
trended up, albeit at a more moderate pace, in particular in emerging Asia.
This broad picture, however, does not mean that investment could not or
should not be higher. Ageing infrastructure is a potential drag on growth in the
United States, the United Kingdom and other advanced economies. In parts of the
euro area, product market and other rigidities hold back business investment. And
supply bottlenecks are having similar effects in several EMEs, including South Africa,
Brazil and various other Latin American countries.

Factors that can potentially hold back a cyclical pickup of investment include
a lack of finance and weak aggregate demand. But in fact financial conditions are
extremely favourable. The cost of capital in major economies has generally fallen
below pre-crisis levels, thanks to very low interest rates and buoyant equity
valuations. Large firms generally have no problem borrowing from banks. And bond
financing has been readily available on extraordinarily good terms around the
world, including to firms without an investment grade rating (Chapters II and VI).
Thanks to easy finance and a recovery in profitability, the net financial balance
of the non-financial corporate sector has continued to improve. It is now back to
surplus in several advanced economies, at similar levels to those prevailing pre-crisis.
In the United States, for example, internal earnings (net of taxes and dividends plus
depreciation charges) have consistently exceeded capital spending since 2009. On
top of this, US firms have also continued to issue long-term debt to exploit record
low yields. And equity is being withdrawn faster than it is raised, as firms pay higher
dividends, buy back shares and engage in mergers and acquisitions.
Access to finance may still be a problem for small and medium-sized firms in
countries where the banking sector is still impaired, such as parts of Europe.
Improving the supply of finance for these firms requires that banks recognise their
losses and recapitalise. Monetary stimulus per se is unlikely to have additional
significant effects (Chapters I and V).
With finance not a constraint, the cyclical weakness of investment is better
explained by the slow recovery in aggregate demand that is typical of balance sheet
recessions. As agents repair balance sheets, their spending remains below pre-crisis
norms, depressing the income of other agents and so prolonging the adjustment
phase (Box III.A). The necessary consolidation of public finances may further slow

growth in the short term. As the recovery proceeds, investment should pick up.
Indeed, investment growth has already risen in recent quarters, albeit modestly, in
a number of countries, including Germany, the United States and the United
Kingdom.
The current weakness of aggregate demand may suggest the need for further
monetary stimulus or for easing the pace of fiscal consolidation. However, these
policies are likely to be either ineffective in current circumstances (Chapter V) or
unsustainable: taking a long-term perspective, they may simply succeed in bringing
forward spending from the future rather than increasing its overall amount over the
long run, while leading to a further rise in public and private debt. Instead, the only
way to boost demand in a sustainable manner is to raise the production capacity of
the economy by removing barriers to productive investment and the reallocation of
resources. This is even more important in the face of declining productivity growth.

Declining productivity growth trends
Since 2010, labour productivity growth has been below pre-crisis averages in most
advanced economies and has so far risen much more slowly than in previous
business cycle recoveries. For instance, it has averaged about 1% in both the United
States and Germany, compared with 2.3% and 1.8%, respectively, over the pre-crisis
decade; and it has been close to zero in the United Kingdom, against a pre-crisis
average of 2½%. Spain is an exception: there it has risen above pre-crisis averages
following the large decline in employment.
Part of the weakness of productivity growth since the start of the recovery
reflects (as noted earlier) the slow recovery typical of a balance sheet recession. But
it also reflects, to some degree, the continuation of a downward trend which began
well before the onset of the financial crisis (Graph III.10, left-hand panel). Such a
trend is also evident in estimates of total factor productivity (TFP), which measures
the efficiency with which both capital and labour are employed in production
(Graph III.10, centre panel). In the United States and the United Kingdom, both
measures indicate that productivity growth underwent a revival from the mid-1980s
till the early 2000s, but has since subsided. TFP growth in the euro area, by contrast,
has been falling steadily since the early 1970s and is currently negative. TFP growth
in Japan has also clearly lagged behind that of the United States: it first fell sharply
and then turned negative during the financial bust of the early 1990s, recovering
somewhat only in the early 2000s.
The productivity growth slowdown, which may have been partly obscured by
the pre-crisis financial boom, is likely to reflect deeper factors. The first is the pace of
technological innovation, which is, however, difficult to predict. One pessimistic view
is that the information technology revolution led only to a temporary one-off revival
of productivity, which ran its course before the start of the crisis.5 The second is
patterns of demand: the shift towards low-productivity growth sectors, such as
services (health care, education, leisure, etc) tends to reduce aggregate productivity
growth.6 The third is the worsening of various structural impediments to the efficient

The misallocation of resources is likely to have worsened further in the wake of
the financial crisis. Existing evidence suggests that in crisis-hit countries low interest
rates and forbearance might be locking up resources in inefficient companies. For
example, firm-level data indicate that in the United Kingdom around one third of
the productivity slowdown since 2007 is due to slower reallocation of resources
between firms, in terms of both labour movements between firms and firms’ market
exit and entry.7 Countries that have been too slow in repairing their balance sheets
may in some respects resemble Japan after its early 1990s financial bust (Box III.B).
Unless productivity growth picks up, the prospects for output growth are dim.
In particular, population ageing in many advanced economies, and not only there,
will act as a drag on growth. The share of the working-age population has been
falling in the euro area and, even more rapidly, in Japan. In the United States and
the United Kingdom, it peaked just before the beginning of the financial crisis
(Graph III.10, right-hand panel).
All this puts a premium on efforts to improve productivity growth. There is a
need to remove various structural barriers to innovation and investment and to
make economies more flexible in the allocation of capital and labour, especially in
the euro area, Japan and other economies where productivity growth has
significantly lagged that of the United States. Examples include distortions in the tax
system, red tape and excessive product and labour market regulation.8 In addition,
further fiscal consolidation is of the essence to prevent high levels of government

debt from becoming a persistent drag on trend growth. In this regard, despite some
progress, most advanced economies have yet to set their public finances on a
sustainable long-term trajectory (Graph III.4 and Annex Table III.3).9
Several EMEs have until recently displayed stable or even rising productivity
growth. But productivity growth may have turned in some countries. The recent
financial booms may partly obscure the fact that improvements in efficiency may
become harder to achieve. As an economy reaches middle income levels, the size of
the manufacturing sector peaks and demand for services becomes more important.
This makes it harder to close the productivity gap with the most advanced
economies: quite apart from slower productivity growth in the service sector,
institutional and structural weaknesses tend to be a stronger drag on the service
sector than on manufacturing. Increasing demographic headwinds are also
expected to weigh on growth in a number of EMEs.
These considerations suggest that sustainable long-term growth requires
structural measures that directly tackle the sources of low productivity rather than
policies aimed at stimulating aggregate demand. Relaxing supply constraints may
also have positive spillovers on current demand, as agents could spend more in
anticipation of higher future income. By contrast, debt-financed stimulus may be less
effective than hoped and raise long-term sustainability issues (Chapter V).

Fiscal adjustment needs are particularly large in Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom,
France and Spain. Most of the required adjustment in the United States and the United Kingdom
is due to age-related spending, which is expected to rise rapidly by the end of the current decade
in the absence of reforms. For a more detailed analysis, see BIS, 83rd Annual Report, June 2013,

IV. Debt and the financial cycle: domestic and global

A pure business cycle view is not enough to understand the evolution of the global
economy since the financial crisis of 2007–09 (Chapters I and III). This view cannot
fully account for the interaction between debt, asset prices and output that explains
many advanced economies’ poor growth in recent years. This chapter explores the
role debt, leverage and risk-taking have played in driving economic and financial
developments, in particular by assessing where different economies stand in terms
of the financial cycle.
Financial cycles differ from business cycles. They encapsulate the selfreinforcing interactions between perceptions of value and risk, risk-taking and
financing constraints which translate into financial booms and busts. They tend to
be much longer than business cycles, and are best measured by a combination of
credit aggregates and property prices. Output and financial variables can move in
different directions for long periods of time, but the link tends to re-establish itself
with a vengeance when financial booms turn into busts. Such episodes often
coincide with banking crises, which in turn tend to go hand in hand with much
deeper recessions – balance sheet recessions – than those that characterise the
average business cycle.
High private sector debt levels can undermine sustainable economic growth.
In many economies currently experiencing financial booms, households and firms
are in a vulnerable position, which poses the risk of serious financial distress and
macroeconomic strains. And in the countries hardest hit by the crisis, private debt
levels are still high relative to output, making households and firms sensitive to
increases in interest rates. These countries could find themselves in a debt trap:
seeking to stimulate the economy through low interest rates encourages the
taking-on of even more debt, ultimately adding to the problem it is meant to solve.
The growth of new funding sources has changed the character of risks. In the
so-called second phase of global liquidity, corporations in emerging market
economies (EMEs) have tapped international securities markets for much of their
funding. In part, this has been done through their affiliates abroad, whose debt is
typically off authorities’ radar screens. Market finance tends to have longer
maturities than bank finance, thus reducing rollover risks. But it is notoriously
procyclical. It is cheap and ample when conditions are good, but can evaporate at
the first sign of problems. This could also have knock-on effects on domestic
financial institutions, which have relied on the domestic corporate sector for an
important part of their funding. Finally, the vast majority of EME private sector
external debt remains in foreign currency, thus exposing borrowers to currency risk.
This chapter begins with a short description of the main characteristics of the
financial cycle, followed by a section analysing the stage of the cycle particular
countries find themselves in. The third section looks at drivers of the financial cycle
in recent years. The final section discusses risks and potential adjustment needs.

The financial cycle: a short introduction
While there is no consensus definition of the financial cycle, the broad concept
encapsulates joint fluctuations in a wide set of financial variables including both
quantities and prices. BIS research suggests that credit aggregates, as a proxy for

BIS 84th Annual Report

65

leverage, and property prices, as a measure of available collateral, play a particularly
important role in this regard. Rapid increases in credit, particularly mortgage credit,
drive up property prices, which in turn increase collateral values and thus the amount
of credit the private sector can obtain. It is this mutually reinforcing interaction
between financing constraints and perceptions of value and risks that has historically
caused the most serious macroeconomic dislocations. Other variables, such as credit
spreads, risk premia and default rates, provide useful complementary information
on stress, risk perceptions and risk appetite.
Four features characterise financial cycles empirically (Box IV.A describes how
financial cycles can be measured). First, they are much longer than business cycles.
As traditionally measured, business cycles tend to last from one to eight years,
and financial cycles around 15 to 20 years. The difference in length means that a
financial cycle can span several business cycles.
Second, peaks in the financial cycle tend to coincide with banking crises or
periods of considerable financial stress. Financial booms in which surging asset
prices and rapid credit growth reinforce each other tend to be driven by
prolonged accommodative monetary and financial conditions, often in combination
with financial innovation. Loose financing conditions, in turn, feed into the real
economy, leading to excessive leverage in some sectors and overinvestment in the
industries particularly in vogue, such as real estate. If a shock hits the economy,
overextended households or firms often find themselves unable to service their
debt. Sectoral misallocations built up during the boom further aggravate this vicious
cycle (Chapter III).
Third, financial cycles are often synchronised across economies. While they do
not necessarily move in lockstep globally, many drivers of the financial cycle have
an important global component. For example, liquidity conditions tend to be highly
correlated across markets. Mobile financial capital tends to equalise risk premia and
financing conditions across currencies and borders and acts as the (price-setting)
marginal source of finance. External capital thus often plays an outsize role in
unsustainable credit booms, amplifying movements in credit aggregates, and may
also induce overshooting in exchange rates. It does so directly when a currency is used
outside national jurisdictions, as exemplified by the international role of the US dollar.
Monetary conditions can also spread indirectly through resistance to exchange rate
appreciation, if policymakers keep policy rates lower than suggested by domestic
conditions alone and/or intervene and accumulate foreign currency reserves.
Fourth, financial cycles change with the macroeconomic environment and
policy frameworks. For example, they have grown both in length and amplitude
since the early 1980s, probably reflecting more liberalised financial systems,
seemingly more stable macroeconomic conditions and monetary policy frameworks
that have disregarded developments in credit. The significant changes in regulatory
and macroeconomic policy frameworks after the financial crisis may also change the
dynamics going forward.
These four features are evident in Graph IV.1, which depicts financial cycles in
a large range of countries. In many advanced economies, the financial cycle as
measured by aggregating medium-term movements of real credit, the credit-toGDP ratio and real house prices peaked in the early 1990s and again around 2008
(Box IV.A). Both turning points coincided with widespread banking crises. The
financial cycles in many Asian economies show a markedly different timing, peaking
around the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. Another boom started in these
economies just after the turn of the millennium and persists today, barely
interrupted by the financial crisis. In some cases, for instance the banking distress in
Germany and Switzerland in 2007–09, strains have developed independently from
the domestic financial cycle through banks’ exposures to financial cycles elsewhere.

The loose link between business and financial cycles over prolonged periods
may tempt policymakers to focus on the former without paying much heed to
the latter. But setting policy without regard to the financial cycle comes at a peril. It
may result in financial imbalances, such as overindebted corporate or household
sectors or bloated financial systems, that render certain sectors fragile to even a
small deterioration in macroeconomic or financial conditions. This is what happened
in Japan and the Nordic countries in the 1980s and early 1990s and in Ireland,
Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States in the years before the financial
crisis.
Diverging financial and business cycles can also help to explain the
phenomenon of “unfinished recessions”. For example, in the wake of the stock
market crashes in 1987 and 2000, monetary policy in the United States was eased
substantially, even though the financial cycle was in an upswing (Graph IV.A).
Benefiting from lower interest rates, property prices and credit did not contract but
expand, only to collapse several years later.

Measuring financial cycles

Policymakers and researchers can build on a wealth of knowledge to measure business cycles, but the same is not
true for financial cycles. This box discusses the main ideas and insights in the emerging literature on how to measure
financial cycles.
Two methods have been used to identify both business and financial cycles. The first is known as the turning
point method, and goes back to the original work in the 1940s to date business cycles, still used today by the NBER
Business Cycle Dating Committee. This approach identifies cyclical peaks and troughs by looking at growth rates of
a broad range of underlying series. For example, a business cycle peaks when the growth rate of several series,
including output, employment, industrial production and consumption, changes from positive to negative. For
financial cycles, BIS research has shown that real credit growth, the credit-to-GDP ratio and real property price
growth represent the smallest set of variables needed to depict adequately the mutually reinforcing interaction
between financing constraints and perceptions of value and risks that can cause serious macroeconomic dislocations
and banking crises. That said, other variables, such as credit spreads, equity prices, risk premia and default rates, also
measure risk or risk perceptions and hence financial cycles. The second approach is based on statistical filters that
extract cyclical fluctuations with a particular cycle length from a specific series, for instance output.
The financial cycle estimates shown in this chapter follow the second approach and are based on joint
developments in real credit growth, the credit-to-GDP ratio and real property price growth. Cycles in the individual
series are extracted by using a bandpass filter with cycles lasting between eight and 30 years, which are then
combined into a single series by taking a simple average. Bandpass filters are useful for identifying historical financial
cycles, yet observations for recent years must be treated more carefully, as trends and thus cyclical fluctuations may
change when more data become available in the future.
The traditional business cycle frequency is around one to eight years. By contrast, the financial cycles that matter
most for banking crises and major macroeconomic dislocations last 10–20 years. This is evident from Graph IV.A.
Focusing on medium-term frequencies is appropriate for two reasons. First, credit and property prices move much
more closely together at these frequencies than at higher ones. Second, these medium-term cycles are an important
driver of overall fluctuations in these two series, much more so than medium cyclical fluctuations are for real GDP.
Financial cycles identified in this way are closely associated with systemic banking crises and serious economic
damage. This holds irrespective of whether they are identified with a turning point approach or a statistical filter.

Where are countries in the financial cycle?
In recent years, financial cycle downswings in most advanced economies have
coincided with upswings in large EMEs and other countries. Unfortunately, the lack
of long series on credit and property prices precludes the construction of the
financial cycle indicator illustrated in Graph IV.1 for several important economies.
But recent credit and property price developments offer a useful picture, if an
incomplete one. These data suggest that countries are at very different stages of
the financial cycle (Graph IV.2).
Many euro area countries are in a financial downswing. Following a prolonged
boom, the euro area countries that were most affected by the financial crisis and
the subsequent European debt crisis, such as Greece and Spain, have seen real
credit and property prices fall by an average of 5–10% annually in recent years. But
downward pressures appear to be receding somewhat, as the decline in credit and
house prices has slowed in recent quarters.
Financial cycles in other economies that experienced a crisis seem to have
bottomed out. The United States saw a large run-up in credit and asset prices
that ended with the onset of the financial crisis. The subsequent downswing in
asset prices and non-financial corporate borrowing ended in 2011, and
household borrowing started to pick up in 2013. The picture is less clear-cut
for the United Kingdom and many central and eastern European economies –
countries that also experienced boom-bust cycles in the last decade. Deleveraging
in these countries continues, but the pace is slowing and property prices
have started to rise again, suggesting that the downward trend in the financial
cycle may have reversed.
Signals are mixed for advanced economies that did not see an outright crisis
in recent years. Australia, Canada and the Nordic countries experienced large
financial booms in the mid- to late 2000s. But the global and European debt crises
dented these dynamics; asset prices fluctuated widely and corporate borrowing
fell as global economic activity deteriorated. This pushed the medium-term
financial cycle indicator on a downward trend, even though households in all these
economies continued to borrow, albeit at a slower pace. But the strong increase
in commodity prices in recent years prevented a lasting turn of the cycle, and
over the last four quarters real property price and (total) credit growth in Australia
and Canada has picked up to levels close to or in line with developments in
large EMEs.
Booms are clearly evident in several other countries, in particular EMEs. In
many cases, the surge in credit and asset prices slowed in 2008 and 2009
but resumed full force in 2010. Since then, credit to the private sector has
expanded by an average of about 10% per year. In China, this growth was
mainly driven by non-banks, whereas banks financed the expansion in Turkey. At
present, there are signs that some of these booms are stalling. For example,
property price growth in Brazil has weakened, which is typical of the later stages
of the financial cycle. Rising defaults in the property sector in China also point in
this direction.

What is driving the financial cycle in the current context?
To some extent, the current state of the financial cycle reflects the self-reinforcing
adjustment after the financial crisis. The ratios of private sector debt to GDP have
slid by roughly 20 percentage points from their recent peaks in the United States,
the United Kingdom and Spain. While substantial, these reductions still fall well

beginning of 2005 to around 5% by May 2013. Using the year-on-year change in
consumer prices in those countries, this amounted to real long-term rates of just
1% in 2013.4
Offsetting the stimulus from abroad through tighter domestic policy is not
easy. First, a large share of foreign capital inflows is denominated in foreign
currency and thus not directly affected by domestic monetary policy. Second,
raising domestic interest rates while rates in the rest of the world remain very
low can trigger even more upward pressure on the exchange rate and capital
inflows. Low domestic policy rates may limit debt inflows from abroad, but they
also stimulate domestic lending. Indeed, countries with a more accommodative
monetary policy for a given set of domestic economic conditions tend to experience
more rapid credit growth (Graph IV.5).

Risks and adjustment needs
The position in the financial cycle identified above, as well as high levels of private
sector debt, pose challenges for the years to come. There is obviously a risk that
many of the more recent booms will end in a crisis or at least in severe financial
stress, just as many have before. But even some countries that are currently in the
down phase of the financial cycle or have just bottomed out are vulnerable. Despite
significant deleveraging since the financial crisis, debt relative to income and asset
prices often remains high, potentially requiring further adjustments to return to
more sustainable levels.
This section first assesses the risk of financial crises using a series of early warning
indicators, and then drills down further to better understand the implications of the

Working Papers, no 441, February 2014.

shift from bank to bond finance in EMEs. Finally, the degree to which households
and firms need to reduce their debt levels relative to GDP to return to more
sustainable levels is analysed, and a potential debt trap is identified.

Indicators point to the risk of financial distress
Early warning indicators in a number of countries are sending worrying signals. In
line with the financial cycle analysis developed in the previous section, several early
warning indicators signal that vulnerabilities have been building up in the financial
systems of several countries. Many years of strong credit and, often, property price
growth have left borrowers exposed to increases in interest rates and/or sharp
slowdowns in property prices and economic activity. Early warning indicators cannot
predict the exact timing of financial distress, but they have proved fairly reliable in
identifying unsustainable credit and property price developments in the past.
Credit-to-GDP gaps in many EMEs and Switzerland are well above the
threshold that indicates potential trouble (Table IV.1). The historical record shows
that credit-to-GDP gaps (the difference between the credit-to-GDP ratio and its
long-term trend) above 10 percentage points have usually been followed by serious
banking strains within three years.5 Residential property price gaps (the deviation of
real residential property prices from their long-term trend) also point to risks: they
tend to build up during a credit boom and fall two to three years before a crisis.
Indeed, the Swiss authorities have reacted to the build-up of financial vulnerabilities
by increasing countercyclical capital buffer requirements from 1% to 2% of riskweighted positions secured by domestic residential property.
Debt service ratios send a less worrying signal. These ratios, which measure the
share of income used to service debt (Box IV.B), remain low in many economies.
Taken at face value, they suggest that borrowers in China are currently especially
vulnerable. But rising rates would push debt service ratios in several other
economies into critical territory (Table IV.1, last column). To illustrate, assume that
money market rates rise by 250 basis points, in line with the 2004 tightening
episode.6 At constant credit-to-GDP ratios, this would push debt service ratios in
most of the booming economies above critical thresholds. Experience indicates that
debt service ratios tend to remain low for long periods, only to shoot up rapidly one
or two years before a crisis, typically in response to interest rate increases.7 Low
values therefore do not necessarily mean that the financial system is safe.
It would be too easy to dismiss these indicator readings as inappropriate because
“this time is different”. True, no early warning indicator is fully reliable. The financial
system evolves continuously, and the nature of risks shifts over time. But credit gaps
and debt service ratios have proved to be relatively robust. They are based on total

5

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision chose the credit-to-GDP gap as a starting point
for discussions about countercyclical capital buffer levels because of its reliability as an early
warning indicator. A credit-to-GDP gap above 2 (beige cells in Table IV.1) indicates that authorities
should consider putting in place buffers, which would reach their maximum at readings above 10
(red cells).

6

In the 2004 tightening episode, money market rates in advanced economies increased by around
250 basis points over three years. The thought experiment here assumes that there is a one-to-one
pass-through from money market rates to average lending rates for loans to the private nonfinancial sector, which, together with current credit-to-GDP ratios and average remaining maturities,
determine the debt service burden (Box IV.B).

credit, ie taking account of credit from all sources,8 and are therefore generally not
affected by the shift from bank to non-bank finance associated with the second
phase of global liquidity. The quality of the indicators should also be robust to
changes in the equilibrium levels of debt owing to financial deepening. Credit-toGDP and debt service ratios tend to rise when households and businesses gain access
to financial services, with the corresponding welfare benefits. But banks’ ability to
screen potential borrowers and manage risks puts a natural limit on how fast this
process can take place. Credit extended during a phase of rapid credit growth could
conceal problem loans, leading to financial instability when the boom turns to bust.9
Weaker output growth could also trigger financial strains, particularly in
countries where debt has increased above trend for a long time. Many countries
with large credit gaps have been experiencing a prolonged period of rapid growth,
briefly interrupted by the fallout from the financial crisis in the advanced economies.
But growth has slowed more recently, and may well remain below the previous
trend in the future (Chapter III).
Commodity exporters could be especially sensitive to a sharp deceleration in
China. This would further increase vulnerabilities of currently booming economies
such as Brazil. But it may also adversely affect some of the advanced economies
that were less affected by the financial crisis. As noted above, countries such as
Australia, Canada and Norway were in the upswing of a pronounced financial cycle
before the crisis erupted. Since then, the cycle has turned in these economies, but
the fallout was buffered by high commodity prices. Since outstanding debt remains
high, the slowdown of GDP associated with a reduction in commodity exports
could cause repayment difficulties.
Looking beyond total credit, the shift from bank lending to market-based debt
financing by non-financial corporations in EMEs has changed the nature of risks. On
the one hand, borrowers have used the favourable conditions to lock in long-term
funding, thus reducing rollover risk. For example, of the roughly $1.1 trillion in
international debt securities outstanding of borrowers headquartered in EMEs,
around $100 billion – less than one tenth of the total – matures in each of the
coming years (Graph IV.6, left-hand panel). In addition, roughly 10% of the debt
securities maturing in 2020 or later are callable, and an unknown proportion have
covenants that allow investors to demand accelerated repayment if the borrower’s
conditions deteriorate. Nonetheless, potential annual repayments look relatively
modest relative to the amount of foreign reserves of the main borrower countries.
But the benevolent impact of longer maturities could be offset by fickle market
liquidity. The availability of market funding is notoriously procyclical. It is available in
large quantities and at a cheap price when conditions are good, but this can change
at the first hint of problems. Capital flows could reverse quickly when interest
rates in the advanced economies eventually go up or when perceived domestic
conditions in the host economies deteriorate. In May and June 2013, the mere
possibility that the Federal Reserve would begin tapering its asset purchases led to
rapid outflows from funds investing in EME securities (Chapter II), although overall
portfolio investment was less volatile.

correlated across funds. This could be because of top-down management of
different portfolios, as is the case for some major bond funds, similar benchmarks
or similar risk management systems (Chapter VI).
The shift from bank to securities financing has apparently had little impact
on currency risk. Over 90% of international debt securities and well over 80% of
cross-border loans by non-bank corporations resident in EMEs are effectively
denominated in foreign currency. And some of the heaviest borrowers in the
international bond market are property firms and utilities, which are unlikely to have
significant foreign currency assets or payment streams that could back up their
debt. There are financial instruments that could hedge some of the currency risk.
But in practice many hedges are incomplete, because they cover exposures only
partly, or are based on shorter-term contracts that are regularly rolled over.
Such strategies significantly reduce the value of financial hedges against large
fluctuations in exchange rates, which often coincide with illiquid markets.

Returning to sustainable debt levels
Regardless of the risk of serious financial distress, in the years ahead many
economies will face headwinds as outstanding debt adjusts to more sustainable
long-run levels. Determining the exact level of sustainable debt is difficult, but
several indicators suggest that current levels of private sector indebtedness are still
too high.
For one, sustainable debt is aligned with wealth. Sharp drops in property and
other asset prices in the wake of the financial crisis have pushed down wealth in
many of the countries at the heart of the crisis, although it has been recovering in
some. Wealth effects can be long-lasting. For example, real property prices in Japan
have decreased by more than 3% on average per year since 1991, thus reducing
the collateral available for new borrowing.
Long-run demographic trends could aggravate this problem by putting further
pressure on asset prices (Chapter III). An ageing society implies weaker demand for
assets, in particular housing. Research on the relationship between house prices
and demographic variables suggests that demographic factors could dampen
house prices by reducing property price growth considerably over the coming
decades (blue bars in Graph IV.7).10  If so, this would partially reverse the effect of
demographic tailwinds that pushed up house prices in previous decades (red bars).
Debt service ratios also point to current debt levels being on the high side.
High debt servicing costs (interest payments plus amortisations) compared with
income effectively limit the amount of debt that borrowers can carry. This is clearly
true for individuals. Lenders, for example, often refuse to provide new loans
to households if future interest payments and amortisations exceed a certain
threshold, often around 30–40% of their income. But the relationship also holds in
the aggregate.
Empirically, aggregate debt service ratios fluctuate around stable historical
averages (Graph IV.B), which can be taken as rough approximations for long-term
sustainable (steady state) levels. High private sector debt service costs relative to
income will result in less credit being extended, eventually translating into falling
aggregate debt service costs. Conversely, low debt service ratios give borrowers
ample room to take on more debt. Hence, over time economy-wide debt service
ratios gravitate back to steady state levels.11

In all but a handful of countries, bringing debt service ratios back to historical
norms would require substantial reductions in credit-to-GDP ratios (Graph IV.8).
Even at the current unusually low interest rates, credit-to-GDP ratios would have to
be roughly 15 percentage points lower on average for debt service ratios to be at
their historical norms. And if lending rates were to rise by 250 basis points, in line
with the 2004 tightening episode, the necessary reductions in credit-to-GDP ratios
would swell to over 25 percentage points on average. In China, credit-to-GDP ratios
would have to fall by more than 60 percentage points. Even the United Kingdom
and the United States would need to reduce credit-to-GDP ratios by around
20 percentage points, despite having debt service ratios in line with long-term
averages at current interest rates.

How can economies bring debt back to sustainable levels?
Downward pressures from lower wealth and high debt service burdens suggest that
many economies will have to lower their debt levels in the years to come. This can
happen through several channels. The first, and least painful, channel is through
output growth, which has the dual effect of reducing credit-to-GDP and debt
service ratios and also supports higher asset prices. The muted growth outlook in
many economies (Chapter III) is not particularly reassuring from this perspective.
Inflation can also have an effect. But the extent to which it reduces the real debt
burden depends on how much interest rates on outstanding and new debt adjust to
higher price increases. More importantly, though, even if successful from this narrow
perspective, it also has major side effects. Inflation redistributes wealth arbitrarily
between borrowers and savers and risks unanchoring inflation expectations, with
unwelcome long-run consequences.
The alternative to growing out of debt is to reduce the outstanding stock of
debt. This happens when the amortisation rate exceeds the take-up of new loans.
This is a natural and important channel of adjustment, but may not be enough. In
some cases, unsustainable debt burdens have to be tackled directly, for instance

Debt service ratios are assumed to be sustainable if they return to country-specific long-run averages. Averages are taken since 1985 or
later depending on data availability and when five-year average inflation fell below 10% (for Russia and Turkey, the last 10 years are taken).
The necessary change in the credit-to-GDP ratio is calculated by using equation (1) in Box IV.B and keeping maturities constant.

through writedowns. Admittedly, this means that somebody has to bear the ensuing
losses, but experience shows that such an approach may be less painful than the
alternatives. For example, the Nordic countries addressed their high and
unsustainable debt levels after the banking crises of the early 1990s by forcing
banks to recognise losses and deal decisively with bad assets, including through
disposals. In addition, authorities reduced excess capacity in the financial system
and recapitalised banks subject to tough viability tests. This provided a solid basis
for recovery, which came relatively quickly.12
Reducing debt levels through writedowns may require important changes in
the regulatory framework in a number of countries. As argued in the 82nd Annual
Report (in the box in Chapter III), reducing household debt requires two main steps.
First, authorities need to induce lenders to recognise losses. Second, they should
create incentives for lenders to restructure loans so that borrowers have a realistic
chance of repaying their debt.13
The impact of interest rates is ambiguous. In principle, lower interest rates
can reduce debt service burdens. Lower rates may also provide support to asset
prices. In fact, monetary authorities have typically cut interest rates in the wake of
financial crises, thus reducing the debt service burden on households and firms.

Estimating debt service ratios

Box IV.B

This box details the construction of debt service ratios (DSRs) and some of the technicalities underlying Graphs IV.8
and IV.9.
Calculating economy-wide DSRs involves estimation and calibration, as detailed loan-level data are generally
not available. We use the methodology outlined in Drehmann and Juselius (2012), who in turn follow an approach
developed by the Federal Reserve Board to construct debt service ratios for the household sector (Dynan et
al (2003)). We start with the basic assumption that, for a given lending rate, debt service costs – interest and
repayments – on the aggregate debt stock are repaid in equal portions over the maturity of the loan (instalment
loans). By using the standard formula for calculating the fixed debt service costs (DSC) of an instalment loan and
dividing it by GDP, we can calculate the DSR at time t as

where Dt denotes the aggregate stock of debt to the private non-financial sector as reported by the BIS, Yt
quarterly GDP, it the average interest rate per quarter, and st the average remaining maturity in quarters (ie for a
five-year average remaining maturity st = 20).
While credit and GDP are readily observable, this is generally not the case for the average interest rate and
average remaining maturities. For data availability reasons, we proxy the average interest rates on the entire stock of
debt with the average interest rates on loans from monetary and financial institutions to the non-financial private
sector. This assumes that the evolution of interest rates from bank and non-bank lenders is similar, which seems
reasonable. For a few countries, mainly in central and eastern Europe and emerging Asia, no lending rates are
available. We proxy them with the short-term money market rate plus the average markup between lending rates
and the money market rates across countries. Drawing on the few available sources, we approximate remaining
maturities, but this remains crude. Particularly in the earlier parts of the sample, it may well be the case that
maturities were lower, and DSRs thus higher, given higher inflation rates and shorter life expectancy.
The historical averages may be biased downwards and thus the deleveraging needs shown in Graph IV.8
upwards. But the bias is likely to be small, as changes in the maturity parameter have limited effects on the estimated
DSR trends. Furthermore, estimates for the US household sector lead to similar DSRs to those published by the
Federal Reserve, which are based on much more granular data. Levels are also generally comparable across
countries, and the derived DSRs exhibit long-run swings around country-specific historical averages, indicating that
these are realistic benchmarks.
Comparing the evolution of DSRs with that of lending rates and credit-to-GDP ratios shows that falling interest
rates allowed the private sector to sustain higher debt levels relative to GDP (Graph IV.B). From 1985 onwards, debtto-GDP ratios in the United Kingdom and the United States increased substantially, even after taking into account
the fall in the wake of the financial crisis. At the same time, lending rates decreased from more than 10% to around
3% now. The combined effect implies that DSRs fluctuate around long-run historical averages.
To construct projections of the DSR for different interest rate scenarios (Graph IV.9), we estimate the joint
dynamics of lending rates and credit-to-GDP ratios using a standard vector autoregression (VAR) process. In
addition to these two variables, we include real residential property prices as an endogenous variable to control
for changes in collateral values, which may allow agents to increase their leverage. The short-term money
market rate enters exogenously. Using the estimated VAR, credit-to-GDP, average lending rates and real property
prices are then projected based on different scenarios for the money market rate. Assuming maturities remain
constant, the resulting credit-to-GDP ratios and lending rates are then transformed into the DSRs shown in
Graph IV.9.
Four interest rate scenarios are considered, all of which start in the second quarter of 2014 and end in the
fourth quarter of 2017. In the first, money market rates evolve in line with market-implied short rates. In the second
scenario, absolute changes in money market rates follow those observed in each country during the tightening
episode that began in June 2004, and are fixed once the maximum is reached. Third, interest rates are raised to their
country-specific long-run averages over eight quarters, and remain constant thereafter. In the fourth scenario,
interest rates are kept constant from the second quarter of 2014 onwards.
The results highlight that debt service burdens are likely to increase, or at least not decrease, even taking into
account several caveats. For instance, the confidence intervals of the projections increase with the horizon and
become fairly large by 2017, but even they do not suggest any substantial decrease. Furthermore, the VAR is

estimated using a sample from the first quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 2013. Thus, the projections are
based on mostly normal relationships, which may not be accurate during periods of financial stress or balance sheet
recessions, when excessive leverage may imply that credit-to-GDP ratios become unresponsive to interest rates. The
VAR framework also assumes that increases or decreases in money market rates are passed on symmetrically to
lending rates. If borrowers have locked in current low rates and rates rise, the increase in the DSRs may be less
pronounced than shown but still more than in the constant rate scenario, as new borrowers have to pay higher rates.

  M Drehmann and M Juselius, “Do debt service costs affect macroeconomic and financial stability?”, BIS Quarterly Review, September
2012, pp 21–35; and K Dynan, K Johnson and K Pence, “Recent changes to a measure of US household debt service”, Federal Reserve
Bulletin, vol 89, no 10, October 2003, pp 417–26.      The justification is that the differences between the repayment structures of
individual loans will tend to cancel out in the aggregate. For example, consider 10 loans of equal size for which the entire principal is due at
maturity (bullet loans), each with 10 repayment periods and taken out in successive years over a decade. After 10 periods, when the first
loan falls due, the flow of repayments on these 10 loans jointly will be indistinguishable from the repayment of a single instalment loan of the
same size. Typically, a large share of private sector loans in most countries will in any case be instalment loans, eg household sector mortgage
credit.      See the BIS database on total credit to the private non-financial sector (www.bis.org/statistics/credtopriv.htm).      These series
are typically only recorded for the past decade or so, but can be extended further back using a weighted average of various household and
business lending interest rates, including the rates on mortgage, consumption and investment loans.      We take only long-run averages
as proxies for long-run sustainable levels of DSRs for Graph IV.8, after inflation has fallen persistently below 10%.      Projected increases in
DSRs are somewhat larger if inflation is included in the VAR as an endogenous variable. Inflation was not included for the results shown in
Graph IV.9, to base the projections on the most parsimonious system.

Unfortunately, however, low interest rates can also have the perverse effect of
incentivising borrowers to take on even more debt, making an eventual rise in rates
even more costly if debt continues to grow. Depending on initial conditions, low
rates could therefore lead countries into a debt trap: debt burdens that already seem
unsustainable now may grow even further.
Scenario analysis suggests that a debt trap is not just a remote possibility for
some countries. The analysis is based on a model capturing the joint dynamics of
credit-to-GDP ratios, interest rates and property prices (Box IV.B). Graph IV.9 shows
the estimated future trajectories for debt ratios and property prices for four interest
rate scenarios for the United Kingdom and the United States. The estimated
trajectories look similar for other economies, such as Korea or Brazil.

Scenarios are: (i) market-implied: interest rates evolve in line with market-implied rates; (ii) 2004 tightening: absolute changes in interest
rates follow the 2004 tightening episode in advanced economies; (iii) rapid tightening: interest rates are tightened to their country-specific
long-run averages over eight quarters; and (iv) constant rates: interest rates are kept constant. Debt service burdens are measured by the
debt service ratio. Historical average since 1985. Projections are based on a simple vector autoregression (VAR) model capturing the joint
dynamics of credit-to-GDP ratios, lending rates, money market rates and real residential property prices (Box IV.B).

Sources: National data; BIS; BIS calculations.

The scenarios highlight that debt service burdens would increase in some
countries irrespective of whether policy rates rose or remained low. At one extreme,
a reversion of money market rates to historical averages would push debt service
burdens to levels close to the historical maxima seen on the eve of the crisis. But
debt service burdens would also grow at the other extreme, if interest rates remained
at the current low levels. Whereas costs on the current stock of debt would remain
constant, further borrowing by households and firms would push up aggregate
debt service costs in this scenario.
To be sure, this scenario analysis is only illustrative. Moreover, it is based on the
assumption that interest rates rise independently of macroeconomic conditions:
presumably, central banks would not raise them unless the outlook for output was
favourable. However, the scenarios examined do point to the tensions embedded
in the current situation.
The conclusion is simple: low interest rates do not solve the problem of high
debt. They may keep service costs low for some time, but by encouraging rather
than discouraging the accumulation of debt they amplify the effect of the eventual
normalisation. Avoiding the debt trap requires policies that encourage the orderly
running-down of debt through balance sheet repair and, above all, raise the longrun growth prospects of the economy (Chapters I and III).

V. Monetary policy struggles to normalise

Monetary policy globally remained very accommodative over the past year as policy
rates stayed low and central bank balance sheets expanded further. Central banks
in the major advanced economies continued to face an unusually sluggish recovery
despite prolonged extraordinary monetary easing. This suggests that monetary policy
has been relatively ineffective in boosting a recovery from a balance sheet recession.
Emerging market economies and small open advanced economies struggled to
deal with spillovers from monetary ease in the major advanced economies. They
have also kept their policy rates very low, which has contributed to the build-up of
financial vulnerabilities. This dynamic suggests that monetary policy should play a
greater role as a complement to macroprudential measures when dealing with
financial imbalances. It also points to shortcomings in the international monetary
system, as global monetary policy spillovers are not sufficiently internalised.
Many central banks faced unexpected disinflationary pressures in the past year,
which represent a negative surprise for those in debt and raise the spectre of deflation.
However, risks of widespread deflation appear very low: central banks see inflation
returning to target over time and longer-term inflation expectations remaining well
anchored. Moreover, the supply side nature of the disinflation pressures has
generally been consistent with the pickup in global economic activity. The monetary
policy stance needs to carefully take into account the persistence and supply side
nature of the disinflationary forces as well as the side effects of policy ease.
The prospect is now clearer that central banks in the major advanced
economies are at different distances from normalising policy and hence will exit at
different times from their extraordinary accommodation. Navigating the transition
is likely to be complex and bumpy, regardless of communication efforts; and partly
for those reasons, the risk of normalising too late and too gradually should not be
underestimated.
This chapter reviews the past year’s developments in monetary policy and then
explores four key challenges that policy faces: low effectiveness; spillovers;
unexpected disinflation; and the risk of falling behind the curve during the exit.

Recent monetary policy developments
Over the past 12 months, nominal and real policy rates remained very low globally,
and central bank balance sheets continued to expand up to year-end 2013
(Graph V.1). On average, the major advanced economies maintained real policy
rates at less than –1.0%. In the rest of the world, real policy rates were not much
higher: in a group of small open advanced economies (which we refer to hereafter
as small advanced economies) – Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden
and Switzerland – and in the emerging market economies (EMEs) we survey here,
real rates were only marginally above zero. The expansion of central bank assets
slowed somewhat between 2012 and mid-2013 and then accelerated in the second
half of 2013.
This extraordinary policy ease has now been in place for about six years
(Graph V.1). Interest rates fell sharply in early 2009. Central bank assets began to
grow rapidly in 2007, and they have more than doubled since then, to an
unprecedented total of more than $20 trillion (more than 30% of global GDP). The

increase has reflected large-scale asset purchases and the accumulation of foreign
exchange reserves.
Central banks in major advanced economies kept nominal policy rates near the
zero lower bound and real rates negative (Graph V.2) even as signs of an improvement
in growth accumulated during the past 12 months.1 In the euro area, where economic
activity has been weak, the ECB halved its main refinancing rate in November, to
25 basis points, and cut it further to 15 basis points in June, given concerns about
low inflation and currency appreciation. The ECB’s latest move took its deposit rate
to 10 basis points below zero.
The central banks of the euro area, the United Kingdom and the United States
have relied heavily on various forms of forward guidance to convey their intention
to keep policy rates low well into the future (Box V.A). The ECB adopted qualitative
forward guidance in July 2013, saying that it would keep policy rates low for an
extended period. In August 2013, the Bank of England introduced threshold-based
forward guidance, linking the low policy rate environment to criteria about the
unemployment rate, inflation projections and expectations, and risks to financial
stability. This new type of guidance was similar in many ways to the approach taken
in December 2012 by the Federal Reserve, which also emphasised thresholds for
unemployment and inflation. In early 2014, as the forward guidance thresholds for
unemployment were being approached in the United Kingdom and the United
States faster than anticipated, central banks in both those countries made their
guidance more qualitative, featuring a broader notion of economic slack.

The trajectories of central bank balance sheets in the major advanced
economies diverged in the past year (Graph V.2, right-hand panel). The Bank of
England and the Federal Reserve gradually shifted away from balance sheet
expansion as the primary means of providing additional stimulus. In August 2013,
the Bank of England announced that it would maintain the stock of its purchased
assets at £375 billion, subject to the same conditions as its forward guidance on
policy rates. In December 2013, the Federal Reserve announced it would gradually
dial back its large-scale asset purchases starting in January. The pace of this tapering
has been smooth since then, but the lead-up to the December announcement
proved to be a communication challenge (Chapter II). At the time of writing,
markets expect the purchase programme to conclude before year-end 2014.
In contrast, in April 2013, the Bank of Japan announced its Quantitative and
Qualitative Easing (QQE) programme as a principal means of overcoming Japan’s
legacy of protracted deflation. Its balance sheet expanded rapidly thereafter, rising
from less than 35% of GDP to more than 50% by early 2014.
Reflecting improved euro area financial conditions, the ECB’s balance sheet
shrank relative to GDP as banks scaled back their use of central bank funding,
including through the ECB’s longer-term refinancing operations. And to date, the
ECB has not activated its Outright Monetary Transactions programme (large-scale
purchases of sovereign bonds in secondary markets under strict conditionality).
However, in early June, the ECB announced that it would initiate targeted longerterm refinancing operations later this year to support bank lending to households
and non-financial corporations. In addition, the ECB decided to intensify its
preparatory work related to outright purchases in the asset-backed securities market.
Policy rates in the small advanced economies also remained very low
(Graph V.3, left-hand panel). The Bank of Canada left its policy rate at 1.0% and
adjusted its forward guidance, pushing back the prospective date of a modest
withdrawal of accommodation. With headline inflation in Switzerland remaining
around zero or less, the Swiss National Bank kept the range of its policy rate for
three-month Libor unchanged at 0–25 basis points and maintained its exchange
rate ceiling against the euro. The Central Bank of Norway kept rates at 1.5% as
disinflationary pressures abated over the course of the year. A few central banks in

this group changed their policy rates. To support recovery, the Reserve Bank of
Australia twice cut its rate to reach 2.5%. Sveriges Riksbank lowered its policy rate
by 25 basis points, to 75 basis points, against the background of inflation that
was persistently below target. In contrast, on evidence of increased economic
momentum and expectations of rising inflation pressures, the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand raised its rate three times, for a total of 75 basis points, to reach 3.25%.
Overall, central bank policies in many of the small advanced economies were
strongly influenced by the evolution of inflation rates: on average they had fallen
short of targets by almost 1 percentage point since early 2012 (Graph V.3, centre
panel), and lingering disinflation led many central banks to mark down inflation
forecasts.
Moreover, many of these central banks had to balance the short-term
macroeconomic effects of low inflation and a lacklustre recovery against the longerterm risks of building up financial imbalances (Chapter IV). Household debt, which
was high and rising, reached an average of roughly 175% of net disposable income
by end-2013 (Graph V.3, right-hand panel). Those elevated levels, and the prospect
of even further debt increases encouraged by accommodative monetary policies,
made these economies vulnerable to a sharp deterioration in economic and
financial conditions. In those jurisdictions in which house prices were high, the risk
of a disorderly adjustment of household sector imbalances could not be ruled out.
In EMEs, central banks had to contend with various monetary policy challenges
after a strong post-crisis recovery, which has weakened recently. One such challenge
came from bouts of financial market volatility associated with depreciation
pressures during the year (Chapter II). In general, their past strong macroeconomic
performance had helped to insulate many EMEs from the fallout and afforded them
some room for manoeuvre, but only up to a point. Most affected were countries
with weaker economic and financial conditions. In many of them, central banks
used the policy rate to defend their currencies (Graph V.4, left-hand panel). Between
April 2013 and early June 2014, several central banks tightened considerably on
net: in Turkey, by 400 basis points, including a 550 basis point hike in one day in

Forward guidance at the zero lower bound

The objective of central banks’ forward guidance at the zero lower bound has been to clarify their intended path for
the policy rate. Such guidance can itself provide stimulus when it reveals that policy rates are likely to remain low for
a period longer than markets had expected. Forward guidance can also reduce uncertainty, thereby dampening
interest rate volatility and, through that channel, lowering risk premia.
Forward guidance must meet three conditions to be effective. First, forward guidance must be clear. In
principle, clarity can be enhanced by spelling out the conditionality of the guidance. However, if the conditionality is
too complex, explicit details may be confusing. Second, forward guidance must be seen as a credible commitment,
ie the public must believe what the central bank says. The stronger the public’s belief, the bigger is the likely impact
of the guidance on market expectations and economic decisions, but the greater also is the risk of an undesirable
reduction in central bank flexibility. Finally, even if it is understood and believed, the guidance must be interpreted
by the public as intended. For instance, communicating the intention to keep policy rates at the zero lower bound
Graphs for Box:
for longer than the market expected may be mistakenly seen as signalling a more pessimistic economic outlook, in
which case negative confidence effects could counteract the intended stimulus.

The experience with forward guidance indicates that it has succeeded in influencing markets over certain
horizons. Forward guidance reduced the financial market volatility of expected interest rates at short horizons but
less so at longer horizons (Graph V.A, left-hand panel). This is consistent with the notion that markets see forward
guidance as a conditional commitment, valid only for the near-term future path of policy interest rates. There is also
evidence that forward guidance affects the sensitivity of interest rates to economic news. The responsiveness of
interest rate volatility in the euro area and the United Kingdom to US rate volatility fell considerably after the ECB
and the Bank of England adopted forward guidance in summer 2013 (Graph V.A, centre panel). There is also

BIS 84th Annual Report

89

evidence that forward guidance made markets more sensitive to indicators emphasised in the guidance. For
instance, US 10-year bond yields became more sensitive to non-farm payroll surprises beginning in 2012 (Graph V.A,
right-hand panel); one interpretation is that news reflecting a stronger recovery tended to bring forward the
expected time at which the unemployment threshold would be breached and policy rate lift-off would ensue.
Policy rate forward guidance also raises a number of risks. If the public fails to fully understand the conditionality
of the guidance, the central bank’s reputation and credibility may be at risk if the rate path is revised frequently and
substantially, even though the changes adhere to the conditionality originally announced. Forward guidance can
also give rise to financial risks in two ways. First, if financial markets become narrowly focused on it, a recalibration
of the guidance could lead to disruptive market reactions. Second, and more importantly, forward guidance could
lead to a perceived delay in the speed of monetary policy normalisation. This could encourage excessive risk-taking
and foster a build-up of financial vulnerabilities.

January; and in Russia and Indonesia, by 200 and 175 basis points, respectively.
India and South Africa raised rates by 50 basis points. Brazil boosted rates gradually
by 375 basis points over the period as currency depreciation and other forces
helped keep inflation pressures elevated. The EME policy responses to currency
depreciation appeared to reflect in part their recent inflation experience (Graph V.4,
centre panel). Where inflation was above target, depreciation pressures tended to
be stronger and policy rates rose by more. Where inflation was at or below target,
no such relationship is visible.
The monetary authorities in the EMEs less affected by capital outflows and
exchange rate pressures had more policy room to respond to other developments.
In Chile and Mexico, the central banks cut policy rates as their economies showed
signs of slowing. In the Czech Republic, the policy rate remained low as inflation fell
below target, and the central bank decided to use the exchange rate as an
additional instrument for easing monetary conditions by establishing a ceiling for
the exchange value of the koruna against the euro. Poland cut rates several times
early on as disinflationary pressures took hold. In China, the central bank maintained
its monetary policy stance with some deceleration in monetary and credit growth
as financial stability concerns grew, especially in relation to the expanding nonbank financial sector.
A number of EMEs also conducted foreign exchange operations last year to
help absorb unwelcome depreciation pressures. Nonetheless, foreign exchange
reserves for EMEs as a whole continued to increase, especially for China (Annex
Table V.1). However, in a number of EMEs, for example Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and
Thailand, foreign exchange reserves dropped; for several such economies, it was the
first reported annual decline in many years.
Credit expansion in many EMEs has been raising financial stability concerns,
especially against the backdrop of volatile financial markets. For the group of EMEs
surveyed here, the credit-to-GDP ratio rose on average by around 40% from 2007
to 2013 (Graph V.4, right-hand panel). For these central banks, questions remain about
the best mix of monetary, macroprudential and capital flow management tools.

Key monetary policy challenges

by financial crisis and an unsustainable accumulation of debt), the key challenge
has been calibrating the monetary policy stance at a time when policy appears
to have lost some of its ability to stimulate the economy. For many EMEs and small
advanced economies, the main challenge has been the build-up of financial
vulnerabilities and the risk of heightened capital flow volatility, problems
complicated by global monetary policy spillovers. Worldwide, many central banks
are struggling with the puzzling disinflationary pressures that materialised in the
past year. And looking ahead, questions arise about the timing and pace of policy
normalisation.

Low monetary policy effectiveness
Central banks played a critical role in containing the fallout from the financial crisis.
However, despite the past six years of monetary easing in the major advanced
economies, the recovery has been unusually slow (Chapter III). This raises questions
about the effectiveness of expansionary monetary policy in the wake of the crisis.
Effectiveness has been limited for two broad reasons: the zero lower bound on
the nominal policy rate, and the legacy of balance sheet recessions. First, the zero
lower bound constrains the central banks’ ability to reduce policy rates and boost
demand. This explains attempts to provide additional stimulus by managing
expectations about the future policy rate path and through large-scale asset
purchases. But those policies also have limitations. For instance, term premia and
credit risk spreads in many countries were already very low (Graph II.2): they cannot
fall much further. In addition, compressed and at times even negative term premia

reduce the profits from maturity transformation and so may actually reduce banks’
incentives to grant credit. Moreover, the scope for negative nominal interest rates is
very limited and their effectiveness uncertain. The impact on lending is doubtful,
and the small room for reductions diminishes the effect on the exchange rate, which
in turn depends also on the reaction of others. In general, at the zero lower bound,
providing additional stimulus becomes increasingly hard.
Second, the legacy of balance sheet recessions numbs policy effectiveness.
Some of this has to do with financial factors. When the financial sector is impaired,
the supply of credit is less responsive to interest rate cuts. And the demand for
credit from non-financial sectors is sluggish – they are seeking instead to pay down
debt incurred on the basis of overly optimistic income expectations. This is why
“credit-less recoveries” are the norm in these situations (Chapter III). But some of
the legacy of balance sheet recessions has to do with non-financial factors. The
misallocations of capital and labour that go hand in hand with unsustainable
financial booms can sap the traction of demand management policies, as these
address only symptoms rather than underlying problems. For instance, the
residential construction sector would normally be more sensitive than many others
to lower interest rates, but it expanded too much during the boom. In fact, the
historical record indicates that the positive relationship between the degree of
monetary accommodation during recessions and the strength of the subsequent
recovery vanishes when the recession is associated with a financial crisis (Box V.B).
Moreover, deleveraging during the recession, regardless of how it is measured,
eventually ushers in a stronger recovery.
None of this means that monetary accommodation has no role to play in a
recovery from a balance sheet recession. A degree of accommodation was clearly
necessary in the early stages of the financial crisis to contain the fallout. But the
relative ineffectiveness of monetary policy does signify that it cannot substitute for
measures that tackle the underlying problems, promoting the necessary balance
sheet repair and structural reforms.
Unless it is recognised, limited effectiveness implies a fruitless effort to apply
the same measures more persistently or forcefully. The consequence is not only
inadequate progress but also amplification of unintended side effects, and the
aftermath of the crisis has highlighted several such side effects.2 In particular,
prolonged and aggressive easing reduces incentives to repair balance sheets and to
implement necessary structural reforms, thereby hindering the needed reallocation
of resources. It may also foster too much risk-taking in financial markets (Chapter II).
And it may generate unwelcome spillovers in other economies at different points in
their financial and business cycles (see below). Put differently, under limited policy
effectiveness, the balance between benefits and costs of prolonged monetary
accommodation has deteriorated over time.

Monetary policy spillovers
EMEs and small advanced economies have been struggling with spillovers from the
major advanced economies’ accommodative monetary policies. The spillovers work
through cross-border financial flows and asset prices (including the exchange rate)
as well as through policy responses.3

Effectiveness of monetary policy following balance sheet recessions

The historical record lends support to the view that accommodative monetary policy during a normal business cycle
downturn helps strengthen the subsequent recovery. But this relationship is not statistically significant after
downturns associated with financial crises. That is, in business cycles accompanied by crises, the relationship between
the average short-term real interest rate during a downturn and the average growth rate during the subsequent
recovery does not have the sign expected in the case of a non-crisis business cycle (Graph V.B, left-hand panel).
A possible reason is that post-crisis deleveraging pressures make an economy less interest rate-sensitive.
Indeed, the evidence suggests that, in contrast to normal recessions, a key factor that eventually leads to stronger
recoveries from balance sheet recessions is private sector deleveraging (Graph V.B, right-hand panel).

Very accommodative monetary policies in major advanced economies influence
risk-taking and therefore the yields on assets denominated in different currencies. As a
result, extraordinary accommodation can induce major adjustments in asset prices and
financial flows elsewhere. As financial markets in EMEs have developed and become
more integrated with the rest of the world, the strength of these linkages has grown.
For instance, local currency bond yields have co-moved more tightly in recent years.4
The US dollar and the other international currencies play a key role here. Since
they are widely used outside the countries of issue, they have a direct influence on

international financial conditions. For example, the amount of US dollar credit
outstanding outside the United States was roughly $7 trillion at end-2013
(Graph V.5, left-hand panel). When interest rates expressed in these currencies are
low, EME borrowers find it cheaper to borrow in them, and those who have already
borrowed at variable rates enjoy lower financing costs. Before the crisis, flows of
dollar credit in particular were driven by cross-border bank lending; since 2008,
activity in global capital markets has surged (Graph V.5, centre panel).5
Policy responses matter too. Central banks find it difficult to operate with policy
rates that are considerably different from those prevailing in the key currencies,
especially the US dollar. Concerns with exchange rate overshooting and capital
inflows make them reluctant to accept large and possibly volatile interest rate
differentials, which contributes to highly correlated short-term interest rate
movements (Graph V.5, right-hand panel). Indeed, the evidence is growing that US
policy rates significantly influence policy rates elsewhere (Box V.C).
Very low interest rates in the major advanced economies thus pose a dilemma
for other central banks. On the one hand, tying domestic policy rates to the very
low rates abroad helps mitigate currency appreciation and capital inflows. On the
other hand, it may also fuel domestic financial booms and hence encourage the
build-up of vulnerabilities. Indeed, there is evidence that those countries in which
policy rates have been lower relative to traditional benchmarks, which take account
of output and inflation developments, have also seen the strongest credit booms
(Chapter IV).

Impact of US monetary policy on EME policy rates: evidence from Taylor rules

One way to assess the impact of US monetary policy on EME policy rates is to estimate augmented Taylor rules for
individual EMEs. The policy rate of each sample economy is modelled as a function of the domestic inflation rate,
the domestic output gap and the “shadow” policy rate of the United States. The shadow rate is designed to
capture the impact of the Federal Reserve’s unconventional monetary policy measures, such as its large-scale asset
purchase programmes. The sample covers 20 EMEs from Q1 2000 to Q3 2013.
The impact of US monetary policy is found to be statistically significant for 16 of 20 EMEs. Since 2012, easier
US monetary policy has been associated with an average reduction of 150 basis points in EME policy rates (Graph V.C,
left-hand panel), although the impact has varied substantially across economies and time. The response of EME
policy rates to inflation was often weaker than the prescription of the conventional Taylor rule. These results are
consistent with the finding that EME policy rates have, over the past decade, run below the level suggested by
domestic macroeconomic conditions as captured in standard Taylor rules (Graph V.C, right-hand panel).
Although the findings are statistically robust and consistent with the findings of other studies, they should
be interpreted with caution. Measuring unobservable variables, such as the output gap, is fraught with difficulties.
Even the policy rate might not be an accurate measure of monetary conditions because EME central banks have
increasingly used non-interest rate measures to affect monetary conditions. And even if representative for EME
central banks as a group, the results do not necessarily apply to any given central bank.

To address this dilemma, central banks have relied extensively on macroprudential
tools. These tools have proved very helpful in increasing the resilience of the financial
system, but they have been only partially effective in restraining the build-up of
financial imbalances (Chapter IV and Box VI.D). A key reason is that, as in the case of
capital flow management measures, macroprudential tools are vulnerable to regulatory
arbitrage. The implication is that relying exclusively on macroprudential measures is
not sufficient and monetary policy must generally play a complementary role. In
contrast to macroprudential tools, the policy rate is an economy-wide determinant of
the price of leverage in a given currency, so its impact is more pervasive and less
easily evaded. Countries using monetary policy more forcefully as a complement to
macroprudential policy need to accept a greater degree of exchange rate flexibility.
Failing to rely on monetary policy can raise even more serious challenges down
the road. Allowing the financial imbalances to build over time would exacerbate a
country’s vulnerability to an unwinding, thereby imposing greater damage and,
most likely, precipitating an external crisis as well. But if they do not unwind and the
country is hit by an external shock, the central bank will find it very hard to raise
interest rates without generating the financial stress it was trying to avoid in the first
place. Full-blown financial busts have not as yet occurred in EMEs or small advanced
economies, but countries in which credit growth had been relatively high proved
more vulnerable to the May–June 2013 period of market tensions (Chapter II). This
indicates that a more gradual but early tightening is superior to a delayed but
abrupt one later on – delayed responses cause a more wrenching adjustment.
Disruptive monetary policy spillovers have highlighted shortcomings in the
international monetary system. Ostensibly, it has proved hard for major advanced
economies to fully take these spillovers into account. Should financial booms turn
to bust, the costs for the global economy could prove to be quite large, not least
since the economic weight of the countries affected has increased substantially.
Capturing these spillovers remains a major challenge: it calls for analytical frameworks
in which financial factors have a much greater role than they are accorded in policy
institutions nowadays and for a better understanding of global linkages.

Unexpected disinflation and the risks of deflation
Many central banks faced unexpected disinflationary pressures in the past year; as
a result, inflation fell or remained below their objectives. The pressures were
particularly surprising in the advanced economies because the long-awaited
recovery seemed to be gaining traction (Chapter III). A key monetary policy challenge
has been how best to respond to such pressures.
Generally, all else equal, inflation unexpectedly below objectives would call for
an easier monetary policy stance. However, the appropriate response depends on a
number of additional factors. Especially important are the perceived costs and
benefits of disinflation. Another factor, as noted above, is the evidence suggesting
that the effectiveness of expansionary monetary policy is limited at the zero lower
bound, especially during the recovery from a balance sheet recession.
Recent developments indicate that the likelihood of persistent disinflationary
pressures is low. Long-term inflation expectations (six to 10 years ahead) have been
well anchored up to the time of writing (Graph V.6), which suggests that shortfalls of
inflation from objectives could be transitory. Under such conditions, wage inflation
and price inflation are less likely to reinforce each other – ie so-called second-round
effects would not operate. For example, the decline in commodity prices from
recent historical highs has contributed to the disinflationary pressures in the past
few years. Even if these prices stabilise at current levels rather than bounce back, as
appears to be the case at the time of writing, the disinflationary pressures would

wane. This is exactly the same reasoning that induced some central banks to accept
inflation persistently above policy objectives in previous years. Of course, if inflation
expectations become less firmly anchored, disinflationary pressures would become
a more significant concern.
Even if the unexpected disinflationary pressures are prolonged, the costs may be
less than commonly thought. The source of the pressures matters. When they arise
from positive supply side developments rather than deficient demand, the associated
costs are known to be lower. Recent disinflationary pressures in part reflect such
positive supply side forces, especially the greater cross-border competition that has
been stoked by the ongoing globalisation of the real economy (Chapter III).
The analysis regarding shortfalls in inflation also applies to outright and
persistent price declines, and so far, for much the same reasons, central banks have
judged the risk of deflation as negligible. In fact, the historical record indicates that
deflationary spirals have been exceptional and that deflationary periods, especially
mild ones, have been consistent with sustained economic growth (Box V.D). Some
countries in recent decades have indeed experienced growth with disinflation, no
doubt because of the influence of positive supply side factors.
Nonetheless, given currently high levels of debt, should the possibility of falling
prices be more of a concern? Without question, large debts make generalised price
declines more costly. Unless interest rates in existing contracts adjust by the same
amount, all else equal, falling prices raise the burden of debt relative to income.
Historically, however, the damage caused by falling asset prices has proven much
more costly than general declines in the cost of goods and services: given the range
of fluctuations, falling asset prices simply have had a much larger impact on net
worth and the real economy (Box V.D). For instance, the problems in Japan arose
first and foremost from the sharp drop in asset prices, especially property prices, as
the financial boom turned to bust, not from a broad, gradual disinflation.

The costs of deflation: what does the historical record say?

Deflations are not all alike. Owing to the prevalence of price declines in the 19th and early 20th centuries as well as
since the 1990s, the historical record can reveal important features of deflation dynamics. Four stand out.
First, the record is replete with examples of “good”, or at least “benign”, deflations in the sense that they
coincided with output either rising along trend or undergoing only a modest and temporary setback. In the preWorld War I period, deflation episodes were generally of the benign type, with real GDP continuing to expand
when prices declined (Graph V.D, left-hand panel). Average real growth in the five years up to the peak in the
price level was roughly similar to the growth rate in the five years after the peak (2.3% vs 2.1%). In the early
interwar period (mainly in the 1920s), the number of somewhat more costly (“bad”) deflations increased (Graph V.D,
centre panel): output still rose, but much more slowly – the average rates in the pre- and post-peak periods
were 2.3% and 1.2%, respectively. (Perceptions of truly severe deflations during the interwar period are
dominated by the exceptional experience of the Great Depression, when prices in the G10 economies fell
cumulatively up to roughly 20% and output contracted by about 10%. That experience is not fully reflected in
Graph V.D, centre panel.)

The deflation episodes during the past two and a half decades have, on average, been much more akin to the
good types experienced during the pre-World War I period than to those of the early interwar period (although
identifying peaks in the price level during this period is much more difficult than in the earlier periods because the
recent deflations tend to be fleeting). For the most recent episodes, the average rates of GDP growth in the preand post-peak periods were 3.6% and 3.1%, respectively, a difference that is not statistically significant.

98

BIS 84th Annual Report

The second important feature of deflation dynamics revealed by the historical record is the general absence of
an inherent deflation spiral risk – only the Great Depression episode featured a deflation spiral in the form of a
strong and persistent decline in the price level; the other episodes did not. During the pre-World War I episodes,
price drops were persistent but not large, with an average cumulative decline in the consumer price index of about
7%. More recently, deflation episodes have been very short-lived, with the price level falling mildly; the notable
exception is Japan, where price levels fell cumulatively by roughly 4% from the late 1990s until very recently. The
evidence, especially in recent decades, argues against the notion that deflations lead to vicious deflation spirals. In
addition, the fact that wages are less flexible today than they were in the distant past reduces the likelihood of a
self-reinforcing downward spiral of wages and prices.
Third, it is asset price deflations rather than general deflations that have consistently and significantly harmed
macroeconomic performance. Indeed, both the Great Depression in the United States and the Japanese deflation
of the 1990s were preceded by a major collapse in equity prices and, especially, property prices. These observations
suggest that the chain of causality runs primarily from asset price deflation to real economic downturn, and then to
deflation, rather than from general deflation to economic activity. This notion is also supported by the trajectories
of prices and real output during the interwar period (Graph V.D, centre panel), which show that real GDP tended to
contract before deflation set in.
Fourth, recent deflation episodes have often gone hand in hand with rising asset prices, credit expansion and
strong output performance. Examples include episodes in the 1990s and 2000s in countries as distinct as China and
Norway. There is a risk that easy monetary policy in response to good deflations, aiming to bring inflation closer to
target, could inadvertently accommodate the build-up of financial imbalances. Such resistance to “good” deflations
can, over time, lead to “bad” deflations if the imbalances eventually unwind in a disruptive manner.

  For formal evidence on this point, see C Goodhart and B Hofmann, House prices and the macroeconomy, Oxford University Press, 2006,

Chapter 5, “Goods and asset price deflations”.

More generally, financial stability concerns call into question the wisdom of
seeking to push inflation back towards its objective over the conventional two-year
horizon. Instead, allowing inflation to undershoot the target may be appropriate,
especially in those jurisdictions in which financial imbalances have been building
up (Chapter IV). All else the same, failing to do so may actually risk unwelcome
disinflationary pressures down the road as the boom turns to bust. This, along with
evidence of diminished policy effectiveness, suggests that although recent
disinflationary pressures deserve close monitoring, the factors limiting their effects
and the costs of further monetary ease should be carefully assessed.

Normalising policy
Looking ahead, the transition from extraordinary monetary ease to more normal
policy settings poses a number of unprecedented challenges. It will require deft
timing and skilful navigation of economic, financial and political factors, and hence
it will be difficult to ensure a smooth normalisation. The prospects for a bumpy exit
together with other factors suggest that the predominant risk is that central banks
will find themselves behind the curve, exiting too late or too slowly.
The central banks from the major advanced economies are at different
distances from normalising policy. The Bank of England has maintained its stock of
purchased assets since mid-2012, and in 2014 the Federal Reserve began a steady
reduction of its large-scale asset purchases as a precursor to policy rate lift-off. In
contrast, the Bank of Japan is still in the midst of its aggressive programme of
balance sheet expansion. And the ECB has just announced targeted longer-term
refinancing operations and lowered its key policy rates to unprecedented levels.
Central banks have also indicated that they will calibrate the pace of policy
normalisation on the basis of the strength of the recovery and the evolution

of various crisis-related headwinds. The Federal Reserve expects labour market
headwinds and balance sheet problems to wane over the next few years;
nonetheless, it expects that the real interest rate consistent with macroeconomic
balance (ie the natural rate) will normalise, at about 2%, only over a longer period,
in part because of a persistent surfeit of global saving. The Bank of England’s
Monetary Policy Committee has said that the natural rate is being held down by
continuing strains in the financial system and the process of repair in private and
public balance sheets. The ECB sees different headwinds. It expects bank
deleveraging and financial fragmentation, among other factors, to hold back the
recovery for several years. Overall, the gap between current market expectations of
policy rates and the trajectory of rates implied by Taylor rules (Graph V.7) may be
shaping the perception of headwinds and their persistence.
A common view today is that central banks should be extra cautious to avoid
endangering the fragile recovery. According to this view, deflation would impose
major costs, and even delaying exit would not be a major problem: inflation might
rise, but central banks could then quickly catch up. Moreover, according to this
view, careful communication, announcing any exit well in advance and making it
clear that it would be gradual, would help limit the risk of market disruptions.
This view is supported by a number of historical observations. The Federal
Reserve’s exit decision in 1994 created serious market tensions globally, whereas
the better anticipated and more gradual exit in 2004 had no such large effects.
Moreover, the gradual pace of exit in 2004 did not result in inflation increasing
beyond the central bank’s control. Indeed, this exit was designed to a considerable
extent to avoid some of the shortcomings of the 1994 process.
However, the argument urging central bank restraint focuses on inflation
and the business cycle at the expense of the financial cycle, ignores the impact
on sovereign fiscal positions and may well put too much faith in the powers of
communication. Each issue deserves some elaboration.
The argument loses some of its appeal once attention turns to concerns about
the financial cycle. Arguably, it was precisely the slow pace of the policy normalisation
after 2003 that contributed to the strong booms in credit and property prices
leading up to the financial crisis. For example, in the United States in the early
2000s, the business cycle turned and equity prices fell, but the rising phase of the
financial cycle continued (Chapter IV). Today, several developments deserve close
attention: the signs of a global search for yield (Chapter II); the risk of financial
imbalances building up in some regions of the world (Chapter IV); and the high
interest rate sensitivity of private sector debt burdens, as debt levels have failed to
adjust relative to output (Chapter IV).
A very slow pace of normalisation also raises issues about the impacts on fiscal
sustainability. One such impact is indirect. Keeping interest rates unusually low for
an unusually long period provides an opportunity to consolidate strained fiscal
positions, but more often than not it lulls governments into a false sense of security
that delays the needed consolidation.
Another impact is more direct, but not very visible. Wherever central banks
engage in large purchases of sovereign or quasi-sovereign debt (financed naturally
with short-term claims), they shorten the debt maturity profile of the consolidated
public sector balance sheet, which comprises the central bank and the government.
This raises the sensitivity of the debt service burden to changes in short-term
interest rates. It may also lead to political economy pressures on the central bank to
refrain from normalising policy at the appropriate time and pace, ie the risk of fiscal
dominance. The government will no doubt dislike seeing its budget position
deteriorate; in that context, the losses that are likely to be incurred by the central
bank could put its room for manoeuvre and even its autonomy at risk. In addition,

the liability costs associated with the bloated central bank balance sheets raise
other political economy challenges. For instance, the remuneration on liquiditydraining facilities may benefit the financial sector, which might be perceived by the
public as inappropriate. One option to keep the remuneration costs lower could be
to rely on unremunerated reserve requirements.
Finally, communication has its limitations. Central banks want to communicate
clearly to avoid surprising the markets and generating sharp price reactions. But
efforts to be clear may imply greater assurance than the central bank wishes to
convey and encourage further risk-taking. As risk spreads narrow, increasingly more
leveraged positions are required to squeeze out returns. And even if no leverage is
involved, investors will be lured into increasingly risky and possibly illiquid assets.
The process, therefore, raises the likelihood of a sharp snap-back.6 Moreover, even
if the central bank becomes aware of such risks, it may nonetheless be very
reluctant to take actions that might precipitate a destabilising adjustment. A vicious
circle can develop. In the end, if the central bank is perceived as being behind the
curve, it may well be the markets that react first.
All this suggests that the risk of central banks normalising too late and too
gradually should not be underestimated. There are very strong and all too natural
incentives pushing in that direction. Another symptom of this bias concerns central
banks’ quantitative easing programmes, in which they bought long-term assets on
an unprecedented scale to push term premia down. But now, as the time for policy
normalisation approaches, they appear hesitant to actively sell those assets out of
concerns about disrupting markets.

VI. The financial system at a crossroads

Nearly six years after the apex of the financial crisis, the financial sector is still coping
with its aftermath. Financial firms find themselves at a crossroads. Shifting attitudes
towards risk in the choice of business models will influence the sector’s future
profile. The speed of adjustment will be key to the financial sector again becoming
a facilitator of economic growth.
The banking sector has made progress in healing its wounds, but balance sheet
repair is incomplete. Even though the sector has strengthened its aggregate capital
position with retained earnings, progress has not been uniform. Sustainable
profitability will thus be critical to completing the job. Accordingly, many banks
have adopted more conservative business models promising greater earnings
stability and have partly withdrawn from capital market activities.
Looking forward, high indebtedness is the main source of banks’ vulnerability.
Banks that have failed to adjust post-crisis face lingering balance sheet weaknesses
from direct exposure to overindebted borrowers and the drag of debt overhang on
economic recovery (Chapters III and IV). The situation is most acute in Europe, but
banks there have stepped up efforts in the past year. Banks in economies less
affected by the crisis but at a late financial boom phase must prepare for a
slowdown and for dealing with higher non-performing assets.
The role of non-bank financial firms has grown as market-based intermediation
has gained in importance following banks’ retrenchment. Low policy rates and a
continuing search for yield have encouraged private bond issuance, while banks
have faced a persistent cost disadvantage relative to their corporate clients. The
portfolios of asset management companies (AMCs) have soared over the past few
years, and AMCs are now a major source of credit. This, together with high size
concentration in the sector, may influence bond market dynamics, with implications
for the cost and availability of funding for businesses and households.
The chapter is organised in three sections. The first section discusses financial
sector performance over the past year. The second focuses on structural changes
that have been shaping business models. The third explores the near-term challenges
institutions face, some in dealing with legacy losses, others in strengthening their
defences in view of a possible turn in the financial cycle.

Overview of trends
On aggregate, the financial sector has made progress in overcoming the crisis and
adjusting to the new economic and regulatory environment. Banks are building
capital faster than planned, and their profitability is improving. In some countries,
however, problems with asset quality and earnings persist. The picture in the
insurance sector is similar, with generally robust premium growth but an uneven
return on equity across jurisdictions.

Banks
Key trends for banks include stronger capital positions and a reduction in riskweighted assets (RWA). The sector has made progress in rebuilding its capital base
primarily through retained earnings, supported by a recovery in profitability. This

progress has not been uniform, however, as some banks (especially in Europe)
remain under strain. The reduction in RWA reflected in some cases outright balance
sheet shrinkage but in many others a decline in the average risk weight of assets.
Given banks’ track record of overly optimistic risk reporting, the latter driver raises
concerns about hidden vulnerabilities.

Capital ratios
Banks worldwide have continued to boost their capital ratios. Thus far, progress for
the sector as a whole has exceeded the minimum pace implied in the Basel III
phase-in arrangements (Box VI.A). In the year to mid-2013, large internationally
active banks, as a group, increased their average Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
capital from 8.5% of risk-weighted assets to 9.5% (Table VI.1). This average ratio
comfortably exceeded the 2019 benchmark of 7% (CET1 plus conservation buffer)
six years ahead of schedule. Smaller, more regionally oriented banks reached the
same average capital ratio, albeit starting from a higher base of 8.8%. Importantly,
these ratios reflect the more stringent new definitions of eligible capital that are
being phased in and will come fully into force only in 2022.
Progress is also evident in the shrinking capital shortfall of those banks that are
lagging. At mid-2013, this shortfall was €85.2 billion, or €59.6 billion lower than at
the beginning of that year. This reduction was primarily due to gains made by large
internationally active banks, which almost halved their shortfall. By contrast, the
shortfall of smaller banks edged slightly higher, but was still less than half the amount
for their larger peers. For comparison, in 2013, the two groups of banks recorded
combined annual profits (after tax and before distributions) of €482 billion, more
than four times the capital shortfall.
Increases in bank capital have provided the main boost to regulatory ratios.
Graph VI.1 (left-hand panel), using data from public financial statements, decomposes
changes in the ratios of common equity to risk-weighted assets. Increases in eligible
capital (left-hand panel, yellow bar segments) made the largest contribution overall,
and especially for banks in emerging market economies (EMEs) and for systemically
important institutions (not shown).
Retained earnings played a key role in supplying fresh capital (Graph VI.1, righthand panel). In aggregate, they account for 2.8 points out of the 4.1 percentage point
increase in banks’ capital-to-RWA ratio between 2009 and 2013. Correspondingly, the
ratio of earnings paid out as dividends declined by almost 13 percentage points to
33%. Banks from advanced economies reduced this ratio by more than 12 percentage
points. In the United States, the decline in banks’ dividend payout ratio contrasted
with the behaviour of government-sponsored enterprises, the main underwriters of
mortgage loans. Under government control, these institutions disbursed their profits
to the US Treasury, keeping their equity cushions slim.

Regulatory reform – new elements and implementation

To minimise transition costs, implementation of the new capital standards is phased over several years (Table VI.A).
The 8% minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (RWA) is already in full effect, but the ratios that
involve higher-quality capital – Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) and overall Tier 1 – will reach their new, higher levels
in 2015. The new capital conservation buffer and the surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs),
both defined in terms of CET1/RWA, will be fully binding in 2019.

In the past year, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) made progress on two key elements of
the post-crisis regulatory reform agenda. The first comprises the minimum liquidity standards. The liquidity coverage
ratio (LCR) was published in January 2013, and the definition of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) was finalised one
year later. The new definition makes greater room for central bank committed liquidity facilities (CLFs). Their use has
been allowed for all jurisdictions, subject to a range of conditions and limitations. The restrictions are intended
to limit the use of CLFs in normal times and to encourage banks to self-insure against liquidity shocks, but they may
be relaxed during times of stress, when HQLA might otherwise be in short supply. The Committee also sought
comments on the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), the second liquidity standard.
Another important element finalised in January 2014 was the definition of the denominator of the Basel III
leverage ratio, a simple ratio of capital to total bank exposure that complements the risk-based capital requirements.
The exposure measure represents progress in two respects. First, it is universal, as it overcomes discrepancies in the
way different accounting standards capture off-balance sheet exposures, including derivatives. Its definition adopts
an established regulatory practice that is highly comparable across jurisdictions. Second, the measure is
comprehensive, as it ensures adequate capture of both on- and off-balance sheet sources of leverage. The result is
stricter capital requirements per unit of exposure than those implied by leverage ratios that had already been in
place in some jurisdictions. Early observations suggest that, on average, the exposure measure is about 15–20%
higher than the corresponding total assets metric. Starting in 2015, banks are required to disclose the ratio, with a
view to migrating it to a Pillar 1 requirement by 2018 after a final calibration.

Given their contribution to higher bank capital so far, stable profits will be key
to the sector’s resilience in the near future. On average, profits rebounded further
from the crisis lows, but recovery remained uneven across countries (Table VI.2).

Outside the euro area, banks’ pre-tax profits improved last year but remained
generally below pre-crisis averages. Interest rate margins did not contribute as
much as in previous years. They remained mostly flat globally, and in some cases
even declined (eg in the United States). Instead, lower credit-related costs were the
main factor at work. Loan loss provisions have been declining in most countries,
reflecting the economic recovery and progress in loss recognition.
In the euro area, the picture was quite different. Profits remained lacklustre.
Sovereign debt strains continued to affect asset quality, and a stagnating economy
compressed revenues. Banks are stepping up their effort to deal with impaired
balance sheets ahead of the ECB’s asset quality review later this year, as witnessed
by the recent spike in the write-off rate.
Recent developments in the Chinese banking sector illustrate the benefits of
retaining earnings as a buffer against losses. As economic growth in China
weakened, borrowers in the country came under financial strain and the volume of
impaired loans ballooned. By drawing on their reserves, however, the five largest
Chinese banks were able in 2013 to absorb credit losses twice as large as a year
earlier, post strong profits and maintain high capital ratios.
Investment banking activity produced mixed results. Revenues from merger
and acquisition advisory business and securities underwriting strengthened, aided
by very robust corporate debt issuance. By contrast, secondary market trading of
fixed income products and commodities weakened, dragging down related revenues
and, alongside a tougher supervisory stance, leading several large capital market
players to trim their trading activity. Legal risk also played a role. Intensifying official
probes into market benchmark manipulation have resulted in very large fines in
recent years.

Risk-weighted assets
The second driver of the improvement in banks’ capital ratios was the reduction in
the denominator: risk-weighted assets (Graph VI.1, left-hand panel). This may reflect
shrinkage in total assets (magenta segments) or a decline in RWA relative to total
assets (blue segments). Most banks grew in size but lowered the average risk weight
of their asset portfolio. In advanced economies, the decline in RWA relative to total
assets contributed 0.7 points to the 3 percentage point average increase in banks’
capital ratios. Euro area banks are an exception to this pattern, as shrinking balance
sheets also contributed to the increase in their capital ratios.
In fact, the average risk weight in bank portfolios has been falling since 2007.
Despite the Great Recession and the sluggish recovery, ratios of RWA to total assets
were about 20% lower in 2013 than six years earlier. Market commentary indicates
that more than a genuine reduction in assets’ riskiness has been at play and suggests
that banks redesigned risk models in order to lower capital requirements by
underestimating risk and providing optimistic asset valuations. This may explain in
part the persistent discount at which bank shares trade on the book value of equity
(Graph VI.8, left-hand panel). This concern has been intensified by the observation
that risk weights for similar assets vary substantially across banks.
Market observers and supervisory studies point to a dispersion of reported
RWA that is hard to justify given the underlying risk exposures. The dispersion is
generally higher for more complex positions. Focused analysis of banks’ loan and

Regulatory treatment of banks’ sovereign exposures

Risk sensitivity is at the core of the capital framework. Basel II and III prescribe minimum capital requirements
commensurate with the credit risk of all exposures. This risk sensitivity also applies to sovereign exposures.
The most relevant standard for internationally active banks is the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach. It
requires a meaningful differentiation of risk and asks banks to assess the credit risk of individual sovereigns using a
granular rating scale. The Basel framework is based on the premise that banks use the IRB approach across the
entire banking group and across all asset classes. But it allows national supervisors to permit banks to gradually
phase in the approach across the banking group and, only if the exposures are non-material in terms of both size
and risk, to keep certain exposures in the external ratings-based, standardised approach (SA) indefinitely.
The SA, as a rule, prescribes positive risk weights to all but the highest-quality credits (AAA to AA). For instance,
it assigns a 20% weight to A-rated borrowers and a 100% weight to B-rated ones. National supervisors, however, are
allowed to exercise discretion and set lower risk weights to sovereign exposures that are denominated and funded
in the corresponding national currency. As a result, the risk weights on such exposures have varied considerably
across large international banks, including global systemically important ones. In fact, the variability in sovereign risk
weights across banks is an important driver of the variability of overall risk-weighted assets.
Data on individual bank risk assessments are generally not available outside the supervisory community. A
notable exception is the European Banking Authority’s welcome initiative to disclose the risk weights and total
exposures of large European banks for different asset classes. The information reveals a wide range of practices and
a general tendency to assign a lower weight to exposures to the home sovereign.
In aggregate, banks assign a zero risk weight to more than half of their sovereign debt holdings. This is
particularly true for portfolios under the SA, which cover the majority of banks’ sovereign exposures, but also for
some IRB portfolios. Interestingly, the tendency to use the potentially more permissive SA is not related to the
capitalisation of the bank but increases with the perceived riskiness of the borrower. In particular, exposures to
sovereigns in the euro area periphery tend to be overwhelmingly under the SA, thus obtaining zero risk weights.
This applies especially to banks with sovereign exposures exceeding 10% of their capital.
Banks assign to their own sovereign a considerably lower risk weight than do banks from other countries. The
“home bias” is particularly pronounced for Portuguese, Spanish and Irish banks and somewhat less so for French, UK
and Austrian banks.

  For further discussion, see “Treatment of sovereign risk in the Basel capital framework”, BIS Quarterly Review, December 2013, pp 10–11.

trading portfolios finds that both supervisory practices and individual bank choices
are at work.1 These practices reflect a combination of discretion permitted under
the Basel framework and, occasionally, deviations from the framework. Examples
include the implementation of capital floors and the partial use of the standardised
(non-model-based) approach – for instance, for credit exposures to sovereigns
(Box VI.B). Internal model risk estimates based on short data samples, and wide
variation in the valuation of trading positions, contribute to the dispersion of RWA.
The combined effect of these varying practices suggests that there is scope for
inconsistency in risk assessments and hence in regulatory ratios.
What is the appropriate policy response to the need to improve the reliability
and comparability of RWA (Chapter V of last year’s Annual Report)? The internal
ratings-based (IRB) approach should remain a pillar of the regulatory framework. It
provides an essential link to banks’ own decision-making and it permits a natural
and welcome diversity of risk assessments among banks. What is needed is to
tighten the link to an objective measurement of the underlying risks and to improve

supervisory safeguards. On the one hand, the introduction of the leverage ratio
provides both a backstop to overly optimistic risk assessments and a useful
alternative perspective on a bank’s solvency. On the other hand, work under way
to understand the drivers of unwanted variation in RWA points to the need to
ensure rigorous supervisory validation of banks’ models and to improve its crossjurisdictional consistency. In addition, other policies, such as imposing tighter
constraints on modelling assumptions and introducing greater disclosure about
these assumptions, can also improve the comparability of RWA. These options
would be superior to requiring a single regulatory model, such as a unique set of
risk weights, which might encourage herding and risk concentration.

Insurance sector
Insurance companies, like banks, are recovering post-crisis. The crisis hit the core
parts of the insurance companies, causing a sharp fall in the value of their investments
and a slowdown in premium growth. Underwriters of credit derivatives also suffered
losses. The recovery in premium growth and capital differs somewhat in the life and
non-life segments and reflects firms’ original asset composition.
Property and casualty insurance firms absorbed the crisis-driven drop in asset
values thanks to their ample capital buffers. At present, these buffers are being
replenished via growing insurance premiums, which rebounded in most markets
during the past couple of years (Table VI.3). Underwriting profitability, as measured
by the combined ratio – the sum of underwriting losses, expenses and policyholders’
dividends divided by premium income – is also improving, despite spikes in policy
payouts due to natural disasters. The reinsurance sector has also strengthened its
capitalisation and tapped alternative sources of capital. The market for catastrophe
bonds, hard hit in the immediate crisis aftermath, recovered after 2010 and issuance
is on the rise. Insurance premiums in EMEs continued to grow strongly, supported
in many countries by an expanding economy, and are narrowing the sizeable gap
in insurance product penetration with mature markets.
The recovery in the life insurance segment has been less strong than in the
property and casualty segment. Life insurers suffered an additional blow during the

crisis because of the combination of losses from embedded product guarantees and
an increase in the valuation of liabilities driven by a decline in interest rates. While
premium income is recovering from its sharp drop during the crisis, it is still growing
less than benefit payments and surrenders.
Premium growth counteracted weak returns on investment portfolios. The low
yields of high-quality bonds, a key asset class for insurers, remain a drag on
investment revenue. Return on equity has recovered from its crisis trough, but
remains below its historical average. A subdued growth outlook and low returns on
other asset classes have triggered a search for yield by insurance companies,
fuelling demand for riskier securities (Chapter II).
Changes in the regulatory framework tighten insurers’ capital requirements and
impose stricter constraints on the valuation of long-term assets and liabilities. This
should increase the resilience of the sector. It might also whet insurers’ appetite for
fixed income securities with regular cash flow streams, including corporate debt.
Looking forward, insurers, and life insurers in particular, are exposed to
interest rate risk. The limited supply of long-term investable assets amplifies this
risk by exacerbating the duration mismatch of assets and liabilities. In this case,
derivatives can provide a good hedge and insurers will benefit from reforms in
over-the-counter market infrastructure that should reduce counterparty risk.
But interest rate risk arises also from guarantees and other option-like elements of
life insurance products with investment features. This risk is complex, more difficult
to predict and harder to hedge. In this case, capital buffers are a better line of
defence.

Bank versus market-based credit
The crisis and its aftermath halted the trend growth in bank-intermediated finance.
In the advanced economies most affected by the crisis, bank credit to corporates
has ceded ground to market-based financing. In EMEs, both sources have grown,
with market-based financing registering the faster pace.

Structural adjustments in the financial sector
The crisis has had a lasting impact on financial intermediaries worldwide. Compelled
by the need to secure profitability, nudged by changes in the regulatory environment
(Box VI.A) and motivated by market signals, many banks have been streamlining
their business mix. In parallel, the asset management sector has grown to become
an established player in the funding of investment. All this has reshaped the
domestic and the international financial landscape.

banks switched from retail to another business model post-crisis (three out of 38),
confirming the relative appeal of stable income and funding sources. This recent
trend stands in contrast to developments in the banking sector pre-crisis. From
2005 to 2007, only four of 45 banks switched to a retail model. In parallel, easy
funding and high trading profits led a quarter of the banks with a retail model in
2005 (13 out of 47 institutions) to adopt another model by 2007.

Shifting patterns in international banking
A key aspect of internationally active banks’ business model relates to the geographical
location of their funding compared with that of their assets (Graph VI.5, left-hand
panel). At one end of the spectrum are German and Japanese banks, whose
international positions are mostly cross-border, largely funded in the home country.
At the other end of the spectrum, Spanish, Canadian and Australian banks use
foreign offices both to obtain funding and to extend credit within the same host
country. Between these two extremes, Belgian and Swiss banks tap geographically
diverse sources of funding and have large cross-border positions mostly booked in
international financial centres, such as London, New York, Paris or the Caribbean.
International banking conducted through local offices in foreign countries has
proved to be more resilient than cross-border banking over the past five years. This
is evident in the positive relationship between the share of locally conducted
intermediation in a banking system’s foreign claims and the overall growth in these
claims (Graph VI.5, right-hand panel). As a case in point, the foreign claims of
Australian banks have increased markedly on the back of growing activity by offices
in New Zealand and emerging Asia. Similarly, robust conditions in Latin America
have allowed Spanish banks to increase their foreign claims, despite general
pressure on European banks to reduce foreign lending in order to preserve capital
for their home markets.

Sources: BIS consolidated banking statistics (ultimate risk and immediate borrower basis); BIS locational banking statistics by nationality.

By contrast, cross-border activities came under strain when liquidity evaporated
during the crisis, subjecting global financial markets to stress. Since then, crossborder bank lending has retreated, driving much of the decline in the foreign claims
of Swiss and German banks over the past five years. In this context, the sizeable
increase in Japanese banks’ cross-border claims, mainly to US and emerging Asia
residents, is a notable exception.

The ascent of the asset management sector
As banks reorganise their business lines and retreat from some capital market
activities, market-based financial intermediaries have been gaining ground. The
growth in the asset management sector is a case in point. Because asset managers
are responsible for the investment of large securities portfolios, they can have a
substantial impact on market functioning, on asset price dynamics and, ultimately,
on the funding costs of governments, businesses and households.
AMCs manage securities portfolios on behalf of ultimate investors. They cater
to both retail and wholesale customers. They manage the savings of households
and handle the surplus cash balances of small businesses, but also manage large
sums for institutional investors, such as corporate and public pension funds,
insurance companies, corporate treasuries and sovereign wealth funds.
Arrangements vary widely in terms of product design and characteristics, in
line with client funds’ investment objectives. For example, open- and closed-end
mutual funds pool individual investors’ funds in larger portfolios that are managed
collectively. By contrast, corporate and public sector pension funds can place money

with AMCs in segregated accounts managed on the basis of mandates tailored to
client needs. In most arrangements, AMCs do not put their balance sheets at risk in
managing those funds. Rather, in exchange for a fee, they offer economies of scale
and scope in the form of expertise in securities selection, transaction execution and
timing, and portfolio administration. There are exceptions, though. For example,
hedge funds actively manage portfolios following investment strategies that
embody a high appetite for risk-taking and involve substantial leverage. The hedge
fund manager has own funds at risk and is rewarded on the basis of performance.
Similarly, a hidden form of leverage relates to the implicit reassurances of capital
preservation made by money market funds. The AMC responsible for those funds
might feel compelled to cover shortfalls due to bad portfolio performance. Explicit
or implicit backing of a segregated fund’s borrowing by the umbrella organisation
managing the fund may also put the AMC balance sheet at risk.
The asset management sector has grown substantially over the past several
years. While the diversity in the profiles of AMCs and products complicates statistical
measurement, estimates put the total assets under management at dozens of
trillions of US dollars (Graph VI.6). Despite a brief decline in the size of the aggregate
portfolio during the crisis, reflecting mainly a drop in valuations rather than client
withdrawals, AMCs managed roughly twice as much money in 2012 as they did
10 years before.
The sector’s growth has coincided with an increase in the market share of the
largest players. That of the top tier of AMCs accounts for more than one quarter of
the total assets under management (Graph VI.6, red line). Concentration is greatest
at the very top, where a handful of firms dominate the rankings. Many of these top
AMCs are affiliated with and/or operate under the same corporate umbrella as
large, systemically important financial institutions.
The ascent of the asset management sector presents both opportunities and
challenges for financial stability. On the one hand, strengthening market-based
financial intermediation can provide a complementary channel to bank-based
funding for businesses and households (see Box VI.C for an example). In fact, the
growth in AMCs’ portfolios mirrors the rebalancing of funding of the real economy
away from banks and towards markets. Greater diversity in funding channels can be
a strength, to the extent that one might compensate for supply problems in the
other. That said, the nexus of incentives and objectives influencing the behaviour of

Financing infrastructure investment

Investment in infrastructure, if properly targeted and designed, can boost potential growth. Both emerging and
advanced economies need to create, or upgrade, crucial transport and energy-related infrastructure. Overstretched
fiscal positions set clear limits to the availability of public sector funding in many countries and put a premium on
promoting private sector funding for such projects. Unlocking this potential requires a degree of certainty about
project design and operation as well as diversity in financing instruments.
A key impediment to greater private sector funding is uncertainty about the pipeline of projects. The suitability
of a project for private investors often hinges on the design of legal contracts that govern the distribution of risks
and cash flows. Ill-structured contracts can lead to cost overruns and even failure. Political risks also loom large. For
instance, a history of politically motivated changes to the prices that infrastructure operators can charge greatly
increases the perception of such risks. Private financiers will bear the fixed costs of building up expertise if they can
invest in well planned projects that are not subject to cancellation, or major revisions, during the long period of
gestation and construction. Otherwise, less complex asset classes will be preferred.
Another factor that can attract long-term portfolio investors is greater diversity in financing instruments.
Infrastructure bonds, for instance, are potentially attractive to pension funds and insurance companies. Over the
long life cycle of infrastructure projects, these bonds’ credit risk tends to subside more rapidly than that of
comparable corporate bonds (Graph VI.C, left-hand panel). The bonds also tend to exhibit greater ratings stability
and higher recoveries in the event of default. Specialised investment vehicles, such as infrastructure funds, can also
attract new investors by offering diversification possibilities across projects in different sectors and countries.
Nevertheless, bank loans remain the main form of debt financing for infrastructure (Graph VI.C, right-hand panel).
While loans have some advantages in the construction and early operational phases, bonds could be used more
widely for seasoned projects or the privatisation of existing infrastructure. In EMEs, their issuance is tied to the
development of onshore local currency markets.

AMCs can adversely affect market dynamics and funding costs for the real economy.
Portfolio managers are evaluated on the basis of short-term performance, and
revenues are linked to fluctuations in customer fund flows. These arrangements can
exacerbate the procyclicality of asset prices, feeding the market’s momentum in
booms and leading to abrupt withdrawals from asset classes in times of stress.
Greater concentration in the sector can strengthen this effect. Single firms in
charge of large asset portfolios may at times exert disproportionate influence on
market dynamics. This is especially true when different managers within the same
organisation share research and investment ideas, and are subject to top-down risk
assessments. Reduced diversity in the marketplace weakens the system’s ability to
deal with stress. Another concern arising from concentration is that operational or
legal problems at a large AMC may have disproportionate systemic effects.

How strong are banks, really?
Banks still need to take important steps to buttress their resilience and ensure the
long-term sustainability of their business models. In order to regain markets’
confidence, institutions from a number of crisis-hit countries must further repair
their balance sheets by recognising losses and recapitalising. This would reduce
their funding costs and strengthen their intermediation capacity. At the same time,
banks operating in, or exposed to, countries with recent financial booms should
avoid excessive expansion and ensure that they have enough loss-absorbing
capacity to face a turning financial cycle (Chapter IV).

Banks in post-crisis recovery
Banks directly affected by the financial crisis have not yet fully recovered. Even
though their capital positions have improved (see above), analysts and markets
remain sceptical. Downbeat perceptions drive banks’ stand-alone ratings, which
capture inherent financial strength and factor out explicit and implicit guarantees
from an institution’s parent or sovereign, as well as all-in ratings, which gauge
overall creditworthiness. Scepticism is also evident in the valuation of certain banks’
equity and in the spreads markets charge for bank debt.
In April 2014, the stand-alone ratings of banks on both sides of the Atlantic
stood several notches below their pre-crisis levels (Graph VI.7, left-hand and centre
panels, green bar segments). The crisis exposed these banks’ 2007 ratings as overly
optimistic, triggering a wave of large downgrades. The major rating agencies’
assessments of banks’ inherent health continued to deteriorate even past 2010,
showing only marginal signs of improvement more recently.
Low and deteriorating stand-alone ratings can undermine confidence in the
banking sector. For one, they cast doubt on banks’ own assessments that their
financial strength has been improving. They also imply that banks need to rely more
than in the past on external support to improve their creditworthiness. But, facing
financial problems of their own or trying to reduce taxpayers’ exposure to financial
sector risks, sovereigns have had less capacity and have expressed a reduced
willingness to provide such support. As a result, banks’ all-in ratings have
deteriorated in step with, or by more than, stand-alone ratings (Graph VI.7, lefthand and centre panels, combined height of green and red bar segments).
Price-based indicators from credit and equity markets also reveal scepticism,
especially about euro area and UK banks. Given credit ratings in the non-financial
corporate sector (Graph VI.7, right-hand panel), this scepticism has resulted in
a positive wedge between the banks’ funding costs and what their potential

slow recovery of the interbank and repo markets, this has weakened banks’ cost
advantage, thus causing them to lose ground to market-based intermediation.
Likewise, euro area and UK banks’ price-to-book ratios have remained persistently
below one, in contrast to those of US banks, which seem to have regained market
confidence (Graph VI.8, left-hand panel).

Despite post-crisis capital-raising efforts, doubts remain about the quality of
certain banks’ balance sheets. More fresh capital has supported an upward trend in
banks’ market capitalisation, both in absolute terms and relative to the book value
of liabilities (Graph VI.8, right-hand panel, red lines). However, the capacity of capital
to absorb future losses is severely undermined by unrecognised losses on legacy
assets. Unrecognised losses distort banks’ incentives, diverting resources towards
keeping troubled borrowers afloat and away from new projects. And as these losses
gradually come to the surface, they raise banks’ non-performing loan (NPL) ratios. In
the euro area periphery countries, NPL ratios have continued to rise, almost six years
after the apex of the crisis (Graph VI.9, left-hand panel), while new lending has remained
subdued. Similarly, banks in central Europe have reported stubbornly high and, in
some cases, rapidly increasing NPL ratios since 2008 (Graph VI.9, right-hand panel).
In the United States, non-performing loans tell a different story. After 2009, the
country’s banking sector posted steady declines in the aggregate NPL ratio, which
fell below 4% at end-2013. Coupled with robust asset growth, this suggests that
the sector has made substantial progress in putting the crisis behind it. Persistent
strains on mortgage borrowers, however, kept the NPL ratios of the two largest
government-sponsored enterprises above 7% in 2013.
Enforcing balance sheet repair is an important policy challenge in the euro area.
The challenge has been complicated by a prolonged period of ultra-low interest
rates. To the extent that low rates support wide interest margins, they provide
useful respite for poorly performing banks. However, low rates also reduce the cost
of – and thus encourage – forbearance, ie keeping effectively insolvent borrowers
afloat in order to postpone the recognition of losses. The experience of Japan in the
1990s showed that protracted forbearance not only destabilises the banking sector
directly but also acts as a drag on the supply of credit and leads to its misallocation
(Chapter III). This underscores the value of the ECB’s asset quality review, which aims
to expedite balance sheet repair, thus forming the basis of credible stress tests.
The goal of stress tests is to restore and buttress market confidence in the
banking sector. Ultimately, though, it is banks’ capacity to assess their own risks that

would support this confidence on a continuous basis. Hence the importance of
policy initiatives to promote transparent, reliable and internationally harmonised
risk measurement systems and enhanced disclosure.

Banks in a late financial boom phase
In countries with recent financial booms, banks may be weaker than they appear.
This concern applies mainly to institutions exposed to those emerging market
economies where perceptions of a benign credit outlook and strong earnings
potential have ridden on an unstable leverage-based expansion. A similar concern
applies to bank operations in certain advanced economies, such as Switzerland and
the Nordic countries, where strong valuations (Graph VI.8, left-hand panel) may be
reflecting fast credit growth and frothy property prices (Chapter IV).
Several indicators deliver an upbeat message about EME banks. For one, the
NPL ratios of banks domiciled in parts of emerging Asia and Latin America have
been low and declining, standing at around 3% or lower at end-2013 (Graph VI.9,
second and third panels). In this context, Indian banks’ rising NPL ratios are an
exception. In addition, the credit ratings that both Fitch and Moody’s assign to large
EME banks have remained stable and even improved slightly on aggregate since
2007 (Graph VI.7). And the corresponding price-to-book ratios have been high,
hovering around 2 over the past five years (Graph VI.8, left-hand panel).
That said, such indicators failed to signal vulnerabilities in the past. Because of
their backward-looking nature, NPL ratios did not pick up in advanced economies
until 2008, when the crisis was already under way (Graph VI.9, left-hand panel).
Similarly, pre-crisis credit ratings and market valuations did not warn about the
imminent financial distress.
In contrast, measures of credit expansion and the speed of property price
inflation, which have been reliable early warning indicators, are flashing red lights
about a number of emerging market economies at the current juncture (Chapter IV).
These warnings are echoed by capitalisation ratios, which equal the market value of
equity divided by the book value of liabilities (Graph VI.8, right-hand panel, blue
lines). On the back of leverage-based balance sheet growth, these ratios have
declined steadily on aggregate for both banks and non-financial corporates (NFCs)
in EMEs. Thus, any event that triggers investor scepticism would depress
capitalisation ratios from a low starting point, potentially endangering financial
stability. The EME NFC sector is an important part of the picture not only because it
is the main source of credit risk to domestic banks but also because it has recently
entered the intermediation chain (Chapter IV).
In a sign of growing investor scepticism, Chinese banks’ price-to-book ratios
have diverged from those of EME peers and have been declining over the past five
years. Explicit and implicit links between regulated and shadow banks have
contributed to this scepticism. National data indicate that non-bank credit to private
NFCs grew sevenfold between mid-2008 and end-2013, thus increasing its share in
the country’s total credit from 10% to 25%. The fragilities accompanying this rapid
rise surfaced in a number of near and outright defaults among China’s shadow
banks and contributed to a drastic reduction in the country’s credit supply in
the first quarter of 2014. Industry analysts expect such strains to have repercussions
on banks, not least because they have acted as issuers and distributors of shadow
banking products.
Authorities in EMEs need to alert banks to the scale of current risks, enforce
sound risk management and strengthen macroprudential measures. For one, the
deteriorating growth outlook in these economies calls for a downward revision of
earnings forecasts. In addition, EME authorities will need to cope with the fallout

The effectiveness of countercyclical policy instruments

Box VI.D

Policies that address macro-financial vulnerabilities require effective instruments that take a system-wide perspective.
In recent years, several jurisdictions have strengthened the systemic orientation of their prudential framework by
redesigning existing, and introducing new, macroprudential policy tools to mitigate the risks arising from the
financial cycle. Similar tools have been incorporated in international standards. Even though it is premature to seek
firm conclusions about the effectiveness of newly introduced tools, such as countercyclical capital buffers, the
historical experience of some jurisdictions with similar tools provides a useful context.
The yardstick for the assessment of instrument effectiveness is tied to the objective of the policy. In the case of
countercyclical tools, there are two complementary objectives. The first, narrower, one is to protect financial
institutions from the effects of the cycle. The second, broader, objective is to tame the financial cycle. Success in the
narrow objective does not guarantee success in the broader one, as policymakers’ experience so far with the most
prominent countercyclical instruments confirms.

Capital buffers and dynamic provisions
A number of jurisdictions have introduced a countercyclical capital requirement in order to increase banks’ resilience
in the face of risk built up during credit booms. Switzerland activated the tool in 2013 with a focus on the domestic
mortgage market. The early signs are that the tool is more effective in strengthening banks’ balance sheets than in
slowing down mortgage credit growth or affecting its cost. This mirrors Spain’s experience with dynamic provisioning.
More ample provisions helped Spanish banks to partially buffer the impact of the bust in the property market, but
did not prevent the bubble from inflating in the first place.

Loan-to-value (LTV) and debt service-to-income (DSTI) ratios
These tools have a longer track record in a number of jurisdictions. The evidence indicates that they help to improve
banks’ resilience by increasing that of borrowers. A number of studies find that tighter LTV caps reduce the sensitivity
of households to income and property price shocks. The impact on the credit cycle is less well documented, but
experience suggests that tightening LTV and DSTI caps during booms slows real credit growth and house price
appreciation to some extent. In particular, a typical tightening of the maximum DSTI ratio generates a 4–7 percentage
point deceleration in credit growth over the following year. But relaxing the constraint has a more ambiguous effect.

Time-varying liquidity requirements / reserve requirements
Similarly to capital, the impact of higher liquidity buffers on the resilience of banks is self-evident. There is also
evidence that liquidity-based macroprudential tools can effectively enhance the system’s resilience. The evidence
on the impact of liquidity-based tools in curbing the credit cycle is not as strong. Studies assessing the impact of
higher reserve requirements find that lending spreads increase and lending shrinks, but that the effects do not last.

from the phasing-out of monetary accommodation in advanced economies. The
resulting market tensions (Chapters II and IV) have highlighted the importance of
proper management of interest and exchange rate risk. More generally, the buildup of financial vulnerabilities underscores the importance of not being lulled into a
false sense of security and of reassessing previously used macroprudential tools
(Box VI.D). Emerging market economies have been early adopters of such tools and
have gained extensive experience regarding their operation and effectiveness. This
experience can be the basis for further refinements and improvements to the
macroprudential policy framework.

The BIS: mission, activities, governance and
financial results

The mission of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is to serve central banks
in their pursuit of monetary and financial stability, to foster international
cooperation in those areas and to act as a bank for central banks.
In the light of the Bank’s mission, this chapter reviews the activities of the BIS,
and of the groups it hosts, for the financial year 2013/14; describes the institutional
framework that supports the work of those groups; and presents the year’s financial
results.
In broad outline, the BIS pursues its mission by:
•
promoting discussion and facilitating collaboration among central banks;
•
supporting dialogue with other authorities that are responsible for promoting
financial stability;
•
conducting research on policy issues confronting central banks and financial
supervisory authorities;
•
acting as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; and
•
serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international financial operations.
The BIS promotes international cooperation among monetary authorities and
financial supervisory officials through its meetings programmes and through the
Basel Process – hosting international groups pursuing global financial stability (such
as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board)
and facilitating their interaction in an efficient and cost-effective way (see below).
The BIS economic analysis, research and statistics function helps meet the
needs of monetary and supervisory authorities for policy insight and data.
The BIS banking function provides prime counterparty, agent and trustee
services appropriate to the BIS mission.
The BIS has its head office in Basel, Switzerland, and representative offices in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China
(Hong Kong SAR) and in Mexico City.

The meetings programmes and the Basel Process
The BIS promotes international cooperation among financial and monetary officials
in two major ways:
•
hosting and preparing background material for meetings of central bank
officials; and
•
the Basel Process, which facilitates cooperation among the international groups
hosted by the BIS.

Bimonthly meetings and other regular consultations
At bimonthly meetings, normally held in Basel, Governors and other senior officials
of BIS member central banks discuss current developments and the outlook for the
world economy and financial markets. They also exchange views and experiences
on issues of special and topical interest to central banks. In addition to the
bimonthly meetings, the Bank regularly hosts gatherings that variously include
public and private sector representatives and the academic community.

BIS 84th Annual Report

129

The two principal bimonthly meetings are the Global Economy Meeting and
the All Governors’ Meeting.

Global Economy Meeting
The Global Economy Meeting (GEM) comprises the Governors of 30 BIS member
central banks in major advanced and emerging market economies that account
for about four fifths of global GDP. The Governors of another 19 central banks
attend the GEM as observers.1 The GEM has two main roles: (i) monitoring and
assessing developments, risks and opportunities in the world economy and the
global financial system; and (ii) providing guidance to three BIS-based central bank
committees – the Committee on the Global Financial System, the Committee on
Payment and Settlement Systems and the Markets Committee. The GEM also
receives reports from the Chairs of those committees and decides on publication.
As the Global Economy Meeting is quite large, it is supported by an informal
group called the Economic Consultative Committee (ECC). Limited to 18 participants,
the ECC includes all BIS Board Governors and the BIS General Manager. The ECC
assembles proposals for consideration by the GEM. In addition, the ECC Chairman
initiates recommendations to the GEM on the appointment of Chairs of the
three central bank committees mentioned above and on the composition and
organisation of those committees.

All Governors’ Meeting
The All Governors’ Meeting comprises the Governors of the 60 BIS member central
banks and is chaired by the BIS Chairman. It convenes to discuss selected topics of
general interest to its members. In 2013/14, the topics discussed were:
•
New challenges for the institutional design of central banks
•
Central bank challenges from forward guidance
•
Financial structure determinants and implications
•
Meeting higher capital requirements: progress and challenges
•
Domestic and global drivers of inflation: has the balance changed?
By agreement with the GEM and the BIS Board, the All Governors’ Meeting
is responsible for overseeing the work of two other groups: the Central Bank
Governance Group, which also meets during the bimonthly meetings, and the
Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics.

Other regular consultations
During the bimonthly meetings, Governors of central banks in (i) major emerging
market economies and (ii) small open economies gather to discuss themes of
special relevance to their economies.
In addition, the Bank hosts regular meetings of the Group of Central Bank
Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), which oversees the work of the Basel

BIS 84th Annual Report

Committee on Banking Supervision. In its January 2014 meeting, the GHOS
endorsed several proposals from the Basel Committee (as discussed below in more
detail in the report of the Committee): a common definition of the Basel III
leverage ratio and related disclosure requirements; changes to the Basel III net
stable funding ratio; minimum requirements for liquidity-related disclosures; and
modifications of the definition of high-quality liquid assets for purposes of Basel III’s
liquidity coverage ratio. Finally, the GHOS also reviewed and endorsed the
Committee’s strategic priorities in its work programme for the next two years, with
the highest priority accorded to completion of the crisis-related policy reform
agenda.
The Bank regularly arranges informal discussions among public and private
sector representatives that focus on their shared interests in promoting a sound
and well functioning international financial system. In addition, for senior central
bank officials, the Bank organises various meetings to which other financial
authorities, the private financial sector and the academic community are invited to
contribute. These meetings include:
•
the annual meetings of the working parties on monetary policy, held in Basel
but also hosted at a regional level by a number of central banks in Asia, central
and eastern Europe, and Latin America;
•
the meeting of Deputy Governors of emerging market economies; and
•
the high-level meetings organised by the Financial Stability Institute in various
regions of the world for Governors and Deputy Governors and heads of
supervisory authorities.
Other meetings in the past year included:
•
a roundtable meeting of Governors from Africa, in May 2013;
•
a meeting of Governors from Latin American and Caribbean central banks, in
June 2013;
•
a Central Bank of Russia – BIS Seminar, “Challenges for monetary and financial
policy”, in July 2013; and
•
a roundtable meeting of Governors from Central Asia, jointly hosted by the
Swiss National Bank and the BIS, in November 2013.

The Basel Process
The Basel Process refers to the facilitative role of the BIS in hosting and supporting
the work of international groups – six committees and three associations – engaged
in standard setting and the pursuit of financial stability.
The hosted committees, whose agendas are guided by various sets of central
banks and supervisory authorities, are as follows:
•
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS): develops global
regulatory standards for banks and addresses supervision at the level of
individual institutions and as it relates to macroprudential supervision;
•
the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS): monitors and analyses
the broad issues relating to financial markets and systems;
•
the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS): analyses and sets
standards for payment, clearing and settlement infrastructures;
•
the Markets Committee: monitors developments in financial markets and their
implications for central bank operations;
•
the Central Bank Governance Group: examines issues related to the design and
operation of central banks; and
•
the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC): addresses statistical
issues of concern to central banks, including those relating to economic,
monetary and financial stability.

BIS 84th Annual Report

131

The hosted associations are as follows:
•
the Financial Stability Board (FSB): an association including finance ministries,
central banks and other financial authorities in 24 countries; coordinates at the
international level the work of national authorities and international standard
setters and develops policies to enhance financial stability;
•
the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI): sets global standards
for deposit insurance systems and promotes cooperation on deposit insurance
and bank resolution arrangements; and
•
the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS): sets standards for
the insurance sector to promote globally consistent supervision.
The Bank’s own Financial Stability Institute (FSI) facilitates the dissemination of
the standard-setting bodies’ work to central banks and financial sector supervisory
and regulatory agencies through its extensive programme of meetings, seminars
and online tutorials.
The Basel Process is based on three key features: synergies of co-location,
flexibility and openness in the exchange of information, and support from the
economic expertise and banking experience of the BIS.

Synergies of co-location
The physical proximity of the nine committees and associations at the BIS creates
synergies that produce a broad and fruitful exchange of ideas. In addition, by
reducing each group’s costs of operation through economies of scale, the Basel
Process supports a more efficient use of public funds.

Flexibility and openness in the exchange of information
The limited size of these groups leads to flexibility and openness in the exchange of
information, thereby enhancing the coordination of their work on financial stability
issues and preventing overlaps and gaps in their work programmes. At the same time,
their output is much larger than their limited size would suggest, as they are able to
leverage the expertise of the international community of central bankers, financial
regulators and supervisors, and other international and national public authorities.

Support from the economic expertise and banking experience of the BIS
The work of the nine groups is informed by the BIS’s economic research and by the
practical experience it gains from the implementation of regulatory standards and
financial controls in its banking activities.

Activities of BIS-hosted committees and the FSI in 2013/14
This section reviews the year’s principal activities of the six committees hosted by
the BIS and of the Financial Stability Institute.

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) seeks to enhance supervisory
cooperation and improve the quality of banking supervision worldwide. It supports
supervisors by providing a forum for exchanging information on national
supervisory arrangements, improving the effectiveness of techniques for supervising
international banks and setting minimum supervisory and regulatory standards.

132

BIS 84th Annual Report

The Committee, which generally meets four times a year, consists of senior
representatives of bank supervisory authorities and central banks responsible for
banking supervision or financial stability issues in the Committee’s member
countries. The Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) is the Basel
Committee’s governing body and consists of central bank Governors and noncentral bank heads of supervision from member countries.

Key initiatives
The
•
•
•
•

Committee’s current work programme has four goals:
policy reform, with the primary task of completing the crisis-induced reforms;
implementation of the Basel regulatory framework;
further examining the balance between simplicity, comparability and risk
sensitivity in the regulatory framework; and
improving the effectiveness of supervision.

Policy reform
The Basel III framework, a set of global regulatory standards on bank capital
adequacy and liquidity that promote a more resilient banking sector, began taking
effect in many jurisdictions at the start of 2013. All Basel Committee member
countries have introduced the capital adequacy requirements. The Committee
continues to develop global regulatory and supervisory standards and to monitor
its members’ implementation of the Basel framework.
Basel III leverage ratio. On 12 January 2014, after endorsement by the GHOS, the
Committee issued the full text of the framework and disclosure requirements for
the Basel III leverage ratio. The document included modifications to the consultative
proposal the Committee issued in June 2013. The leverage ratio complements the
risk-based capital framework to better limit the build-up of excessive leverage in
the banking sector.
The numerator of the leverage ratio is a measure of equity (the “capital
measure”), and the denominator is a measure of assets (the “exposure measure”).
The capital measure is currently defined as Tier 1 capital, and a minimum leverage
ratio of 3% has been tentatively proposed. The Committee is checking the ratio at
banks twice per year to assess its appropriateness over a full credit cycle and for
different types of business models. It is also collecting data to assess the impact
of using Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) or total regulatory capital as the capital
measure.
Banks have begun reporting on the ratio to national supervisors, and public
disclosure starts on 1 January 2015. The Committee will make any final adjustments
to the definition and calibration of the leverage ratio by 2017, with a view to
migrating to a Pillar 1 (minimum capital requirements) treatment on 1 January 2018.
Basel III net stable funding ratio. The Committee first published its proposals on the
net stable funding ratio (NSFR) in 2009 and included the measure in the December
2010 Basel III agreement. Since that time, the Committee has been reviewing the
standard and its implications for financial market functioning and the economy.
The NSFR limits over-reliance on short-term wholesale funding, encourages
better assessment of funding risk across all on- and off-balance sheet items, and
promotes funding stability. A robust funding structure increases the likelihood that,
if a bank’s regular sources of funding are disrupted, it will maintain liquidity
sufficient to sustain its operations.

BIS 84th Annual Report

133

On 12 January 2014, after endorsement by the GHOS, the Committee issued
proposed revisions to the NSFR. The revisions include reducing cliff effects within
the measurement of funding stability, improving the alignment of the NSFR with
the liquidity coverage ratio, and altering the calibration of the NSFR to focus
greater attention on short-term, potentially volatile funding sources.
Refinements to the liquidity coverage ratio. Also in January 2014, the GHOS endorsed
the Committee’s proposal to modify the definition of high-quality liquid assets
(HQLA) within the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) framework to provide greater use
of committed liquidity facilities (CLFs) provided by central banks. The use of CLFs
within the LCR had been limited to those jurisdictions with insufficient HQLA to
meet the needs of the banking system. Subject to a range of conditions, a restricted
version of a CLF (an RCLF) may be used by any jurisdiction in times of stress. The
conditions are intended to limit the use of RCLFs in normal times, thereby
maintaining the principle that banks should self-insure against liquidity shocks and
that central banks should remain the lenders of last resort. Whether jurisdictions
choose to make use of RCLFs is a matter for national discretion; central banks are
under no obligation to offer them.
Margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. In September 2013,
the Committee and the International Organization of Securities Commissions
(IOSCO) released the final framework for margin requirements for non-centrally
cleared derivatives. Under these globally agreed standards, all financial firms and
systemically important non-financial entities that transact non-centrally cleared
derivatives will have to exchange initial and variation margin commensurate with
the counterparty risks arising from such transactions. The framework has been
designed to reduce systemic risks related to OTC (over-the-counter) derivatives
markets as well as to provide firms with appropriate incentives for central clearing
while managing the overall liquidity impact of the requirements.
The requirements will be phased in over a four-year period, which begins in
December 2015 with the largest, most active and most systemically important
participants in the derivatives market.
Standardised approach for capitalising counterparty credit risk exposures. Following
a public consultation on a “non-internal model method” proposed in June 2013,
the Committee published a final standard in March 2014 to improve the
methodology for assessing the counterparty credit risk associated with derivatives
transactions. The standardised approach, which will come into effect on 1 January
2017, will replace the capital framework’s existing methods – the Current Exposure
Method and the Standardised Method. It improves on the risk sensitivity of the
Current Exposure Method by differentiating between margined and unmargined
trades. The standardised approach updates supervisory factors to reflect the
level of volatilities observed over the recent stress period and provides a more
meaningful recognition of netting benefits. At the same time, the method is
suitable for a wide variety of derivatives transactions, reduces the scope for
discretion by banks as it does not rely on internal models, and avoids undue
complexity.
Updated assessment methodology and additional loss absorbency requirement
for global systemically important banks. In July 2013, the Committee published
an updated framework that sets out its assessment methodology for identifying
global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The framework also describes the
requirements for additional loss absorbency that will apply to G-SIBs, the phase-in

134

BIS 84th Annual Report

arrangements for these requirements and the disclosures that banks above a certain
size are required to make to enable the framework to operate on the basis of
publicly available information.
The measures will enhance the going-concern loss absorbency of G-SIBs and
reduce the probability of their failure. The rationale for the measures is that current
regulatory policies do not fully address the cross-border negative externalities
created by G-SIBs.
The assessment methodology takes an indicator-based approach comprising
five broad categories: size, interconnectedness, lack of readily available substitutes
or financial institution infrastructure, global (cross-jurisdictional) activity and
complexity.
The amount of additional loss absorbency will consist of “buckets” of CET1,
with the buckets ranging in size from 1% to 3.5% of CET1, depending on a bank’s
systemic importance. Initially, no G-SIBs were assigned to the highest requirement
– 3.5% (the so-called empty bucket) – which was established to discourage banks
from becoming even more systemically important.
In December 2013, in accordance with the timeline it set out in July, the
Committee published (i) the denominators that were used to calculate bank scores
and (ii) the cutoff score and bucket thresholds that were used to identify the
updated list of G-SIBs and to allocate them to buckets. That information will enable
banks to calculate their own scores and their higher loss absorbency requirement.
The requirement will be introduced, in parallel with the Basel III capital conservation
and countercyclical buffers, between 1 January 2016 and year-end 2018, becoming
fully effective on 1 January 2019.
Measuring and controlling large exposures. Concentrated exposures to individual
counterparties have been a major source of bank failures and were significant
during the global financial crisis. In April 2014, with the results of public consultation
and a quantitative impact study in hand, the Committee finalised a supervisory
framework for measuring and controlling large exposures to contain the maximum
loss a bank could face in the event of a sudden counterparty failure. The framework
can be used to mitigate the risk of contagion between G-SIBs, thus underpinning
financial stability. It also offers policy measures designed to capture large exposures
to shadow banks that are of concern to supervisors.
Capital requirements for investments in funds. Following a public consultation in
mid-2013, the Committee revised its policy framework for the prudential treatment
of banks’ investments in the equity of all types of funds (eg hedge funds, managed
funds, investment funds) that are held in the banking book. The revised framework
will take effect from 1 January 2017 and will apply to all banks regardless of the
method they use for assigning risk weights for credit risk.
In general, investing in funds should involve identifying their underlying assets,
but this look-through approach may not always be feasible. Therefore, the revised
framework provides incentives for improved risk management practices. It also
helps address risks associated with banks’ interactions with shadow banks and thus
contributes to the broader effort by the Financial Stability Board to strengthen the
oversight and regulation of shadow banking.
Fundamental review of the trading book. In October 2013, the Committee issued a
follow-up to its May 2012 consultative paper on its fundamental review of capital
requirements for the trading book. The October consultative paper comprises
detailed proposals for a comprehensive revision of the market risk framework. Key
features include:

BIS 84th Annual Report

135

•

a revised boundary between the trading book and banking book that is less
permeable and more objective; it reduces the incentives for regulatory
arbitrage and remains aligned with banks’ risk management practices;
•
a shift in the measure of risk, from value-at-risk to expected shortfall, to better
capture tail risk; calibration would be based on a period of significant financial
stress;
•
incorporation of market illiquidity risk and an additional risk assessment tool
for trading desks with exposure to illiquid, complex products;
•
a revised standardised approach that is sufficiently risk-sensitive to act as a
credible fallback to internal models, and is still appropriate for banks that do
not require sophisticated measurement of market risk;
•
a revised internal models-based approach that includes a more rigorous
approval process for the models and more consistent identification and
capitalisation of material risk factors;
•
a strengthened relationship between the standardised and the models-based
approaches that requires all banks to conduct a standardised calculation and
publicly disclose the resulting standardised capital charges; and
•
a closer alignment of the regulatory treatment of credit risk in the trading
book and the banking book by differentiating securitisation and nonsecuritisation exposures.
The Committee is also considering making the standardised approach a floor
or a surcharge to the models-based approach. The Committee expects to finalise
the trading book framework in 2015 following a comprehensive quantitative impact
study.
Revisions to the securitisation framework. In December 2013, the Committee published
a second consultative paper on revisions to the securitisation framework following
a comment period and a quantitative impact study. In revising the framework, the
Committee aimed to strike an appropriate balance between risk sensitivity,
simplicity and comparability. The major changes in the December document apply
to the hierarchy of approaches and the calibration of capital requirements.
For the hierarchy, the Committee has proposed a simple framework akin to
that used for credit risk: if they have the capacity and supervisory approval, banks
may use (i) an internal ratings-based approach in setting their capital requirement;
if that is not possible for a given exposure, they may use (ii) an external ratingsbased approach (if permitted by their jurisdiction) or, failing that, (iii) a standardised
approach.
Capital requirements remain more stringent than under the existing framework.
The Committee also proposes to set a 15% risk-weight floor for all approaches
instead of the 20% floor originally proposed. The Committee intends to finalise the
securitisation framework around year-end 2014.

Policy implementation
Implementation of the Basel III framework is a key priority of global regulatory
reform. To facilitate implementation, the Basel Committee adopted a Regulatory
Consistency Assessment Programme (RCAP). The RCAP (i) monitors the progress on
implementation and (ii) assesses the consistency and completeness of the adopted
standards. The RCAP also facilitates dialogue among Committee members and aids
the Committee in developing standards.
The assessments are carried out by jurisdiction and by theme. The thematic
focus, currently on risk-based capital, will expand from 2015 to cover Basel III
standards on liquidity, leverage and systemically important banks.

136

BIS 84th Annual Report

In October 2013, the Committee published updated procedures for conducting
jurisdictional assessments. The document will be updated as the scope of the RCAP
expands to include all aspects of the Basel III framework.
An important part of the jurisdictional assessments is to ensure that the
internationally active segment of the domestic banking system conforms to the
letter and spirit of the relevant Basel standards; the assessment does so by
highlighting the current and potential impact of that segment on the overall
regulatory environment. This helps reveal differences within and across jurisdictions
and allows member jurisdictions to initiate corrective measures, as appropriate, to
strengthen and improve the functioning of their regulatory regimes.
This year the RCAP conducted jurisdictional assessments for Switzerland
(published in June 2013), China (September), Brazil (December) and Australia
(March 2014). By end-2014, the RCAP will have completed assessments for all
countries that are home to G-SIBs. By end-2015, it will have completed or initiated
detailed peer reviews of the capital regulations of all 27 member jurisdictions of the
Basel Committee, which together account for more than 90% of global banking
assets.
Progress reports. In April and October 2013, the Committee issued reports providing
a high-level view of Committee members’ progress in adopting Basel II, Basel 2.5
and Basel III. The reports focus on the status of domestic rule-making processes to
ensure that the Committee’s capital standards are transformed into national law or
regulation according to the internationally agreed time frames. The Committee
believes that disclosure will provide an additional incentive for members to fully
comply with the international agreements.
Reports to the G20. In April 2013, the Committee gave updates to the G20 Finance
Ministers and Central Bank Governors on progress in adopting the Basel III
regulatory reforms. The report covered capital and other regulatory standards as
well as banks’ progress in bolstering their capital. It also highlighted specific
shortcomings in implementation that will require continued policy and operational
attention.
In August 2013, the Committee reported to the G20 Leaders on implementation
of Basel III, the further harmonisation of capital regulations across member
jurisdictions and the finalisation of the Basel framework’s remaining post-crisis
reforms. The report also included Committee findings regarding bank calculations
of risk-weighted assets.
Basel III monitoring. Published twice a year, the Committee’s Basel III monitoring
report covers the implications of Basel III for financial markets. The results of the
monitoring exercise assume that the final Basel III package has been fully
implemented. Thus, they do not take account of the transitional arrangements set
out in the Basel III framework, such as the gradual phase-in of deductions from
regulatory capital. The latest report was released in March 2014. It shows that, as of
30 June 2013, the sampled banks’ average CET1 capital ratio under the Basel III
framework was 9.5% for Group 1 (representative of internationally active banks with
Tier 1 capital of more than €3 billion) and 9.1% for Group 2 (representative of all
other banks). The fully phased-in CET1 minimum requirement is 4.5%, and the CET1
target level is 7.0%. The report indicates that shortfalls in the risk-based capital of
large internationally active banks generally continue to shrink.
Liquidity coverage ratio. In January 2014, following a mid-2013 public consultation,
the Committee issued final requirements for banks’ LCR-related disclosures.

BIS 84th Annual Report

137

Internationally active banks in all Committee member jurisdictions will have to
publish their LCR according to a common template to help market participants
consistently assess banks’ liquidity risk position. National authorities will implement
these disclosure standards, and compliance will be required from the date of the
first reporting period after 1 January 2015.
Risk data aggregation and risk reporting. In December 2013, the Committee
published a report that assessed the overall progress of G-SIBs in adopting the
Committee’s Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting. The
principles, issued in January 2013, are designed to help improve risk management,
decision-making and resolvability.
The assessment found that many banks are having difficulties with the initial
stage of implementation, which covers the governance, architecture and processes
for strong data aggregation. Of the 30 banks identified as G-SIBs during 2011 and
2012, 10 reported that they will not be able to comply with the principles by the
1 January 2016 deadline for full implementation, the main reason being the
resources devoted to large multi-year computer and data-related projects.
The Committee will continue to monitor the status of G-SIBs as regards
meeting the deadline. In addition, the Committee urges national supervisors to
apply these principles to institutions identified as domestic SIBs three years after
their designation as such. The Committee believes that the principles can be
applied to a wider range of banks in a way that is appropriate to their size, nature
and complexity.

Simplicity, comparability and risk sensitivity
Having substantially strengthened the banking system’s regulatory framework, the
Committee has now turned to the matter of its complexity and the comparability of
capital adequacy ratios across banks and jurisdictions. The Committee considers it
essential to the ongoing effectiveness of the Basel capital standards to simplify
them where possible and to improve the comparability of their outcomes
(eg regulatory capital, risk-weighted assets and capital ratios).
In 2012, the Committee commissioned a small group of its members to review
the Basel capital framework, aware that, over time, the framework has steadily grown
and that more sophisticated risk measurement methodologies have been introduced.
The goal of the task force was to point to areas of undue complexity within the
framework and opportunities to improve the comparability of its outcomes.
In July 2013, the Committee released a discussion paper on the trade-offs
between the risk sensitivity of the Basel capital standards and their simplicity and
comparability. The goal of the paper was to seek views to help shape the
Committee’s thinking on this question.
Related developments in the analysis of comparability were the Committee’s
release of two studies on the risk-weighting of assets, the first regarding credit risk
in the banking book, and the second regarding market risk in the trading book.
Banking book – risk-weighting of assets for credit risk. In July 2013, the Committee
published its first report on the consistency of weighting for credit risk in the
banking book. Part of the RCAP, the study draws on supervisory data from more
than 100 major banks plus data on sovereign, bank and corporate exposures
collected from 32 major international banks as part of a portfolio benchmarking
exercise.
Risk-weighted assets (RWA) for credit risk in the banking book vary considerably
across banks, mostly because the differences in the riskiness of assets across banks

138

BIS 84th Annual Report

are real. The study found, however, that a material portion of the variation is driven
by differences in bank and supervisory practices regarding the weighting process.
These differences could result in the reported capital ratios of identical portfolios
for some outlier banks varying by as much as 2 percentage points in either direction
from a 10% capital ratio benchmark – potentially a 4 percentage point difference –
although the capital ratios for most banks fall within a narrower range.
The report discusses policy options for minimising such excessive practicebased variations. The Committee considers it critical to improve the comparability
of regulatory capital calculations by banks while maintaining good risk sensitivity.
Trading book – risk-weighting of assets for market risk. The Committee’s December
2013 report on market risk in the trading book follows up on a January 2013 study,
which found that internal models produced a significant variation in market risk
weights and that modelling choices were a significant driver of the variation. The
December study extended that analysis to more representative and complex
trading positions. It confirmed the earlier findings and in addition showed that the
variability in market risk weights typically increases for more complex trading
positions.
Policy recommendations in the December study support reforms identified in
the earlier report, which are being addressed by the Committee’s ongoing reviews
of the trading book framework and Pillar 3 (market discipline) requirements for
disclosure. These reform areas are:
•
improving public disclosure and the collection of regulatory data to aid the
understanding of weighting for market risk;
•
narrowing the range of modelling choices for banks; and
•
further harmonising supervisory practices with regard to model approvals.

Improving the effectiveness of supervision
The global financial crisis underscored the crucial importance of supervision for
financial stability and for the effective functioning of the policy framework.
Sound capital planning. In January 2014, the Committee issued A sound capital
planning process: fundamental elements, which brings together recent supervisory
thinking on important lessons from the financial crisis concerning weak capital
planning.
During and after the crisis, certain jurisdictions conducted ad hoc stress tests to
assess capital adequacy at banks. Because of the pressing need to determine
whether banks were appropriately capitalised, those first rounds of official stress
tests often did not include an assessment of the processes banks employ to project
potential capital needs and to manage capital sources and uses. More recently,
supervisors have begun to codify their expectations for what constitutes sound
processes for capital planning. Those processes help banks judge the appropriate
amount and composition of capital needed to support their business strategies
across a range of potential scenarios and outcomes.
Supervisory colleges. A consultative document published by the Committee in
January 2014, Revised good practice principles for supervisory colleges, updates the
original document, published in October 2010, which included a commitment to
take stock of any key lessons learned from their use. The January consultative
report follows a review of the challenges encountered in implementation and
possible areas of additional best practice. The review took into account the
perspectives of home and host supervisors and internationally active banks.

139

Money laundering and financing of terrorism. In January 2014, following a mid2013 consultative period, the Committee issued Sound management of risks
related to money laundering and financing of terrorism, a set of guidelines
describing how banks should include such risks within their overall risk
management framework. The guidelines are consistent with those in International
standards on combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism and
proliferation, issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2012, and
supplement their goals and objectives. The Committee’s guidelines include crossreferences to FATF standards to help banks comply with national requirements
based on those standards.
Market-based indicators of liquidity. Also in January 2014, the Committee
published information to assist supervisors in their evaluation of the liquidity
profile of assets held by banks. The document, Guidance for supervisors on
market-based indicators of liquidity, also helps promote greater consistency in the
classification of so-called high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) across jurisdictions in
the context of the Basel III LCR. The guidance does not change the definition of
HQLA within the LCR; rather, it helps supervisors assess whether assets are suitably
liquid for LCR purposes.
Intraday liquidity management. In April 2013, the Committee issued the final
version of its Monitoring tools for intraday liquidity management. The seven
quantitative tools were developed in consultation with the CPSS to help banking
supervisors better monitor a bank’s management of intraday liquidity risk and its
ability to meet its payment and settlement obligations. They complement the
qualitative guidance in the Committee’s 2008 Principles for sound liquidity risk
management and supervision.
Introduced for monitoring purposes only, the tools will also help supervisors
gain a better understanding of banks’ payment and settlement behaviour.
Internationally active banks will be required to apply them; national supervisors will
determine the extent to which the tools apply to non-internationally active banks
within their jurisdictions. Monthly reporting of the monitoring tools will commence
from 1 January 2015 to coincide with the implementation of the LCR reporting
requirements.
External audits. The financial crisis revealed the need to improve the quality of
external audits of banks. Following a public consultation in 2013, the Committee
published External audits of banks in March 2014. Its 16 principles and
accompanying explanatory guidance describe supervisory expectations regarding
audit quality and how they relate to the external auditor’s work in a bank.
Joint Forum publications. During the past year, the Joint Forum2 issued publications
on mortgage insurance, longevity risk and point of sale disclosures.
•
Mortgage insurance: market structure, underwriting cycle and policy implications
Published in August 2013 after a comment period, this report examines the
interaction of mortgage insurers with mortgage originators and underwriters. It
makes a series of recommendations for policymakers and supervisors that aim to
reduce the likelihood of mortgage insurance stress and failure in times of crisis.

The Joint Forum was established in 1996 under the aegis of the Basel Committee, IOSCO and the
IAIS to deal with issues common to the banking, securities and insurance sectors, including the
regulation of financial conglomerates. Its membership consists of senior supervisors from the three
sectors (www.bis.org/bcbs/jointforum.htm).

2013 following a comment period, the guidance considers risk transfer markets
and makes recommendations for supervisors and policymakers.
Point of sale disclosure in the insurance, banking and securities sectors
Published for consultation in August 2013, the report assesses differences and
gaps in regulatory approaches to point of sale (POS) disclosure for investment
and savings products across the insurance, banking and securities sectors. The
report considers whether POS disclosures need to be further aligned across
sectors, and it includes recommendations to assist policymakers and
supervisors in addressing that question.

Committee on the Global Financial System
The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) monitors financial market
developments for the Governors of the BIS Global Economy Meeting and analyses
the implications of these developments for financial stability and central bank
policy. The CGFS is chaired by William C Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. Committee members are Deputy Governors and other senior
officials from 23 central banks of major advanced and emerging market economies
and the Economic Adviser of the BIS.
Among the focal points of the Committee’s discussions during the past year
were the challenges posed by the eventual exit of major central banks from their
current accommodative policies and the resulting implications for financial markets.
Cross-market spillovers from exit, including reversals in capital flows, were a key
aspect of this topic. Committee members also examined risks posed by financial
imbalances that may have built up during the recent period of monetary
accommodation and the possibility of addressing them through macroprudential
policy. Also discussed were sovereign and banking sector risks in the euro area, the
budgetary stand-off in the United States, and the risks posed by macroeconomic
and financial developments in China and other key emerging market economies.
A number of in-depth analyses and longer-term projects have been
commissioned by the Committee from groups of central bank experts. Three of
these groups produced public reports during the year.
The rising demand for collateral assets. The first report, issued in May 2013, explored
the increasing demand for collateral assets arising from regulatory reform and other
developments. It found that endogenous market adjustments are likely to prevent any
lasting system-wide scarcity of collateral assets. The report argued that policy
responses therefore need to focus primarily on those market adjustments and their
implications, rather than on supply-demand conditions for the assets. Later in the
year, key market responses, including collateral transformation and optimisation
activities, were investigated further in an informal workshop with industry participants.
Trade finance. The second report, published in January, examined the interplay
between changes in trade finance and international trade. It found that trade
finance has historically posed little financial stability risk. It noted, however, that
when banks run down their trade finance assets in response to strains, the trade
finance market can transmit stress from the financial system to the real economy.

Therefore, policies that broadly address weaknesses in bank capital and liquidity
and encourage competition – aspects of current regulatory efforts – were found to
generally provide an effective means for avoiding or containing disruptions to
trade finance flows.
Banking systems in emerging market economies (EMEs). In March, a report provided
indications that banking groups headquartered in EMEs are starting to play a
greater role in regional financial systems. That process, however, has not yet
reached a point where it would significantly change the risk profile of EME banking
systems. Yet over time there may be broader effects that warrant strengthening the
regulatory environment and market infrastructures and providing crisis prevention
and resolution measures.

Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems
The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) promotes the safety
and efficiency of payment, clearing, settlement and reporting systems and
arrangements, thereby supporting financial stability and the wider economy.
Comprising senior officials from 25 central banks, the CPSS is a recognised global
standard setter in its field. It also serves as a forum for central banks to monitor and
analyse developments concerning payment, clearing and settlement within and
across jurisdictions and to cooperate in related policy and oversight matters. The
Committee Chair is Benoît Cœuré, a member of the Executive Board of the
European Central Bank.

Monitoring implementation of standards for financial market infrastructures
The CPSS-IOSCO Principles for financial market infrastructures (PFMIs report),
published in April 2012, sets out international standards for systemically important
FMIs – payment systems, central securities depositories, securities settlement systems,
central counterparties (CCPs) and trade repositories. The PFMIs report also specifies
five responsibilities for the authorities that oversee or regulate the FMIs, including
effective cooperation between authorities where more than one is involved.
Monitoring the consistent, complete and timely implementation of the PFMIs
is a high priority for the CPSS and involves three phases: (i) Have the legislation and
related rules to enable implementation been adopted? (ii) Are the legislation and
related rules complete and consistent with the PFMIs? (iii) Has implementation of
the new standards produced consistent outcomes?
In August 2013, the CPSS and IOSCO published the results of the first phase of
monitoring. The report showed that most jurisdictions had begun enactment of the
necessary laws and rules. Although few had completed the process for all types of
FMIs, the results represented substantial progress during the relatively brief period
since the PFMIs report was issued.
Continued monitoring and regular updates for the first phase are planned until
all jurisdictions have completed the legal and regulatory framework. In February
2014, the CPSS and IOSCO also started the second phase of the monitoring process.

Recovery of financial market infrastructures
In August 2013, the CPSS and IOSCO released a consultative report, Recovery of
financial market infrastructures. The report gives guidance to financial market

142

BIS 84th Annual Report

infrastructures such as CCPs on developing plans to enable them to recover from
threats to their viability and financial strength that might prevent them from
continuing to provide critical services. It was produced in response to comments
received on an earlier CPSS-IOSCO report, Recovery and resolution of financial
market infrastructures, that requested more guidance on what recovery tools would
be appropriate for FMIs.

Authorities’ access to trade repository data
A report issued by the CPSS and IOSCO in August 2013 outlines the framework to
guide authorities’ regular and ad hoc access to data held in trade repositories. The
guidance expands on issues of access addressed in the January 2012 CPSS-IOSCO
publication on aggregation and reporting of data on OTC derivatives.

Non-banks in retail payments
The CPSS is studying the role of non-banks in retail payments. It is analysing the
factors that explain the growing importance of non-banks in this area, the possible
risks and the differing regulatory approaches of the various CPSS jurisdictions.

Payment aspects of financial inclusion
The CPSS, in cooperation with the World Bank, has recently started to explore the
links between payment systems and financial inclusion.

Cyber-security in FMIs
The CPSS has begun analysing cyber-security issues and their implications for FMIs
in view of the operational risk principle set out in the PFMIs report.

Red Book statistics
In December 2013, the CPSS published its annual update of Statistics on payment,
clearing and settlement systems in the CPSS countries.

Markets Committee
The Markets Committee is a forum for senior central bank officials to jointly monitor
developments in financial markets and assess their implications for the operations
of central banks. The Committee’s membership comprises 21 central banks.
In June 2013, the BIS Global Economy Meeting appointed Guy Debelle,
Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, as Chair of the Committee. He
succeeded Hiroshi Nakaso, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, who had served
as Chair since June 2006.
The timing of the Federal Reserve’s decision to scale back its pace of asset
purchases and the Bank of Japan’s new monetary policy framework (quantitative
and qualitative easing) shaped the Committee’s discussion during the year. The
Committee monitored the impact of these developments in emerging market
economies especially closely.
Moreover, the Committee discussed the greater emphasis on forward policy
guidance in some advanced economies; money market developments in China; and

BIS 84th Annual Report

143

the emerging contours of the ECB’s comprehensive assessment of credit institutions.
Uncertainties surrounding the debt limit and government shutdown in the United
States in late 2013 prompted a close dialogue among Committee members to
discuss potential market implications.
In addition to monitoring near-term market developments, the Committee also
devoted time to the potential longer-term market effects of new and evolving
financial regulations. The Committee’s deliberations included discussions on swap
execution facilities and European Commission proposals for a financial transaction
tax and the regulation of financial benchmarks. The Committee also discussed the
design of foreign exchange benchmarks.
Under the auspices of the Markets Committee, the BIS and 53 participating
central banks conducted the 2013 Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign
Exchange Market Activity. Trading in foreign exchange markets averaged
$5.3 trillion per day in April 2013, up from $4.0 trillion in April 2010. The Committee
reviewed the usefulness of the survey’s expanded coverage of currency pairs and of
the refinements introduced in the survey categories for counterparty and execution
methods. To aid the design of future Triennial Surveys, the Committee organised a
January 2014 workshop with private sector participants regarding execution
methods for foreign exchange transactions.

Central Bank Governance Group
The Central Bank Governance Group comprises nine central bank Governors and is
chaired by Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia. It serves as a
venue for information exchange on the design and operation of central banks as
public policy institutions. The Group also suggests priorities for BIS work carried out
on these topics through the almost 50 central banks that make up the Central Bank
Governance Network. Central bank officials have access to the results of numerous
surveys on governance topics conducted among Network central banks as well as
other governance research, and selected material is published.
The Governance Group convened during several BIS bimonthly meetings to
study the evolving circumstances of central banks. The Group discussed the postcrisis organisational issues faced by central banks that have a major responsibility
for banking supervision, surveyed the organisation of financial risk management
within central banks, and discussed the challenges faced in communicating policy
actions and intentions in uncertain times. The information and insights provided
help central banks assess the effectiveness of their own arrangements as well as the
alternatives available.

Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics
The Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC) addresses statistical
topics related to monetary and financial stability. The IFC comprises more
than 80 central banks worldwide, including almost all BIS members, and is
currently chaired by Muhammad Ibrahim, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank
of Malaysia.
The Committee and various central banks co-sponsored workshops and
meetings on the following topics: balance of payments issues (Bank of France); the
integrated management of micro-databases (Bank of Portugal); and measuring

BIS 84th Annual Report

structural change in the financial system, especially regarding shadow banking
(People’s Bank of China). It also organised six sessions at the 59th biennial World
Statistics Congress of the International Statistical Institute (ISI), held in Hong Kong
SAR. The IFC’s sessions covered data methodologies and compilation exercises
related to five sets of financial and economic variables: bank interest rates, real
effective exchange rates, inflation measures, external debt and capital flows. At the
Congress, the IFC became an affiliated member of the ISI.
The Committee has set up a task force to analyse data sharing between
central bank statistical departments and bank supervisors so as to support
research and policy analysis relating to financial stability. The group has made an
inventory of approaches taken in different countries, and it is identifying good
practices that will allow central banks and supervisors to benchmark their national
arrangements.
The IFC’s 2013 annual report was endorsed by the BIS All Governors’ Meeting
in January and was published in February.

Financial Stability Institute
The Financial Stability Institute (FSI) assists supervisory authorities worldwide in
their oversight of financial systems by fostering a solid understanding of prudential
standards and good supervisory practice.
The FSI helps supervisors to implement reforms developed by international
standard-setting bodies by explaining the concepts and detail of the reforms and
their implications for supervision. It carries out these tasks through a range of
channels, including high-level meetings, seminars and the internet. Its online
information resource and learning tool, FSI Connect, is used by financial sector
supervisors at all levels of experience and expertise.
The FSI annually surveys selected countries’ implementation of the Basel
framework and publishes the results on the BIS website. The 2013 survey results,
combined with work by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, show that
100 countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing Basel II, and
72 countries are implementing Basel III.

Meetings, seminars and conferences
The FSI’s extensive programme of high-level meetings, seminars and conferences is
targeted at banking and insurance supervisors and central bank financial stability
experts. Over the past year, approximately 1,700 participants attended 41 banking
events and nine insurance seminars.
The annual high-level regional meetings for Deputy Governors of central banks
and heads of supervisory authorities, organised jointly with the BCBS, took place in
Africa, Asia, central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Topics
included financial stability, macroprudential tools and policies, regulatory priorities
and other key supervisory issues.
The FSI held banking seminars in Basel and collaborated with the following
supervisory groups for seminars elsewhere:
•
Africa – Committee of Bank Supervisors of West and Central Africa (BSWCA);
Southern African Development Community (SADC)
•
Americas – Association of Supervisors of Banks of the Americas (ASBA); Center
for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA); Caribbean Group of Banking
Supervisors (CGBS)

as well as in Africa, Asia, central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle
East.
The seminars last year focused on the revised BCBS and IAIS core principles,
risk-based supervision, macroprudential policies and systemic risk assessment, and
Basel III capital and risk-based solvency.

FSI Connect
FSI Connect is used by more than 9,800 subscribers from 250 central banks and
banking and insurance supervisory authorities. It offers more than 230 tutorials
covering a wide range of regulatory policy and supervisory topics. Recently released
tutorials cover supervisory intensity and effectiveness, public awareness of deposit
insurance systems, macroprudential supervision, group-wide supervision and onsite inspection processes for insurance supervisors, and pricing of life insurance
products.

Activities of BIS-hosted associations in 2013/14
This section reviews the year’s principal activities of the three associations hosted
by the BIS in Basel.

Financial Stability Board
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) coordinates at the international level the financial
stability work of national authorities and international standard-setting bodies; and
it develops and promotes financial sector policies to enhance global financial
stability.3
Its membership consists of finance ministries, central banks,4 and financial
supervisory and regulatory authorities in 24 countries and territories;5 the European

Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission; and international financial
institutions and standard-setting bodies.6
The FSB, chaired by Mark Carney,7 operates through Plenary meetings of its
membership; the Plenary appoints the Chair of the FSB and a Steering Committee.
The FSB also has four Standing Committees:
•
Assessment of Vulnerabilities – chaired by Agustín Carstens, Governor of the
Bank of Mexico;
•
Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation – chaired by Daniel Tarullo, member
of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System;
•
Standards Implementation – chaired by Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the
Monetary Authority of Singapore; and
•
Budget and Resources – chaired by Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche
Bundesbank.
To facilitate its interaction with a wider group of countries, the Plenary
has established six regional consultative groups (for the Americas, Asia, the
Commonwealth of Independent States, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa,
and sub-Saharan Africa). These groups bring FSB members together with institutions
from about 65 non-member jurisdictions to discuss vulnerabilities affecting regional
and global financial systems and the current and potential financial stability
initiatives of the FSB and member jurisdictions.
The Plenary has also established various working groups, which cover a number
of technical areas.
Plenary meetings were held in June and November 2013 and in March 2014.
As detailed below, the FSB was active in a wide range of areas during the year, and
several policy initiatives were endorsed at the September 2013 St Petersburg
Summit of the G20 Leaders.

Reducing the moral hazard posed by systemically important financial
institutions (SIFIs)
Endorsed by the G20 Leaders at their 2010 Seoul Summit, the FSB’s framework to
address the systemic risks and moral hazard associated with SIFIs contains three key
elements:
•
a resolution framework to ensure that all financial institutions can be quickly
resolved without destabilising the financial system and exposing the taxpayer
to risk of loss;
•
higher loss absorbency for SIFIs to reflect the greater risks they pose for the
global financial system; and
•
more intense supervisory oversight for SIFIs.
Resolution of SIFIs. In July, the FSB published Guidance on recovery triggers and
stress scenarios covering three key aspects of recovery and resolution planning:
(i) developing the scenarios and triggers that should be used in recovery plans for
global SIFIs (G-SIFIs); (ii) developing resolution strategies and associated operational
resolution plans tailored to different group structures; and (iii) identifying the

functions that should remain in operation during resolution to maintain systemic
stability.
In August, the FSB published three consultative papers regarding its October
2011 document Key attributes of effective resolution regimes for financial institutions
(hereafter in text and titles, Key attributes).
On 12 August, it released Application of the Key attributes to non-bank financial
institutions. When final, the guidance is intended to form additional annexes to the
Key attributes on the following topics:
•
the resolution of financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and of systemically
important FMI participants;
•
the resolution of insurers; and
•
client asset protection in resolution.
Also on 12 August, the FSB released Information sharing for resolution purposes,
which covers standards for confidentiality and statutory safeguards for information
sharing within cross-border crisis management groups and for institution-specific
cross-border cooperation agreements.
On 28 August, the FSB published Assessment methodology for the Key attributes,
which proposes criteria for assessing jurisdictions’ compliance with the Key
attributes and offers guidance on related legislative reforms. The FSB developed the
draft methodology in conjunction with the IMF, World Bank and standard-setting
bodies.
Higher loss absorbency. In November 2013, the FSB released the annual update to
its list of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) using end-2012 data; it was
based on a revised methodology that was published by the BCBS in July 2013. One
bank was added to the list, increasing the overall number from 28 to 29.
The list distributes the banks across the lower four of the five levels of required
additional loss absorbency (additional common equity) for G-SIBs. The five levels
range from 1% to 3.5% of risk-weighted assets, according to the level of systemic
risk posed by the bank. The highest level (3.5%) is currently kept empty as a
disincentive for G-SIBs to increase their systemic importance. Starting from 2016,
the additional loss absorbency will be phased in over three years, initially for those
banks in the November 2014 list.8
In July 2013, the FSB published an initial list of nine global systemically
important insurers (G-SIIs), using the IAIS assessment methodology and end-2011
data. Starting from November 2014, the list of G-SIIs will be updated and published
annually by the FSB. In July 2014, in consultation with the IAIS and national
authorities, the FSB will determine the systemic status of, and appropriate risk
mitigating measures for, major reinsurers. The IAIS also published policy measures
for G-SIIs and an overall framework for macroprudential policy and surveillance in
insurance, which were endorsed by the FSB.
More intense supervisory oversight. In November 2013, the FSB published Principles
for an effective risk appetite framework and the consultation paper Guidance on
supervisory interaction with financial institutions on risk culture. These papers form
part of the FSB’s initiative to increase the intensity and effectiveness of supervision,
which is a key component of the policy response to the problem of firms that are
“too big to fail”. Supervisory expectations for firms’ risk management functions and
overall risk governance frameworks are increasing, as these were areas that
exhibited significant weaknesses during the global financial crisis.

BIS 84th Annual Report

In April 2014, the FSB will publish its final version of the guidance regarding
risk culture, which will incorporate the feedback from the public consultation and
report on efforts to enhance supervisory effectiveness.
Extending the framework. The FSB and standard-setting bodies continue to extend
the SIFI framework to additional types of financial institutions. In January 2014,
the FSB and IOSCO published for public consultation Assessment methodologies
for identifying non-bank non-insurer global systemically important financial
institutions (NBNI G-SIFIs). The document proposes methodologies for the
identification of NBNI G-SIFIs, but it does not identify specific institutions, nor
does it propose any policy measures. Policies will be developed once the
methodologies are finalised.
Improving the OTC derivatives markets. The G20 has made commitments to improve
the functioning, transparency and oversight of the OTC derivatives markets through
increased standardisation, central clearing, organised platform trading and
reporting of all trades to trade repositories (TRs). The FSB published progress
updates on the reforms in April and September 2013, and it continues to work with
member jurisdictions to complete the reforms, settle remaining cross-border issues
and ensure the consistency of implementation across jurisdictions.
The FSB has set up a study group to consider how the data reported to TRs can
be effectively used by authorities, in particular by aggregating the data. In February
2014, the FSB published a consultation paper that analyses the options for
aggregating TR data on OTC derivatives.

Strengthening the oversight and regulation of shadow banking
The shadow banking system – credit intermediation involving entities and activities
outside the regulated banking system – can be a source of systemic risk both
directly and through its interconnections with the regular banking system. Shadow
banking can also create opportunities for arbitrage that might undermine stricter
bank regulation and lead to a build-up of additional leverage and risks in the
financial system as a whole.
In August 2013, after a comment period, the FSB published revised policy
recommendations to strengthen the oversight and regulation of the shadow
banking system and mitigate its potential systemic risks. The recommendations
focus on five areas:
•
spillovers between the regular banking system and the shadow banking system;
•
the susceptibility of money market funds (MMFs) to “runs”;
•
the incentives associated with securitisation;
•
the risks and procyclical incentives associated with securities financing
transactions that may exacerbate funding strains in times of market stress; and
•
systemic risks posed by other shadow banking entities and activities.
The recommendations are now largely finalised with the exception of the
proposals for securities financing transactions, which will be further refined.
In November 2013, the FSB released its third annual monitoring report on
global trends and risks of the shadow banking system, including innovations and
changes that could lead to growing systemic risks and regulatory arbitrage. The
report includes data from 25 jurisdictions and the euro area as a whole, which
represent about 80% of global GDP and 90% of global financial system assets. For
the first time, the report also incorporates estimates from a hedge fund survey by
IOSCO.

Credit ratings
In August 2013, the FSB released a progress report and an interim peer review
report on the work by standard setters and national authorities to accelerate their
implementation of the FSB’s October 2010 guidance on reducing reliance on credit
rating agency ratings. The goal of the guidance is twofold: to eliminate mechanistic
market reliance on ratings, which is a cause of herding and cliff effects that can amplify
procyclicality and cause systemic disruption; and to create incentives for market
participants to improve their independent credit risk assessments and due diligence.
The second stage of the peer review will analyse planned actions to reduce
reliance on the ratings; and it will report on progress with alternative measures of
credit risk and the strengthening of banks’ internal credit risk assessment processes.
The FSB intends to issue the final peer review report in 2014.

Financial benchmarks
The G20 has tasked the FSB with promoting consistency in the various efforts to
improve the reliability and robustness of interbank benchmark interest rates. The
FSB has established a high-level Official Sector Steering Group (OSSG) of regulators
and central banks to coordinate reviews of existing interest rate benchmarks. The
OSSG will also guide a Market Participants Group, which will examine the feasibility
of adopting additional reference rates and potential transition issues. The OSSG will
report to the FSB by June 2014.

Addressing data gaps
The global financial crisis highlighted major gaps in information on globally active
financial institutions. The FSB is developing a common data template with which
G-SIBs can analyse their exposures and funding dependencies by counterparty, and
their concentration by country, market, currency, sector and instrument. The
international data hub that is collecting these data is hosted by the BIS and became
fully operational in the second quarter of 2013 with the assembly of harmonised
data on credit exposures of G-SIBS. In October 2013, the FSB and IMF published
their Fourth progress report on the implementation of the G-20 data gaps initiative,
which reported considerable progress.

Advancing transparency through the legal entity identifier (LEI)
The objective of the global LEI system is to provide unique identification of parties
to financial transactions across the globe. The G20 endorsed the June 2012 FSB
report A global legal entity identifier for financial markets, and an interim system
has been launched. A key building block of an improved financial data infrastructure,
the LEI will facilitate the achievement of many financial stability and risk
management objectives as well as reduce operational risk within firms.
The Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) was established in January 2013 as
a standalone body responsible for governance of the global LEI system and to
ensure that it serves the public interest. It has asked the FSB to act as the founder
of the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF), and the FSB is undertaking a due diligence
review of the possibility. The GLEIF will be established as a not-for-profit foundation
under Swiss law to act as the operational arm of the LEI system. It will support the
worldwide application of uniform operational standards and protocols set by the
ROC and support the maintenance of a centralised database of identifiers and
corresponding reference data.

BIS 84th Annual Report

Strengthening accounting standards
The G20 and FSB support the development of a single set of high-quality global
accounting standards. The FSB continues to encourage the IASB and the Financial
Accounting Standards Board to complete their convergence project, and it is
monitoring their progress in implementing specific G20 and FSB accounting
recommendations. The two boards made further progress in 2013. Work in the key
areas of accounting for the impairment of loans and for insurance contracts is
scheduled to be completed in 2014.

Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF)
The EDTF is a private sector initiative to enhance the risk disclosure practices of
major banks. It issued principles and recommendations for such disclosures in
October 2012. In August 2013, it published a survey on the level and quality of
implementation as it appeared in the major banks’ 2012 annual reports. The FSB
has asked the EDTF to undertake another survey in 2014.

Monitoring implementation and strengthening adherence to international
standards
The FSB’s Coordination Framework for Implementation Monitoring (CFIM)
mandates that implementation of reforms in priority areas (those deemed by the
FSB to be particularly important for global financial stability) should be subject to
more intensive monitoring and detailed reporting. Current priority areas are the
Basel II, Basel 2.5 and Basel III frameworks; the OTC derivatives market reforms;
compensation practices; policy measures for G-SIFIs; resolution frameworks; and
shadow banking. Detailed reporting of progress in implementation, conducted in
cooperation with relevant standard-setting bodies, has begun in several of these
areas, and the FSB will extend and deepen monitoring in 2014.
In August, the FSB published the second progress report on member
jurisdictions’ adoption of the FSB’s principles for sound compensation practices,
issued in September 2009.
The FSB’s most intensive monitoring mechanism is the peer review
programme. It is conducted through its Standing Committee on Standards
Implementation to evaluate member jurisdictions’ adoption of international
financial standards and FSB policies. In 2013, the FSB completed country peer
reviews of South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. Three other
peer reviews began in 2013 and will be completed in 2014: the thematic review of
reducing reliance on ratings issued by credit rating agencies and country reviews
of Indonesia and Germany.
In December 2013, the FSB published an update on its initiative to promote
jurisdictions’ adherence to standards for international supervisory and regulatory
cooperation and information exchange. This annual update provides information
on all jurisdictions evaluated under the initiative, including those identified as noncooperative.

Impact of regulatory reforms on emerging market and developing
economies (EMDEs)
As requested by the G20, and in consultation with standard-setting bodies and
international financial institutions, the FSB reports on significant unintended
consequences of internationally agreed reforms and of measures taken to address

BIS 84th Annual Report

151

them. In September 2013, the FSB published an update of monitoring developments,
which draws in part on the findings of a workshop organised in May 2013 on
experiences among EMDEs. It also draws on discussions in FSB regional consultative
groups and input from FSB members. The FSB will continue to report on the effects
of reforms on EMDEs as part of its overall implementation monitoring framework.

Financial regulatory factors affecting the availability of long-term finance
In August 2013, the FSB updated the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank
Governors on financial regulatory factors affecting the supply of long-term investment
finance. The FSB’s monitoring of this issue will continue as part of a broader study of
long-term finance being undertaken for the G20 by international organisations.

International Association of Deposit Insurers
The International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) is the global standardsetting body for deposit insurance systems. It contributes to the stability of financial
systems by enhancing the effectiveness of deposit insurance and, in active
partnership with other international organisations, by promoting international
cooperation on deposit insurance and bank resolution arrangements. IADI also
provides guidance on establishing and enhancing deposit insurance systems.
Jerzy Pruski, President of the Management Board of Poland’s Bank Guarantee
Fund, serves as the President of IADI and the Chair of its Executive Council.
The theme of IADI’s 13th Annual General Meeting and Conference, held in
Buenos Aires, was “Navigating through the financial reform landscape”. Topics
included changes in the global financial landscape; the response of deposit
insurance and the banking sector to the financial crisis; financial safety net design;
deposit insurance funding arrangements and reforms in bank resolution regimes;
and contingency planning for bank failures.
IADI took action to advance the four strategic priorities it adopted in 2013, as
follows.

Enhance IADI standards and evaluations
To enhance its standards and the evaluations based on them, IADI established a
steering committee in February 2013 to propose a revision of its Core principles for
effective deposit insurance systems.9 In January 2014, IADI provided the committee’s
revisions for discussion by a Joint Working Group consisting of the BCBS, FSB, IMF,
World Bank, European Commission and European Forum of Deposit Insurers. In
June, the IADI Executive Council will consider the final version, which will later be
presented to the FSB as an update to the FSB’s key standards.

Conduct research and develop guidance on insurance and resolution
As a member of the FSB’s Resolution Steering Group, IADI is contributing to the
design of an international standard for the resolution of failed financial institutions.
9

152

IADI’s core principles are part of the FSB’s key standards for sound financial systems and are used
in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted by the IMF and World Bank. IADI
experts participate in FSAP evaluations and in IMF and World Bank technical assistance
programmes.

BIS 84th Annual Report

A key issue for deposit insurers and resolution regimes is the use of bail-in for a
bank resolution. IADI initiated a research project to identify strategies and guidance
for the application of bail-in for deposit insurance systems.
IADI continued to advance its research on ex ante funding for deposit insurance
funds and multiple deposit insurance systems within one jurisdiction. It also
published guidance on mitigating moral hazard through early detection and timely
intervention; and it issued a research paper on financial inclusion.
IADI is enhancing its database of global deposit insurance systems through
updates from research surveys, including its own annual survey of deposit insurers.
IADI posted on its public website a selection of results from its third annual survey;
full results are available to IADI members, the FSB and the BIS.
More than 200 participants attended IADI’s Second Bi-Annual Research
Conference, which presented current research related to the conference theme,
“Evolution of the deposit insurance framework: design features and resolution
regimes”.

Strengthen deposit insurance systems
IADI introduced a Self-Assessment Technical Assistance Program (SATAP). Under the
SATAP, IADI experts assist deposit insurer members in evaluating their insurance
systems and, as needed, in developing a reform programme.
In August 2013, IADI and the FSI held their third annual joint seminar on bank
resolution and deposit insurance. Since 2008, IADI has collaborated with the FSI to
produce eight online tutorials on deposit insurance systems.
IADI hosted global and regional seminars on various topics including
reimbursement of deposit insurance, Islamic deposit insurance issues, integrated
protection schemes and contingency planning for effective resolutions.

Expand membership and strengthen its support
This year, nine deposit insurers joined IADI, bringing its coverage of all explicit
deposit insurance systems to 65% and the total number of organisations affiliated
with IADI to 96. To address IADI’s growth and strengthen its support of the
membership, the Executive Council approved the establishment of a Research Unit
in the Secretariat to enhance IADI’s participation in research on current policy
issues.

International Association of Insurance Supervisors
The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is the global standardsetting body for the insurance sector. Its purpose is to promote effective and
globally consistent supervision and contribute to global financial stability so that
policyholders may benefit from fair, safe and stable insurance markets.
Peter Braumüller, a director in Austria’s Financial Market Authority, chairs the IAIS
Executive Committee.

Financial stability
In July 2013, the IAIS released its assessment methodology and policy measures
for G-SIIs, which were endorsed by the FSB. It also released a framework for
implementing macroprudential policy and surveillance (MPS) in the insurance

BIS 84th Annual Report

153

sector. The focus of the MPS framework is on enhancing the supervisory capacity
to identify, assess and mitigate macro-financial vulnerabilities that could lead to
severe and widespread financial risk. The MPS framework is being refined by
developing guidance on related IAIS insurance core principles and by developing
a toolkit and data template of early warning risk measures for stress testing.

Insurance core principles
At its October general meeting, the IAIS revised Insurance Core Principle (ICP) 22,
which covers anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism, and
adopted an “applications paper” on the same subject. This revision is an update to
the October 2011 Insurance core principles, standards, guidance and assessment
methodology. In October, the IAIS also adopted “issues papers” on policyholder
protection schemes and the supervision of cross-border operations through
branches.

ComFrame
In October, the IAIS issued the final consultation draft of the Common Framework
for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (ComFrame), which
builds on the IAIS insurance core principles. In 2014, after any modifications arising
from the comment period, field testing of ComFrame will begin so that it can be
further modified as necessary before formal adoption in 2018. Members are to
begin implementation of ComFrame in 2019.

Global insurance capital standard
In October, the IAIS announced its plan to develop the first-ever risk-based global
insurance capital standard (ICS), which will be a part of ComFrame. Full
implementation of the ICS will thus begin in 2019 after two years of testing and
refinement with supervisors and internationally active insurance groups.
The IAIS also began developing basic capital requirements (BCRs), which
are scheduled to be finalised and ready for implementation by G-SIIs in late
2014. BCRs will undergird the higher loss absorbency requirements for GSIIs,
and their development and testing is expected to also support development of
the ICS.

Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding
Insurance supervisors that are signatories to the IAIS Multilateral Memorandum of
Understanding (MMoU) participate in a global framework for cooperation and
information exchange. The memorandum sets minimum standards to which
signatories must adhere, and all applicants are subject to review and approval by
an independent team of IAIS members. By participating in the MMoU, supervisors
are better able to promote the financial stability of cross-border insurance
operations for the benefit of consumers. The MMoU currently has 39 signatories
representing more than 54% of worldwide premium volume.

Coordinated Implementation Framework
The Coordinated Implementation Framework (CIF), adopted in October 2013, sets
forth key principles and strategies to guide the IAIS’s extensive work in monitoring
its members’ implementation of IAIS supervisory material. The CIF establishes a

154

BIS 84th Annual Report

programme of working with associations of supervisors around the world on
regional implementation.
Central to the CIF is leveraging the work of partners. One of these partners,
the Access to Insurance Initiative (A2ii), advances capacity building in inclusive
insurance markets. Such markets are a critical area of attention for standard-setting
bodies under the G20’s Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion.

Self-assessment and peer reviews
In October, the IAIS released an aggregate report containing the findings from two
self-assessment and peer reviews (SAPRs) conducted on ICP 1 (Objectives, Powers
and Responsibilities of the Supervisor), ICP 2 (Supervisor) and ICP 23 (Group-Wide
Supervision). The IAIS is committed to reviewing all ICPs through the SAPR process
by the end of 2016. The outcome of these assessments will help identify areas
in which the ICPs may need to be revised, which was the case with the SAPR for
ICP 23; the results will also feed into IAIS education activities.

Joint Forum publications
The Joint Forum, which the IAIS co-established in 1996, issued publications during
the past year on mortgage insurance, longevity risk and point of sale disclosures
(more details are given above, at the end of the section on the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision).

Economic analysis, research and statistics
The BIS provides in-depth economic analysis and research on policy issues
regarding macroeconomic, monetary and financial stability. These activities are
carried out by the Monetary and Economic Department (MED) at the head office in
Basel and at the BIS Representative Offices in Hong Kong SAR and Mexico City. The
BIS also compiles and disseminates international statistics on financial institutions
and markets.

Analysis and research in the Basel Process
BIS economists produce analytical background documents and research papers on
issues of importance to central banks and financial supervisory authorities. In
particular, such work is prepared for the regular meetings of Governors and other
senior central bank officials. MED also provides analytical and statistical support to
the BIS-hosted committees and associations.
BIS researchers collaborate with central bank and academic economists and
participate in research conferences and networks. Such engagements foster
international cooperation in policy research and analysis, stimulate the exchange of
ideas and enhance the quality of the Bank’s work.
The BIS itself organises conferences and workshops designed to bring
together participants from the worlds of policy, research and business. Of
these gatherings, the flagship event for central bank Governors is the BIS
Annual Conference. In June 2013, the 12th BIS Annual Conference – “Navigating
the Great Recession: what role for monetary policy?” – focused on the nature
of the Great Recession and its aftermath. Papers considered the appropriate

BIS 84th Annual Report

155

policy mix, the risk of overburdening monetary policy, the relevance of global
spillovers and the advancement of monetary policy cooperation in this evolving
environment.
Most BIS analysis and research is published through the principal outlets on
the Bank’s website (www.bis.org) – the Annual Report, the BIS Quarterly Review, BIS
Papers and BIS Working Papers. BIS economists also publish in professional journals
and other external publications.
BIS research: www.bis.org/forum/research.htm

Research topics
Reflecting the Bank’s mission, the focus of BIS research is on monetary and financial
stability. In recent years, the principal themes of the work have been the challenges
posed by the global financial crisis and its longer-term policy implications. During
the past year, BIS research devoted special attention to three areas: financial
intermediation; new frameworks for monetary and financial stability policies; and
the global economy and spillovers.
The research on financial intermediation focused on conditions in emerging
market economies, the measurement of banks’ systemic importance and
adjustments surrounding higher capital requirements. Analyses covered specific
financial market segments (long-term finance, longevity risk transfer markets,
collateral asset markets), instruments (non-deliverable forwards, contingent
convertible bonds) and practices (liquidity stress testing, portfolio allocation). More
general issues included the link between the financial system and growth, and the
interplay between the financial health of the sovereign and that of the banking sector.
The research on new policy frameworks consisted of two lines of inquiry. The
first explored various aspects of monetary policy and the macroeconomy, including
collateral frameworks and practices; forward guidance policies; and the use of
specific instruments such as committed liquidity facilities. It also considered foreign
exchange intervention, interest rate pass-through processes, the sustainability and
implications of extraordinarily low interest rates, and the link between the
macroeconomy and the financial cycle (eg the usefulness of credit as an early
indicator of crisis). The second line of enquiry addressed prudential policy, including
the identification of systemically important institutions and the impact of structural
regulation, which aims at distinguishing types of banking activity. Research also
examined the macroeconomic impact of reforms in the regulation of OTC derivatives.
The third area of research, the global economy and spillovers, explored the
nexus between the international monetary and financial system and the
performance of the global economy. Among the issues studied were global
imbalances; the concept, measurement and policy implications of global liquidity;
and monetary policy spillovers.

International statistical initiatives
The BIS’s unique international financial statistics facilitated detailed studies on
transnational banking activity. Studies also focused on developments revealed by
the 2013 BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives
Market Activity.
The BIS is pursuing further enhancements to its international banking statistics.
Together with central banks, it is improving the collection and dissemination of
data on cross-border claims and liabilities of internationally active banks, a
multistage process endorsed by the CGFS. In the current phase, central banks have

156

BIS 84th Annual Report

started reporting a more detailed sectoral breakdown in both the locational and
consolidated banking statistics; the latter are being extended to cover the liability
positions of banks, including capital.
The BIS International Data Hub completed its first year of operations. It
accomplished phase 1 of its goal, which was to assemble micro data covering global
systemically important banks. This work has helped to strengthen the supervisory
dialogue by providing authorities with a more complete picture of balance sheet
interlinkages in derivatives markets. The Data Hub has been coordinating with the
FSB Data Gaps Implementation Group in preparing for phase 2, which is the
collection of additional data.
On its website, the BIS has begun releasing its Data Bank statistics regarding
global liquidity indicators.10 This initiative forms part of the BIS’s support for G20
activities and extends earlier work by the BIS and CGFS.
The BIS also participates in the Inter-Agency Group on Economic and Financial
Statistics (IAG), which follows up on the FSB and IMF recommendations to the G20
to close data gaps revealed by the financial crisis.11
BIS statistics: www.bis.org/statistics

Cooperation with other central bank initiatives
The BIS contributes to the activities of central banks and regional central bank
organisations. During the past year, it cooperated with the following groups on the
following topics:
•
CEMLA (Center for Latin American Monetary Studies) – foreign exchange
intervention, payment and settlement systems;
•
FLAR (Latin American Reserve Fund) – reserves management;
•
MEFMI (Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute of Eastern and
Southern Africa) – payment and settlement systems, reserves management;
•
SEACEN (South East Asian Central Banks) Research and Training Centre –
central bank governance, financial stability, macroeconomic and monetary
policy challenges, payment and settlement systems; and
•
World Bank – governance and oversight of central bank reserves management.
BIS experts also contributed to events organised by the International Banking
and Finance Institute of the Bank of France.

Representative Offices
The BIS has a Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific (the Asian Office),
located in Hong Kong SAR; and a Representative Office for the Americas (the
Americas Office), located in Mexico City. The Representative Offices promote
10

The Data Bank contains key economic indicators reported by almost all BIS member central banks,
additional detailed macroeconomic series from major advanced and emerging market economies
and data collected by BIS-hosted groups. The BIS is making a substantial effort to facilitate use of
the Data Bank for calculating and disseminating long series of important economic variables, such
as credit.

11

The IAG comprises the BIS, the ECB, Eurostat, the IMF, the OECD, the United Nations and the World
Bank (www.principalglobalindicators.org). These organisations also sponsor the Statistical Data and
Metadata Exchange (SDMX), whose standards the BIS uses for its collection, processing and
dissemination of statistics (www.sdmx.org).

cooperation and the BIS mission within each region by organising meetings,
supporting regional institutions and Basel-based committees, conducting policy
research and fostering the exchange of information and data. The Asian Office also
provides banking services to the region’s monetary authorities.12

The Asian Office
The Asian Office undertakes economic research, organises high-level regional
meetings and, through its Regional Treasury, offers specialised banking services and
explores new investment outlets in regional financial markets. The economists of
the Asian Office focus their research on the region’s policy issues. The Asian Office’s
activities are guided by the Asian Consultative Council (ACC), comprising the
Governors of the 12 BIS member central banks in the Asia-Pacific region.13 Governor
Amando Tetangco, of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, succeeded Governor
Choongsoo Kim, of the Bank of Korea, as Chair of the Council in April 2014.

The Asian Consultative Council
At its June 2013 semiannual meeting, in Basel, the ACC endorsed a secondment
programme in Hong Kong as a mechanism for research collaboration among
member central banks in the region. At its February 2014 meeting, in Sydney, the
Council endorsed a two-year research programme on “Expanding the boundaries
of monetary policy”.

Research
Economists in the Asian Office produced research on the two themes previously
endorsed by the ACC. On the financial stability side, the theme was cross-border
financial linkages in Asia and the Pacific; outlines for proposed papers and specific
policy issues were discussed at a July research workshop in Hong Kong. On the
monetary policy side, the theme was inflation dynamics and globalisation; in
September, a conference in Beijing co-hosted with the People’s Bank of China
showcased the results of that research.
In carrying out their research, Asian Office economists collaborated with
academics from around the world and economists at BIS member central banks in
the region. The resulting papers have informed policy discussions in various central
bank meetings and have appeared in the BIS Quarterly Review and refereed
journals.

The Special Governors’ Meeting and other high-level meetings
The Asian Office organised 10 high-level BIS policy meetings. Most were held jointly
with a central bank or with either EMEAP or SEACEN.
The ACC Governors meet with others from around the world in the annual
Special Governors’ Meeting. Normally held in Asia in February, it was combined this
year with the BIS bimonthly meeting, held in Sydney in February with the Reserve
Bank of Australia as host. For the fourth consecutive year, the event included a

roundtable with the chief executive officers of large financial institutions active in
the region. The discussions covered current vulnerabilities in Asia, the role of asset
managers and the financing of infrastructure projects.
Other high-level events were the 16th meeting of the Working Party on
Monetary Policy in Asia, co-hosted by the Bank of Korea, in Seoul in May; the BISSEACEN Exco Seminar, co-hosted by the Bank of Mongolia, in Ulaanbaatar in
September; the Ninth Meeting on Monetary Policy Operating Procedures, in Hong
Kong in November; and the Workshop on the Financing of Infrastructure
Investment, in Hong Kong in January.

The Americas Office
The activities of the Americas Office are guided by the Consultative Council for the
Americas (CCA). The CCA comprises the Governors of the eight BIS member central
banks in the Americas and is chaired by José Darío Uribe, Governor of the Bank of
the Republic, Colombia.14
The Americas Office has implemented a number of initiatives in the past year
to support regional central bank consultations and research. A newly established
Consultative Group of Directors of Operations (CGDO) brings together central bank
officials who are typically responsible for open market and foreign exchange market
operations and foreign reserve management. The group held regular teleconferences,
and the Americas Office co-hosted with the Bank of Mexico the group’s first
meeting, in March 2014. Meeting topics included the implications of changes in
global monetary conditions, policy responses and financial market structures.
In December 2013, the directors of financial stability from CCA central banks
held their first meeting, hosted by the Central Bank of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro.
Among the issues discussed were responsibilities, instruments, governance and risk
assessment (including stress testing). The Americas Office has supported efforts to
further strengthen the consultation process of this group.
The fourth annual CCA research conference was hosted by the Central Bank of
Chile in Santiago in April 2013. The theme of the conference was “Financial stability,
macroprudential policy and exchange rates”, and paper selection was organised
into each of those three topics.
A project of the CCA central bank research network introduces financial
stability considerations into central bank policy models. In October 2013, the
project held its first conference in the newly opened facilities of the Americas
Office. A policy exercise is focusing the project’s models on the implications of a
credit boom. Some CCA central banks in the research network are also undertaking
a joint research project that will allow for cross-country comparison of the effects
of monetary or macroprudential policies.
The Americas Office contributed to other meetings and outreach activities as
follows: (i) providing background material for the 17th BIS Working Party for
Monetary Policy in Latin America, hosted by the Central Bank of Chile in Santiago
in September 2013; (ii) organising and chairing a BIS-CEMLA roundtable on foreign
exchange market intervention, hosted by the Central Bank of Costa Rica in San José
in July 2013; (iii) providing economists for presentations at FSB regional consultative
group meetings and at central bank research conferences; and (iv) organising a
high-level central bank panel at the November 2013 annual meeting of the Latin
America and Caribbean Economics Association in Mexico City.

Financial services of the Bank
The BIS, through its Banking Department, offers a wide range of financial services
designed to assist central banks and other official monetary authorities in the
management of their foreign exchange reserves and to foster international
cooperation in this area. Some 140 such institutions, as well as a number of
international organisations, make active use of these services.
Safety and liquidity are the key features of BIS credit intermediation, which is
supported by a rigorous framework of internal risk management. Independent
control units reporting directly to the BIS Deputy General Manager monitor and
control the related risks. A compliance and operational risk unit monitors
operational risk; a risk control unit controls the Bank’s financial risks – ie credit,
liquidity and market risks – and is also responsible for the coordination required for
an integrated approach to risk management.
BIS financial services are provided from two linked trading rooms: one in Basel,
at the Bank’s head office; and one in Hong Kong SAR, at its Representative Office
for Asia and the Pacific.

Scope of services
As an institution owned and governed by central banks, the BIS possesses a
distinctive understanding of the needs of reserve managers – their primary
requirement of safety and liquidity as well as their evolving need to diversify part of
their foreign exchange reserves. To meet those needs, the BIS offers investments
that vary by currency denomination, maturity and liquidity. The Bank offers tradable
instruments in maturities ranging from one week to five years – Fixed-Rate
Investments at the BIS (FIXBIS), Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs) and products with
embedded optionality (Callable MTIs); these instruments can be bought or sold
throughout the Bank’s dealing hours.
Also available are money market placements, such as sight/notice accounts
and fixed-term deposits, in most convertible currencies; in addition, the Bank
provides short-term liquidity facilities and extends credit to central banks, usually
on a collateralised basis. Moreover, the Bank acts as trustee and collateral agent in
connection with international financial operations.
The Bank transacts foreign exchange and gold on behalf of its customers,
thereby providing access to a large liquidity base in the context of, for example,
regular rebalancing of reserve portfolios or major changes in reserve currency
allocations. The foreign exchange services of the Bank encompass spot transactions
in major currencies and Special Drawing Rights (SDR) as well as swaps, outright
forwards, options and dual currency deposits (DCDs). In addition, the Bank provides
gold services such as buying and selling, sight accounts, fixed-term deposits,
earmarked accounts, upgrading and refining and location exchanges.
The BIS also provides asset management products and services. The products,
which predominantly consist of sovereign securities and other high-grade fixed
income instruments in major reserve currencies, are available in two forms:
(i) dedicated portfolio mandates tailored to each customer’s preferences; and
(ii) open-end fund structures that allow customers to invest in a common pool of
assets, ie BIS Investment Pools (BISIPs).
The BISIP structure is used for the Asian Bond Fund (ABF) initiative, sponsored
by EMEAP (Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks) to foster the
development of local currency bond markets. Further initiatives developed in
cooperation with a group of advising central banks have also been based on the
BISIP structure. These include the BISIP ILF1 (US inflation-protected government

160

BIS 84th Annual Report

securities fund) and the BISIP CNY (domestic Chinese sovereign fixed income
fund).
The BIS Banking Department hosts global and regional meetings, seminars and
workshops on reserve management issues. These gatherings facilitate the exchange
of knowledge and experience among reserve managers and promote the
development of investment and risk management capabilities in central banks and
international organisations. The Banking Department also supports central banks in
reviewing their current reserve management practices.

Financial operations in 2013/14
The Bank’s balance sheet increased by SDR 10.6 billion, following a decrease of
SDR 43.7 billion in the previous year. The balance sheet total at 31 March 2014 was
SDR 222.5 billion (see graph).

Liabilities
Customer placements, about 94% of which are denominated in currencies and
the remainder in gold, constitute the largest share of total liabilities. On
31 March 2014, customer placements (excluding repurchase agreements) amounted
to SDR 191.8 billion, compared with SDR 183.7 billion at the end of 2012/13.
Currency deposits increased from SDR 166.2 billion a year ago to
SDR 180.5 billion at end-March 2014. That balance represents 2.1% of the world’s
total foreign exchange reserves – which totalled nearly SDR 7.9 trillion at endMarch 2014, up from SDR 7.7 trillion at end-March 2013.15 The share of currency
placements denominated in US dollars was 73%, while euro- and sterlingdenominated funds accounted for 13% and 6%, respectively.
Gold deposits amounted to SDR 11.3 billion at end-March 2014, a decrease of
SDR 6.3 billion for the financial year.

Assets
As in the previous financial year, most of the assets held by the BIS consisted of
government and quasi-government securities plus investments (including reverse
repurchase agreements) with commercial banks of international standing. In
addition, the Bank held 111 tonnes of fine gold in its investment portfolio at
31 March 2014. The Bank’s credit exposure is managed in a conservative manner,
with most of it rated no lower than A–.
The Bank’s holdings of currency assets totalled SDR 184.4 billion at
31 March 2014, compared with SDR 157.1 billion at the end of the previous financial
year. The Bank uses various derivative instruments to manage its assets and
liabilities efficiently.16

Governance and management of the BIS
The governance and management of the Bank are conducted at three principal
levels:
•
the General Meeting of BIS member central banks;
•
the BIS Board of Directors; and
•
BIS Management.

The General Meeting of BIS member central banks
Sixty central banks and monetary authorities are currently members of the BIS and
have rights of voting and representation at General Meetings. The Annual General
Meeting (AGM) is held no later than four months after 31 March, the end of the BIS
financial year. The AGM approves the annual report and the accounts of the Bank
and decides on the distribution of a dividend, makes adjustments in the allowances
paid to Board members and elects the Bank’s auditor.

BIS budget policy
Management begins preparing the BIS annual expenditure budget by establishing a
broad business plan and financial framework. Within that context, business areas
specify their plans and corresponding resource requirements. The process of reconciling
detailed business plans, objectives and overall resources culminates in a draft budget,
which must be approved by the Board before the start of the financial year.
The budget distinguishes between administrative and capital expenditures. In
2013/14, these expenditures collectively amounted to CHF 306.5 million. The Bank’s
overall administrative expense amounted to CHF 277.4 million.18 As with organisations
similar to the BIS, spending for Management and staff – including remuneration,
pensions, and health and accident insurance – amounts to around 70% of
administrative expenditure. New staff positions were added during the year in
accordance with the Bank’s business plan, which emphasised the Basel regulatory
process, BIS financial statistics, and BIS banking activities and internal controls.
The other major categories of administrative spending are information
technology (IT), buildings and equipment, and general operational costs, each
accounting for about 10%.
Capital spending, relating mainly to buildings and IT investment, can vary
significantly from year to year depending on projects in progress. For 2013/14,
capital expenditure amounted to CHF 29.1 million, including a special item of
CHF 13.6 million for the purchase of the office building at Centralbahnstrasse 21,
near the BIS head office.

BIS remuneration policy
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, the BIS employed 656 staff members
from 57 countries. The jobs performed by BIS staff members are assessed on
the basis of a number of objective criteria – including qualifications, experience
and responsibilities – and classified into distinct job grades. The job grades are
associated with a structure of salary ranges, and the salaries of individual staff
members move within the ranges of the salary structure on the basis of
performance.
Every three years, a comprehensive survey benchmarks BIS salaries (in Swiss
francs) against compensation in comparable institutions and market segments, with
adjustments to take place as of 1 July in the following year. In benchmarking, the

18

166

The financial statements report a total administrative expense of CHF 360.9 million. That figure
consists of the CHF 277.4 million actual administrative expense reported here plus CHF 83.5 million
of financial accounting adjustments for post-employment benefit obligations. This additional
expense is not included in the budget for the coming financial year because it depends on actuarial
valuations as at 31 March, which in turn are not finalised until April, after the budget has been set
by the Board.

BIS 84th Annual Report

Bank focuses on the upper half of market compensation in order to attract highly
qualified staff. The analysis takes into account differences in the taxation of
compensation at the surveyed institutions.
In years between comprehensive salary surveys, the salary structure is adjusted
as of 1 July on the basis of the rate of inflation in Switzerland and the weighted
average real wage development in industrial countries. As of 1 July 2013, this
adjustment produced a decrease of 0.95% in the salary structure.
The salaries of senior officials are also regularly benchmarked against
compensation in comparable institutions and market segments. As of 1 July 2013,
the annual remuneration of senior officials, before expatriation allowances, is based
on the salary structure of CHF 766,220 for the General Manager;19 CHF 648,340 for
the Deputy General Manager; and CHF 589,400 for Heads of Department.
BIS staff members have access to a contributory health insurance plan and a
contributory defined benefit pension plan. At the Bank’s headquarters, non-Swiss
staff members recruited from abroad, including senior officials, are entitled to an
expatriation allowance. The allowance currently amounts to 14% of annual salary
for unmarried staff members and 18% for married staff members, subject to a
ceiling. Expatriate staff members are also entitled to receive an education allowance
for their children, subject to certain conditions.
The Annual General Meeting approves the remuneration of members of the
Board of Directors, with adjustments taking place at regular intervals. The total
fixed annual remuneration paid to the Board of Directors was CHF 1,114,344 as
of 1 April 2014. In addition, Board members receive an attendance fee for each
Board meeting in which they participate. Assuming the full Board is represented
in all Board meetings, the annual total of these attendance fees amounts to
CHF 1,061,280.

Net profit and its distribution
The net profit for 2013/14 was SDR 419.3 million (2012/13: SDR 895.4 million). The
profit represented a return of 2.4% on average equity (2012/13: 4.9%).

Financial results
The BIS’s financial results for 2013/14 were shaped by greater stability in most
financial markets compared with recent years as well as continuing low interest
rates. This environment resulted in lower returns on the Bank’s investment assets
and a compression of intermediation margins, which led to a decline in profitability.
The total comprehensive income of the BIS includes unrealised valuation
movements on “available for sale” assets (the BIS’s own gold and investment
securities) and re-measurements of the actuarial liabilities for post-employment
benefit arrangements. As the market price of gold fell (22% on the year), the
valuation of the Bank’s own gold declined. At the same time, there was a revaluation
loss on own funds investment securities. These effects were partly offset by a
gain on the re-measurement of defined benefit obligations. The resulting
total comprehensive income for 2013/14 was SDR –570.4 million (2012/13:
SDR +718.2 million). The total return on equity was –3.2% (2012/13: +3.9%),
primarily because of the fall in the price of gold.

19

In addition to the basic salary, the General Manager receives an annual representation allowance and
enhanced pension rights.

Taking into account the 2012/13 dividend of SDR 175.8 million, which was paid
during 2013/14, the Bank’s equity decreased by SDR 746.2 million during the year
ended 31 March 2014.

Proposed dividend
It is proposed for the financial year 2013/14 to declare a dividend of SDR 215 per
share, which is consistent with BIS dividend policy and with the reduction in profit
in the context of the global financial environment.
At 31 March 2014, there were 559,125 issued shares; these include the
1,000 shares of the Albanian issue, which are suspended, held in treasury and
receive no dividend. The dividend is therefore to be paid on 558,125 shares. The
total cost of the proposed dividend would be SDR 120.0 million, after which
SDR 299.3 million would be available for allocation to reserves. The dividend would
be paid on 3 July 2014 in one of the component currencies of the SDR (US dollar,
euro, yen or sterling) or in Swiss francs according to the instructions of each
shareholder named in the BIS share register at 31 March 2014.

Proposed allocation of net profit for 2013/14
On the basis of Article 51 of the BIS Statutes, the Board of Directors recommends
that the General Meeting allocate the 2013/14 net profit of SDR 419.3 million in the
following manner:
(a) SDR 120.0 million to be paid as a normal dividend of SDR 215 per share;
(b) SDR 15.0 million to be transferred to the general reserve fund;20 and
(c) SDR 284.3 million, representing the remainder of the available profit, to be
transferred to the free reserve fund.

Independent auditor
Election of the auditor
In accordance with Article 46 of the BIS Statutes, the Annual General Meeting is
invited to elect an independent auditor for the ensuing year and to fix the auditor’s
remuneration. This election is based on a formal proposal by the BIS Board, which
in turn is based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee. This annual
process ensures a regular assessment of the knowledge, competence and
independence of the auditor and of the effectiveness of the audit. The 2013 Annual
General Meeting elected Ernst & Young as the BIS auditor for the financial
year ended 31 March 2014. The Board policy is to rotate the auditor on a regular
basis, with the new auditor chosen following a selection process involving BIS
Management and the Audit Committee. The financial year ended 31 March 2014
was the second year of Ernst & Young’s term as auditor.

Report of the auditor
In accordance with Article 50 of the BIS Statutes, the independent auditor has full
powers to examine all books and accounts of the BIS and to require full information
20

168

At 31 March 2014, the general reserve fund exceeded five times the Bank’s paid-up capital. As
such, under Article 51 of the Statutes, 5% of net profit, after accounting for the proposed dividend,
should be allocated to the general reserve fund.

BIS 84th Annual Report

Accounting policies

The accounting policies set out below have been applied to
both of the financial years presented unless otherwise stated.

1. Scope of the financial statements
These financial statements recognise all assets and liabilities that
are controlled by the Bank and in respect of which the economic
benefits, as well as the rights and obligations, lie with the Bank.
To provide services to central bank customers, the Bank operates
investment entities that do not have a separate legal personality
from the BIS. Transactions are undertaken for these entities in
the Bank’s name, but for which the economic benefit lies with
central bank customers and not with the Bank. The assets and
liabilities of these entities are not recognised in these financial
statements. The Bank does not prepare consolidated financial
statements. Note 33 provides information on off-balance sheet
assets and liabilities.
The Bank operates a staff pension fund that does not have
a separate legal personality from the BIS. Transactions are
undertaken in the Bank’s name, but for the economic benefit of
the fund. The fund’s assets and liabilities are included in these
financial statements on a net basis in accordance with the
accounting policy for post-employment benefit obligations.
Note 20 provides information on the Bank’s staff pension fund.

3. Currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into SDR at the
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Other assets
and liabilities are recorded in SDR at the exchange rates ruling
at the date of the transaction. Profits and losses are translated
into SDR at an average rate. Exchange differences arising from
the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities and from the
settlement of transactions are included as net foreign exchange
gains or losses in the profit and loss account.

4. Designation of financial instruments
Upon initial recognition the Bank allocates each financial
instrument to one of the following categories:

•
•

Loans and receivables

•
•

Available for sale financial assets

Financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value
through profit and loss
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

The allocation to these categories is dependent on the nature
of the financial instrument and the purpose for which it was
entered into, as described in Section 5 below.
The resulting designation of each financial instrument determines
the accounting methodology that is applied, as described in
the accounting policies below. Where the financial instrument
is designated as held at fair value through profit and loss, the
Bank does not subsequently change this designation.

2. Functional and presentation currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Bank is the
Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
The SDR is calculated from a basket of major trading currencies
according to Rule O–1 as adopted by the Executive Board of
the IMF on 30 December 2010 and effective 1 January 2011. As
currently calculated, one SDR is equivalent to the sum of
USD 0.660, EUR 0.423, JPY 12.1 and GBP 0.111. The composition
of the SDR currency basket is subject to review every five
years by the IMF; the next review is due to be undertaken in
December 2015.
All figures in these financial statements are presented in SDR
millions unless otherwise stated.

BIS 84th Annual Report

5. Asset and liability structure
Assets and liabilities are organised into two sets of portfolios:

A. Banking portfolios
These comprise currency and gold deposit liabilities and related
banking assets and derivatives.
The Bank operates a banking business in currency and gold on
behalf of its customers. In this business the Bank is exposed to
credit and market risks. The extent of these exposures is limited
by the Bank’s risk management approach.

179

The Bank designates all currency financial instruments in its
banking portfolios (other than cash and sight and notice
accounts with banks, and sight and notice deposit account
liabilities) as held at fair value through profit and loss. The use
of fair values in the currency banking portfolios is described in
Section 9 below.

8. Sight and notice deposit account liabilities

All gold financial assets in these portfolios are designated as
loans and receivables and all gold financial liabilities are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
They are included in the balance sheet at their principal value
plus accrued interest. Interest is included in interest expense on
an accruals basis.

Sight and notice deposit accounts are short-term monetary
liabilities. They typically have notice periods of three days or
less and are included under the balance sheet heading
“Currency deposits”.

B. Investment portfolios
These comprise assets, liabilities and derivatives relating
principally to the investment of the Bank’s equity.
The Bank holds most of its equity in financial instruments
denominated in the constituent currencies of the SDR, which
are managed by comparison to a fixed duration benchmark of
bonds.
Currency assets in investment portfolios, with the exception of
cash and sight accounts with banks and those in more actively
traded portfolios, are designated as available for sale.
The currency investment assets maintained in more actively
traded portfolios are trading assets and as such are designated
as held at fair value through profit and loss.
The remainder of the Bank’s equity is held in gold. The Bank’s
own gold holdings are designated as available for sale.

6. Cash and sight accounts with banks
Cash and sight accounts with banks are included in the balance
sheet at their principal value plus accrued interest where
applicable.

7. Notice accounts
Notice accounts are short-term monetary assets, including
balances at futures clearing brokers. These typically have notice
periods of three days or less and are included under the
balance sheet heading “Loans and advances”. They are
considered to be cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash
flow statement.
Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments are
designated as loans and receivables. They are included in the
balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued interest.
Interest is included in interest income on an accruals basis.

9. Use of fair values in the currency banking
portfolios
In operating its currency banking business, the Bank acts as a
market-maker in certain of its currency deposit liabilities. As a
result of this activity the Bank incurs realised profits and losses
on these liabilities.
In accordance with the Bank’s risk management policies, the
market risk inherent in this activity is managed on an overall
fair value basis, combining all the relevant assets, liabilities and
derivatives in its currency banking portfolios. The realised and
unrealised profits or losses on currency deposit liabilities are
thus largely offset by realised and unrealised losses or profits
on the related currency banking assets and derivatives, or on
other currency deposit liabilities.
To reduce the accounting inconsistency that would otherwise
arise from recognising realised and unrealised gains and losses
on different bases, the Bank designates the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios as
held at fair value through profit and loss.

10. Securities purchased under resale
agreements
Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse
repurchase agreements”) are recognised as collateralised loan
transactions by which the Bank lends cash and receives an
irrevocable commitment from the counterparty to return the
cash, plus interest, at a specified date in the future. As part of
these agreements, the Bank receives collateral in the form of
securities to which it has full legal title, but must return
equivalent securities to the counterparty at the end of the
agreement, subject to the counterparty’s repayment of the
cash. Because the Bank does not acquire the risks or rewards
associated with ownership of these collateral securities, they are
not recognised as assets in the Bank’s balance sheet.
The collateralised loans relating to securities purchased under
resale agreements are currency assets. The accounting
treatment is determined by whether the transaction involves
currency assets held at fair value through profit and loss
(Section 11 below) or currency investment assets available for
sale (Section 13 below).

Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and government
and other securities.
As described in Section 9 above, the Bank designates all of the
relevant assets in its currency banking portfolios as held at fair
value through profit and loss. In addition, the Bank maintains
certain actively traded investment portfolios. The currency
investment assets in these portfolios are trading assets and
as such are designated as held at fair value through profit
and loss.
These currency assets are initially included in the balance sheet
on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest and amortisation
of premiums paid and discounts received are included in the
profit and loss account under “Interest income” on an effective
interest rate basis. After initial measurement, the currency
assets are revalued to fair value, with all realised and unrealised
movements in fair value included under “Net valuation
movement”.

After trade date, the currency investment assets are revalued
to fair value, with unrealised gains or losses included in the
securities revaluation account, which is reported under the
balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”. The movement
in fair value is included in the statement of comprehensive
income under the heading “Unrealised gain / (loss) on securities
available for sale”. Realised profits on disposal are included in
the profit and loss account under “Net gain on sales of securities
available for sale”.

14. Short positions in currency assets
Short positions in currency assets are included in the balance
sheet under the heading “Other liabilities” at fair value on a
trade date basis.

15. Gold
12. Currency deposit liabilities held at fair value
through profit and loss

Gold comprises gold bar assets held in custody at central banks
and sight accounts denominated in gold. Gold is considered by
the Bank to be a financial instrument.

As described in Section 11 above, all currency deposit liabilities,
with the exception of sight and notice deposit account liabilities
are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.

Gold is included in the balance sheet at its weight in gold
(translated at the gold market price and USD exchange rate
into SDR). Purchases and sales of gold are accounted for on a
settlement date basis. Forward purchases or sales of gold are
treated as derivatives prior to the settlement date.

These currency deposit liabilities are initially included in the
balance sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest to
be paid and amortisation of premiums received and discounts
paid are included under the profit and loss account heading
“Interest expense” on an effective interest rate basis.

The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold is described in Section 18 below.

After initial measurement, the currency deposit liabilities are
revalued to fair value, with all realised and unrealised movements
in fair value included under “Net valuation movement”.

16. Gold loans

13. Currency investment assets available for sale
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and government
and other securities.

Gold loans comprise fixed-term gold loans. Gold loans are
included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis at their
weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and USD
exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest.
Accrued interest on gold loans is included in the profit and loss
account under “Interest income” on an effective interest rate
basis.

As described in Section 12 above, the Bank designates as
available for sale all of the relevant assets in its currency
investment portfolios, except for those assets in the Bank’s
more actively traded investment portfolios.
Available for sale investment assets are initially included in the
balance sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest and
amortisation of premiums paid and discounts received are
included in the profit and loss account under “Interest income”
on an effective interest rate basis.

BIS 84th Annual Report

17. Gold deposits
Gold deposits comprise unallocated sight and fixed-term
deposits of gold from central banks.

181

Unallocated gold deposits provide customers with a general
claim on the Bank for delivery of gold of the same weight and
quality as that delivered by the customer to the Bank, but do
not provide the right to specific gold bars. Unallocated gold
deposits are included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis
at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and
USD exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest. Accrued
interest on gold deposits is included in the profit and loss account
under “Interest expense” on an effective interest rate basis.
Allocated (or “earmarked”) gold deposits provide depositors
with a claim for delivery of the specific gold bars deposited by
the customer with the Bank on a custody basis. Beneficial
ownership and risk remain with the customer. As such, allocated
gold deposit liabilities and the related gold bar assets are not
included on the Bank’s balance sheet. They are disclosed as offbalance sheet items (see note 33).

Realised gains or losses on disposal of gold investment assets
are included in the profit and loss account as “Net gain on sales
of gold investment assets”.

19. Securities sold under repurchase agreements
Securities sold under repurchase agreements (“repurchase
agreements”) are recognised as collateralised deposit transactions
by which the Bank receives cash and provides an irrevocable
commitment to return the cash, plus interest, at a specified
date in the future. As part of these agreements, the Bank
transfers legal title of collateral securities to the counterparty.
At the end of the contract the counterparty must return
equivalent securities to the Bank, subject to the Bank’s repayment
of the cash. Because the Bank retains the risks and rewards
associated with ownership of these securities, they continue to
be recognised as assets in the Bank’s balance sheet.

18. Realised and unrealised gains or losses
on gold

Where the repurchase agreement is associated with currency
assets available for sale, the collateralised deposit transaction is
designated as a financial liability measured at amortised cost.

The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold depends on the designation as described below:

Where the repurchase agreement is associated with the
management of currency assets held at fair value through profit
and loss, the collateralised deposit transaction is designated as
a financial instrument held at fair value through profit and loss.

A. Banking portfolios, comprising gold deposits and
related gold banking assets

The collateralised deposits relating to securities sold under
repurchase agreements are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest is included
in the profit and loss account under “Interest expense” on an
effective interest rate basis. After initial measurement, the
transactions designated as held at fair value through profit and
loss are revalued to fair value with all unrealised movements in
fair value included under “Net valuation movement”.

The Bank designates gold loans in its banking portfolios as
loans and receivables and gold deposits as financial liabilities
measured at amortised cost. The gold derivatives included in
the portfolios are designated as held at fair value through profit
and loss.
Gains or losses on derivative transactions in gold are included
in the profit and loss account under “Net foreign exchange
gain / (loss)” as net transaction gains or losses.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the net position in gold
in the banking portfolios are included under “Net foreign
exchange gain / (loss)” as net translation gains or losses.

B. Investment portfolios, comprising gold
investment assets
The Bank’s own holdings of gold are designated and accounted
for as available for sale assets.
Unrealised gains or losses on the Bank’s gold investment assets
over their deemed cost are taken to the gold revaluation
account in equity, which is reported under the balance sheet
heading “Other equity accounts”. The movement in fair value is
included in the statement of comprehensive income under the
heading “Unrealised gain on gold investment assets”.
For gold investment assets held on 31 March 2003 (when the
Bank changed its functional and presentation currency from
the gold franc to the SDR) the deemed cost is approximately
SDR 151 per ounce, based on the value of USD 208 that was
applied from 1979 to 2003 following a decision by the Bank’s
Board of Directors, translated at the 31 March 2003 exchange rate.

182

20. Derivatives
Derivatives are used either to manage the Bank’s market risk
or for trading purposes. They are designated as financial
instruments held at fair value through profit and loss.
Derivatives are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis. Where applicable, the accrual of interest and
amortisation of premiums and discounts are included in the
profit and loss account under “Interest income” on an effective
interest rate basis.
After trade date, derivatives are revalued to fair value, with all
realised and unrealised movements in value included under
“Net valuation movement”.
Derivatives are included as either assets or liabilities, depending
on whether the contract has a positive or a negative fair value
for the Bank.

BIS 84th Annual Report

Where a derivative contract is embedded within a host contract
which is not accounted for as held at fair value through profit
and loss, it is separated from the host contract for accounting
purposes and treated as though it were a standalone derivative
as described above.

21. Valuation policy
The Bank’s valuation policy defines how financial instruments
are designated, which determines their valuation basis and
accounting treatment. This policy is supplemented with detailed
valuation procedures.
The majority of the financial instruments on the balance sheet
are included at fair value. The Bank defines fair value as the exit
price of an orderly transaction between market participants on
the measurement date.
The use of fair values ensures that the financial reporting to the
Board and shareholders reflects the way in which the banking
business is managed and is consistent with the risk management
and economic performance figures reported to Management.
The Bank considers published price quotations in active markets
as the best evidence of fair value. Where no published price
quotations exist, the Bank determines fair values using a
valuation technique appropriate to the particular financial
instrument. Such valuation techniques may involve using
market prices of recent arm’s length market transactions in
similar instruments or may make use of financial models. Where
financial models are used, the Bank aims at making maximum
use of observable market inputs (eg interest rates and
volatilities) as appropriate, and relies as little as possible on its
own estimates. Such valuation models comprise discounted
cash flow analyses and option pricing models.
Where valuation techniques are used to determine fair values,
the valuation models are subject to initial approval and periodic
review in line with the requirements of the Bank’s model
validation policy.
The Bank has an independent valuation control function which
periodically reviews the value of its financial instruments, taking
into account both the accuracy of the valuations and the
valuation methodologies used. Other valuation controls include
the review and analysis of daily profit and loss.
The Bank values its positions at their exit price, so that assets
are valued at the bid price and liabilities at the offer price.
Derivative financial instruments are valued on a bid-offer basis,
with valuation reserves, where necessary, included in derivative
financial liabilities. Financial assets and liabilities that are not
valued at fair value are included in the balance sheet at
amortised cost.

impairment at each balance sheet date. A financial asset is
impaired when there is objective evidence that the estimated
future cash flows of the asset have been reduced as a result of
one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of
the asset. Evidence of impairment could include significant
financial difficulty, default, or probable bankruptcy / financial
reorganisation of the counterparty or issuer.
Impairment losses are recognised to the extent that a decline in
fair value below amortised cost is considered significant or
prolonged. Impairment of currency assets is included in the
profit and loss account under “Net valuation movement”, with
impairment of gold loans included under “Interest income”. If
the amount of the impairment loss decreases in a subsequent
period, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed
through profit and loss to the extent that the carrying amount
of the investment does not exceed that which it would have
been had the impairment not been recognised.

23. Accounts receivable and accounts payable
Accounts receivable and accounts payable are principally very
short-term amounts relating to the settlement of financial
transactions. They are initially recognised at fair value and
subsequently included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.

24. Land, buildings and equipment
The cost of the Bank’s buildings and equipment is capitalised
and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets concerned, as follows:

•
•
•
•

Buildings – 50 years
Building installations and machinery – 15 years
Information technology equipment – up to 4 years
Other equipment – 4 to 10 years

The Bank’s land is not depreciated. The Bank undertakes an
annual review of impairment of land, buildings and equipment.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its
estimated recoverable amount, the asset is written down to the
lower value.

25. Provisions

22. Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those designated as held at fair
value through profit and loss, are assessed for indications of

BIS 84th Annual Report

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of events arising before the
balance sheet date and it is probable that economic resources
will be required to settle the obligation, provided that a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Best
estimates and assumptions are used when determining the
amount to be recognised as a provision.

183

26. Post-employment benefit obligations

B. Directors’ pensions

Note 3 to the financial statements describes a change in
accounting policy which applies to post-employment benefit
obligations.

The Bank provides an unfunded defined benefit arrangement
for Directors’ pensions. The liability, defined benefit obligation
and amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect
of the Directors’ pension arrangement are calculated on a
similar basis to that used for the staff pension fund.

The Bank operates three post-employment benefit arrangements,
respectively, for staff pensions, Directors’ pensions, and health
and accident insurance for current and former staff members.
An independent actuarial valuation is performed annually for
each arrangement.

A. Staff pensions
The Bank provides a final salary defined benefit pension
arrangement for its staff, based on a fund without a separate
legal personality from the BIS, out of which benefits are paid.
The fund assets are administered by the Bank for the sole
benefit of current and former members of staff who participate
in the arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all
benefits due under the arrangement.
The liability in respect of the staff pension fund is based on the
present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair
value of the fund assets, both at the balance sheet date. The
defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit
obligation is determined from the estimated future cash
outflows. The rate used to discount the cash flows is determined
by the Bank based on the market yield of highly rated corporate
debt securities in Swiss francs which have terms to maturity
approximating the terms of the related liability.

C. Post-employment health and accident benefits
The Bank provides an unfunded post-employment health and
accident benefit arrangement for its staff. The liability, benefit
obligation and amount charged to the profit and loss account
in respect of the health and accident benefit arrangement are
calculated on a similar basis to that used for the staff pension
fund.

27. Cash flow statement
The Bank’s cash flow statement is prepared using an indirect
method. It is based on the movements in the Bank’s balance
sheet, adjusted for changes in financial transactions awaiting
settlement.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and sight and notice
accounts with banks, which are very short-term financial assets
that typically have notice periods of three days or less.

The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents
the sum of the current service cost of the benefits accruing for
the year under the scheme, and interest at the discount rate on
the net of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of
the fund assets. Past service costs from plan amendments are
immediately recognised through profit or loss. Gains and losses
arising from re-measurement of the obligations, such as
experience adjustments (where the actual outcome is different
from the actuarial assumptions previously made) and changes
in actuarial assumptions are charged to other comprehensive
income in the year in which the re-measurement is applied.
They are not subsequently included in profit and loss in future
years.

BIS 84th Annual Report

Notes to the financial statements

1. Introduction
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS, “the Bank”) is an international financial institution which was established pursuant to the Hague
Agreements of 20 January 1930, the Bank’s Constituent Charter and its Statutes. The headquarters of the Bank are at Centralbahnplatz 2,
4002 Basel, Switzerland. The Bank maintains representative offices in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of
China (for Asia and the Pacific), and in Mexico City, Mexico (for the Americas).
The objectives of the BIS, as laid down in Article 3 of its Statutes, are to promote cooperation among central banks, to provide additional
facilities for international financial operations and to act as trustee or agent for international financial settlements. Sixty central banks are
currently members of the Bank. Rights of representation and voting at General Meetings are exercised in proportion to the number of BIS
shares issued in the respective countries. The Board of Directors of the BIS is composed of the Governors and appointed Directors from the
Bank’s founding central banks, being those of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, as
well as the Governors of the central banks of Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland, and the
President of the European Central Bank.

2. Use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the Bank’s Management to make some estimates in arriving at the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of income and expenses during the financial year. To arrive at these estimates, Management uses available information, makes assumptions
and exercises judgment.
Assumptions include forward-looking estimates, for example relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities, the assessment of postemployment benefit obligations and the assessment of provisions and contingent liabilities.
Judgment is exercised when selecting and applying the Bank’s accounting policies. The judgments relating to the designation and valuation
of financial instruments are another key element in the preparation of these financial statements.
Subsequent actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

A. The valuation of financial assets and liabilities
There is no active secondary market for certain of the Bank’s financial assets and financial liabilities. Such assets and liabilities are valued
using valuation techniques which require judgment to determine appropriate valuation parameters. Changes in assumptions about these
parameters could significantly affect the reported fair values. The valuation impact of a 1 basis point change in spread assumptions is shown
in the table below:

B. Impairment provision on financial assets
The Bank conducts an annual review for impairment at the date of each balance sheet. At 31 March 2014 the Bank did not have any financial
assets that were considered to be impaired (31 March 2013: nil).

C. Actuarial assumptions
The valuation of the Bank’s pension fund and health care arrangements relies on actuarial assumptions which include expectations of
inflation, interest rates, medical cost inflation and retirement age and life expectancy of participants. Changes to these assumptions have
an impact on the valuation of the Bank’s pension fund liabilities and the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

3. Change in accounting policy for post-employment benefit obligations
With effect from 1 April 2013, the Bank changed its accounting policy for post-employment benefit obligations to reflect developments in
global financial reporting standards. As a result of the change, the Bank no longer applies “corridor accounting” for actuarial gains and
losses, and all changes in the net defined benefit obligations or assets are recognised as they occur. Service costs and net interest are
recognised in the profit and loss account while re-measurements, such as actuarial gains and losses, are recognised in other comprehensive
income.
The reported numbers for prior financial periods have been restated for comparative purposes. The restatement resulted in an increase in
“Other liabilities” of SDR 511.7 million, reflecting the recognition of amounts previously reported as “Unrecognised actuarial losses” as at
31 March 2013. There was a corresponding decrease in shareholders’ equity, of which SDR 89.7 million was deducted from the free reserve
fund within “Statutory reserves” and represented the cumulative change in profit recognition in prior financial years due to the adoption of
the revised accounting policy. The remainder, SDR 422.0 million, was charged to a new account within “Other equity accounts” and
represented the cumulative actuarial losses arising from re-measurements.
The tables below show the effect of this change in accounting policy.

Included in “Gold” is SDR 6,311.2 million (236 tonnes) of gold (2013: SDR 13,836.1 million; 404 tonnes) that the Bank holds in connection
with its gold swap contracts. Under such contracts the Bank exchanges currencies for physical gold, and has an obligation to return the
gold at the end of the contract. See note 8 for more details on gold swap transactions.

B. Gold investment assets
The Bank’s gold investment assets are included in the balance sheet at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and USD
exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest. The excess of this value over the deemed cost value is included in the gold revaluation
account, which is reported under the balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”; the movement in this value is included in the
statement of comprehensive income under the heading “Unrealised gain on gold investment assets”. Realised gains or losses on the disposal
of gold investment assets are recognised in the profit and loss account under the heading “Net gain on sales of gold investment assets”.
Note 19B provides further analysis of the gold revaluation account. Note 28 provides further analysis of the net gain on sales of gold
investment assets.

deposit liabilities along with currency investment assets that are part of more actively traded portfolios. The remaining part of the Bank’s
currency investment assets are categorised as available for sale and, together with the gold investment assets, largely represent the
investment of the Bank’s equity.
Treasury bills are short-term debt securities issued by governments on a discount basis.
Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse repurchase agreements”) are recognised as collateralised loan transactions. Interest
receivable on the transaction is fixed at the start of the agreement. During the term of the agreement the Bank monitors the fair value of
the loan and related collateral securities, and may call for additional collateral (or be required to return collateral) based on movements in
market value.
Fixed-term loans are primarily investments made with commercial banks. Also included in this category are investments made with central
banks, international institutions and other public sector organisations. This includes advances made as part of committed and uncommitted
standby facilities. These loans are recognised in the balance sheet total “Loans and advances”, which also includes notice accounts (see note 7).
Government and other securities are debt securities issued by governments, international institutions, other public sector institutions,
commercial banks and corporates. They include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, fixed and floating rate bonds, covered bonds and
asset-backed securities.

7. Loans and advances
Loans and advances comprise fixed-term loans to commercial banks, advances and notice accounts. Advances relate to committed and
uncommitted standby facilities which the Bank provides for its customers. Notice accounts are very short-term financial assets, typically
having a notice period of three days or less.
Fixed-term loans and advances are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss. Notice accounts are designated as loans and
receivables and are included in the balance sheet at amortised cost. At 31 March 2014 the balance held in the futures clearing accounts
totalled SDR 33.1 million (2013: SDR 34.1 million).

(2013: SDR 2.1 million).

8. Derivative financial instruments
The Bank uses the following types of derivative instruments for economic hedging and trading purposes:
Interest rate and bond futures are contractual agreements to receive or pay a net amount based on changes in interest rates or bond prices
at a future date. Futures contracts are settled daily with the exchange. Associated margin payments are settled by cash or marketable
securities.
Currency and gold options are contractual agreements under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to either
buy (call option) or sell (put option), a specific amount of a currency or gold at a predetermined price, on or by a set date. In consideration,
the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.

BIS 84th Annual Report

191

Currency and gold swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps are bilateral contractual agreements to exchange cash
flows related to currencies, gold or interest rates (for example, fixed rate for floating rate). Cross-currency interest rate swaps involve the
exchange of cash flows related to a combination of interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Except for certain currency and gold swaps
and cross-currency interest rate swaps, no exchange of principal takes place.
Currency and gold forwards are bilateral contractual agreements involving the exchange of foreign currencies or gold at a future date. This
includes undelivered spot transactions.
Forward rate agreements are bilateral interest rate forward contracts that result in cash settlement at a future date for the difference
between a contracted rate of interest and the prevailing market rate.
Swaptions are bilateral options under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a currency or
interest rate swap at a predetermined price by or on a set date. In consideration, the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.
In addition, the Bank sells products to its customers which contain embedded derivatives (see note 11). Where the host contract is not
accounted for as held at fair value, embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract for accounting purposes and treated as
though they are regular derivatives. As such, the gold currency options embedded in gold dual currency deposits are included within
derivatives as currency and gold options.

Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs) are fixed rate investments at the BIS for quarterly maturities of up to 10 years.
Callable MTIs are MTIs that are callable at the option of the Bank at an exercise price of par, with call dates between June 2014 and
December 2014 (2013: June 2013 and March 2014). The balance sheet total for callable MTIs includes the fair value of the embedded
interest rate option.
FIXBIS are fixed rate investments at the Bank for any maturities between one week and one year.
FRIBIS are floating rate investments at the Bank with maturities of one year or longer for which the interest rate is reset in line with prevailing
market conditions.
Fixed-term deposits are fixed rate investments at the BIS, typically with a maturity of less than one year.
Dual Currency Deposits (DCDs) are fixed-term deposits that are repayable on the maturity date either in the original currency or at a fixed
amount in a different currency at the option of the Bank. The balance sheet total for DCDs includes the fair value of the embedded foreign
exchange option. These deposits all mature between April 2014 and May 2014 (2013: in April 2013 and May 2013).
Sight and notice deposit accounts are very short-term financial liabilities, typically having a notice period of three days or less. They are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
The Bank acts as the sole market-maker in certain of its currency deposit liabilities and has undertaken to repay some of these financial
instruments at fair value, in whole or in part, at one to two business days’ notice.

A. Valuation of currency deposits
Currency deposits (other than sight and notice deposit accounts) are included in the balance sheet at fair value. This value differs from
the amount that the Bank is contractually obliged to pay at maturity to the holder of the deposit. The amount the Bank is contractually
obliged to pay at maturity in respect of its total currency deposits (including accrued interest to 31 March 2014) is SDR 180,373.0 million
(2013: SDR 165,182.2 million).
The Bank uses valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of its currency deposits. These valuation techniques comprise discounted cash
flow models and option pricing models. The discounted cash flow models value the expected cash flows of financial instruments using
discount factors that are partly derived from quoted interest rates (eg Libor and swap rates) and partly based on assumptions about spreads
at which each product is offered to and repurchased from customers.

194

BIS 84th Annual Report

The spread assumptions are based on recent market transactions in each product. Where the product series has been closed to new
investors (and thus there are no recent market transactions), the Bank uses the latest quoted spread for the series as the basis for determining
the appropriate model inputs.
The option pricing models include assumptions about volatilities that are derived from market quotes.

B. Impact of changes in the Bank’s creditworthiness
The fair value of the Bank’s liabilities would be affected by any change in its creditworthiness. If the Bank’s creditworthiness deteriorated,
the value of its liabilities would decrease, and the change in value would be reflected as a valuation movement in the profit and loss account.
The Bank regularly assesses its creditworthiness as part of its risk management processes. The Bank’s assessment of its creditworthiness did
not indicate a change which could have had an impact on the fair value of the Bank’s liabilities during the period under review.

12. Gold deposits
Gold deposits placed with the Bank originate entirely from central banks. They are all designated as financial liabilities measured at
amortised cost.

13. Securities sold under repurchase agreements
Securities sold under repurchase agreements (“repurchase agreements”) are recognised as collateralised deposit transactions by which the
Bank receives cash and provides an irrevocable commitment to return the cash, plus interest, at a specified date in the future. Interest
payable on the transaction is fixed at the start of the agreement. As part of these agreements, the Bank transfers legal title of collateral
securities to the counterparty which the counterparty commits to return at the end of the contract. Because the Bank retains the risks and
rewards associated with ownership of these securities, they continue to be recognised as assets in the Bank’s balance sheet.
The securities sold under repurchase agreements (and related collateral provided by the Bank) are analysed in the table below:

17. Statutory reserves
The Bank’s Statutes provide for application of the Bank’s annual net profit by the Annual General Meeting on the proposal of the Board of
Directors to three specific reserve funds: the legal reserve fund, the general reserve fund and the special dividend reserve fund; the
remainder of the net profit after payment of any dividend is generally allocated to the free reserve fund.
Legal reserve fund. This fund is currently fully funded at 10% of the Bank’s paid-up capital.
General reserve fund. After payment of any dividend, 5% of the remainder of the Bank’s annual net profit currently must be allocated to the
general reserve fund.
Special dividend reserve fund. A portion of the remainder of the annual net profit may be allocated to the special dividend reserve fund,
which shall be available, in case of need, for paying the whole or any part of a declared dividend. Dividends are normally paid out of the
Bank’s net profit.
Free reserve fund. After the above allocations have been made, any remaining unallocated net profit is generally transferred to the free
reserve fund.
Receipts from the subscription of the Bank’s shares are allocated to the legal reserve fund as necessary to keep it fully funded, with the
remainder being credited to the general reserve fund.
The free reserve fund, general reserve fund and legal reserve fund are available, in that order, to meet any losses incurred by the Bank. In
the event of liquidation of the Bank, the balances of the reserve funds (after the discharge of the liabilities of the Bank and the costs of
liquidation) would be divided among the Bank’s shareholders.

global financial reporting standards. The revised policy is described in Section 26 of the accounting policies and note 3 provides further
information on the effects of this change.
The Bank operates three post-employment arrangements:
1. A defined benefit pension arrangement for its staff in the event of retirement, disability or death. Benefits accrue under this arrangement
according to years of participation and pensionable remuneration. Benefits are paid out of a fund without separate legal personality from
the BIS. The fund assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of current and former members of staff who participate in the
arrangement. Contributions are made to this fund by the Bank and by staff. The fund also receives the return on the assets it holds. The
Bank remains ultimately liable for all benefits due under the arrangement.
2. An unfunded defined benefit arrangement for its Directors, whose entitlement is based on a minimum service period of four years.
3. An unfunded post-employment health and accident benefit arrangement for its staff. Employees who leave the Bank after becoming
eligible for early retirement benefits from the pension arrangement are eligible for post-employment health and accident benefits.
All three arrangements operate in Swiss francs and are valued annually by an independent actuary. During 2014/15, the Bank expects to
make contributions of SDR 32.3 million to its post-employment arrangements.
In January 2014, the Board endorsed a number of changes to the staff pension arrangement. Changes included the discontinuation of the
right to purchase additional pension benefits, an increase in the compulsory retirement age, a reduction in early retirement benefits, and
an amendment to the pensionable remuneration basis from final salary to average salary of the last three years of service. Some of these
changes became effective immediately; others will become effective on 1 October 2014 when new pension fund regulations come into
force. These new pension regulations have been included in the actuarial calculation at 31 March 2014 to the extent that they change the
future expected cash flows of the staff pension arrangement.

F. Composition and fair value of fund assets for staff pensions
The table below analyses the assets of the staff pension fund and the extent to which the fair values of those assets have been calculated
using quoted prices in active markets. A price is considered to be quoted if it is both readily available from an exchange, dealer or similar
source and indicates the price at which transactions can be executed. A market is considered to be active if willing buyers and sellers can
normally be found. The staff pension fund does not invest in financial instruments issued by the Bank.

I. Sensitivity analysis of significant actuarial assumptions
The Bank is exposed to risks from these plans including investment risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, longevity risk and salary risk.
Investment risk is the risk that plan assets will not generate returns at the expected level.
Interest rate risk is the exposure of the post-employment benefit obligations to adverse movements in interest rates including credit spreads.
A decrease in interest rates will increase the present value of these obligations. However, in the case of the staff pension arrangement this
may be offset, either fully or partly, by an increase in value of the interest bearing securities held by the fund.
Foreign exchange risk is the exposure of the post-employment benefit obligations to adverse movements in exchange rates between the
Swiss franc, which is the operating currency of the post-employment benefit arrangements, and the SDR, which is the functional currency
of the Bank.
Longevity risk is the risk that actual outcomes differ from actuarial estimates of life expectancy.
Salary risk is the risk that higher than expected salary rises increase the cost of providing a salary-related pension.
The table below shows the estimated increase of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a change in key actuarial assumptions (see
tables 20G and 20H):

31 March 2014 the Bank employed 60 staff members (2013: 57) on behalf of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the International Association
of Deposit Insurers (IADI) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS).
The Bank makes direct contributions, which include salary and post-employment costs and other related expenses, towards the operational
costs of the FSB, IADI and IAIS, and these amounts are included under “Office and other expense”. The Bank also provides logistical,
administrative and staffing-related support for these organisations, the cost of which is included within the Bank’s regular operating expense
categories.

policy also requires that the dividend should reflect the Bank’s capital needs and its prevailing financial circumstances, with a pay-out ratio
of between 20% and 30% in most years.
The proposed dividend for 2014 represents a pay-out ratio of 29% of net profit (2013: 20%).

Gold bars held under earmark comprise specific gold bars which have been deposited with the Bank on a custody basis. They are included
at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and the USD exchange rate into SDR). At 31 March 2014 gold bars held under
earmark amounted to 389 tonnes of fine gold (2013: 324 tonnes).
Portfolio management mandates include BIS Investment Pools (BISIPs), which are collective investment arrangements for central banks and
dedicated mandates where assets are managed for a single central bank customer.
The BISIPs are a range of open-ended investment funds created by the Bank and managed using entities that do not have a separate legal
personality from the Bank. The assets of the BISIPs are held in the name of the BIS, but the economic benefit lies with central bank
customers. The Bank is considered as having an agency relationship with the BISIPs; the related assets are not included in the Bank’s financial
statements. The Bank does not invest for its own account in the BISIPs.
Dedicated mandates are portfolios which are managed by the Bank in accordance with investment guidelines set by the customer. The Bank
is not exposed to the risks or rewards from these assets, as they are held for the sole benefit of the central bank customer. The assets are
not included in the Bank’s financial statements.
For both the BISIPs and the dedicated mandates, the Bank is remunerated by a management fee which is included within net fee income
in the profit and loss account.
In addition to the off-balance sheet items listed above, the Bank also manages portfolios of BIS currency deposits on behalf of its customers.
These totalled SDR 8,560.9 million at 31 March 2014 (2013: SDR 6,532.6 million). The investments held in these portfolios are liabilities of
the Bank, and are included in the balance sheet under the heading “Currency deposits”.

34. Commitments
The Bank provides a number of committed standby facilities for its customers on a collateralised or uncollateralised basis. As at 31 March 2014
the outstanding commitments to extend credit under these committed standby facilities amounted to SDR 2,922.9 million (2013:
SDR 3,053.8 million), of which SDR 194.1 million was uncollateralised (2013: SDR 200.1 million).
The Bank is committed to supporting the operations of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the International Association of Deposit Insurers
(IADI) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and in each case has a separate agreement specifying the terms of
support and commitment. The Bank is the legal employer of IADI and IAIS staff, with the regular ongoing staff costs borne by each
association. The commitment by the BIS to IADI and the IAIS is subject to an annual budgetary decision of the Board.
On 28 January 2013 the BIS and the FSB entered into an agreement which governs the Bank’s support of the FSB. The agreement is for an
initial term of five years. Under the terms of the agreement, the BIS is the legal employer of FSB staff. The Bank provides a contribution to
cover FSB staff costs, and also provides premises, administrative infrastructure and equipment.

35. The fair value hierarchy
The Bank categorises its financial instrument fair value measurements using a hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in
measuring fair value. The valuation is categorised at the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The fair value hierarchy used by the Bank comprises the following levels:
Level 1 – Instruments valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
Level 2 – Instruments valued with valuation techniques using inputs which are observable for the financial instrument either directly (ie as
a price) or indirectly (ie derived from prices for similar financial instruments). This includes observable interest rates, spreads and volatilities.
Level 3 – Instruments valued using valuation techniques where the inputs are not observable in financial markets.

A. Assets and liabilities classified by levels in the fair value hierarchy
At 31 March 2014 and 2013 the Bank had no financial instruments categorised as level 3.

The Bank considers published price quotations in active markets as the best evidence of fair value. The financial instruments valued using
active market quotes are categorised as level 1.
Where reliable published price quotations are not available for a financial instrument, the Bank determines fair value by using market
standard valuation techniques. These valuation techniques include the use of discounted cash flow models as well as other standard
valuation methods. Where financial models are used, the Bank aims at making maximum use of observable market data as model inputs.
The financial instruments valued in this manner are categorised as level 2.

B. Transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy
Of the assets categorised as level 1 at 31 March 2014, SDR 2,359.3 million related to assets that had been held at 31 March 2013 and valued
as level 2 at that date. Of the assets categorised as level 2 at 31 March 2014, SDR 3,068.3 million related to assets that had been held at
31 March 2013 and categorised as level 1 as at that date. No assets were transferred to or from the level 3 category during the year. The
transfer of assets between levels 1 and 2 reflected specific market conditions existing at the reporting dates that affected the observability
of the market prices as defined above. No liability valuations were transferred between fair value hierarchy levels.

C. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value level 3
During the 2013/14 financial year the Bank did not hold assets classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. During the previous financial
year the Bank had an opening balance at 31 March 2012 of SDR 8.3 million of illiquid bonds. These were valued by the estimation of credit
spreads. An increase in the credit spread estimate would have led to a lower fair value at 31 March 2012.

D. Financial instruments not measured at fair value
The Bank accounts for certain financial instruments at amortised cost. These comprise financial assets of “Cash and sight accounts”, “Gold
and gold loans” and “Notice accounts”. Financial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise “Gold deposits”, “Sight and notice deposit
accounts” and those “Securities sold under repurchase agreements” that are associated with currency assets available for sale. If these
instruments were included in the fair value hierarchy, the valuation of “Gold loans” and “Securities sold under repurchase agreements” would
be considered level 2. All other amortised cost financial instruments would be considered level 1.
Using the same valuation techniques for amortised cost financial instruments as is applied to fair valued financial instruments, the Bank
estimates that their fair values would be materially the same as the carrying values shown in these financial statements for both 31 March
2014 and 31 March 2013.

Capital adequacy

1. Capital adequacy frameworks
As an international financial institution that is overseen by a Board composed of Governors of major central banks and that, by nature, has
no national supervisor, the Bank is committed to maintaining its superior credit quality and financial strength, in particular in situations of
financial stress. To that end, the Bank continuously assesses its capital adequacy based on an annual capital planning process that focuses
on two elements: an economic capital framework and a financial leverage framework.
The Bank discloses risk-related information on its exposure to credit, market, operational and liquidity risk based on its own assessment of
capital adequacy.
To facilitate comparability, the Bank has implemented a framework that is consistent with the revised International Convergence of Capital
Measurement and Capital Standards (Basel II Framework) issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in June 2006. Following
that framework, the Bank discloses a Tier 1 capital ratio (Pillar 1), risk-weighted assets and more detailed related information. The Bank
maintains a capital position substantially in excess of the regulatory minimum requirement in order to ensure its superior credit quality.

2. Economic capital
The Bank’s economic capital methodology relates its risk-taking capacity to the amount of economic capital needed to absorb potential
losses arising from its exposures. The risk-taking capacity is defined as allocatable economic capital that is derived following a prudent
assessment of the components of the Bank’s equity, which are set out in the table below:

Allocatable economic capital is determined following a prudent evaluation of the Bank’s equity components for their loss absorption
capacity and sustainability. The components of capital with long-term risk-bearing capacity are the Bank’s Tier 1 capital and the sustainable
portion of the securities and gold revaluation reserves (“sustainable supplementary capital”). Only this “allocatable capital” is available for
allocation to the various categories of risk. The portion of revaluation reserves that is considered more transitory in nature is assigned to
the “capital filter” together with the profit accrued during the financial year.

As part of the annual capital planning process, Management allocates economic capital to risk categories within the amount of allocatable
capital. As a first step, capital is assigned to an “economic capital cushion” that provides an additional margin of safety and is sufficient to
sustain a potential material loss without the need to reduce the capital allocation to individual risk categories or to liquidate any holdings
of assets. The level of the economic capital cushion is determined based on stress tests that explore extreme but still plausible default events.
Allocations are then made to each category of financial risk (ie credit, market and “other risks”) as well as operational risk. “Other risks” are
risks that have been identified but that are not taken into account in the economic capital utilisation calculations, and include model risk
and residual basis risk. The Bank’s economic capital framework measures economic capital to a 99.995% confidence level assuming a oneyear horizon, except for settlement risk (included in the utilisation for credit risk) and other risks. The amount of economic capital set aside
for settlement risk and other risks is based on an assessment by Management.
The following table summarises the Bank’s economic capital allocation and utilisation for credit risk, market risk, operational risk and
other risks:

The Bank’s economic capital framework is subject to regular review and calibration. The increase of economic capital utilisation for credit
risk and operational risk since 31 March 2013 is partly due to a review of the respective methodologies and parameterisations during the
reporting period. The relatively low level of utilisation of economic capital for market risk is largely attributable to the exceptionally low
volatility of the main market risk factors during the period under review.

3. Financial leverage
The Bank complements its capital adequacy assessment with a prudently managed financial leverage. The Bank monitors its financial
leverage using a leverage ratio that compares the Bank’s Tier 1 capital with its total balance sheet assets. As such, derivatives transactions,
repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are included in the leverage ratio calculation on a gross basis in accordance
with the Bank’s accounting policies.
The table below shows the calculation of the Bank’s financial leverage ratio:

The Basel II Framework includes several approaches for calculating risk-weighted assets and the corresponding minimum capital requirements.
In principle, the minimum capital requirements are determined by taking 8% of the risk-weighted assets.

For credit risk, the Bank has adopted the advanced internal ratings-based approach for the majority of its exposures. Under this approach,
the risk weighting for a transaction is determined by the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs.
For securitisation exposures, externally managed portfolios and relevant other assets, the Bank has adopted the standardised approach.
Under this approach, risk weightings are mapped to exposure types.
Risk-weighted assets for market risk are derived following an internal models approach. For operational risk, the advanced measurement
approach is used. Both these approaches rely on value-at-risk (VaR) methodologies.
More details on the assumptions underlying the calculations are provided in the sections on credit risk, market risk and operational risk.

Expected loss is calculated for credit risk exposures subject to the advanced internal ratings-based approach. The expected loss is calculated
at the balance sheet date taking into account any impairment provision which is reflected in the Bank’s financial statements. The Bank had
no impaired financial assets at 31 March 2014 (2013: nil). In accordance with the requirements of the Basel II Framework, any expected loss
is compared with the impairment provision and any shortfall is deducted from the Bank’s Tier 1 capital.
The Bank is committed to maintaining its superior credit quality and financial strength, in particular in situations of financial stress. This is
reflected in its own assessment of capital adequacy. As a result, the Bank maintains a capital position substantially in excess of minimum
capital requirements under the Basel II Framework.

Risk management

1. Risks faced by the Bank
The Bank supports its customers, predominantly central banks, monetary authorities and international financial institutions, in the
management of their reserves and related financial activities.
Banking activities form an essential element of meeting the Bank’s objectives and ensure its financial strength and independence. The BIS
engages in banking activities that are customer-related as well as activities that are related to the investment of its equity, each of which
may give rise to financial risk comprising credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The Bank is also exposed to operational risk.
Within the risk frameworks defined by the Board of Directors, the Management of the Bank has established risk management policies
designed to ensure that risks are identified, appropriately measured and controlled as well as monitored and reported.

2. Risk management approach and organisation
The Bank maintains superior credit quality and adopts a prudent approach to financial risk-taking, by:

•
•
•
•

maintaining an exceptionally strong capital position;

•

maintaining a high level of liquidity.

investing its assets predominantly in high credit quality financial instruments;
seeking to diversify its assets across a range of sectors;
adopting a conservative approach to its tactical market risk-taking and carefully managing market risk associated with the Bank’s
strategic positions, which include its gold holdings; and

A. Organisation
Under Article 39 of the Bank’s Statutes, the General Manager is responsible to the Board for the management of the Bank, and is assisted
by the Deputy General Manager. The Deputy General Manager is responsible for the Bank’s independent risk control and compliance
functions. The General Manager and the Deputy General Manager are supported by senior management advisory committees.
The key advisory committees are the Executive Committee, the Finance Committee and the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee.
The first two committees are chaired by the General Manager and the third by the Deputy General Manager, and all include other senior
members of the Bank’s Management. The Executive Committee advises the General Manager primarily on the Bank’s strategic planning and
the allocation of resources, as well as on decisions related to the broad financial objectives for the banking activities and operational risk
management. The Finance Committee advises the General Manager on the financial management and policy issues related to the banking
business, including the allocation of economic capital to risk categories. The Compliance and Operational Risk Committee acts as an
advisory committee to the Deputy General Manager and ensures the coordination of compliance matters and operational risk management
throughout the Bank.
The independent risk control function for financial risks is performed by the Risk Control unit. The independent operational risk control
function is shared between Risk Control, which maintains the operational risk quantification, and the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit.
Both units report directly to the Deputy General Manager.
The Bank’s compliance function is performed by the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit. The objective of this function is to provide
reasonable assurance that the activities of the Bank and its staff conform to applicable laws and regulations, the BIS Statutes, the Bank’s
Code of Conduct and other internal rules, policies and relevant standards of sound practice.
The Compliance and Operational Risk Unit identifies and assesses compliance risks and guides and educates staff on compliance issues. The
Head of the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit also has a direct reporting line to the Audit Committee, which is an advisory committee
to the Board of Directors.

BIS 84th Annual Report

223

The Finance unit and the Legal Service complement the Bank’s risk management. The Finance unit operates an independent valuation
control function, produces the Bank’s financial statements and controls the Bank’s expenditure by setting and monitoring the annual budget.
The objective of the independent valuation control function is to ensure that the Bank’s valuations comply with its valuation policy and
procedures, and that the processes and procedures which influence the Bank’s valuations conform to best practice guidelines. The Finance
unit reports to the Deputy General Manager and the Secretary General.
The Legal Service provides legal advice and support covering a wide range of issues relating to the Bank’s activities. The Legal Service has
a direct reporting line to the General Manager.
The Internal Audit function reviews internal control procedures and reports on how they comply with internal standards and industry best
practices. The scope of internal audit work includes the review of risk management procedures, internal control systems, information systems
and governance processes. Internal Audit has reporting lines to the General Manager and the Deputy General Manager, and to the Audit
Committee.

B. Risk monitoring and reporting
The Bank’s financial and operational risk profile, position and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis by the relevant units.
Financial risk and compliance reports aimed at various management levels are regularly provided to enable Management to adequately
assess the Bank’s risk profile and financial condition.
Management reports financial and risk information to the Board of Directors on a monthly and a quarterly basis. Furthermore, the Audit
Committee receives regular reports from Internal Audit, the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit and the Finance unit. The Banking and
Risk Management Committee, another advisory committee to the Board, receives regular reports from the Risk Control unit. The preparation
of reports is subject to comprehensive policies and procedures, thus ensuring strong controls.

C. Risk methodologies
The Bank revalues virtually all of its financial assets to fair value on a daily basis and reviews its valuations monthly, taking into account
necessary adjustments for impairment. It uses a comprehensive range of quantitative methodologies for valuing financial instruments and
for measuring risk to its net profit and equity. The Bank reassesses its quantitative methodologies in the light of its changing risk environment
and evolving best practice.
The Bank’s model validation policy defines the roles and responsibilities and processes related to the implementation of new or materially
changed risk models.
A key methodology used by the Bank to measure and manage risk is the calculation of economic capital based on value-at-risk (VaR)
techniques. VaR expresses the statistical estimate of the maximum potential loss on the current positions of the Bank measured to a
specified level of confidence and a specified time horizon. VaR models depend on statistical assumptions and the quality of available market
data and, while forward-looking, they extrapolate from past events. VaR models may underestimate potential losses if changes in risk factors
fail to align with the distribution assumptions. VaR figures do not provide any information on losses that may occur beyond the assumed
confidence level.
The Bank’s economic capital framework covers credit risk, market risk, operational risk and other risks. As part of the annual capital planning
process, the Bank allocates economic capital to the above risk categories commensurate with principles set by the Board and taking account
of the business strategy. The Bank’s economic capital framework measures economic capital to a 99.995% confidence interval assuming a
one-year holding period. An additional amount of economic capital is set aside for “other risks” based on Management’s assessment of risks
which are not reflected in the economic capital calculations. Moreover, capital is also allocated to an “economic capital cushion” that is
based on stress tests that explore extreme but still plausible default events. The economic capital cushion provides an additional margin of
safety to sustain a potential material loss without the need to reduce the capital allocated to individual risk categories or to liquidate any
holdings of assets.
The management of the Bank’s capital adequacy is complemented by a comprehensive stress testing framework, and a prudently determined
financial leverage. The stress testing framework supplements the Bank’s risk assessment including its VaR and economic capital calculations
for financial risk. The Bank’s key market risk factors and credit exposures are stress-tested. The stress testing includes the analysis of severe
historical and adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, as well as sensitivity tests of extreme but still plausible movements of the key
risk factors identified. The Bank also performs stress tests related to liquidity risk. The financial leverage framework focuses on a ratio that
sets the Bank’s Tier 1 capital in relation to its total balance sheet assets.

224

BIS 84th Annual Report

3. Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to meet its obligations in accordance with the agreed contractual terms and conditions.
A financial asset is considered past due when a counterparty fails to make a payment on the contractual due date.
The Bank manages credit risk within a framework and policies set by the Board of Directors and Management. These are complemented by
more detailed guidelines and procedures at the level of the independent risk control function.

A. Credit risk assessment
Credit risk is continuously controlled at both a counterparty and an aggregated level. As part of the independent risk control function,
individual counterparty credit assessments are performed subject to a well defined internal rating process, involving 18 rating grades. As
part of this process, counterparty financial statements and market information are analysed. The rating methodologies depend on the
nature of the counterparty. Based on the internal rating and specific counterparty features, the Bank sets a series of credit limits covering
individual counterparties and countries. Internal ratings are assigned to all counterparties. In principle, the ratings and related limits are
reviewed at least annually. The main assessment criterion in these reviews is the ability of the counterparties to meet interest and principal
repayment obligations in a timely manner.
Credit risk limits at the counterparty level are approved by the Bank’s Management and fit within a framework set by the Board of Directors.
On an aggregated level credit risk, including default and country transfer risk, is measured, monitored and controlled based on the Bank’s
economic capital calculation for credit risk. To calculate economic capital for credit risk, the Bank uses a portfolio VaR model. Management
limits the Bank’s overall exposure to credit risk by allocating an amount of economic capital to credit risk.

B. Default risk
The following tables show the exposure of the Bank to default risk, without taking into account any collateral held or other credit
enhancements available to the Bank. Credit risk is further mitigated through the use of collateral and legally enforceable netting or setoff
agreements. The corresponding assets and liabilities are not offset on the balance sheet.
The exposures set out in the tables below are based on the carrying value of the assets on the balance sheet as categorised by sector,
geographical region and credit quality. The carrying value is the fair value of the financial instruments, including derivatives, except in the
case of very short-term financial instruments (sight and notice accounts) and gold, which are shown at amortised cost net of any impairment
charge. Commitments are reported at their notional amounts. Gold and gold loans exclude gold bar assets held in custody, and accounts
receivable do not include unsettled liability issues, because these items do not represent credit exposures of the Bank.
The vast majority of the Bank’s assets are invested in securities issued by governments and financial institutions rated A– or above by at
least one of the major external credit assessment institutions. Limitations on the number of high-quality counterparties in these sectors
mean that the Bank is exposed to single-name concentration risk.
The Bank conducts an annual review for impairment at the date of each balance sheet. At 31 March 2014 the Bank did not have any financial
assets that were considered to be impaired (31 March 2013: nil). As at 31 March 2014 no financial assets were considered past due
(31 March 2013: nil). No credit loss was recognised in the current period.

C. Credit risk mitigation

Netting
Netting agreements give the Bank the legally enforceable right to net transactions with counterparties under potential future conditions,
notably an event of default. Such master netting or similar agreements apply to counterparties with whom the Bank conducts most of its
derivative transactions, as well as the counterparties used for repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement transactions. Where required,
netting is applied when determining the amount of collateral to be requested or provided, but the Bank does not settle assets and liabilities
on a net basis during the normal course of business. As such, the amounts shown on the Bank’s balance sheet are the gross amounts.

Collateral
The Bank also mitigates the credit risks it is exposed to by requiring counterparties to provide collateral. The Bank receives collateral in
respect of most derivative contracts, securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse repurchase agreements”) and for advances
made under collateralised facility agreements. During the term of these transactions, further collateral may be called or collateral may be
released based on the movements in value of both the underlying instrument and the collateral that has been received. The Bank is required
to provide collateral in respect of securities sold under repurchase agreements (“repurchase agreements”).
For derivative contracts and reverse repurchase agreements, the Bank accepts as collateral high-quality sovereign, state agency and
supranational securities and, in a limited number of cases, cash. For advances made under collateralised facility agreements, eligible
collateral accepted includes currency deposits with the Bank as well as units in the BIS Investment Pools.

230

Under the terms of its collateral arrangements, the Bank is permitted to sell (“re-hypothecate”) collateral received on derivative contracts
and reverse repurchase agreements, but upon expiry of the transaction must return equivalent financial instruments to the counterparty. At
31 March 2014 the Bank had not sold any of the collateral it held (2013: nil).
The fair value of collateral held which the Bank had the right to sell was:

Financial assets and liabilities subject to netting or collateralisation
The tables below show the categories of assets and liabilities which are either subject to collateralisation, or for which netting agreements
would apply under potential future conditions such as the event of default of a counterparty.
The amount of collateral required is usually based on valuations performed on the previous business day, whereas the Bank’s balance sheet
reflects the valuations of the reporting date. Due to this timing difference, the valuation of collateral can be higher than the valuation of
the underlying contract in the Bank’s balance sheet. The amount of the collateral obtained is also impacted by thresholds, minimum transfer
amounts and valuation adjustments (“haircuts”) specified in the contracts. In these tables, the mitigating effect of collateral has been limited
to the balance sheet value of the underlying net asset.

D. Economic capital for credit risk
The Bank determines economic capital for credit risk using a VaR methodology on the basis of a portfolio VaR model, assuming a one-year
time horizon and a 99.995% confidence interval, except for settlement risk (included in the utilisation for credit risk). The amount of
economic capital set aside for settlement risk reflected in the Bank’s economic capital calculations is based on an assessment by Management.

E. Minimum capital requirements for credit risk
Exposure to sovereigns, banks and corporates
For the calculation of risk-weighted assets for exposures to banks, sovereigns and corporates, the Bank has adopted an approach that is
consistent with the advanced internal ratings-based approach.
As a general rule, under this approach risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying the credit risk exposures with risk weights derived
from the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs. These estimates for key inputs are also relevant
to the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit risk.
The credit risk exposure for a transaction or position is referred to as the exposure at default (EAD). The Bank determines the EAD as the
notional amount of all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures, except derivative contracts and certain collateralised exposures. The EAD
for derivatives is calculated using an approach consistent with the internal models method proposed under the Basel II framework. In line
with this methodology, the Bank calculates effective expected positive exposures that are then multiplied by a factor alpha as set out in the
framework.
Key inputs to the risk weight function are a counterparty’s estimated one-year probability of default (PD) as well as the estimated loss-givendefault (LGD) and maturity for each transaction.
Due to the high credit quality of the Bank’s investments and the conservative credit risk management process at the BIS, the Bank is not in
a position to estimate PDs and LGDs based on its own default experience. The Bank calibrates counterparty PD estimates through a mapping
of internal rating grades to external credit assessments taking external default data into account. Similarly, LGD estimates are derived from
external data. Where appropriate, these estimates are adjusted to reflect the risk-reducing effects of collateral obtained giving consideration
to market price volatility, re-margining and revaluation frequency. The recognition of the risk-reducing effects of collateral obtained for
derivative contracts, reverse repurchase agreements and collateralised advances is accounted for in calculating the EAD.
The table below details the calculation of risk-weighted assets. The exposures are measured taking netting and collateral benefits into
account. The total amount of exposures reported in the table as at 31 March 2014 includes SDR 208.5 million for interest rate contracts
(31 March 2013: SDR 303.6 million) and SDR 229.4 million for FX and gold contracts (31 March 2013: SDR 761.3 million). In line with the
Basel II Framework, the minimum capital requirement is determined as 8% of risk-weighted assets.

Securitisation exposures
The Bank invests in highly rated securitisation exposures based on traditional, ie non-synthetic, securitisation structures. Given the scope of
the Bank’s activities, risk-weighted assets under the Basel II Framework are determined according to the standardised approach for
securitisation. Under this approach, external credit assessments of the securities are used to determine the relevant risk weights. External
credit assessment institutions used for this purpose are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Risk-weighted assets
are then derived as the product of the notional amounts of the exposures and the associated risk weights. In line with the Basel II
Framework, the minimum capital requirement is determined as 8% of risk-weighted assets.

4. Market risk
The Bank is exposed to market risk through adverse movements in market prices. The main components of the Bank’s market risk are gold
price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The Bank measures market risk and calculates economic capital based on a VaR
methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Risk factor volatilities and correlations are estimated, subject to an exponential
weighting scheme, over a four-year observation period. Furthermore, the Bank computes sensitivities to certain market risk factors.
In line with the Bank’s objective of maintaining its superior credit quality, economic capital is measured to a 99.995% confidence interval
assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank’s Management manages market risk economic capital usage within a framework set by the
Board of Directors. VaR limits are supplemented by operating limits.
To ensure that models provide a reliable measure of potential losses over the one-year time horizon, the Bank has established a comprehensive
regular back-testing framework, comparing daily performance with corresponding VaR estimates. The results are analysed and reported to
Management.
The Bank also supplements its market risk measurement based on VaR modelling and related economic capital calculations with a series of
stress tests. These include severe historical scenarios, adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios and sensitivity tests of gold price,
interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements.

BIS 84th Annual Report

A. Gold price risk
Gold price risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in the price of gold.
The Bank is exposed to gold price risk principally through its holdings of gold investment assets, which amount to 111 tonnes
(2013: 115 tonnes). These gold investment assets are held in custody or placed on deposit with commercial banks. At 31 March 2014 the
Bank’s net gold investment assets amounted to SDR 2,981.8 million (2013: SDR 3,944.9 million), approximately 17% of its equity (2013: 21%).
The Bank sometimes also has small exposures to gold price risk arising from its banking activities with central and commercial banks. Gold
price risk is measured within the Bank’s VaR methodology, including its economic capital framework and stress tests.

B. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates including credit spreads. The Bank
is exposed to interest rate risk through the interest bearing assets relating to the management of its equity held in its investment portfolios
and investments relating to its banking portfolios. The investment portfolios are managed using a fixed duration benchmark of bonds.
The Bank measures and monitors interest rate risk using a VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses taking into account movements in
relevant money market rates, government bonds, swap rates and credit spreads.
The tables below show the impact on the Bank’s equity of a 1% upward shift in the relevant yield curve per time band:

C. Foreign exchange risk
The Bank’s functional currency, the SDR, is a composite currency comprising fixed amounts of USD, EUR, JPY and GBP. Currency risk is the
exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in exchange rates. The Bank is exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily
through the assets relating to the management of its equity. The Bank is also exposed to foreign exchange risk through managing its
customer deposits and through acting as an intermediary in foreign exchange transactions. The Bank reduces its foreign exchange exposures
by matching the relevant assets to the constituent currencies of the SDR on a regular basis, and by limiting currency exposures arising from
customer deposits and foreign exchange transaction intermediation.
The following tables show the Bank’s assets and liabilities by currency and gold exposure. The net foreign exchange and gold position in
these tables therefore includes the Bank’s gold investments. To determine the Bank’s net foreign exchange exposure, the gold amounts need
to be removed. The SDR-neutral position is then deducted from the net foreign exchange position excluding gold to arrive at the net
currency exposure of the Bank on an SDR-neutral basis.

D. Economic capital for market risk
The Bank measures market risk based on a VaR methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique taking correlations between risk
factors into account. Economic capital for market risk is also calculated following this methodology measured to a 99.995% confidence
interval and assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank measures its gold price risk relative to changes in the USD value of gold. The
foreign exchange risk component, resulting from changes in the USD exchange rate versus the SDR, is included in the measurement of
foreign exchange risk. The table below shows the key figures of the Bank’s exposure to market risk in terms of economic capital utilisation
over the past two financial years:

E. Minimum capital requirements for market risk
For the calculation of minimum capital requirements for market risk under the Basel II Framework, the Bank has adopted a banking book
approach consistent with the scope and nature of its business activities. Consequently, market risk-weighted assets are determined for gold
price risk and foreign exchange risk, but not interest rate risk. The related minimum capital requirement is derived using the VaR-based
internal models method. Under this method, VaR calculations are performed using the Bank’s VaR methodology, to a 99% confidence
interval assuming a 10-day holding period.
The actual minimum capital requirement is derived as the higher of the VaR on the calculation date and the average of the daily VaR
measures on each of the preceding 60 business days (including the calculation date) subject to a multiplication factor of three plus a
potential add-on depending on back-testing results. For the period under consideration, the number of back-testing outliers observed
remained within the range where no add-on is required. The table below summarises the market risk development relevant to the calculation
of minimum capital requirements and the related risk-weighted assets over the reporting period:

5. Operational risk
Operational risk is defined by the Bank as the risk of financial loss, or damage to the Bank’s reputation, or both, resulting from one or more
risk causes, as outlined below:

•

Human factors: insufficient personnel, lack of requisite knowledge, skills or experience, inadequate training and development, inadequate
supervision, loss of key personnel, inadequate succession planning, or lack of integrity or ethical standards.

•

Failed or inadequate processes: a process is poorly designed or unsuitable, or is not properly documented, understood, implemented,
followed or enforced.

•
•

Failed or inadequate systems: a system is poorly designed, unsuitable or unavailable, or does not operate as intended.
External events: the occurrence of an event having an adverse impact on the Bank but outside its control.

Operational risk includes legal risk, but excludes strategic risk.
The Bank’s operational risk management framework, policies and procedures comprise the management and measurement of operational
risk, including the determination of the relevant key parameters and inputs, business continuity planning and the monitoring of key risk
indicators.
The Bank has established a procedure of immediate reporting for operational risk-related incidents. The Compliance and Operational Risk
Unit develops action plans with the respective units and follows up on their implementation on a regular basis.
For the measurement of operational risk economic capital and operational risk-weighted assets, the Bank has adopted a VaR approach using
a Monte Carlo simulation technique that is consistent with the advanced measurement approach proposed under the Basel II Framework.
In line with the assumptions of the Basel II Framework, the quantification of operational risk does not take reputational risk into account.
Internal and external loss data, scenario estimates and control self-assessments to reflect changes in the business and control environment
of the Bank are key inputs in the calculations. In quantifying its operational risk, the Bank does not take potential protection it may obtain
from insurance into account.

A. Economic capital for operational risk
Consistent with the parameters used in the calculation of economic capital for financial risk, the Bank measures economic capital for
operational risk to a 99.995% confidence interval assuming a one-year holding period. The table below shows the key figures of the Bank’s
exposure to operational risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years.

6. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises when the Bank may not be able to meet expected or unexpected current or future cash flows and collateral needs
without affecting its daily operations or its financial condition.
The Bank’s currency and gold deposits, principally from central banks and international institutions, comprise 94% (2013: 95%) of its total
liabilities. At 31 March 2014 currency and gold deposits originated from 175 depositors (2013: 168). Within these deposits, there are
significant individual customer concentrations, with five customers each contributing in excess of 5% of the total on a settlement date basis
(2013: five customers).
Outstanding balances in the currency and gold deposits from central banks, international organisations and other public institutions are the
key drivers of the size of the Bank’s balance sheet. The Bank is exposed to funding liquidity risk mainly because of the short-term nature of
its deposits and because it undertakes to repurchase at fair value certain of its currency deposit instruments at one or two business days’
notice. In line with the Bank’s objective to maintain a high level of liquidity, it has developed a liquidity management framework, including
a ratio, based on conservative assumptions for estimating the liquidity available and the liquidity required.

A. Maturity profile of cash flows
The following tables show the maturity profile of cash flows for assets and liabilities. The amounts disclosed are the undiscounted cash flows
to which the Bank is committed.

B. Liquidity ratio
The Bank has adopted a liquidity risk framework taking into account regulatory guidance issued by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision related to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The framework is based on a liquidity ratio that compares the Bank’s available
liquidity with a liquidity requirement over a one-month time horizon assuming a stress scenario. In line with the Basel III Liquidity Framework,
the underlying stress scenario combines an idiosyncratic and a market crisis. However, the liquidity ratio differs in construction from the LCR
to reflect the nature and scope of the BIS banking activities – in particular, the short-term nature of the Bank’s balance sheet. Within the
Bank’s liquidity framework, the Board of Directors has set a limit for the Bank’s liquidity ratio which requires the liquidity available to be at
least 100% of the potential liquidity requirement.

Liquidity available
The liquidity available is determined as the cash inflow from financial instruments over a one-month horizon, along with potential additional
liquidity which could be generated from the disposal of highly liquid securities, or by entering into sale and repurchase agreements for a
part of the Bank’s remaining unencumbered high-quality liquid securities. The assessment of this potential additional liquidity involves two
steps. First, there is an assessment of the credit quality and market liquidity of the securities. Second, the process of converting the identified
securities into cash is modelled by projecting the amount that could be reasonably collected.

Liquidity required
Consistent with the stress scenario, the Bank determines the liquidity required as the sum of the cash outflow from financial instruments
over a one-month horizon, the estimated early withdrawal of currency deposits, and the estimated drawings of undrawn facilities. As regards
the calculation of the liquidity needs related to currency deposits, it is assumed that all deposits that mature within the time horizon
are not rolled-over and that a proportion of non-maturing currency deposits is withdrawn from the Bank prior to contractual maturity. At
31 March 2014 the estimated outflow of currency deposits in response to the stress scenario amounted to 42.9% of the total stock of
currency deposits. Moreover, it is assumed that undrawn facilities committed by the Bank would be fully drawn by customers, along with a
proportion of undrawn uncommitted facilities.

Independent auditor’s report
to the Board of Directors and to the General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements, Basel
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Bank for International Settlements, which
comprise of the balance sheet as at 31 March 2014, the related profit and loss account, statement of
comprehensive income, statement of cash flows and movements in the Bank’s equity for the year then
ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Management’s responsibility
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
accordance with the accounting principles described in the financial statements and the Statutes of the
Bank. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system
relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error. Management is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting
policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply
with ethical responsibilities and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the
entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s
internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
