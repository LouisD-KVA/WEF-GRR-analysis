LEVEL 3 EMERGENCIES

Syria:

In its largest and most complex emergency
operation, WFP provided food for as many
as 4 million people a month inside Syria and
assisted more than a million refugees in
neighbouring countries.

Central African
Republic:

A breakdown in law and order tested
WFP’s humanitarian response to the
limit as communities were split apart
by violence. More than a million
people were forced to flee their homes,
some of them across borders.

Philippines:

Super-Typhoon Haiyan smashed
into the Philippines archipelago,
posing a logistics challenge
requiring massive mobilisation of
resources. In the weeks that
followed, WFP provided a million
people with food and cash.

South Sudan:

The world’s newest country was
engulfed by conflict, pushing
millions into food insecurity. Even
before the conflict, WFP was
assisting more than 2 million people.

Level 3 is the highest category for a WFP emergency, requiring the mobilisation of a
global, corporate response to support the Country Office and/or Regional Bureau.
