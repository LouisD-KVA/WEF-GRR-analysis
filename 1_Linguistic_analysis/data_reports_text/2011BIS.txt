BIS 81st Annual Report

81st Annual Report

submitted to the Annual General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements
held in Basel on 26 June 2011

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to submit to you the 81st Annual Report of the Bank for
International Settlements for the financial year which ended on 31 March 2011.
The net profit for the year amounted to SDR 816.0 million, compared with
SDR 1,859.8 million for the preceding year. Details of the results for the
financial year 2010/11 may be found on pages 139–42 of this Report under “Net
profit and its distribution”.
The Board of Directors proposes, in application of Article 51 of the Bank’s
Statutes, that the present General Meeting apply the sum of SDR 161.1 million
in payment of a dividend of SDR 295 per share, payable in any constituent
currency of the SDR, or in Swiss francs.
The Board further recommends that SDR 65.5 million be transferred to
the general reserve fund, SDR 6.0 million to the special dividend reserve fund
and the remainder – amounting to SDR 583.4 million – to the free reserve fund.
If these proposals are approved, the Bank’s dividend for the financial year
2010/11 will be payable to shareholders on 1 July 2011.

Overview of the economic chapters

Over the past year, the global economy has continued to improve. In emerging
markets, growth has been strong, and advanced economies have been moving
towards a self-sustaining recovery. But it would be a mistake for policymakers
to relax. From our vantage point, numerous legacies and lessons of the
financial crisis require attention. In many advanced economies, high debt levels
still burden households as well as financial and non-financial institutions, and
the consolidation of fiscal accounts has barely started. International financial
imbalances are re-emerging. Highly accommodative monetary policies are fast
becoming a threat to price stability. Financial reforms have yet to be completed
and fully implemented. And the data frameworks that should serve as an early
warning system for financial stress remain underdeveloped. These are the
challenges we examine in this year’s Annual Report.
Interrelated imbalances made pre-crisis growth in several advanced
countries unsustainable. Rapidly increasing debt and asset prices resulted in
bloated housing and financial sectors. The boom also masked serious longterm fiscal vulnerabilities that, if left unchecked, could trigger the next crisis.
We should make no mistake here: the market turbulence surrounding the
fiscal crises in Greece, Ireland and Portugal would pale beside the devastation
that would follow a loss of investor confidence in the sovereign debt of a major
economy.
Addressing overindebtedness, private as well as public, is the key to
building a solid foundation for high, balanced real growth and a stable financial
system. That means both driving up private saving and taking substantial
action now to reduce deficits in the countries that were at the core of the crisis.
The lessons of the crisis apply to emerging market economies, too. And
those where debt is fuelling huge gains in property prices and consumption
are running the risk of building up the imbalances that now plague the
advanced economies.
Global current account imbalances are still with us, bringing the prospect
of disorderly exchange rate adjustments and protectionism. But the imbalances
extend beyond current accounts to gross financial flows, which today dwarf
the net movements commonly associated with the current account. And they
pose perhaps even bigger risks by giving rise to potential financial mismatches
and facilitating the transmission of shocks across borders. Not only that, but
cross-border financing makes rapid credit growth possible even in the absence
of domestic financing. As the experience of the past few years reminded us, a
reversal of strong cross-border capital flows can inflict damage on financial
systems and ultimately on the real economy.
The imbalances in current accounts and in gross financial flows are
related and need to be addressed together. Sound macroeconomic policies will

xi

play a key role in this regard, as will structural domestic policies to encourage
saving in deficit countries and encourage consumption in surplus countries.
Although the adjustment of real exchange rates is also required, it will not, by
itself, be enough. Countries will need to implement policies that strengthen
prudential frameworks and the financial infrastructure. Capital controls, best
left as a last resort, can offer only temporary relief.
While adjustment by surplus and deficit countries is necessary and
mutually beneficial, it is constrained by a fundamental problem: countries may
find unilateral adjustment too costly. This means that international coordination
is essential to break the policy gridlock.
Turning to monetary policy, the challenges are intensifying even as central
banks extend the already prolonged period of accommodation. The persistence
of very low interest rates in major advanced economies delays the necessary
balance sheet adjustments of households and financial institutions. And it is
magnifying the risk that the distortions that arose ahead of the crisis will return.
If we are to build a stable future, our attempts to cushion the blow from the
last crisis must not sow the seeds of the next one.
Overall, inflation risks have been driven up by the combination of
dwindling economic slack and increases in the prices of food, energy and
other commodities. The spread of inflation dangers from major emerging
market economies to the advanced economies bolsters the conclusion that
policy rates should rise globally. At the same time, some countries must
weigh the need to tighten with vulnerabilities linked to still-distorted balance
sheets and lingering financial sector fragility. But once central banks start
lifting rates, they may need to do so more quickly than in past tightening
episodes.
With the end of unconventional policy actions in sight, central banks face
the risks associated with the resulting large size and complexity of their own
balance sheets. Failure to manage those risks could weaken their hard-won
credibility in delivering low inflation, as could a late move to tighten policy
through conventional channels.
Progress on financial regulatory reform has been impressive. International
agreements on stronger capital requirements and new liquidity standards for
banks have been reached quickly. Still, a number of critical steps remain.
Among these are the full and timely implementation of Basel III; the adoption
of measures to address the systemic risks associated with very large global
financial institutions; and the design of regimes to ensure the orderly resolution
of such institutions in the event of their failure. But the target will keep moving
as institutions resume risk-taking and adapt their business models to the new
environment. The supervisory framework must be able to keep up, monitoring
and managing risks to financial stability regardless of the given perimeter of
regulation.
The recent financial crisis revealed gaps in both the data and the
analytical frameworks used to assess systemic risk. These gaps hampered
policymakers in their efforts to identify and respond to vulnerabilities. To do
their job, authorities need a broader and more accurate view of the financial
system from multiple vantage points. That picture would show sectoral

xii

balance sheets and their global interlinkages, and it implies a wider sharing of
institution-level data within and across jurisdictions. While better data and
analytical frameworks will not prevent future crises, experience suggests that
the improvements will enable policymakers and market participants alike to
identify vulnerabilities previously unseen and pick up the emergence of others
much sooner.

I. Building a stable future

Pessimism has become tiresome, so optimism is gaining a foothold. But has
the pessimism born of the slow recovery from the financial crisis been
superseded by events? Is the optimism justified? Today, various facts support
a new attitude. Growth in emerging market economies is robust, and recovery
looks to be on a self-sustaining path in the countries that were at the centre
of the 2007–09 crisis. Yet the remaining challenges are enormous – towering
debt, global imbalances, extremely low interest rates, unfinished regulatory
reform, and financial statistics still too weak to illuminate emerging national
and international stresses.
Crisis-related expansions of sovereign debt have worsened what were
already unsustainable fiscal policy trajectories, and private sector debt remains
too high. The result is that, today, policymakers and households have virtually
no room for manoeuvre. All financial crises, especially those generated by a
credit-fuelled property price boom, leave long-lasting wreckage. But we must
guard against policies that would slow the inevitable adjustment. The sooner
that advanced economies abandon the leverage-led growth that precipitated
the Great Recession, the sooner they will shed the destabilising debt
accumulated during the last decade and return to sustainable growth. The
time for public and private consolidation is now.
The ongoing global integration of financial markets and financial systems
continues to deliver large, tangible economic benefits. But the gains come with
risks that require proper management. Aggregate supply and demand seem
to be roughly balanced on a global scale. But having declined during the crisis,
current account balances are increasing again. That means domestic demand
is too high in some countries and too low in others. And while current account
imbalances could disappear smoothly and harmlessly, the danger is that they
will continue to grow and stoke demands for protectionist measures. It is here
that international cooperation and coordination of policy are both most needed
and most lacking.
But net flows of capital are not the only challenge; gross flows matter too,
and they are staggeringly large. A sudden reversal of such flows could wreak
havoc with asset prices, interest rates, and even the prices of goods and
services in countries at both ends of the flows. Moreover, international flows
make rapid credit growth possible even in the absence of domestic saving.
The persistence of unusually low interest rates has played a role in encouraging
and facilitating these flows.
Many of the challenges facing us today are a direct consequence of a third
consecutive year of extremely accommodative financial conditions. Near zero
interest rates in the core advanced economies increasingly risk a reprise of the
distortions they were originally designed to combat. Surging growth made
emerging market economies the initial focus of concern as inflation began
rising nearly two years ago. But now, with the arrival of sharper price increases
for food, energy and other commodities, inflation has become a global concern.

The logical conclusion is that, at the global level, current monetary policy
settings are inconsistent with price stability.
The progress in financial regulation over the past year represents an
enormous achievement. International agreements were reached on stronger
capital requirements and new liquidity standards for banks, and implementation
has started. But work continues on large challenges that still remain. We need
to ensure that systemically important financial institutions can withstand the
next big shock when it inevitably comes. We need to build improved resolution
regimes within jurisdictions and create agreements across them. And we need
to continue building a regulatory perimeter that is sufficiently robust and
extensive to encompass every institution that acts like a bank.
Obviously, we also need to ensure universal acceptance of the new
regulatory framework being put in place. Investors and financial institutions
must understand and accept that the financial landscape has changed and that
they need to adapt their behaviour accordingly. The ongoing challenge for
regulators and other policymakers is to make the rules incentive compatible –
that is, to guarantee that decision-makers in financial institutions find that it is
in their own interest to act in a manner that reduces the risk of systemic collapse.
Finally, monitoring financial activity and anticipating stresses require
better and more complete data on markets and institutions than we now have.
Agreeing on the most practical solutions for these data gaps and quickly
implementing them is also essential to the preservation of financial stability.
These challenges – high public and private debt, global imbalances, the
risks of continued extreme monetary accommodation, the unfinished financial
reform agenda and gaps in financial data – are the subjects of the economic
chapters in this year’s Annual Report. To set the stage, we first briefly survey
the past year’s financial and economic events and then summarise the chapters
to come.

The year in retrospect
Two developments dominated the economic and financial landscape over the
past year: growing confidence that the recovery had become self-sustaining;
and continued reverberations of the sovereign debt problems facing a few
countries on the periphery of the euro area.
Recovery in advanced economies
Throughout much of 2010, the recovery of the major advanced economies
followed a somewhat stumbling path. Weak macroeconomic data, in
combination with the unfolding of euro area fiscal problems, prompted fears
that growth would stall and possibly even reverse. In response, major central
banks delayed policy normalisation and provided stimulus by creating or
extending extraordinary measures.
In October 2010, the Bank of Japan announced a ¥5 trillion programme
to purchase a variety of assets in an effort to lower risk premia and raise asset
prices. A month later, the US Federal Reserve began a second round of Treasury
bond purchases – the large-scale asset purchase programme commonly known

Anticipating the Federal Reserve’s move, markets had begun bidding up US
stock and bond prices long before the early-November announcement. The
passage by the US Congress of a further $858 billion stimulus bill in December
reinforced the positive market tone. More broadly, an increasingly steady
stream of good economic news contributed to the brightening expectations,
the rising prices of risky assets and the lowering of implied volatility in Europe,
Japan and the United States (Graph I.1).

The devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan in early March 2011
captured world attention but only temporarily dented optimism. As we write,
the resulting supply disruptions do not appear serious enough to impede
steady global growth.
Activity remained strong in major emerging market economies (Graph I.2,
left-hand panel). Mindful of the unevenness of the global recovery, investors
continued to shift their portfolios towards emerging markets (centre panel),
where equity prices outpaced those in advanced economies (right-hand panel).
Differential performance persisted until early 2011, when concerns about
overheating and inflation, combined with geopolitical worries linked to unrest
in the Middle East and North Africa, prompted a retreat from some emerging
markets.
While much of the increase in asset prices in the past year reflected
improving fundamentals, changing attitudes played a role as well. Market
participants had been gradually resuming their willingness to take on risk, as
we would expect in the early stages of a cyclical upturn. A related development
was the resurgence of financial innovation, with strong growth in new
instruments and vehicles such as synthetic exchange-traded funds, commoditylinked notes and commodity-based hedge funds. At one level, the return of
innovation is a positive sign. But the arrival of new products with risks untested
by market stress vividly brings back memories of the lead-up to the financial
crisis. The revival of risk-taking and innovation therefore poses an important
challenge for authorities tasked with maintaining financial stability.
Inflation pressures prompt revisions to monetary policy expectations
In major advanced economies, where economic slack dampened upward
pressure on consumer prices for some time, inflation expectations started a
gradual rise. Along with dwindling slack, a surge in prices for food, energy
and other commodities added substantially to near-term inflation pressures
for much of the past year (Graph I.3, left-hand and centre panels). The

significant food price increases reflected weather-related declines in global
supply combined with strong demand coming from global growth. For several
commodities, low inventories exacerbated upward price pressures, while
increased investor interest in commodities as an asset class may also have
played a role. Moreover, political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa
during the first quarter of 2011 led to concerns of possible supply disruptions,
contributing to especially sharp oil price increases.
Against this background, 10-year break-even inflation rates in major
advanced economies gradually started to climb in mid-2010 (Graph I.3, righthand panel). Much of the rise, however, was the result of quickly increasing
near-term inflation compensation (expected inflation and inflation risk premia).
But despite the obvious near-term price pressures, break-even inflation
expectations at distant horizons remained relatively stable, suggesting that
central banks’ long-term credibility was intact, at least for the time being.
But controlling inflation in the long term will require policy tightening.
And with short-term inflation up, that means a quicker normalisation of policy
rates. Expectations that short-term interest rates would rise contributed to the
increase in long-term bond yields seen until early 2011 (Graph I.4).
The move among major advanced economies to tighten monetary policy
came first in Europe in early 2011. Commodity price increases had helped lift
consumer price inflation in the euro area to 2.7% in March, well above the
ECB’s definition of price stability (close to, but below, 2%). In response, and
citing further upside risks to the outlook, the ECB raised policy rates by
25 basis points in April 2011. In the United Kingdom, CPI inflation had
exceeded the Bank of England’s 2% target since December 2009, reaching a
peak of 4.5% in April 2011 (in part due to a VAT increase). As yet, there has
been no move by the Monetary Policy Committee, but one wonders how long
its current policy can be sustained.
In emerging market economies, inflationary pressures were increasing as
well. Brisk economic growth combined with a relatively high weight on food

and commodities in consumer price indices generated price increases – modest
in Brazil, but significant in both China and India (Graph I.5, left-hand panel). In
response, authorities continued to take gradual steps to tighten monetary
conditions. The People’s Bank of China raised both its policy interest rate and
its reserve requirement a number of times. The Reserve Bank of India and the
Central Bank of Brazil also continued to tighten (Graph I.5, centre panel). Still,
real interest rates remained low or even negative in a number of emerging
market economies.
With interest rates rising in emerging markets and at or close to record
lows in advanced economies, investors shifted their portfolios towards the
assets with higher returns. They did that in part by increasing their carry trade
positions in emerging market fixed income instruments. Funded at very low
interest rates in currencies such as the US dollar and Swiss franc, these
positions are bets that the high interest rate differential will more than
compensate for possible countervailing moves in exchange rates.
The shift of funding has two potentially damaging effects. First, by exerting
upward pressure on exchange rates in the emerging market economies
receiving the capital flows, it makes their exports less competitive and puts a
brake on their growth. For economies that are overheating, this currency
appreciation is part of the natural equilibrating process. Second, large gross
cross-border financial flows can fuel unsustainable credit expansions and asset
price booms. What begins as a response to strong fundamentals can become
a serious threat to financial stability.
To resist, or at least slow, the nominal appreciation of their currencies,
several countries have been accumulating additional foreign currency reserves.
Some also introduced or increased taxes on foreigners investing in their
domestic currency markets: Brazil, which has seen strong currency appreciation
(Graph I.5, right-hand panel), raised its transaction tax on foreign fixed income
investments. Thailand removed tax breaks for foreign investors on domestic

bonds. Korea renewed a tax on foreign investors’ returns on government
bond investments.
Lingering fiscal policy concerns in the euro area
For a number of countries on the periphery of the euro area, concern about the
fiscal situation, which had initially surfaced in late 2009, intensified and then
lingered throughout the past year. As a result of initial policy actions, peripheral
country sovereign bond yields and credit default swap (CDS) spreads receded
from their May 2010 peaks. But, shortly thereafter, they began a steady rise
(Graph I.6). As the situation in Ireland deteriorated in November, spreads
climbed further there, as well as in Greece, Portugal and Spain.
Another factor driving up euro area credit spreads in late 2010 was the
October agreement between the governments of France and Germany – with
subsequent support from the rest of the European Union – making it possible
to impose losses on holders of sovereign bonds should a government be
unable to service its debt. Faced with soaring credit spreads, finance ministers
in several European countries later reiterated their position that such burdensharing would apply only to bonds issued after 2013. That declaration, together
with the later announcement of a support package for Ireland and continued
ECB bond purchases, brought temporary calm.
As 2011 began, credit spreads on euro area sovereigns rose once again.
But the news was not all bad. Some fiscal austerity measures were announced,
and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) successfully launched its
first issue of EU bonds in January.
Although the EFSF is scheduled to close down in mid-2013, its function
of supporting troubled EU sovereigns will be taken up by a successor, the
European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Euro area heads of state or government

agreed on some key features of the ESM in early March, when they also
adopted a Pact for the Euro, which, among other things, will require euro area
states to put the fiscal rules of the EU Stability and Growth Pact into national
legislation. Despite this progress, doubts remained about the near-term
effectiveness of the agreed facilities and, because of funding questions, about
the longer-term adequacy of the ESM.
The crisis deepened in April 2011 when Portugal became the third euro
area country to request EU assistance after its government failed to receive
domestic support for planned austerity measures and was forced to resign.
With negotiations on the support package dragging on, and popular backlashes
erupting in several countries, investor sentiment deteriorated further, and the
relentless upward trend of credit spreads of crisis-hit countries continued into
the second quarter. As a result, the financing burden was seen to be quickly
spiralling out of control in Greece, with Portugal and Ireland not far behind.
While inflation is one way out of this bind, it is ruled out by an independent ECB
set on maintaining price stability. That leaves only two options, neither of
which is very appealing. The first is restructuring. But the fallout from a partial
default on outstanding sovereign debt would be extremely difficult to control,
especially given the losses banks might sustain. The second is mutualisation,
in which other euro area countries pick up the tab for those in trouble. The first
option would be hard to manage; the second would be hard to sell to an
already sceptical European electorate.
Fiscal policy elsewhere
While investor distrust forced European politicians to act repeatedly over the
past year, fiscal imbalances in other countries, including the United States, the
United Kingdom and Japan, had little market impact (Graph I.6, right-hand
panel). Nonetheless, recognising the risks associated with waiting, the UK
government that took office in May 2010 announced a range of austerity
measures. Rating agencies provided further confirmation of the fiscal dangers
facing major advanced sovereigns. In January 2011, Standard & Poor’s (S&P)
downgraded the credit rating of Japan, and over subsequent months Moody’s,
S&P and Fitch lowered their outlook for Japan’s rating from “stable” to
“negative”, partly as a result of the prospective costs associated with the
March earthquake and tsunami. In April 2011, S&P cut its long-term outlook
for US sovereign debt for the first time (also from stable to negative), indicating
a higher risk that the United States could lose its AAA rating unless its finances
are put on a sounder footing.
Banks’ balance sheets improve but remain vulnerable
Balance sheets of financial firms continued to improve in advanced economies
(Graph I.7, left-hand panel). Rising asset prices and a steep yield curve helped
banks generate outsize profits over much of the past year. Lower loan loss
provisions contributed as well. However, while bank CDS spreads remained
stable in the United States and in Asia, they rose in Europe to levels not seen
since 2009 on worries about exposures to the troubled sovereign debt of the
euro area periphery (Graph I.7, right-hand panel). The greatest increase in

spreads was for banks in the countries facing the toughest fiscal challenges.
But the rise in spreads also affected banks in the core euro area, highlighting
the close relationship between fiscal and financial stability: valuation losses
on bonds issued by sovereigns in fiscal difficulty reduce the creditworthiness
of the banks holding them and lower the amount of collateral they can borrow
against.
Following the May 2009 US example, the European Union conducted
stress tests to assess the resilience of the EU banking system to a range of
adverse economic and financial market shocks. (Swiss regulators conducted a
simultaneous test.) The EU results, released in July 2010, showed that only
seven of 91 banks tested required additional capital (a combined E3.5 billion).
Initially, financial markets took a positive view of the announcements.
Sovereign credit spreads fell and conditions in European money markets
improved. But reaction turned negative as sceptical analysts complained that
the tests had not been demanding enough. Critics were vindicated when
several Irish banks were forced to seek government support only a few months
after having received a clean bill of health, thus triggering the Irish sovereign
debt crisis. A new stress test in early 2011 showed that the Irish banks would
require an additional E24 billion in capital, which would push the total Irish
government injection to at least E70 billion.
In the United States, a Federal Reserve assessment of the 19 largest US
banks showed that they had made significant progress in bolstering their
capital positions over the two years of the crisis, adding more than $300 billion

The year in prospect
Given the key role of finance in real economic growth, a robust financial
environment is a prerequisite for a stable economic future. If we are to create
and nurture that financial environment, we must shift public and private
finances onto a sustainable path, reduce the large current account balances
and gross financial flows arising from international activity, and ensure
medium-term price stability. Creating a durable financial environment also
requires that we finish regulatory reform and fill key gaps in the currently
available data that hinder our ability to detect emerging stresses in financial
markets, institutions and instruments.
Fiscal challenges
In the aftermath of the Great Recession, public debt levels have increased
dramatically, particularly in mature economies. As previously discussed, in the
peripheral euro area countries, the fiscal problems have already sapped
investor confidence to the point where sovereign borrowing costs have soared
beyond sustainable levels. For well over a year, European policymakers have
been scrambling to put together short-term fixes for the hardest-hit countries
while debating how to design a viable and credible long-term solution. They
need to finish the job, once and for all.
The fiscal woes of a number of euro area countries resulted in eyepopping jumps in their sovereign bond yields and CDS spreads. Yet, as noted,
other mature sovereigns with record high fiscal deficits and outsize levels of
public debt have not seen any market effects (at least none that are clearly
linked to their deteriorating fiscal conditions). Three factors that may be playing
a role in the market’s seemingly inconsistent treatment of fiscal stress across
countries are differences in the distribution of debt between the public and
private sectors, differences in the fraction of the countries’ sovereign debt that
is held by foreigners and whether countries have an independent currency.
Countries with lower private debt have more capacity to repay their public
debt. And when public debt is held by domestic residents, there may be a
greater willingness to repay. In addition, having an independent currency and
monetary policy also seems to play a role, as this provides policymakers with
greater flexibility.
Nevertheless, either you enjoy the confidence of the markets or you don’t.
Therefore, a loss of confidence in the ability and willingness of a sovereign to
repay its debt is more likely to be characterised by a sudden change in
sentiment than by a gradual evolution. This means that governments that put
off addressing their fiscal problems run a risk of being punished both suddenly
and harshly. And if that day comes, experience teaches us that the fiscal
consolidation measures needed to regain the confidence of investors will
be substantially larger, more difficult and more painful than they would
have been.
As discussed in Chapter II, fiscal authorities must take swift and credible
action to bring debt levels down to sustainable levels. This requires taking
short-term measures to reduce deficits in the aftermath of a costly recession
while addressing longer-term challenges arising from structural imbalances.

10

BIS 81st Annual Report

In many countries, the structural task involves facing up to the fact that, with
their populations ageing, promised pension schemes and social benefits are
simply too costly to sustain.1
The fiscal challenge is made all the more difficult by the fact that simply
returning to the pre-crisis fiscal stance will not be enough. This is true for at
least two reasons. First, fiscal positions preceding the financial crisis were
made to look unrealistically rosy by the tax revenues arising from unsustainable
credit and asset price booms. And second, cyclical surpluses need to be built
up as buffers that can be used for stabilisation in the future. Since the
government acts like an insurance company, it needs a reserve fund. This
means that running a cyclical balance, in which budget surpluses in booms
neutralise budget deficits in recessions, is not good enough.
What about the risk that aggressive austerity measures could prove
counterproductive, choking off economic growth? In advanced economies,
where the recovery appears now to be self-sustaining, this risk is much smaller
than it was a year ago. (In most emerging market economies, it is almost nonexistent.) But more importantly, in a number of cases the long-run fiscal outlook
has not improved, at least not enough. The unavoidable conclusion is that the
biggest risk is “doing too little too late” rather than “doing too much too soon”.
Private sector balance sheet challenges
Financial stability also requires adjustment to household, financial and nonfinancial firm balance sheets. Private sector debt remains high in both the
United States and Europe, where, as Chapter II argues, maintaining or
regaining market confidence requires continued deleveraging.
At the centre of the financial crisis was an unsustainable, debt-driven
residential and commercial real estate boom in a number of countries, most
prominently the United States. The result was a large stock of household debt,
which has not yet fallen enough, and shaky commercial mortgages. Together,
these cast a dark shadow over both the financial and real economies in a
number of countries.
Troubled financial institutions have made progress in cleaning up their
balance sheets. But, again, there is work left to do. They have been valuing
impaired assets at more realistic levels, discouraging evergreening of loans,
retaining earnings and raising capital in the financial markets. But at the same
time as ultra-low interest rates have given banks the breathing space to take
the necessary actions, they have weakened incentives to pursue the clean-up.
With the time for policy normalisation fast approaching, financial institutions
need to quickly finish what they have started. The fact that the financial system
has been building up significant interest rate risk as rock-bottom policy rates
have persisted underscores the need for urgency.
Apart from balance sheet difficulties, the private sector faces structural
problems that will take time to solve. Growth during the pre-crisis years was
heavily weighted towards finance and construction. In a number of countries,

BIS Working Papers, no 300, March 2010.

BIS 81st Annual Report

11

these sectors grew disproportionately to the rest of the economy and now have
to shrink. Like most adjustments, it will be painful in the short run. Not only will
this reallocation impose suffering on the people who worked and invested in
those sectors, it will weigh on aggregate growth and public revenues as well.
Emerging market economies managed to escape the worst of the crisis,
but many now run the risk of building up imbalances very similar to those
seen in advanced economies in the lead-up to the crisis. For example, property
prices in a number of emerging market economies are advancing at staggeringly
rapid rates, and private sector indebtedness is rising fast. Emerging market
policymakers should recognise that the lessons from the financial crisis do not
apply only to advanced economies.
International imbalances
After a brief, crisis-induced hiatus, global imbalances in financial flows – both
net and gross – have returned, creating vulnerabilities and complicating
policymaking at all levels. Current account surpluses and deficits are
generating large net flows of capital. But a country with large net inflows risks
financial instability if its financial sector cannot allocate the new capital
efficiently; and it is vulnerable to a sharp and damaging depreciation of its
currency if the inflow reverses.
Cross-border flows spur growth and development, benefiting everyone.
The flows can have harmful side effects, but impeding them or the cross-border
financial integration that facilitates them is not the solution. Instead, their
benefits should be protected and the side effects targeted by making structural
domestic adjustments, improving international policy coordination and
strengthening the financial stability framework.
What we need are policies in deficit countries to encourage saving and
policies in surplus countries to encourage consumption. And although not
enough by themselves, changes in real exchange rates are also essential;
however, major countries resist real exchange rate adjustment. As argued in
Chapter III, the policy gridlock must be broken by international coordination
that would distribute the burden of adjustment across major surplus and deficit
countries. Without such cooperation, the outsize current account imbalances,
the large net financial flows they generate and the resulting vulnerabilities will
continue to grow.
Large gross financial flows, dangerously obscured by the long-standing
concern over current account imbalances, are also creating vulnerabilities. In
recent years, these flows have generated enormous gross positions on balance
sheets across the globe, in some cases in the absence of any net flows. The
financial crisis showed us that the build-up of gross investment positions can
lead to substantial currency, liquidity and other mismatches that can propagate
and magnify shocks, creating damaging volatility in the international financial
system. Moreover, gross international flows make rapid credit growth possible,
eliminating the domestic savings restriction that would otherwise temper
credit expansions.
As discussed in Chapter III, the principal defence against the risks posed
by large gross flows is a set of macroeconomic policies that promote monetary

12

BIS 81st Annual Report

stability and fiscal sustainability. Regulatory and macroprudential measures
play a secondary role, while, as a last resort under extraordinary conditions,
capital controls can serve as a stopgap measure.
Monetary policy
Monetary policy challenges, already difficult, are intensifying. The great danger
is that long-term inflation expectations will start to climb, and current price
developments and policy stances are sending us in the wrong direction. As
spare capacity dwindles, food and energy price increases are more likely to have
second-round effects on inflation. And the risks to long-term inflation expectations
are intensified by continued unconventional monetary policy actions, outsize
central bank balance sheets in the core advanced economies and a perceived
temptation to inflate away the real value of ballooning government debt.
As discussed in Chapter IV, monetary policymakers have their work cut
out for them. They must find a way to normalise policy rates or risk jeopardising
their hard-earned credibility as inflation fighters. As the experience of the
1970s and 1980s shows, once inflation expectations take off, a costly, protracted
effort is required to rein them in. In emerging market economies, where central
banks are still working to establish their anti-inflation credibility, inflationary
pressures are rising and authorities face the build-up of risks linked to credit
and property price booms.
Given their large-scale government bond purchases, central banks are
running the risk of being seen as either working to ease sovereign debt strains
or having their policies rendered ineffective by the actions of debt managers.
Central banks must guard against even the hint that they are using monetary
easing as an excuse to monetise public debt. Markets and the public must
remain confident that central bank balance sheet policies are a means of
maintaining price stability and that, with inflation threats growing, policy will
be normalised very soon.
In this regard, the independence of central banks is the basis for their
credibility and provides the best defence against incipient inflation threats.
Indeed, the importance of central bank independence is applicable to other
policy areas. In particular, it should set the standard for the organisation of
macroprudential authorities (see box).
Regulatory reform
Regulatory reform is proceeding rapidly yet deliberately. The Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision has agreed on a new framework for capital and
liquidity standards, or Basel III, the details of which are described in Chapter V.
The reforms create a stronger banking system that will be more efficient in
allocating credit to the real economy while being less vulnerable to costly
financial crises.
The reforms in Basel III include requirements for both a higher minimum
quantity of capital and a better quality of capital to cover more risks. Further,
Basel III introduces additional capital buffers that will be adjusted
countercyclically to limit the amplitude of credit cycles. It also introduces
liquidity standards. One lesson of the crisis was that, left to their own devices,

Central bank governance and financial stability
The recent financial crisis highlighted the need for central banks to play a role in fashioning and executing
financial stability policy but raised questions about how best to organise such a function. Since central
banks vary widely in their institutional settings, historical contexts and political environments, no single
answer will apply. Nonetheless, the crisis provides four broad lessons that can inform efforts worldwide
to enhance the financial stability function of central banks:
Central banks must be involved in the formulation and execution of financial stability policy if such
policy is to be effective. There are three key reasons. Financial instability can affect the macroeconomic
environment, with substantial consequences for economic activity, price stability and the monetary
policy transmission process. Central banks are the ultimate source of liquidity for the economy, and
appropriate liquidity provision is crucial to financial stability. And central banks have a macroeconomic
focus and an understanding of financial markets, institutions and infrastructures – all crucial for the
exercise of a macroprudential function.
Clarity about the roles and responsibilities of all authorities involved in financial stability policy –
central banks, supervisors, deposit insurers, treasuries and competition authorities – is of paramount
importance for effective and rapid decision-making, for managing trade-offs and for accountability.
Clarity is needed to reduce the risk of a mismatch between what the public expects and what the central
bank can deliver. Knowing who is responsible for what at different stages of a crisis can aid rapid
decision-making. And clarity about responsibilities and powers also helps to promote accountability.
Even though it is difficult to define and operationalise financial stability concepts, attempting to achieve
clarity is thus desirable. Especially for central banks with broad financial stability responsibilities, there
may be merit in the public announcement of a financial stability strategy that clarifies the central bank’s
intentions and how it will reconcile the need to achieve multiple objectives.
The greater the responsibility afforded the central bank for emergency actions to support financial
stability, the greater the central bank’s risk-bearing capacity will need to be and/or the more robust the
mechanisms for transferring financial losses to the treasury. The point at which the treasury takes over
responsibility for financial risks, and the mechanisms by which it does so, should be clearly stated.
Central bank accountability for monetary policy actions is now heavily based on transparency. For
the most part, transparency will also be needed for financial stability functions. Disclosure of financial
stability decision-making and reasoning is therefore essential, though delay in disclosing some elements
of the decisions may be necessary if immediate disclosure risks triggering destabilising behaviour.
Under any financial stability mandate, the central bank will need appropriate tools, authorities and
safeguards. When the central bank has macroprudential policy responsibilities, it must have either tools
that it can use autonomously or the means to prompt or even require action by other authorities that
have the power to take appropriate action.
To discharge such mandates, central banks also need access to a wide range of information,
including on the quality of collateral, the solvency of institutions seeking liquidity support, the state of
systemically important institutions, and the interconnections between institutions, markets and systems.
This may require extensive information-sharing between agencies. The power to obtain information
directly from financial firms through the legal authority to call for reports and to conduct on-site
inspections may be needed.
Central banks’ financial stability mandates and governance arrangements need to be compatible
with their monetary policy responsibilities. In order to conduct monetary policy successfully, decisions
affecting monetary conditions should be made independently by the central bank, which also means that
it should have control over its balance sheet.
Where several agencies have related responsibilities for macroprudential policy, inter-agency
councils may be useful. Such councils may serve as forums for the exchange of information and advice
or for joint decision-making. In the former case, transparency of recommendations and comply-or-explain
requirements may reduce the risk that consultation will be perfunctory. In the latter case, the decisionmaking arrangements need to be clearly specified. In both cases, the design of procedures for making
decisions should pay careful attention to the capacity of each authority to discharge its separate and
independent duties.

chaired by Stefan Ingves, 2011.

BIS 81st Annual Report

Four recent examples of new institutional arrangements for macroprudential policy illustrate the
different approaches that can be taken in different institutional settings. In Malaysia, a new decisionmaking board with financial stability responsibilities was created within the central bank in 2009. In the
United Kingdom, an interim Financial Policy Committee has been created at the Bank of England pending
new legislation. Its purpose is to focus on the macroprudential dimension of financial stability policy –
including the use of microprudential policy instruments for overall system stability purposes. In both
these cases, the new decision-making bodies reside within the central bank. In contrast, in the new
arrangements in the European Union and the United States, inter-agency bodies are responsible for
macroprudential policy coordination and decision-making – the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB)
and, in the United States, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). Nonetheless, the central
banks have the majority of votes in the ESRB and have the prime role in providing it with analysis. In
the United States, the FSOC decides whether an institution is systemic, but the Federal Reserve, as the
supervisor of systemically important entities, takes the lead in setting heightened regulatory standards
for such entities. In all four examples just discussed, the mandates of the macroprudential bodies do not
extend to monetary policy; the central banks retain their independent objectives and full ability to make
interest rate decisions.

banks and other financial intermediaries will maintain woefully inadequate
liquidity buffers. Under Basel III, financial institutions will have to hold sufficient
liquidity to be able to weather a variety of shocks.
However, the work is not finished. Significant challenges remain. Among
them is the need to ensure that systemically important financial institutions
(SIFIs) become, in effect, less so. This means first figuring out which
institutions are systemically important and then determining the steps needed
to make them sufficiently resilient. Regulators are busy working out how much
additional loss absorbency global SIFIs should have. Moreover, while the
Financial Stability Board (FSB) has issued recommendations for enhanced
supervision of SIFIs, the details still need to be settled by national supervisors,
standard setters and the FSB. This process is complicated by the existence of
various types of SIFIs. For example, among SIFIs, an insurance company
would probably have balance sheet risks that need to be treated differently
from those faced by a bank.
Besides making SIFIs more resilient, reducing the externality they create
for the financial system at large, we must devise resolution regimes for them
to ensure that they can fail in an orderly way. Work is progressing on legal and
policy frameworks to enhance authorities’ capability to manage and resolve
distressed institutions with the least possible disruption to the larger financial
system.
Another key to building the foundations of a stable financial system is to
extend the regulatory perimeter beyond traditional financial institutions to
cover shadow banks – entities that perform maturity or liquidity transformation
outside the currently regulated banking system. Shadow banks have the
potential to generate substantial systemic risk because they can be highly
leveraged and engage in significant amounts of maturity transformation while
being closely linked to commercial banks. And, as the name suggests, the
shadow banks can do all of this in ways that are less than completely transparent.
Banks – often systemically important ones – typically generate large
profits by sponsoring shadow banking activities to which they have significant

BIS 81st Annual Report

15

direct and indirect exposures, including backup lines of credit and various sorts
of credit enhancements. It is exactly that linking of the banking system to the
shadow banks, including explicit or implicit guarantees to the holders of
shadow bank liabilities, that gives rise to some of the most pernicious financial
stability risks. By comparison, mutual funds and hedge funds, although huge
in terms of the money involved, pose less of a systemic risk because they are
generally less leveraged and have fewer and looser ties to banks.
As we complete the preparation of the new global standards, it is essential
that national authorities translate them into legislation and regulations in a
timely and globally consistent manner. Financial stability will be jeopardised
by any attempt to delay or weaken the agreements.
Finally, even after their implementation, the new rules, as such, will not
be sufficient: rigorous enforcement by supervisors within and across national
boundaries will play a key role in making sure that financial institutions comply
with them.
Measuring and monitoring the threats
The crisis exposed serious shortcomings in our ability to measure financial
stability vulnerabilities. As discussed in Chapter VI, regulators and supervisors
need better data to improve their measurement and monitoring of systemic
risk. Getting those data poses significant analytical challenges.
Currently available data have serious gaps at both the firm and marketwide level. Firm-level data available to authorities are neither detailed nor
consistent enough. Market-wide data are available, but they are not well suited
to risk management: they reveal systemic stress only after a shock occurs.
We must fill the data gaps as soon as possible. Resource constraints,
combined with confidentiality concerns and legal obstacles, require that we
set priorities: what can realistically be done, and what should have the highest
priority? As expressed in Chapter VI, the highest priority should be given to
improvements in two areas: firm-level data and standardised sets of data on
aggregate quantities. The first of these demands a new international framework
that gives supervisory authorities a complete view of the balance sheet
positions of the largest financial institutions and the linkages between them.
Without that framework, supervisors will lack the ability to jointly analyse the
positions across banks and to detect vulnerabilities at the system level.
Moreover, the data must be disseminated internationally to allow an adequate
analysis of global systemic risks.
The second area of priority is updating standardised sets of aggregate
financial statistics – such as for flow of funds, the balance of payments and
trading platforms – to reflect the significant changes in the financial landscape
over the past few decades. Updated aggregates would enhance our ability to
monitor systemic vulnerabilities of both the bank and non-bank sectors. By
exposing sector-level problems, better aggregates would provide a lead for
uncovering stress in the firm-level data.
Lastly, the financial system will continue to evolve, not least because
of business requirements, innovation and efforts by financial institutions
to circumvent costly regulations. Given this fact of life, transaction-level

16

BIS 81st Annual Report

information from data warehouses and trading platforms can assist regulators
and supervisors in identifying markets or activities whose evolution needs
more of their attention.

Summing up
Over the past year, the global economy has been moving towards healthy,
stable, self-sustaining growth, albeit in fits and starts. Despite that good news,
significant work remains to be done.
Even before the financial crisis created the need for massive stimulus,
government budgets in many advanced economies were on an unsustainable
path. Fiscal authorities need to act quickly and decisively before disaster
strikes again. This means addressing the structural imbalances that are among
the myriad causes of the crisis as well as a dangerous part of its legacy. In the
countries that were at the centre of the crisis, those imbalances include the
lingering indebtedness in the private sector – households as well as financial
and non-financial firms – which must be cut to levels well below those seen
in the middle of the last decade. Structural adjustment for those countries also
means eschewing the model of leverage-led growth, a prerequisite for a
rebalancing of the global economy.
Large and persistent current account imbalances continue to plague the
global economy, while the immense gross financial flows coursing through
the system are intensifying risks to financial stability. International cooperation
and coordination is particularly needed here if we are to avoid a painfully
disorderly adjustment. Nonetheless, even without coordination, deficit countries
can and should encourage more saving, and surplus countries more
consumption; it is vital that each country first puts its own house in order.
Central bankers have their work cut out for them as well. They confront
distortions exacerbated by years of extraordinarily accommodative monetary
conditions. Prime among the challenges is the increasing risk to price stability.
Output gaps are closing, commodity prices have been surging, and inflation
is rising around the globe. The dangers are most acute in emerging market
economies, but they also extend to the core advanced economies.
On the regulatory front, where authorities have agreed to a number of
important reforms, challenges remain. Systemically important financial
institutions must be made more resilient. Resolution regimes must be built to
manage the failure of even the largest financial firms. And the regulatory
framework of the future must be such that any institution that does the work
of a bank will be treated like a bank regardless of its legal form of organisation.
Finally, the crisis exposed large gaps in the data available for measuring
financial vulnerabilities and systemic risk. In the short term, the key to
addressing the problem is identifying the important gaps that can be most
expeditiously filled, and then filling them.

II. Building new foundations for sustainable growth

The imbalances that accompanied the boom in a number of advanced
economies are still with us today. In some of those countries, the financial and
construction sectors grew out of proportion to the rest of the economy and may
have to shrink. The debt taken on by households and firms during the housing
boom has heightened their vulnerability to future shocks and may weigh on
growth. Many governments cut their debt during the boom years, in some cases
considerably. Yet, with hindsight, much of the improvement in public finances
was directly or indirectly related to the housing boom and thus transient.
Almost three years after the failure of Lehman Brothers led many
advanced economies to their sharpest contraction since the Great Depression,
output remains at or below its pre-crisis levels in most instances (Graph II.1,
left-hand and centre panels). The persistence of the imbalances that led to the
crisis is one reason why the recovery in those cases has so far been tepid.
Growth in the emerging economies has generally been much faster
(Graph II.1, right-hand panel), but some of these economies risk building up their
own imbalances. For example, property prices in some cases are advancing at
rates reminiscent of those in some of the advanced economies during the precrisis housing boom, and private sector debt levels are soaring. To be sure,
these indicators are increasing from a low level, but that was also the case for
some advanced economies, including Ireland and Spain, in the early 2000s.
The first section of this chapter gives a brief account of growth and
its associated imbalances during the years of the housing boom. In the
subsequent three sections, we discuss in turn sectoral imbalances, private
sector indebtedness and fiscal challenges. In the final section, we draw some
lessons for economic policy.

Imbalances, financial crises and growth
Output costs of the
crisis are unlikely
to be recovered …

… as suggested by
previous crises

The boom in house
prices …

The global financial crisis had enormous costs in many regards, not least in
terms of lost output. The major advanced economies may be returning to
pre‑crisis levels of output, but – with the possible exception of Australia –
production is still well below what it would have been had these economies
continued on their pre-crisis growth path. Recovering those losses would thus
require a substantial period of above-trend expansion, but unfortunately that
seems unlikely for several reasons. First, the economic losses produced by
the Great Recession, such as the destruction of human capital due to longterm unemployment, may weigh on growth for years to come.1 Second,
growth in the years before the crisis was boosted by a series of unsustainable
imbalances whose correction may reduce growth until the excesses have been
reabsorbed.
The existence of these imbalances also implies that an extrapolation of
pre-crisis growth is neither the correct matrix by which to assess the state of
the recovery nor a useful guide for policy. Some of the (physical and human)
capital put in place during the boom years is less useful than originally thought.
A sizeable part of investment in the construction and financial sectors probably
falls into this category. The unsustainability of pre-crisis growth also has to be
reflected in measures of potential output, which are important inputs in policy
discussions. In order to be useful, such measures, above all those that rely on
estimates of the stocks of physical and human capital, have to be adjusted to
take into account this obsolescence.2
The historical record supports the notion that systemic banking crises can
have long-lasting, possibly permanent output costs relative to trend. A recent
survey of the literature on the costs of financial crises found that post-crisis
growth is usually not sufficient to regain the former trend in output.3 In other
words, the output lost during the crisis will probably never be recovered.
The problems plaguing the advanced economies today have their roots
in the pre-crisis boom. House prices went up in many countries in the years
before the crisis (Graph II.2), and the countries where prices rose most strongly
were, in many cases, those that later suffered the most. Examples are Ireland,
Spain and the United Kingdom. Yet there were exceptions. In France, house
prices increased by almost as much as those in Spain, yet France was spared
many of the financial sector problems that assailed other countries. And it was
Germany and Japan, where house prices posted no aggregate increases at all,
which experienced some of the sharpest (albeit short-lived) contractions in
output among the advanced economies.4

Graph II.2

Sharp increases in credit extension to households and corporations
fuelled the appreciation in property.5 The ratio of household debt to GDP
(Graph II.3) rose in all countries that experienced a housing boom, far
exceeding their long-term trends. Non-financial corporations also added to
their debt, with those in the United States being a notable exception. As
shown by the left-hand scale of the graph, Irish and Spanish non-financial
corporations saw particularly large increases in their debt ratios, with the
lion’s share of the debt being used to finance real estate. That said, the
increase in indebtedness looked much smaller when set against the market
value of the real estate portfolios being financed. In the case of Spain, real
estate firms increased their ratio of debt to total assets from 50% in 2000 to
63% in 2007.
The housing and credit booms changed the sectoral composition of output.
The relative weight of the construction sector rose in all economies where
house prices increased. In 2007, construction employed 13% of all workers in
Spain, up from 10% a decade earlier (Graph II.4, left-hand panel). In Ireland,
the corresponding increase was even sharper, from 8½% to 13%. A similar
picture emerges if one measures the share of construction in total value
added.6 Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States also saw growth in
the share of construction in employment and GDP, but to a much lesser extent
than in Ireland and Spain.
Strong expansion of real estate finance as property prices went up was
one factor behind the rapid growth of the financial sector during the pre-crisis

period. By almost any measure, the sharpest growth in the financial sector took
place in Ireland, where the assets of financial institutions increased from
10 times GDP in 2002, an already high level, to more than 20 times GDP on
the eve of the crisis (Graph II.4, right-hand panel). The weight of financial
intermediation in total value added in Ireland rose from around 6% in 1997 to
more than 10% in 2007 (centre panel). Admittedly, foreign-owned financial
institutions – located in Dublin but with little connection to the remainder of the
Irish economy – accounted for part of this increase, but the balance sheets of
domestic banks also soared. Spain, which unlike Ireland is not an offshore
financial centre, also saw a rapid expansion of domestic banks’ balance sheets.
There, the ratio of bank assets to GDP increased from a stable 2.6 between
2000 and 2003 to more than 4 just before the financial crisis.
The burst of growth originating in the credit and housing booms and the
associated expansion of the construction and financial sectors was ultimately
not sustainable. This was first revealed when US house prices stopped going
up in 2006, and then began to fall. Borrowers whose creditworthiness relied
exclusively on future house price appreciation were the first ones to default.
As house prices continued to fall, losses started to spread from the subprime
to the prime mortgage sector. In other countries house prices peaked somewhat
later than in the United States, and so write-offs on home mortgages also
increased later, and they generally remained below the US level. However,

some countries, such as Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom, saw a surge
in non-performing loans to the non-financial corporate sector, in particular
property developers.
The financial crisis and the Great Recession that followed led to a sharp
reversal in the sectoral trends. The construction sector shrank even more
rapidly than it had grown before the crisis, probably in response to the large
stock of unsold houses. The rate of contraction of the housing sector in Spain
and Ireland from 2007 to 2009 was much faster than that during the bust phase
of construction cycles in other countries. In Germany, the share of construction
in total employment fell from 8.5% at the peak of the unification boom in 1995
to 5.5% in 2006, a change of 3 percentage points in about 10 years. In Spain
and Ireland, the share fell by 4 and 6 percentage points, respectively, in just
three years.7
Only the financial sector showed no sign of shrinking. Its share in value
added receded somewhat in Ireland but increased in Spain and the United
States. The ratio of financial sector assets to GDP continued to go up almost
everywhere, in part due to unprecedented public support.
Fiscal balances deteriorated significantly during the crisis and have not
improved substantially since. Massive outlays by governments to save the
financial system were only one reason for the sharp rise in deficits. Together
with declining tax revenues and increased overall spending in the wake of the
recession, they resulted in unprecedented peacetime deficits. Another reason
for the weak state of public finances was the overestimation of potential, or
sustainable, output in the boom years. The credit-financed housing boom
boosted fiscal revenues, but these revenues disappeared during the crisis.

Some countries used the increase in revenues to reduce their public debt/GDP

Sectoral imbalances
Growth in the years before the financial crisis was heavily weighted towards
the increasingly bloated construction and financial sectors, and the effect
of their prolonged rapid expansion was probably to reduce growth in the rest
of the economy. Of course, because the financial sector allocates capital
throughout the economy, its expansion can actually stimulate overall growth.
But as with the growth of any sector, expansion of the construction and
financial industries after a point would remove resources from the rest of the
economy. The expansion of the capital-intensive construction sector would
make it more difficult for other sectors to attract capital. And a massively
expanding financial industry would probably make it more difficult for other
knowledge-intensive industries to attract highly skilled labour.8
The cross-country evidence indicates that, indeed, the boom in construction
and financial intermediation coincided with lower productivity growth in the
rest of the economy (Graph II.5). The most notable example is the construction
sector in Spain, where the employment share (horizontal axis of the left-hand
panel) grew on average by 0.3 percentage points each year from 2000 to 2007,
while productivity in the rest of the Spanish economy (the vertical axis) saw
virtually no gain. The effect also appears for finance (Graph II.5, right-hand

panel), although to a lesser degree.9 However, a more rigorous econometric
analysis suggests that the effect in the case of financial intermediation may
have been even stronger than for construction (see box).
Other sectors will have to take over from construction and financial
intermediation as the engines of growth. Which sectors will do so is difficult
to say, since past performance is not necessarily a good guide to the future.
Nonetheless, the likely (relative or absolute) stagnation of construction and
finance could liberate resources for use in other sectors – so long as authorities
do not prevent such a reallocation through subsidies or other measures that
preserve the status quo.

Private sector debt reduction
Many of the loans made during the housing boom, particularly its final stages,
were extended on the implicit or explicit assumption that house prices would
continue to go up. This premise turned out to be false. It is therefore natural
that both lenders and borrowers would react and adjust their target rates of
debt to the new reality.
Households in Ireland, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States
have begun to reduce their debt-to-income ratios (Graph II.6), although to
varying degrees. In the United States and the United Kingdom, where the
process has gone furthest, household debt has fallen by approximately
15 percentage points to 120% and 150% of disposable income, respectively. In
the aggregate, Spanish households reduced their debt-to-income ratio by
8 percentage points between 2008 and early 2010, but the ratio has since
rebounded. The debt ratio of Irish households has fallen by 7 percentage
points from its peak.
The historical record suggests that households will further reduce their
debt. Almost all systemic banking crises that were preceded by an expansion in
the ratio of credit to GDP were followed by marked decreases in that ratio.10 The
extent of debt reduction varied across episodes but was generally substantial.
On average, private credit-to-GDP fell by 38 percentage points over a period
of about five years. The magnitude of the debt reduction was only slightly
smaller than that of the increase before the crisis (which was 44 percentage
points on average).
The debt-to-income ratios of households and other sectors can be reduced
in essentially four ways: (i) repayment; (ii) default, write-offs or debt forgiveness;
(iii) higher real disposable incomes; and (iv) inflation, by reducing the real
value of debt.11 The available data allow us to break down the decline in the

The fact that the negative relationship is less clear-cut in the case of financial intermediation may
have to do with the previously mentioned positive effects that expansion of the financial sector can deliver.

Paraguay, 1995; and Korea, 1997), these crises were followed by a substantial period of debt reduction.

The effect of sectoral imbalances on growth: the case of manufacturing
The economics literature has generally found that a larger financial sector is associated with higher GDP
growth. Indeed, sectors that face financing difficulties should benefit more from a larger financial sector.
The recent experience, however, suggests a more nuanced view. Rapid increases in credit and asset
prices may inflate the profitability of the financial sector to the point that it diverts resources away from
other sectors. A conjecture is that the sectors most likely to be disadvantaged are those that, like financial
services, depend heavily on highly skilled labour. To test this conjecture, we use the propensity to
undertake research and development (R&D) as a proxy for the demand for highly skilled labour. Focusing
on manufacturing industries, we identify those that have a higher R&D intensity than others. We then
estimate whether a fast-growing financial sector – and, separately, whether a fast-growing construction
sector – would have a disproportionate effect on the growth of the higher-intensity, versus the lowerintensity, manufacturing industries. The negative coefficients reported in Table II.A for value added
growth and employment growth in the financial intermediation and construction sectors (first and third
lines and fifth and seventh lines of data) suggest that they would have such an effect and that it would
be stronger in the case of finance than in the case of construction.

ratio of debt to disposable income into three of these components (Graph II.6):
repayment/default (without distinguishing between the two;12 shown by
“Nominal debt” in the graph), real income growth (“Real disposable income”)
and inflation (“Prices”).13 The relative weight of these drivers varies across
countries. Households in all four countries shown in Graph II.6 have cut their
nominal debt levels, with Ireland leading, followed by the United States. Real
disposable income proved more resilient during the crisis and continued to
grow even as GDP fell, thus lowering debt ratios. In Ireland and, to a lesser
extent, the United States, the damping effect of repayments/defaults and of
growth in real disposable income was at least partly offset by a drop in consumer
prices immediately after the crisis, which pushed up the real value of debt.
The drivers of debt reduction have changed with time. The crisis in Ireland
and Spain turned out to be more structural than it first appeared, and
disposable income in these two countries began to fall in 2010, thus driving
up debt ratios.
To put the debt issue into perspective, it is worth considering what the
impact on growth would be if debt ratios were not cut. High debt levels make
households (and firms) more vulnerable even to small shocks. In a recent
survey, more than one fifth of US households with mortgage debt reported
that their mortgage balance exceeded the value of their house.14 The proportion
was higher among the young and those living in states with particularly large

12 Disentangling the two factors is difficult. Write-offs do not reduce the amount of outstanding debt
one-to-one since the buyers of repossessed homes may take on new debt. See M Brown, A Haughwout,

increases in house prices – precisely the groups that are also more likely to
have lost their jobs in the Great Recession or to have experienced other types
of income shocks. In some European economies, the overwhelming majority
of mortgages are linked to short-term money market rates. These rates are
currently very low, but at some point they will increase and add to households’
debt burden, further heightening their vulnerability if debt ratios remain high.
That said, there is a risk that reducing debts rapidly in order to lessen the
vulnerability of households to shocks will precipitate a collapse in private
consumption. Public policy cannot fully manage this risk. What it can do is
facilitate growth in other sectors of the economy that could take over from
construction and household consumption as the engine of recovery.
There are also ways to reduce debt that are unlikely to be effective.
Surprise inflation is one of them. Admittedly, a burst of surprise inflation will
reduce the real value of debt, thus redistributing wealth from lenders (and,
ultimately, savers) to borrowers. That said, because surprise inflation is
generally associated with lower real incomes if wage contracts are in nominal
terms, it could offset the impact on the real value of debt. Moreover, the
transfer of wealth will not occur if inflation is anticipated. In this case, higher
inflation will tend to drive up nominal interest rates and thus increase
borrowers’ debt servicing costs. This, in turn, acts like a forced acceleration of
repayment. Regardless of whether inflation is anticipated, it imposes the
substantial long-term cost of reduced central bank credibility.15

Public debt and fiscal consolidation
Public debt has

crisis …

… as automatic

deficits

The reduction in
government debt
before the crisis
was not
sustainable …

Public debt surged after the default of Lehman Brothers in September 2008
(Table II.1), particularly in the countries that had experienced housing booms.
The deterioration in governments’ fiscal position was due to a combination of
lower tax revenues and higher spending.
There are obvious reasons why deficits increase during recessions.
Automatic stabilisers support spending and were one reason why the Great
Recession did not turn into another Great Depression. The problem is that
the deficits have shown no signs of declining two years into the recovery
and that debt levels continue to soar. Today’s fiscal deficits are largely
structural (Graph II.7), suggesting that governments need to do more to restore
fiscal positions. Moreover, the cyclical component of fiscal deficits may be
overestimated if, as argued above, measures of potential output are upwardly
biased.
This picture of high structural deficits and rapidly increasing debt levels
contrasts with surpluses and declining deficits before the crisis. Several
countries did use the good years to reduce their public debt. Government
debt in Canada, Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom fell markedly between
2000 and 2007, and it remained broadly stable in France and the United

15 In any case, inflation in the advanced economies in the short term is most likely to be of the costpush variety because of rising commodity prices. Cost-push inflation directly reduces the capacity of
households and firms to spend and thus makes debts even more burdensome.

Table II.1

States. However, this favourable trend concealed vulnerabilities, in particular
the reliance of apparently sound fiscal positions on a small number of dynamic
sectors such as construction and finance. For example, Suárez (2010) estimates
that, in the case of Spain, the “construction and real estate sectors might have
inflated fiscal revenues by 2.9 percent of GDP at the peak of the boom”.16
The view that fiscal accounts can be highly dependent on some particular
sectoral developments is borne out by a more systematic investigation. Indeed,
government revenues and government total balance do improve considerably
when the construction sector expands, after controlling for the usual
determinants of fiscal positions (Graph II.8, left-hand panel). For instance, an
increase in the construction sector share in value added by 1 percentage point
is estimated to improve the cyclically adjusted fiscal balance by 0.3 percentage
points of potential GDP. In contrast, changes in the relative size of the financial
intermediation sector do not have significant effects on net fiscal positions. The
specific effect of construction booms is therefore to boost the revenue side of
fiscal accounts. To be sure, this jolt to revenues is likely to come from various
sources. Revenues may be driven up by the one-off component associated
with construction booms, but the overestimation of potential output can also
contribute to improving the cyclically adjusted fiscal position.
With these calculations in hand, it is possible to compute what fiscal
positions would have looked like had the construction boom not happened
(Graph II.8, right-hand panel). In the case of Ireland, for instance, the fiscal
surplus in 2007 was almost entirely due to the bloated construction sector;

without the construction boom, its fiscal position would have been close to
balance. In Spain, approximately one third of the surplus in 2007 was due to
construction, a result somewhat lower than Suárez’s bottom-up estimates but
nonetheless substantial.17
The revenue intensity of construction means that the gap between
revenues and expenditures opened by the crisis is unlikely to disappear even
as the economy recovers. This, in turn, implies that governments cannot
avoid strong measures to adjust their fiscal positions in the short run, in
addition to a credible plan over the medium term. Different circumstances call
for different approaches to how consolidation should be carried out while
minimising its short-term costs in terms of growth. Yet fiscal policy can
strongly influence reallocations across industries through measures such as
cuts in subsidies to declining industries and support for retraining of workers,
which should help to both raise growth and reduce unemployment. For the
longer term, this assessment illustrates the need to go beyond balancing
budgets over the cycle. Besides some well known challenges ahead – like
ageing – the above analysis suggests that the true state of public accounts
may reveal itself only during downturns, when sectoral imbalances tend to
eliminate what in fact were only temporarily engorged revenues.
Last but not least, the state of public accounts has fundamental implications
for financial stability, which calls for further caution. Valuation losses on
government bonds, for instance, directly affect the creditworthiness of the
institutions holding them and reduce the amount of collateral they can borrow
against. This mechanism appears to be at work in Greece, where banks have
found it increasingly difficult to raise funding as investors focus on the risk of
a restructuring of the country’s public debt. But most obviously, large-scale
government support for banks in trouble represents a severe drain on the
treasury (Ireland is a case in point) which cannot be absorbed in the absence
of a strong fiscal position.

17

We estimate the effect on revenues to be around 2.2% of GDP, compared with 2.9% in Suárez, op cit.

Conclusions
The key message of this chapter is that growth during the boom years before
the crisis was unsustainable and that the imbalances built up during those
years threaten to hold back growth in the advanced economies for some time
to come.
Real estate and finance are unlikely to drive growth in the future as much
as they did prior to 2007. Many countries are faced with large amounts of unsold
properties, and it will take years to absorb this overhang. Similarly, the growth
in the financial sector in the years up to 2006–07 was at least partly a response
to inadequate regulation and is thus unlikely to be repeated in the coming
years (see Chapter V). Therefore the sectoral composition of the economy
needs to change if we want to take advantage of new opportunities for growth.
Propping up declining sectors risks crowding out more dynamic sectors.
Policy should also put the banking system in order so that future growth
sectors have access to healthy credit. This means that banks need to have
sufficient capital to be able to take losses and write off doubtful assets. The
example of Japan in the mid-1990s shows that unrecognised losses lead to a
misallocation of resources, create uncertainty and thus hinder economic
growth. When banks are not forced to write down loans (and shrink their
books), they are actually provided with incentives to “evergreen”, ie to roll
over non-performing loans to firms that should have been bankrupt.18 In
Japan, evergreening contributed to stagnation by preventing restructuring

credit in Japan”, American Economic Review, vol 95, no 4, September 2005, pp 1144–66.

and thus curtailing profit opportunities for healthy firms.19 It was only after a
rigorous examination of banks’ non-performing loan portfolios in 1998 and a
second round of capital infusions that banks in Japan began to lend again.
Getting the economy back on a growth path through the policy measures
described above will greatly help the necessary process of public and private
debt reduction. But while growth is an essential element of the debt reduction
process, it cannot be the only one. Households are already dedicating a
significant fraction of their income to repaying debt.
Government debt, by contrast, continues to go up. Running large budget
deficits was appropriate during the crisis and its immediate aftermath, when
expansionary fiscal policy helped prevent the worst outcomes. With recovery
under way, however, running large deficits is becoming more and more
dangerous. Market sentiment can quickly change, forcing governments to take
even more drastic measures than those that would have been necessary at an
earlier stage.
Fiscal consolidation will not happen overnight, but it has to start now. The
measures taken will vary across countries but, if they are to be credible, they
will have to address the fundamental weaknesses of the fiscal framework.

sources of revenues, to name but three factors. Many of the required structural
changes will take time to generate lower deficits, and so it is important to
start implementing them now. A legislated schedule for their implementation
would make such reforms more credible and would reduce uncertainty about
possible consolidation measures. That said, promises lose credibility if their
implementation cannot be monitored.
But fiscal challenges go beyond the immediate need to reduce deficits and
bring down debt levels. More structural changes to the tax system are needed
to avoid a rerun of the credit booms that ultimately led to the crisis. The tax
system is still biased towards debt accumulation, for example through the tax
deductibility of some interest payments. More generally, with government taxes
and expenditures accounting for an increasing fraction of total output in the
future, the distortions implied by fiscal policy will become ever more important,
and even revenue-neutral reforms that reduce these distortions could be
beneficial.
The crisis has revealed important weaknesses in fiscal frameworks, which
need to be addressed. In particular, budgeting before the crisis did not take
into account the sensitivity of public finances to asset price and credit booms.
If we do not want to repeat this mistake, we need better measures of cyclically
adjusted deficits that not only filter out the impact of the normal business
cycle but also that of asset price and credit booms. In addition, we need fiscal
rules that ensure that temporary increases in revenues are treated as such and
do not lead to excessive optimism in assessing fiscal accounts.
In addition, the close relationship between fiscal and financial stability
during the crisis highlights the importance of fiscal room for manoeuvre to deal
with future crises, even those not caused by the financial sector. Governments
faced with natural disasters, for example, will be able to respond more quickly
and thoroughly if they can mobilise large amounts of resources without
approaching their borrowing limits.
At this writing, many emerging market economies are experiencing rapid
growth, booming housing markets and rising indebtedness in the private sector.
For instance, Brazil, China and India all saw credit grow by an annual average
of more than 20% between 2006 and 2010, equal to or greater than the rates
of growth recorded in Ireland and Spain (Table II.2). The emerging market
economies escaped the worst of the last crisis. If they can heed what perhaps
was its most important lesson – that prevention is better than cure – they may
be able to avoid suffering their own version of it.

III. The risks of international imbalances: beyond
current accounts

Globalisation provides large, measurable economic benefits. It expands trade
flows and allows consumers to enjoy a range of goods and services vastly
larger than that produced by their domestic economy. And the international
financial flows associated with globalisation free firms’ investment decisions
from domestic financing constraints while allowing investors to reduce risks
and optimise returns by globally diversifying their assets. International
financial flows thus enhance the efficiency with which capital and know-how
are allocated.
Yet, by widening the scope for economic activity, globalisation also widens
the potential exposure to instability. The same international links that increased
welfare and efficiency in recent decades served as a powerful propagation
channel for financial and economic shocks during the 2007–09 crisis. In the
early stages, rapidly falling asset prices wreaked havoc on the balance sheets
of international investors; in the later stages, a collapse in world trade punished
many export-oriented economies.
Before the financial crisis, the main risk to the global economy was
thought to be the presence of large current account surpluses and deficits.
Thereafter, at the height of the crisis, threats to the solvency of major financial
institutions were the focus of attention. Now, with the waning of the crisis, the
discussion is returning to the risks posed by current accounts; and indeed,
though they declined during the crisis, global current account imbalances
remain large.
Certainly, one risk of persistent current account imbalances is that they
will drive policymakers towards protectionism. Furthermore, net financial flows,
which necessarily run from economies with a current account surplus to those
with a deficit, create risks. An economy with large net financial inflows may
suffer a sharp and disorderly depreciation of its currency should those flows
suddenly reverse. Also, the financial sector may be unable to efficiently absorb
these inflows, which could lead to financial instability.
Current account imbalances are declining, but only slowly. Structural
adjustment in terms of saving and investment is ongoing in major surplus and
deficit countries, which will reduce imbalances in the long run. Real exchange
rate adjustment is also helping to reduce current account imbalances. In the
near term, accelerating the real exchange rate adjustment would require more
flexibility in terms of domestic prices or nominal exchange rates or both.
Because policymakers need to maintain price stability, the burden of adjustment
in the real exchange rate should rest on the nominal exchange rate.
International coordination could help distribute the burden of adjustment
across major surplus and deficit countries and break the current policy gridlock.
For example, given that the costs of increased exchange rate flexibility would
fall on China, the United States could share the burden by pursuing tighter
fiscal and monetary policies. Furthermore, among surplus emerging economies,

33

the country that allows its currency to appreciate first loses competitiveness
relative to its peers. Coordination would reduce this first-mover disadvantage.
The dangers posed by imbalances in current accounts and in net capital
flows are important, but the financial crisis also highlighted the need to look
beyond them. If we are to fully appreciate the growing risks of financial
imbalances, we must also look to gross financial flows. Gross financial inflows
and outflows are substantially larger than the net flows associated with the
current account and are often large even where current account balances are
negligible. It is these gross flows, not the net, that must be accommodated by
the receiving financial sector; and a sudden stop of gross flows risks economic
crisis in the receiving economy.
Gross flows also pose a threat to the extent that they contribute to
vulnerabilities in the interconnected balance sheets of financial institutions,
firms and households around the world. They can result in currency, liquidity
and credit risk mismatches because the attributes of assets acquired through
outflows are unlikely to exactly match those of the liabilities acquired through
inflows – both at the level of individual market participants and in the aggregate.
Furthermore, even if balance sheet positions are perfectly matched, they still
give rise to counterparty risks. During the financial crisis, a sudden deterioration
in balance sheets caused a large decline in economic activity, demonstrating
that even seemingly small differences between the attributes of assets and
liabilities – along with counterparty risks – can form a powerful propagation
channel for shocks.
The first line of defence in managing the risks associated with gross
financial flows and financial imbalances is the use of macroeconomic policies
that maintain monetary stability and fiscal sustainability. Monetary policy can
also be used to “lean against the wind” and resist outsize increases in credit
and asset prices. Policies that strengthen prudential frameworks and the
financial infrastructure form a useful second line of defence that can limit
financial imbalances and minimise the fallout in the event of a crisis. As a last
resort, and in extraordinary circumstances, capital controls might be used as
a stopgap measure to temporarily address some risks of large gross financial
inflows. Furthermore, steps being taken to fill current data gaps will allow a
better assessment of vulnerabilities that may develop in international balance
sheets.
Finally, current account and financial imbalances are linked. The financial
crisis showed that effectively managing the risks posed by both types of
imbalance is crucial for sustainable global growth and financial stability.
Further, some of the risks arising from current account imbalances are similar
to those arising from gross flows. As noted, a sudden reversal of either can
trigger domestic economic and financial crises. And some policy measures that
would ameliorate one form of imbalance would also address the other. For
instance, increased nominal exchange rate flexibility would not only accelerate
adjustment in current account imbalances, but would also contribute to financial
stability in surplus emerging economies by relieving inflationary pressures.
We first discuss today’s large current account imbalances and the potential
for using policy coordination to reduce the risks they pose. We then analyse

34

BIS 81st Annual Report

the risks associated with large gross financial flows and the most effective
policy responses. We conclude by showing how current account and financial
imbalances are related.

Current account balances: risks and responses
Current account balances remain substantial (Graph III.1). The United States,
Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom run large, persistent deficits while China,
Japan and Germany run large, persistent surpluses. Summed together as
positive quantities, current account surpluses and deficits remained around
2% of global GDP during the 1980s and early 1990s and then rose steadily in
the lead-up to the financial crisis, to around 6%. Although it has since decreased
to 4%, the aggregate sum remains high by historical standards.
Current account balances are concentrated. Most of the growth in the
balances since 1994 has occurred in the United States and East Asia (Graph III.2,
left-hand panel) and in the euro area (centre panel). Comparing the 1980–94
period with 2000–10, the average regional balance as a share of regional GDP
rose about 2.6 percentage points for the United States and East Asia and
1.7 percentage points in the euro area, but only about 1.1 percentage points
in the rest of the world. This concentration explains why policy discussion
often focuses on a few countries with the largest balances, including China
and the United States.
Because much of the reduction in current account balances during the
crisis was a cyclical phenomenon, rather than structural, future increases are
likely. For example, many advanced economies with current account deficits,
including the United States, experienced sharp contractions in private domestic
demand; as these economies recover and private consumption and investment
grow again, domestic demand is likely to increase. Without substantial fiscal
consolidation, the increased demand is likely to further widen current account

deficits. Conversely, macroeconomic stimulus spurred economic growth in
emerging economies with current account surpluses, notably China; the phaseout of the stimulus is likely to reduce domestic demand and may boost current
account surpluses.
Risks
Persistently large current account deficits are unsustainable and so must
eventually come to an end. The question, therefore, is not whether, but how,
these imbalances will be corrected. The main risk is that the adjustment will
be disorderly and detrimental to global macroeconomic and financial stability.
Should the financial flows complementing current account deficits
suddenly reverse course, economies with large deficits will suffer disorderly
currency depreciations. Before the financial crisis, the large US current
account deficit was regarded as a major threat to global stability because of
the risk it posed of a disorderly decline in the value of the US dollar. The
current ability of the United States to easily finance its deficit cannot be taken
for granted. Past examples of a number of smaller economies in deficit suggest
that market confidence can evaporate quickly, forcing sudden and costly
adjustment. An abrupt rebalancing of global demand following a precipitous
depreciation of the US dollar would have far-reaching ramifications for the
global economy.
The domestic financial sector might also struggle to efficiently absorb the
financial inflows that are the counterpart to the current account deficit. A
failure to allocate these inflows to productive uses is especially likely if financial
institutions are not well regulated. The resulting capital misallocation – to real
estate lending, for example – might lead to boom-bust cycles and eventually
to financial instability. In fact, some economists attribute the pre-crisis housing
boom in the United States partly to large capital inflows, which are the

counterpart of current account deficits. Continuing global imbalances mean
that similar financial stability risks will also continue.
Last but not least, current account imbalances might prompt deficit
countries to turn to protectionist measures. The risk is especially large if the
policies of the surplus countries are seen as putting deficit countries at a
competitive disadvantage. Escalating protectionism could eventually lead to
trade wars. Policymakers are currently showing some resistance to such an
approach, but the risk of a turn in that direction seems to be growing.

… and
protectionism

The policy impasse
Reducing current account imbalances requires a rebalancing of global demand.
Deficit countries need to shift from domestic to external sources of demand,
and surplus countries need to shift in the opposite direction. Viewing the
required change in terms of quantities, deficit countries require some
combination of increased domestic saving and reduced consumption or
investment; and surplus economies require the opposite. In terms of prices, a
real depreciation of deficit country currencies would increase international
competitiveness and help bring about the desired changes in quantities. Real
appreciation of the currencies of surplus countries would work towards the
same end. Achieving those adjustments in the real exchange rate requires
flexibility of domestic prices and wages or of nominal exchange rates or both.
Although current account imbalances have declined somewhat from the
levels immediately preceding the crisis (see Box III.A), the current rate of
adjustment appears sluggish, and further deliberate adjustment on a significant
scale does not seem likely under current conditions. A major surplus or deficit
country will probably continue to resist price or nominal exchange rate
adjustments if it must take on all the adjustment costs.
In particular, fearing the large costs of monetary instability, deficit
countries resist the deflationary pressures generated by their current account

Box III.A: Some evidence of adjustment
A correction of global imbalances in the current account requires offsetting adjustments in saving and
investment – that is, in quantities – supported by complementary shifts in real exchange rates that adjust
relative prices. Some tentative signs of an adjustment in saving and investment have emerged. In the
United States, private saving has increased since the peak of the financial crisis. In China, the government
plans to increase domestic consumption, and ongoing reforms in the governance structure of major
corporations may reduce their currently high level of saving.
Relative price adjustment, via changes in real exchange rates, is supporting the reduction in current
account imbalances. That is, prices in deficit countries, expressed in the currency of surplus countries,
are tending to rise more slowly than prices in surplus countries. One measure of international
competitiveness is the real effective exchange rate based on unit labour costs. For the US dollar, this rate
fell by around 10% between 2004 and 2009, which should assist in reducing the current account deficit.
While official unit labour cost data are not available for China, recent rapid wage growth suggests that
adjustment is taking place there too. This partly results from a policy of raising minimum wages; but it
may also indicate that China is approaching an end to its supply of surplus labour, which in turn would
imply even faster wage increases in the future.
The available measures of the real effective exchange rate based on consumer price inflation also
point to an ongoing adjustment. The real effective exchange rate of the renminbi has risen by around
15% in the past five years (Graph III.A, left-hand panel). Meanwhile, the US dollar rate, despite strong
gains during the financial crisis, has declined by around 15% over the same period. The real appreciation
of the renminbi in dollar terms has been due to a combination of inflation in China exceeding that in the
United States and nominal dollar appreciation of the renminbi (Graph III.A, right-hand panel). These
measures may understate the degree of adjustment in China. Recent wage increases are likely to pass
through to higher prices for services, which are systematically underweighted in China’s consumer price
index, which is used to calculate the inflation-based real exchange rate.
According to the labour supply argument, increases in the demand for labour in China did not previously increase real wages
there substantially because the demand was met from a surplus supply of agricultural workers. As the surplus supply becomes
depleted, further increases in labour demand will imply real wage gains that are likely to drive faster real appreciation of the
renminbi.

Resistance makes

adjustment more
costly for other
countries

For example, low policy rates and aggressive fiscal stimulus in the United
States substituted for sharply declining private household and business
demand (Graph III.3, left-hand panel). Net household lending, defined as gross
saving less gross investment, increased from about –3.2% of GDP in 2005 to
+3.7% in 2010, while net government lending dropped from about –3.2% to
–10.1% in the same period. For a time there was a clear danger of deflation,
which the stimulus helped to counter.
Likewise, many surplus economies work to limit the speed of nominal
currency appreciation. Rapid appreciation would mark an end to their
successful export-led growth strategy and probably lead to short-run losses in
employment and output. The resistance to rapid appreciation in those
economies is thus consistent with their domestic policy objectives.
The resistance can be seen in the foreign exchange reserves they have
accumulated in the past decade (Table III.1). In China, large current account
surpluses are matched by high rates of reserve accumulation (Graph III.3,
right-hand panel). In fact, since 1994, China’s reserve accumulation of
$2.4 trillion has exceeded its accumulated current account surpluses by around
30%. As a result of reserve accumulation, increases in the nominal exchange
rate are smaller than they would otherwise have been.
The accumulation of foreign exchange reserves complicates monetary
policy. Without additional measures, an increase in reserves would put
downward pressure on interest rates. To maintain monetary stability, and resist
inflationary pressures from foreign exchange intervention, China sterilises the
impact of its large accumulation of reserves. For the same reason, it has
steadily increased required reserve ratios and tightened policy rates.
Overall, the policies in the United States, China and elsewhere to maintain
monetary stability and limit nominal exchange rate movement have slowed
the rate of adjustment in the real exchange rate.
Furthermore, policies in the countries on one side of the current account
divide make unilateral adjustment more difficult for countries on the other side.
For example, the large current account surplus of China increases the incentive
to implement macroeconomic policies that stimulate demand in the United
States. Conversely, macroeconomic stimulus and, more generally, excess
demand in the United States increase the size and cost of the exchange rate
adjustment necessary in China to reduce its surplus. Countries on each side
may wish to adjust, but neither finds unilateral adjustment to be in its interest.
The costs of adjusting are borne disproportionately by the adjusting country
and appear to outweigh the domestic benefits in the form of increased financial
stability and lower inflation (if the adjuster is a surplus emerging economy) or
more sustainable external positions (if the adjuster is a deficit advanced
economy). However, adjustment provides a positive externality to all other
countries as well, because of increased global macroeconomic stability.
Role for policy coordination

current gridlock

Coordination could overcome this gridlock. The large costs of monetary
instability mean that adjustment should principally work through more
flexible nominal exchange rates. In the case of the United States and China,

the costs of that adjustment would probably fall mostly on China. The United
States, however, could share the burden by pursuing tighter fiscal and
monetary policies in order to reduce domestic demand. Tighter macroeconomic
policies in the deficit country could also allay concerns that the value of
foreign exchange reserves accumulated by surplus economies will be inflated
away.
Implementing coordination is likely to depend on the arrival of more
supportive domestic conditions on each side. The principal need in deficit
countries is an economic recovery strong enough to allow for tighter
macroeconomic policies. In surplus countries, enhancing the financial market
infrastructure by developing a foreign exchange derivatives market, for instance,
would reduce the real costs of greater nominal exchange rate flexibility.
Coordination could also address the first-mover problem affecting surplus
economies. In a surplus country that unilaterally opts to allow nominal currency
appreciation, exporters will be at a disadvantage vis-à-vis exporters in surplus

40

BIS 81st Annual Report

Coordination
among surplus
economies would
allow more flexible
exchange rates

countries that do not simultaneously adjust their exchange rates. Coordination
among surplus economies, especially in emerging Asia, may help overcome
this hurdle.
Apart from coordination, structural policies in both surplus and deficit
countries could also advance the global adjustment of current account
imbalances. For example, the existing tax regime in the United States subsidises
debt and penalises saving. Removing these distortions could contribute to
global rebalancing. Conversely, in China, further developing sustainable social
security programmes – including public health care and pension plans – would
reduce the need for household saving and encourage consumption.
Nonetheless, the size of the problem suggests that, without coordinated
action, gridlock and growing imbalances may last for many years. Surplus
economies can resist nominal currency appreciation as long as they are
willing to continue accumulating – and bearing the cost of carrying – foreign
exchange reserves. Thus, in general, deficit countries are the ones that are
eventually forced to adjust. The longer the gridlock lasts, the larger the
eventual adjustment will need to be and the greater the risk of a disorderly
adjustment.1

Gross financial flows and financial imbalances

Gross inflows and
outflows are large
and not necessarily
related to net
flows …

The financial crisis has demonstrated that the international risks posed by
gross financial flows are as important as those of current account balances.
Financial flows result in the accumulation of large positions on interconnected
balance sheets of financial institutions, firms and households around the world.
Differences between the attributes of these inflows and outflows accumulate in
the form of mismatches between assets and liabilities on these balance sheets.
The mismatches, for instance in currency or maturity, can potentially lead to
financial imbalances. Understanding and managing the risks associated with
these mismatches is important for sustainable global economic growth and
for financial stability.
The difference between a country’s gross inflows and outflows is equal to
its current account balance: gross inflows exceed outflows for countries with a
current account deficit, and gross outflows exceed inflows for countries with a
surplus.2 Taken separately, however, the magnitudes of gross inflows and
outflows may bear little relationship to the size of the current account. Investors
diversify their investment portfolio internationally on the basis of expected
returns and risks rather than on the underlying saving and investment balances
of national economies. Transactions by pension funds building internationally

1
For the United States, the pressure to adjust is somewhat weaker than for other deficit countries.
Because the dollar is the world’s main reserve currency, the United States might sustain a small current
account deficit even in the long run because non-residents are likely to wish to hold dollar-denominated
assets. Nevertheless, the current size of the US deficit is clearly beyond such a level, implying that its
eventual adjustment is inevitable.
2
Gross flows are themselves consolidated measures. Gross inflows refer to non-residents’ purchases
minus sales of domestic assets. Similarly, gross outflows measure residents’ net purchases of foreign
assets. In each case, gross flows will be negative if sales exceed purchases.

diversified portfolios involve large outflows from both surplus and deficit
countries. Similarly, large firms that expand production by investing beyond
their domestic boundaries tend to do so without regard to their home country’s
current account.
Brazil, for example, has experienced large gross inflows and outflows
despite small current account balances (Graph III.4, left-hand panel). Current
account surplus countries can have large financial inflows. In China (centre
panel), gross inflows exceeded $1 trillion between 2002 and 2009 in spite of
cumulative current account surpluses of $1.7 trillion. Conversely, financial
outflows from deficit countries can be sizeable, as in the case of the United
States (right-hand panel). Although US current account deficits cumulated to
about $5 trillion over the past eight years, US gross outflows were even
greater, financed by inflows of around $10 trillion.
Furthermore, the balance sheets resulting from gross financial flows are
connected to one another in complex patterns. The BIS banking statistics
allow an exploration of the subset of these bilateral linkages in which at least
one of the parties to the transaction is a BIS reporting bank. In Graph III.5, the
circles, or nodes, depict countries or regions, and the size of each is proportional
to the quantity of cross-border bank assets and liabilities booked by banks
located in that country or region. The thickness of the lines between nodes is
proportional to the size of financial claims or the financial linkages between
them. The nodes and the linkages are shown for dollar-denominated stocks
(left-hand panel) and euro-denominated stocks (right-hand panel).
In some cases, financial linkages are closely related to current accounts,
as is the case of flows between the euro area and emerging Europe. But the
large linkages shown between the United States and the United Kingdom
($2.7 trillion in dollar stocks; Graph III.5, left-hand panel) and between the
United Kingdom and the euro area ($3.6 trillion in euro stocks; right-hand
panel) bear little relation to underlying current account balances.

Risks

Large mismatches

balance sheets also
create risks

Gross financial flows give rise to some risks that are very similar to those
posed by net flows. Large gross inflows can stop – or even reverse – quickly,
leading to a crisis. They might also overwhelm weak or weakly regulated
financial sectors – after all, the financial sector intermediates gross, rather
than net, flows.
Most importantly, the large balance sheet positions that emerge as a
consequence of gross flows can entail risks because the assets (accumulated
outflows) and the liabilities (accumulated inflows) are not interchangeable.
Foreign assets held by some residents, for instance pension funds, cannot
generally be used to repay the cross-border debts owed by some other
residents, such as real estate developers. And the currency, liquidity and credit
risks of assets and liabilities are also likely to vary considerably: the risk
characteristics of the pension fund’s equity portfolio are very different from
those of the real estate developer’s loans.

BIS 81st Annual Report

Of course, the risks associated with gross flows (transactions between
residents and non-residents) cannot be considered in isolation; they must be
seen in the broader context of domestic balance sheets (transactions among
residents). For example, international flows can facilitate rapid domestic credit
growth because they represent an additional source of financing beyond what
can be obtained from residents alone. Indeed, during credit booms, the external
component often increases faster than the domestic one (see Box III.B).
A breakdown of the data on gross flows by major category – reserves,
portfolio investment and foreign direct investment (FDI) – reveals the
distinctions between assets and liabilities described in the above example.
The mismatches on country balance sheets are visibly large even between
these highly aggregated major categories (Graph III.4). In Brazil, for example,
incoming FDI is far larger than outgoing FDI. Its current account is balanced by
the accumulation of reserves plus a smaller amount of other investment. In
China, outflows are mostly reserves, and inflows consist mostly of FDI. For the
United States, outgoing FDI is slightly larger than incoming FDI. Large portfolio
inflows, partly from the reserve accumulation of other countries, finance the
current account deficit and also provide low interest funding for the purchase
of foreign assets yielding higher returns. The mismatches are even larger at
the level of individual economic agents.
Large financial linkages among globally dispersed balance sheets can
transmit shocks quickly to hard-to-predict locations in unexpected ways. For
example, the severe stress experienced during the financial crisis limited the
ability of internationally active banks to supply credit. One result was that
cross-border bank lending to various emerging market economies declined

much more sharply than could be explained by demand factors alone
(Graph III.6). During the same crisis, some continental European banks were
unexpectedly found to have large exposures to the US subprime market that
threatened their liquidity and solvency. The challenges of those exposures
were particularly severe in economies in which balance sheets were also
highly leveraged in terms of domestic assets and liabilities, leaving limited
scope for absorbing losses on international positions.
Addressing financial risks

macroeconomic
policies, including
monetary stability

Second line of
defence: improved
financial
regulation …

… in particular,
the use of
macroprudential
tools

Capital controls
should be used
only in
extraordinary
circumstances

The financial crisis has shown that neglecting financial imbalances can be
extremely costly. Without proper regulation to provide the right incentives,
large balance sheet linkages and mismatches expose the financial sector, and
ultimately the wider economy, to substantial risks.
Sound macroeconomic policies – ensuring monetary stability and
sustainable fiscal policies – are the first and best line of defence against the
risks of financial imbalances (see Chapter IV on the challenges facing
monetary policy). If markets perceive that inflation is becoming unanchored
or that fiscal authorities are failing to adequately protect against the risk
of sovereign default, investors could trigger forced deleveraging. Such
deleveraging could translate mismatched balance sheet positions into a
severe domestic macroeconomic contraction with international spillovers.
Furthermore, monetary policy can play a role beyond the pursuit of price
stability by “leaning against the wind” to moderate outsize increases in credit
and asset prices.
Improved financial sector regulation would complement sound
macroeconomic policies by helping prevent crises or limit the fallout from them
(see Chapter V). Adjusting capital requirements according to the risk posed by
specific balance sheet exposures would strengthen the financial system. Such
adjustments would also play a secondary role in reducing the incentives to
accumulate large unmatched positions in the first place. Current regulatory
reforms under Basel III represent an important step in this regard.
In particular, macroprudential tools have an important role to play in
limiting the build-up of large, mismatched positions on balance sheets. Some
emerging market economies have had a good deal of experience recently with
macroprudential tools. In central and eastern Europe, loan-to-value or debt
servicing ratios were used even before the financial crisis. Some Latin
American emerging economies gained experience with the dynamic
provisioning pioneered in Spain. And some emerging Asian economies have
introduced various macroprudential measures to protect their domestic banking
systems from overheated property markets and to limit credit growth. Such
tools can safeguard bank balance sheets and reduce the harm that a financial
shock can inflict on the wider economy.
Capital controls remain the last line of defence against financial imbalances
in extraordinary circumstances. They could act as a stopgap measure to slow
capital inflows in the short term. Over longer horizons, experience has shown
that capital controls mostly change the composition of gross flows rather than
their size, but the experience to date is insufficient to show whether the

Box III.B: Global liquidity
Low interest rates for key international currencies have raised concerns about credit conditions globally.
This box uses BIS international financial statistics, which track offshore, cross-border credit patterns, to
cast light on international aspects of credit growth. Credit conditions are one element of what has come
to be known as “global liquidity”.
Towards global credit aggregates
Some currencies are used widely outside their issuing jurisdiction. The decisions of the corresponding
monetary authorities have a direct influence on monetary and financial conditions in the rest of the
world. The external use of the US dollar, for example, is sizeable and has been increasing. In mid-2010,
dollar credit to non-US residents (Graph III.B.1, left-hand panel, “Debt securities booked outside the US”
and “International loans”) reached 17% of dollar credit to the non-financial sector worldwide, from 12%
in 2000. Excluding the series “liabilities of US government”, the proportion that is the external component
is even higher, 23% (up from 15% in 2000).
US dollar credit to the rest of the world has tended to grow much faster than credit to US
residents, a gap that widened substantially after the crisis (Graph III.B.1, right-hand panel). Dollar credit
to households and non-financial businesses in the United States grew at roughly 9% year on year
between 2000 and 2007, to reach $23 trillion, or 166% of GDP, on the eve of the crisis. Over the same
period, the growth of dollar credit to borrowers outside the United States was faster, peaking at
30% year on year by mid-2007 to reach $5.8 trillion, or 15% of the GDP of the rest of the world. In
the aftermath of the crisis, credit to private sector US residents declined by $580 billion between
Q3 2008 and Q4 2010. In contrast, after a short-lived dip, credit to non-US borrowers actually rose, by
$749 billion. The expansion has been especially rapid in countries experiencing domestic currency
credit booms, such as China.
The international element in domestic credit booms
During domestic credit booms, the growth of credit to the private sector tends to outpace monetary
growth. Non-bank credit channels tend to be especially active, as the experience with the shadow
banking system in the United States shows. Moreover, international sources of finance – direct cross-

border (“offshore”) lending to non-banks and the cross-border component channelled by resident banks
– become more important. That is, during booms these two international components tend to grow
faster than the credit granted by banks located in the country.
The case of Ireland is but one example of this regularity. Cross-border claims on non-banks in
the country grew at roughly 40% year on year in the three years preceding the crisis (2005–07), a full
10 percentage points higher than the rate of growth of domestic credit (Graph III.B.2, right-hand panel).
Moreover, since domestic bank credit grew faster than domestic (non-bank) deposits, banks in Ireland
drew on cross-border sources of funds to finance credit growth at home (left-hand panel). Combined,
cross-border claims on non-banks and net cross-border borrowing by banks accounted for more than
half of total bank credit to non-banks in the country in 2008.
Compared with the external bank financing component, direct cross-border lending to non-banks
poses particular challenges to the authorities. First, it can circumvent measures put in place to restrain
lending, such as higher reserve requirements, prudential and macroprudential tools (eg tighter loan-tovalue ratios) or quantitative credit limits. Indeed, the operation of the countercyclical capital buffer of
Basel III envisages an explicit coordinating mechanism between home and host supervisors based on
reciprocity agreements in order to prevent circumvention. Second, direct cross-border loans are harder
to track than domestic credit. They are excluded from the monetary statistics, which are the typical
source of information for credit growth; and the sources of the raw data, such as balance of payments
statistics, tend to be comparatively less reliable in this area.

Currently available information about gross flows and balance sheet
positions needs to be improved if it is to allow for more than a rudimentary
risk analysis (see Chapter VI). Consider the asset accumulations in East Asian
economies (Graph III.7). Between 2002 and 2009, these economies together
accumulated $3.5 trillion in current account surpluses (left-hand panel). Over the
same period, they experienced gross financial outflows of more than $7 trillion
while the effect of capital gains and other valuation changes pushed up the
value of asset positions even further, by almost $9 trillion (right-hand panel).
But currently, only around $3 trillion of this $9 trillion can be tracked using
available counterparty data. These and similar data gaps must be filled to
better assess the risks that may arise from interconnected international balance
sheets.

Summing up
Globalisation has greatly improved living standards in both advanced and
emerging economies. The enlarged flow of goods and services across borders
has allowed wider choices for consumers and greater specialisation along the
lines of comparative advantage for producers. Financial globalisation has
contributed to more efficient capital allocation across countries and enabled the
international diversification of investment portfolios. These benefits, however,
have come with risks.
Managing the risks posed by current account imbalances requires
structural adjustment to rebalance demand in the long term. In the near term,
international coordination to increase exchange rate flexibility could accelerate
the ongoing adjustment.

risks

Effectively managing the risks posed by financial imbalances due to gross
financial flows requires sound macroeconomic policies supported by policies
that strengthen prudential frameworks and the financial infrastructure. Capital
controls are best reserved as a stopgap last resort.
A policy that affects one imbalance tends to work in the same direction
on the other. For example, a monetary tightening in deficit countries can
reduce both types of imbalance by simultaneously shrinking excess domestic
demand and reducing incentives for financial sector risk-taking. Conversely,
excessively loose (“too low for too long”) monetary policies can exacerbate
both imbalances. Furthermore, regulatory and macroprudential measures can
limit the size of financial imbalances as well as help the financial system
efficiently absorb the inflows associated with current account imbalances.
Likewise, fiscal tightening in advanced economies with unsustainable current
account deficits will help reduce both their current account deficits and the
financial risks stemming from debt sustainability concerns. Finally, increased
flexibility of the nominal exchange rate not only assists the adjustment of the
real exchange rate that is central to reducing current account imbalances but
also reduces inflationary pressures in surplus emerging economies, which is
fundamental to managing the risks associated with financial imbalances.
Taking steps such as these to appropriately manage the vulnerabilities
created by globalisation is necessary to ensure that it continues to improve
economic welfare and living standards across the globe.

IV. Monetary policy challenges ahead

Central banks face considerable challenges after a prolonged period of
accommodative monetary policies. Global inflation pressures are rising rapidly
as commodity prices soar and as the global recovery runs into capacity
constraints. These increased upside risks to inflation call for higher policy
rates, but in some countries this still needs to be balanced against the
vulnerabilities associated with continuing private and public sector balance
sheet adjustments and lingering financial sector fragility.
This monetary policy environment has been further complicated by the
unprecedented expansion of central bank balance sheets, especially in recent
years. This chapter starts by reviewing the current size and complexity of
central bank balance sheets and their implications. It then assesses the threat
to price stability and other factors influencing the need to normalise the global
stance of monetary policy.

Challenges from the expansion of central bank balance sheets
Over the past decade, many central bank balance sheets have grown to an
unprecedented size (Graph IV.1). For example, in responding to the international
financial crisis, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England sharply increased
their total assets, in each case from 8% to just below 20% of GDP, while the
Eurosystem expanded its assets from 13% to more than 20% of euro area GDP.
Most of the growth of the balance sheet of the Bank of Japan, to 30% of GDP,
occurred as a consequence of quantitative easing in the early 2000s. The Bank

of Japan’s balance sheet expanded further this March as the central bank
injected additional liquidity to combat the adverse economic and financial
consequences of the earthquake.
Central banks in advanced economies, in particular the Federal Reserve
and the Bank of England, eased monetary conditions aggressively during the
crisis. They first lowered interest rates and then massively expanded their
balance sheets via unconventional monetary policies (Graph IV.2, top panels).
The latter included large purchases of both private sector and government
securities, new targeted lending facilities and credit extensions associated
with the rescue of financial institutions. Many central banks also widened the
range of eligible counterparties for their monetary policy operations and
lengthened their maturity. Central banks in advanced economies that were
less directly hit by the crisis, such as Australia and Canada, also expanded
their balance sheets, albeit by much less, as the crisis spilled over to their
countries’ financial systems.

BIS 81st Annual Report

Central bank balance sheets in emerging market economies grew more
gradually over the past decade. Following the Asian crisis in the late 1990s,
the growth mainly reflected a steady accumulation of foreign exchange reserve
assets, both to build up a war chest against contingencies and as the by-product
of policies to resist exchange rate appreciation (Graph IV.2, bottom panels).
Foreign currency reserves help to smooth exchange rate volatility, especially
in economies whose financial markets cannot accommodate effective hedging
of foreign exchange exposures. Foreign currency reserves can also support
favourable credit ratings for sovereign bonds and growth in local currency
debt markets, thereby lowering borrowing costs and deepening financial
markets.

markets, it reflected

Implications of expanded central bank balance sheets
Central bank balance sheet policies have supported the global economy through
a very difficult crisis. However, the balance sheets are now exposed to greater
risks – namely interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and credit risk – that could
lead to financial losses. Rising long-term interest rates may result in actual
losses if central banks sell bonds from their portfolios, or in potential losses
under mark to market accounting. Central banks with large holdings of foreign
currency-denominated assets are especially vulnerable to exchange rate risks:
a sharp appreciation of the domestic currency would translate into losses on
their foreign exchange reserves. Credit risks have been increasing since the
onset of the international financial crisis as central banks have purchased (or
lent against) lower-quality assets, such as asset-backed securities.
Losses may also arise from the mismatch between funding costs and
asset revenues. Central banks that remunerate commercial banks’ reserves or
that issue central bank bills to drain liquidity from the market may find that
the related interest payments exceed the returns on their assets. In emerging
market economies, the return on foreign assets often falls short of the cost of
short-term sterilisation bonds; this carrying cost can be rather substantial in
those economies with low credit ratings.1
Sustained balance sheet losses arising from unconventional policy
measures adopted during the crisis could expose central banks to political
economy pressures.2 In the case of private sector asset purchase programmes,
including in some instances corporate bonds, central banks may risk being
criticised for favouring some segments of the economy over others. Similarly,
rescue operations by central banks may raise questions about the degree of
preferential treatment that one financial institution receives over another, even
if the policy actions are designed solely to save the financial system overall
from collapse. Finally, large-scale asset purchase programmes may complicate
fiscal debt management, putting the actions of the central bank at odds with

Box IV.A: Interactions of sovereign debt management with monetary conditions
and financial stability
The global financial crisis dramatically altered the environment in which central banks and managers of
sovereign debt operate. During the crisis, debt managers in many cases had to meet sudden and large
additional funding needs as central banks undertook extraordinary liquidity support measures and, in
some cases, subsequently purchased government debt as part of unconventional monetary policy operations.
Debt managers generally aim to minimise the medium- to long-term expected cost of funding the
government’s activities, subject to prudent risk management. Experience with sovereign debt management
(SDM) choices during and after the crisis is somewhat different across countries. For example, to meet
funding needs under difficult market conditions, some highly rated government issuers shortened
maturities; but others tended not to, in spite of the market pressures.
Maturity and other SDM choices, such as indexation and issuance techniques, can matter for central
banks. For example, shorter maturities of individual debt issues, other things being equal, imply more
frequent rollovers and may affect liquidity conditions in the money markets. More generally, SDM is
relevant for central banking because both activities influence the money and government bond markets
and because government bond yields act as a benchmark for the pricing of other types of debt. This is
especially the case under current conditions of heightened segmentation of financial markets, markedly
higher government debt issuance and fiscal sustainability concerns.
The potential interactions of SDM and central banking could be mutually reinforcing or conflicting.
For example, while some central banks have used large-scale transactions in government bonds as part
of unconventional monetary policy operations, there is a risk that those operations could be perceived
as intended to fund fiscal policy initiatives, undermining central bank independence. Moreover, SDM
strategies that shift the maturity or risk characteristics of outstanding government debt could have
implications for financial stability or could affect how monetary policy actions influence monetary
conditions. Increased issuance of long-term debt, for example, might blunt the interest rate effects of
central bank purchases of such debt if the primary mechanism by which such purchases work on interest
rates is through the supply of long-term debt in the market.
A report recently published by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) examined
these issues and their implications for central banks. In most countries, debt management operations
do not appear to have constrained central banks’ ability to ease monetary conditions via large-scale
asset purchases. This partly reflects the credibility of existing independence arrangements, as well as the
use of communication to emphasise the respective agencies’ different objectives and planning horizons.
Mainstream SDM practice generally aims to keep issuance steady and predictable, consistent with
reducing volatility for investors, while monetary policy’s role is to respond quickly to new information
relevant to the inflation and growth outlook.
In countries facing fiscal sustainability concerns and in some emerging market economies, legacy
SDM choices (about maturity and foreign participation, for example) have affected crisis dynamics and
thus financial stability. The lessons from this experience are that sound SDM can reduce financial system
volatility by spreading maturity, avoiding concentrated placement and developing stable and diversified
investor bases, which help in the recovery from crisis.
In the current circumstances, or where financial systems are still developing, debt managers will
benefit from taking a broad view of cost and risk, and central bankers will benefit from keeping abreast
of SDM activities. Recent experience confirms that medium-term strategic outcomes for the maturity
structure and risk characteristics of outstanding debt do matter, especially for financial stability. For the
relevant agencies, this underscores the importance of closely coordinating their activities while
maintaining their independence and accountability on the basis of clear and distinct mandates.
 See P Turner, “Fiscal dominance and the long-term interest rate”, LSE Financial Markets Group Special Paper, no 199, May
2011; and BIS, 79th Annual Report, June 2009, Chapter VI.  CGFS, “Interactions of sovereign debt management with monetary
conditions and financial stability: lessons and implications for central banks”, CGFS Papers, no 42, May 2011.

the plans of debt managers if not coordinated appropriately. Indeed, sovereign
debt management activities, monetary policy and financial stability policies
have become much more interdependent in recent years (see Box IV.A).

All these risks argue for an eventual reduction in the size of central bank
balance sheets. But it would be dangerous to cut balance sheets too rapidly
or too indiscriminately. In the major advanced economies, a near-term
reduction faces obstacles because of both the lingering economic and financial
fragility and the inherent uncertainties surrounding the withdrawal from the
unprecedented measures. In emerging market economies, there is the concern
that achieving a substantial reduction in central bank balance sheets by selling
foreign exchange assets would put upward pressures on exchange rates and
could trigger destabilising capital flows. These concerns notwithstanding, central
banks will want to avoid the longer-term costs associated with persistently
expanded balance sheets.
On a more positive note, the traditional monetarist concern that the
expansion of central bank balance sheets might cause inflation receives little
empirical support. The relationship between increases in central bank
balance sheets and base money has been rather weak for both advanced and
emerging market economies since 2007 (Graph IV.3, left-hand panel). The
correlation between central bank asset expansion and broad money growth
has been even weaker; in advanced economies, it is even slightly negative
(centre panel). This reflects instability in the money multiplier (broad money
over monetary base) over this period. Similarly, the correlation between the
change in central bank assets and consumer price inflation has been virtually
zero (right-hand panel). In sum, bloated central bank balance sheets do not
seem to pose a direct inflation risk.

said, the expected pace of tightening is rather modest. Policy rates in real
terms have remained exceptionally low over the past year and in many
countries continue to be negative (Graph IV.4, right-hand panels).
Two interrelated factors are likely to be important in determining the
future trajectory of inflation: (i) commodity prices and (ii) the degree of global
economic slack.
Inflation risk from higher commodity prices
Inflation is rising …

One key factor influencing the pace of tightening is the upside risk to inflation
arising from higher commodity prices, especially food and energy prices.
Headline inflation has already risen significantly in many countries. The impact
has been particularly strong in emerging market economies, where food
constitutes a large part of the consumption basket (around 25%, compared
with less than 15% for advanced economies).

Graph IV.5

The buoyancy of food and commodity prices is closely linked to the
strength of the global economic recovery, particularly in emerging market
economies. Supply side disruptions are also contributing to upward price
pressures. Recent poor weather conditions, including floods in Pakistan and
Australia and droughts in China and Russia, helped drive up food prices. And
geopolitical concerns and supply disruptions in North Africa and the Middle
East are putting additional upward pressure on energy prices. Although these
adverse supply side effects should subside when weather conditions normalise
and the political landscape in energy-producing countries becomes more stable,
conditions in particular markets may continue to have an effect. For example,
coal and natural gas prices could receive a substantial boost from efforts to
substitute away from nuclear energy and, in the short term, financial factors
seem to have played a role in influencing commodity prices (see Box IV.B).
More generally, as long as the demand for food and commodities is supported
by robust global growth, their prices may stay elevated or even rise further.
Since 2005, inflation in most advanced and emerging market economies
has been much more volatile than it was in the period 2000–04, owing for the
most part to the volatility of the energy and food components of consumer
price indices (Graph IV.6, left-hand panel).
Soaring commodity prices have in addition raised concerns about a
significant increase in underlying inflation via second-round effects. There are
clear signs of mounting wage pressures in some major emerging market
economies (Graph IV.6, right-hand panel). Dwindling economic slack and
persistent inflation in these countries have been pushing up wage demands.
Moreover, given the globalised nature of many supply chains, underlying
inflation pressures in the advanced economies are affected indirectly by a
pickup in unit labour costs in the emerging market economies. Indeed, profit
margins may have become tighter and a further squeezing of price margins due
to higher costs may eventually force firms to pass on a greater share of the

Box IV.B: Commodity prices and financialisation
What role have financial investors played in the rise in the level and volatility of commodity prices
(Graph IV.B, left-hand panel)? Commodity-related financial instruments such as index funds and
exchange-traded commodity funds have expanded rapidly in recent years (Graph IV.B, right-hand panel).
One major reason for this growth seems to be that institutional and retail investors are seeking to
diversify their portfolios. Some investors may view investments in commodity derivatives as a vehicle
for benefiting from rapid growth in the aggregate demand coming from emerging market economies
without having to invest in the often narrow local financial markets. A search for yield in an environment
of low interest rates has also been part of this trend.
A greater presence of financial investors can affect commodity prices in various ways. On the one
hand, markets could become deeper and more liquid, which in turn should facilitate hedging and reduce
price volatility. On the other hand, index-linked investments in particular could raise the correlation
between commodities and other assets, especially equities, and add to price volatility to the extent that
hedging makes the demand for commodities less price-sensitive.
Recent research supports the view that financialisation is affecting short-term price dynamics in
commodity markets. This seems to reflect both financial investors’ sensitivity to news and the large
sums they employ in commodity trading. The run-up in oil prices until mid-2008 has provided the
strongest empirical evidence that financial investments resulted in significant deviations of prices away
from those implied by fundamental demand and supply conditions. For non-oil commodities, there is
little evidence that financial investments have had a material impact on prices. The fact that the prices of
coal and iron ore – commodities that are not included in the standard commodity indices – have also risen
supports the view that physical demand and supply have remained the key driver of commodity prices.
In sum, while traditional demand and supply factors continue to matter for commodity prices, there
is growing evidence that price formation and dynamics in commodity futures markets increasingly
display patterns familiar from traditional markets for financial assets – including swings in investor risk
aversion and episodes of herding behaviour. More research is needed to better understand the impact
of financial investments on commodity prices.

State of the recovery and risks of overheating
The second key factor influencing the pace of monetary tightening is the extent
of economic slack. The recovery has broadened over the past year, with the
advanced economies gaining momentum and the emerging market economies
continuing to perform strongly. For 2011, according to Consensus Economics,
the global economy is forecast to expand by 3.7%, with the advanced
economies expected to grow at 2.0% and emerging market economies at
6.1%. The improved macroeconomic conditions reflect in no small part the
effectiveness of the extraordinary fiscal and monetary policy measures taken
in response to the financial crisis but, since last year, evidence has been
accumulating that self-sustaining cyclical forces in the private sector have
begun to play a bigger role in the recovery.
The persistently high unemployment rates in some countries are often
interpreted as indicating that there is significant slack in labour markets. For
the economy as a whole, some measures of the output gap (actual output
minus potential output) also point to ample unused capacity. In particular,
structural estimates of the output gap which rely on production functions and
other structural macroeconomic relationships (see the OECD’s estimate
represented by the dots in the top right-hand panel of Graph IV.7) currently
indicate a large negative output gap (that is, actual output much smaller than
potential). Projections of structural estimates suggest that the gap will shrink
only slowly and, as a consequence, hold down price pressures for some time.3
Other measures of the output gap suggest, however, that there may be
much less unused economic capacity in many economies and, on average,

globally. For example, some statistical measures of global output gaps indicate
that a substantial narrowing, if not outright closure, is in train (Graph IV.7, top
right-hand panel). Survey measures of capacity utilisation, which are available
at high frequency, also indicate a low degree of output slack.
The less benign inflation perspective is also supported by soaring
commodity prices and evidence of increasingly tight labour market conditions
in emerging market economies. It also reflects the possibility that potential
output in the advanced economies was more adversely affected by the
international financial crisis than is commonly thought. In particular, potential
output trends may be suffering from high private and public debt, which can
have negative effects on consumption and investment prospects. Moreover,

large investments that took place prior to the crisis, eg in the construction
sector, may prove to be much less productive than was originally expected
(see Chapter II). In general, identifying and quantifying changes in the structure
of the economy takes time. Thus, while statistical measures may overestimate
the speed of closure of the output gap, structural models may underestimate it.4
Inflationary pressures from soaring commodity prices and the possibility
of overestimated economic slack evoke memories of the 1970s. Then, food
prices – which are set in global auction markets and therefore respond quickly
to global demand pressures – were the first to move up, well before the surge
in oil prices (Graph IV.7, bottom left-hand panel). What followed was a mutually
reinforcing spiral of increases in headline inflation and unit labour costs
(bottom centre panel). At the same time, unemployment rates were reaching
new highs and the apparent opening-up of a large negative output gap during
the decade, as then measured by the OECD, indicated considerable slack in
the economy (bottom right-hand panel).
Today, with hindsight, it is clear that conventional measures of economic
slack at that time were grossly overestimated. The rise in the unemployment
rate was due in large part to structural changes in labour markets. The
slowdown in economic activity was mistakenly attributed mainly to insufficient
demand rather than to a substantial slowing of potential output growth. In
other words, the estimated output gap was thought to be quite large and
persistent, whereas in reality it was not. This is evident if one looks at the
difference between the OECD real-time estimate based on structural measures
(Graph IV.7, bottom right-hand panel) and revised estimates based on current
data.5 This misperception helps to explain why monetary policy at the time
ended up being too accommodative for too long.
The economic environment today appears to be very different from that
in the 1970s. In particular, wage developments in advanced economies today
are much less closely tied to domestic output gaps and domestic consumer
price developments. Globalisation, greater flexibility in labour markets and the
achievement of price stability have played key roles. However, the increase in
unit labour costs in some major emerging market economies represents a risk
to price stability globally because of the importance of these economies in
supply chains. The current situation, while different in many respects from that
in the 1970s, may therefore still confront monetary policymakers with challenges
that are more similar to that period than they might appear at first sight.
Against this backdrop, central banks must remain highly alert to a buildup of inflationary pressures. They should do so even if the evidence may
seem at odds with conventional estimates of domestic economic slack and
domestic wage developments. Vigilance and a timely tightening of monetary

How much tighter does monetary policy need to be to keep inflation in check?
Estimated Taylor rules, which link the level of policy rates to inflation and
the output gap, indicate that policy rates are too low. This is true for a large
number of individual countries, where the implied policy rates from the Taylor
rule are well above the actual policy rates (observations above the 45° line in
the left-hand panel of Graph IV.8), as well as on average for the global economy
(right-hand panel).
Of course, conventional Taylor rules may not be able to completely
characterise the range of trade-offs facing a central bank in setting its policy
rate. Those rules ignore a number of factors relevant in the current policy
environment, such as lingering financial headwinds from the crisis and the
effects of the unconventional monetary policies recently adopted. The latter
policies make monetary conditions much more accommodative than is
indicated by the difference between the actual policy rate and the implied rate
from estimated Taylor rules.
The current loose stance of monetary policy therefore reinforces concerns
about risks to price stability. At the same time, it may foster a renewed buildup of risks to financial stability. In particular, emerging market economies risk
the accumulation of financial imbalances similar to those seen in advanced
economies in the years immediately preceding the global crisis. Credit relative

to GDP and prices for residential property and equities have grown fast in
many emerging market economies over the past year (Graph IV.9; see also
Graph I.2, right-hand panel). These developments have also been fuelled by
large capital inflows (Graph I.2, centre panel).
Monetary policy tightening in emerging market economies has been limited
by concerns about reinforcing capital inflows and exchange rate appreciation.
But alternative policy measures have been adopted to rein in the build-up of
financial imbalances. These include macroprudential measures (such as caps
on loan-to-value and debt service-to-income ratios), higher reserve requirements
and in some cases capital controls (such as taxes on short-term capital inflows).6
These measures, however, cannot substitute for a tightening of monetary
policy and greater exchange rate flexibility.7
For the advanced countries that were most affected by the crisis, undue
delay in the normalisation of the monetary policy stance entails the risk of
creating serious financial market distortions, the postponement of deleveraging
and the misallocation of resources.8 Moreover, the unusually accommodative
monetary conditions in advanced economies have probably been an important
factor behind the recent large capital flows to emerging market economies.
Indeed, one lesson from the crisis is that monetary policy actions taken in
one economy can have powerful consequences for other economies. A purely
domestic focus fails to take into account the global implications of central
banks’ collective behaviour. In the run-up to the crisis, for instance, unusually

low policy rates in the core advanced economies were transmitted to the rest
of the world through resistance to exchange rate appreciation. The result was
unusually loose global monetary policy conditions at a time of strong global
growth. Another example is the role of commodity prices in the formulation of
monetary policy. Central banks commonly treat commodity prices as exogenous,
often excluding them from the price index representing the main guidepost
for monetary policy. But commodity prices, which are determined in global
auction markets, may be driven by global monetary conditions and may thus
be endogenous with respect to central banks’ collective actions. As argued in
Box IV.B, the recent increase in commodity prices may also be related to a
search for yield caused by the extraordinarily loose global monetary policy.
These considerations call for central banks to take better account of the global
side effects of their own monetary policies (see Chapter III). This also puts a
premium on reaching an international consensus on how to achieve balanced,
non-inflationary growth.

Summing up
In the current monetary environment, policymakers face several daunting
challenges. The increase in the size and complexity of central bank balance
sheets resulting from unconventional monetary policies and foreign reserve
accumulation creates risks that, if left unchecked, could eventually impact
monetary policy credibility. At the same time, soaring commodity prices have
pushed headline inflation rates up to uncomfortable levels in many economies,
while tighter capacity constraints have heightened the risks of second-round
inflation effects. These increased upside risks to inflation call for higher policy
rates, but in some advanced economies this still needs to be balanced against
the vulnerabilities associated with continuing private and public sector balance
sheet adjustments and lingering financial sector fragility. However, the prolonged
period of very low interest rates entails the risk of creating serious financial
distortions, misallocations of resources and delay in the necessary deleveraging
in those advanced countries most affected by the crisis. Moreover, some
emerging market economies show signs of a renewed build-up of financial
imbalances.
Tighter global monetary policy is needed in order to contain inflation
pressures and ward off financial stability risks. It is also crucial if central banks
are to preserve their hard-won inflation fighting credibility, which is particularly
important now, when high public and private sector debt may be perceived as
constraining the ability of central banks to maintain price stability. Central
banks may have to be prepared to raise policy rates at a faster pace than in
previous tightening episodes.

V. Financial regulatory reform: accomplishments,
pitfalls, prospects

As the source of credit intermediation between lenders and borrowers, banks
provide essential domestic and international financial services to consumers,
businesses and government. A strong and resilient banking system is thus the
foundation for sustainable economic growth. Throughout history, however,
financial crises have occurred at one time or another in every region of the
world and for a wide range of reasons. The most recent crisis, in 2007–09,
revealed fundamental shortcomings in the operation and regulation of the
banking system in many countries.
The crisis had its roots in the United States and spread primarily to other
advanced economies, having originated in the imprudent use and inadequate
regulation of complex securitisations by large banks. However, in a broader
sense, the causes and evolution of the crisis reflect deficiencies that are typical
of financial crises in general: investors chasing yield, too much credit, weak
underwriting standards, an underpricing of risk, excessive leverage, and
contagion.
Given the speed at which crises can arise and be transmitted around the
globe, and given ever more rapid financial innovation, banks in all countries
need to hold higher capital and liquidity buffers to protect the global banking
system and economy from unforeseen risks. Unfortunately, memories tend to
be short, and significant risks to the banking sector generally emerge after a
period of complacency bred of apparent calm. Thus, the work to strengthen
banking systems must be carried through now, when the crisis is still fresh in
people’s minds and policymakers and the wider public understand the urgency
of an effective response.
With its release of the Basel III rules on 16 December 2010, the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision set out new global regulatory standards
on bank capital adequacy and liquidity to correct the deficiencies revealed by
the crisis.1 Some of the new rules represent a significant overhaul of existing
global standards, others introduce rules where none previously existed. Taken
together, they strengthen capital and liquidity regulation to promote more
resilience in global banking. Thus fortified by Basel III, the international
regulatory framework will better shield the financial sector from the next crisis,
whatever its origin, and reduce the risk of spillover from the financial sector
to the real economy. As risk-taking in the financial sector resumes, banks have
started to accumulate capital and to adapt their funding strategies and broader
business models to the new regulatory framework, which will call on them to
target lower, more stable returns on equity.

How the financial crisis is shaping regulatory reform
The severity of the crisis owed much to the fact that the banking sector in many
countries had taken on too much risk without a commensurate increase in
capital. Furthermore, this inadequate level of capital was of insufficient quality,
as the latter had gradually eroded. Basel III tightens capital requirements,
encompasses a broader array of risks, and explicitly addresses macroprudential
aspects of banking system stability.
Bank capital

measures and help
curb the build-up of
excessive leverage

Basel III substantially raises the quality as well as the quantity of capital, with
a much greater emphasis on common equity (Graph V.1; Box V.A). During the
crisis, losses reduced banks’ common equity. However, some banks maintained
deceptively high ratios of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets through the
inclusion of other forms of financial instruments in the capital base. Moreover,
non-common Tier 1 capital instruments often did not share in banks’ losses
through reduced coupon or principal payments and so did not contribute to
maintaining the institutions as going concerns in any meaningful way. The
artificially high Tier 1 risk-based ratios also meant that banks were building up
high levels of leverage. Basel III therefore also introduces a simple leverage
ratio that provides a backstop to the risk-based regime. The supplementary
ratio, which is a measure of a bank’s Tier 1 capital as a percentage of its assets
plus off-balance sheet exposures and derivatives, will serve as an additional
safeguard against attempts to “game” the risk-based requirements, and will
mitigate model risk. By helping contain the build-up of excessive leverage, the
leverage ratio will also complement other macroprudential measures, discussed
below, to reduce systemic risk.

Box V.A: Capital instruments
The global banking system entered the crisis with an insufficient level of high-quality capital. The crisis
revealed an inconsistency in how regulatory capital is defined across jurisdictions and the lack of disclosure
that would have enabled the market to fully assess and compare the quality of banks’ capital. In response,
Basel III introduces a harmonised definition of capital that comprises the following components:
•
Common Equity Tier 1 – consists of the bank’s common shares and retained earnings less regulatory
adjustments (eg the deduction of goodwill). This component of capital fully absorbs losses while
the bank remains a going concern. It is therefore the highest-quality component of a bank’s capital.
A key element of the new definition of capital is the greater focus on Common Equity Tier 1.
•
Additional Tier 1 capital – consists of preferred shares and other capital instruments that comply
with a set of criteria to ensure they can absorb losses while the issuing bank remains a going concern.
These criteria include requirements that the instruments be subordinated, have fully discretionary
non-cumulative dividends or coupons and have neither a maturity date nor an incentive to redeem.
•
Tier 2 capital – consists of debt instruments that comply with a set of criteria to ensure they are
able to absorb losses when a bank fails (ie when it has become a “gone concern”). These criteria
include requirements that the instruments be subordinated, have a minimum original maturity of
at least five years and contain no step-ups or other incentives to redeem. Regulatory recognition of
these instruments is amortised over the five years before maturity.
During the crisis, a number of distressed banks were rescued by the injection of public sector funds
in the form of common equity and other forms of Tier 1 capital. While this had the effect of supporting
depositors, it also meant that certain capital instruments did not absorb losses. Therefore, in addition to
the characteristics noted above, instruments in Additional Tier 1 and in Tier 2 must have a feature
ensuring that they can be written off or converted to common equity when the issuing bank reaches the
point of non-viability (ie the point at which the bank is unable to support itself in the private market) as
determined by the relevant authority.
The Basel III definition of capital phases out innovative hybrid capital instruments, which provided
an incentive to redeem through features such as step-up clauses. It also eliminates Tier 3 capital, which
was short-term subordinated debt that was previously permitted to cover market risk.
In addition to the Basel III elements of capital, certain other instruments are being considered in the
context of systemically important banks:
•
Contingent capital (also called cocos) – debt instruments that convert to Common Equity Tier 1 capital
through a write-off or conversion to common shares before a bank reaches the point of non-viability.
•
Bail-in-able debt – debt instruments that convert to Common Equity Tier 1 capital through a writeoff or conversion to common shares when a bank reaches the point of non-viability.

Risk coverage
The Basel Committee has also improved the risk coverage of the regulatory
capital framework for capital market activities – a salient feature of the recent
crisis, where trading exposures accounted for much of the build-up of leverage
and were an important source of losses.2 Weak capital, excessive leverage
and inadequate risk coverage prevented the banking system from fully
absorbing systemic trading and credit losses. Nor could it cope with the
reintermediation of large off-balance sheet exposures that had built up in the
shadow banking system. Under Basel III, banks will have to hold more capital
against their less liquid, credit-sensitive assets whose holding periods are
much longer than traditional trading positions. Trading activities will also be

2
Trading exposures include positions in financial instruments and commodities held either with the
intent to trade them or to hedge other trading activities. For purposes of calculating regulatory capital,
such positions are subject to the Basel Committee’s market risk rules and are said to be held in the
“trading book”.

subject to a stressed value-at-risk requirement. In addition, securitisation
exposures in the trading book will be subject to capital charges more consistent
with those for the banking book. Basel III also imposes higher capital
requirements for counterparty credit risk, that is, for the amount that would be
lost in the event of default by a counterparty to a financial contract. Moreover,
Basel III creates incentives for banks to increase the use of central counterparties
(CCPs) – financial institutions that act as intermediaries between market
participants (see Box V.B) – while ensuring that the risk arising from banks’
exposures to CCPs is adequately capitalised.

During the build-up to the crisis, many banks had operated with increasingly

Box V.B: The role of financial market infrastructures
Transactions in financial markets are conducted either on organised exchanges or over the counter (OTC).
After the transaction is concluded, it is passed on to what is commonly known as the post-trade infrastructure.
This process starts with the matching of the transaction and ends with its settlement. Settlement typically
involves the transfer of money against the delivery of an asset or a financial instrument such as a derivative.
In modern financial systems, settlement takes place in financial market infrastructures like large-value
payment systems, securities settlement systems and central counterparties (CCPs).
The way these post-trade infrastructures are designed and how they function has important
implications for financial stability because they can act as a channel through which disruptions can spread
among financial market participants. Put differently, these infrastructures can serve as an important means
to mitigate the risks arising from the “interconnectedness” of market participants and can reduce the
risk of contagion.
The financial crisis revealed a striking weakness in the way important OTC derivatives, in particular
credit default swaps, were processed in the post-trade phase. Many of these transactions were inadequately
reported, and the bilateral exposures between counterparties were insufficiently collateralised.
Against this background, authorities from around the world are pushing for two significant changes
in the post-trade infrastructure for OTC derivatives. Both should be implemented by the end of 2012.
First, OTC derivatives will need to be reported to a trade repository (TR). A TR is an electronic registry
that keeps a record of all relevant details of an OTC derivative transaction over its lifetime. This
information can be used in various ways by the reporting institutions, authorities and the public. If all
trades are reported to a TR, and the information is made available to the relevant supervisory authorities,
then these authorities will be able to attain an overall view of the OTC derivatives markets, including the
most important (gross and net) positions taken by the major dealers in these markets. If TRs had existed
before the crisis, the build-up of huge derivative positions, such as those at American International
Group (AIG), would have been observed much earlier.
Second, clearing OTC derivatives through a CCP instead of bilaterally can bring about several
benefits from a financial stability perspective. A CCP interposes itself between the two original
counterparties of a financial transaction, becoming the buyer to the seller and the seller to the buyer. In
other words, the CCP isolates the original counterparties from each other should one of them default.
Thus, it makes financial institutions less interconnected. However, since risks become concentrated in
the CCP, the CCP itself needs to be highly robust: it must protect itself against the default of one or more
of its members. To that end, the CCP requires its members to adjust their collateral at the CCP at least
daily in accordance with the price movements of their positions.

funding. Basel III addresses the liquidity deficiencies that the crisis laid bare.
The internationally harmonised liquidity framework consists of two minimum
regulatory standards: the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable
funding ratio (NSFR). They have complementary objectives.
The LCR is designed to bolster the short-term resilience of a bank’s liquidity
risk profile by ensuring that it has high-quality liquid assets in sufficient quantity
to survive a plausibly severe stress scenario lasting for 30 calendar days. The
stress scenario, designed by the Basel Committee, incorporates many of the
shocks experienced during the crisis. It includes a partial run-off of retail
deposits, a partial or complete drying-up of wholesale funding sources, a need
to post additional collateral due to a credit rating downgrade, and unscheduled
draws on unused credit and liquidity facilities.
The NSFR is designed to promote resilience over a longer time horizon
by creating additional incentives for banks to use more stable sources of
funding on an ongoing basis. These standards complement the Committee’s
2008 Principles for sound liquidity risk management and supervision, the
implementation of which will be assessed in the near term.

Macroprudential aspects
Basel III was designed to enhance both bank-specific soundness and wider
banking sector stability. Thus, besides its firm-specific approaches, it incorporates
macroprudential measures to explicitly address systemic risk.
During the crisis, mounting losses and the resulting strain on capital
impaired banks’ ability to lend – precisely at the time when economies were
most in need of credit. This tendency for the financial system to amplify
cyclical effects in the real economy, or procyclicality, combined with the
interconnectedness of financial institutions that were considered too big to
fail, exacerbated the crisis.
To help mitigate procyclicality in banking and the broader financial
system, the new regulatory capital framework provides for building up capital
in good times to levels above the minimum requirement. The resulting capital
conservation buffer will help banks absorb losses during periods of financial
and economic stress. As a bank’s capital level moves closer to the minimum
requirement, the conservation buffer imposes a progressively tightened
constraint on the bank’s discretionary distributions, such as dividends.
Retaining a bigger proportion of earnings during a downturn will help ensure
that capital remains available to support banks’ ongoing business operations
during the period of stress.
Basel III also introduces a countercyclical buffer. It is based on the
observation that private sector credit growth that is out of line with historical
experience often ultimately imposes losses on the lenders. The ratio of
aggregate credit to GDP will serve as the reference for the build-up of the
buffer, which will be implemented through restrictions on capital distributions
identical to those that apply to the conservation buffer. Within countries, the
authorities will impose this buffer only when they judge that credit growth is
resulting in an unacceptable build-up of system-wide risk. Conversely, the
buffer will be released when, in the judgment of the authorities, the capital

Box V.C: National and international progress on implementing macroprudential
policy frameworks
One of the key lessons of the recent financial crisis is that regulatory policy must have an enhanced
macroprudential orientation to comprehensively address systemic financial risks. The national and
international work to develop such a macroprudential policy has intensified and continues to grow,
building on conceptual efforts by the BIS since the apparent coining of the term “macroprudential” by
the Cooke Committee, the forerunner of the Basel Committee, in 1979.
Recent initiatives in a number of international forums have aided the formation of a clear consensus
regarding the key features of an effective macroprudential framework. These include:
•
effective integration of supervisory information, market intelligence and aggregate indicator data;
•
recognition of the importance of domestic and cross-border interlinkages across financial institutions
and markets;
•
macroprudential instruments matched to the particular risks or imbalances diagnosed;
•
macroprudential policy responsibility assigned to an independent central agency or formal committee,
either within the central bank or involving the central bank in a key role;
•
clarity of mandate, adequacy of powers and strong accountability; and
•
clear macroprudential policy communications that link financial stability assessments to policy
decisions and that manage public expectations about the capabilities of macroprudential policy.
Formal macroprudential policy arrangements that will enable these principles to be realised have
been established or are well in train in many jurisdictions, including the United States, the United
Kingdom and the European Union. In many cases, operations under new arrangements have begun. The
emerging frameworks feature advancements in the structured, regular diagnosis of systemic risk. For
example, these diagnoses are conducted at the international level by the Committee on the Global
Financial System (CGFS), the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Standing Committee on the Assessment of
Vulnerabilities, and the IMF-FSB Early Warning Exercise; and national financial stability reports are
progressively strengthening their support of macroprudential policy. Basel III incorporates macroprudential
capital elements, and many jurisdictions continue to accumulate practical experience with macroprudential
instruments such as loan-to-value ratio caps and reserve requirements.
The powers, tools and accountability requirements for macroprudential policy are either well
defined or in an advanced stage of development. The imperative now is to get actual policy operations
up and running. To do so, key operational issues must be resolved, including the selection, design and
calibration of instruments, the translation of risk indicators to instrument settings, and arranging for
efficient decision-making by committees encompassing diverse policy interests and knowledge. In short,
the development of macroprudential policy is moving from conceptual issues of design to practical
questions of implementation.
The more technical phase of macroprudential policy development is being facilitated by increasingly
useful data generated by the growing number of actual macroprudential interventions and improvements
to statistical coverage. Nonetheless, a substantial amount of trial and error is likely to be needed for the
time being, given the still-limited history of macroprudential policy usage. Sharing of practical experiences
among macroprudential policymakers, including through the BIS and FSB processes, will promote the
development of the international dimension of macroprudential policy and the refinement of national
frameworks.

can help absorb banking system losses that pose a risk to financial stability.
The ability to run down the buffer without penalties will help reduce the risk
of constraining the availability of credit.
The macroprudential elements of Basel III contribute significantly to the
development of the broader macroprudential policy framework. The BIS has

advocated such a framework for some time and is encouraged to see the
growth of national and international efforts to develop and implement it (see
Box V.C). However, while much has been accomplished, more needs to be
done, especially on practical implementation of the broad consensus now
evident around the framework’s core concepts.

Impact of the new requirements
A stronger, safer banking system allocates credit more efficiently, reduces the
risk of a costly financial crisis and stabilises the environment for long-term
business decisions. These benefits will begin to be reaped when the reforms
are implemented. But the process of implementing the new framework will also
impose some costs on banks and their customers as banks adjust their balance
sheets and business models.
How much adjustment will be needed? The answer varies substantially
across institutions and jurisdictions. In some economies, particularly those
affected by the financial crisis, banks are still rebuilding capital and running
off certain assets. In others, capital and liquidity levels already meet the new
requirements. Regardless of their starting point, all economies will see some
adjustment, given the significant qualitative and quantitative changes in
supervisory definitions and approaches in Basel III.
To ascertain the impact of the new requirements and the corresponding
adjustment, members of the Basel Committee conducted a comprehensive
quantitative impact study (QIS).3 They found that, for a set of 74 large,
internationally active banks (Group 1), the new capital requirements (including
new deductions of capital from common equity) would have nearly halved the
31 December 2009 ratios of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital to riskweighted assets, from a weighted average gross CET1 ratio of 11.1% (gross of
current deductions, based on current risk-weighted assets) to an average net
CET1 ratio of 5.7% (after application of regulatory deductions and based on
new risk-weighted assets) (Table V.1). Because data pertained to most of the
banks that met the specified Group 1 criteria, these figures are likely to be

… and banks have
already started to
adjust

close to the actual weighted average capital ratio for the world’s large, global
banks. For a sample of 133 smaller banks (Group 2), measured capital ratios
would also fall, but to a lesser extent, with the net CET1 ratio declining from
10.7% to 7.8%.
These results suggest that some adjustment within the global banking
system is to be expected as banks work to meet the new requirements.
However, the improvements in capital positions since the end of 2009 should
mitigate this to some extent. The adjustment will also be eased by improvements
in bank profitability and behavioural shifts over the transition period.
Banks have already begun to accumulate the additional capital that they
will need (Graph I.7, left-hand panel). Banks’ capital-raising in 2008–09 largely
made up for their losses on writedowns related to the crisis (Graph V.2). More
recently, some have started to raise private capital, both to repay official
capital injections and to achieve stronger capital positions overall. For the
most part, however, banks have accumulated capital through higher retained
earnings, with increased profitability largely reflecting a fall in loan loss
provisions (Table V.2).
In contrast to previous international regulatory initiatives, the formulation
of the Basel III proposals was guided by top-down analysis of the potential
macroeconomic impact. Thus, alongside their bottom-up efforts to cumulate
the impact of higher requirements on individual banks, regulators looked
closely at the growth impact during the transition to stronger capital and
liquidity requirements as well as the costs and benefits to the economy over
the long term.
To examine potential transitional impacts on lending and investment,
the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee assembled the

Graph V.2

Macroeconomic Assessment Group (MAG), consisting of macroeconomic
modellers from a number of central banks, national regulators and international
organisations. The MAG concluded that the transitional effects were likely to
be modest.4 Using median results from the suite of models and relatively
conservative assumptions, the group estimated that bringing the global
common equity capital ratio to a level that would meet agreed targets over
eight years would result in a maximum decline in GDP, relative to baseline
forecasts, of 0.22% over 35 quarters (Graph V.3, right-hand panel). This is
equivalent to a shortfall from baseline in average annual growth of GDP of
0.03 percentage points (3 basis points) during these 35 quarters, after which
the growth rate would accelerate back towards the baseline. The 97 models used
in the study produced a wide range of estimated impacts. The 20th percentile
estimate produced a maximum GDP decline of 0.1% and the 80th percentile
estimate a decline of almost 0.5%. However, most of the results clustered
around the median, with the estimated paths between the 40th and 60th
percentile tending to be very close to the median forecast. The macroeconomic
impact of liquidity requirements was more difficult to estimate but also seemed
to be small.
The MAG noted that banks may choose to implement the reforms on a
faster schedule than the one set out by supervisors. The group found that
implementing the reforms over four years rather than eight (Graph V.3, lefthand panel) would lead to a slightly greater decline in the average annual
growth rate of GDP over a shorter period, specifically a reduction of 5 basis
points from baseline over 18 quarters, followed by a return towards baseline.

5.7% of risk-weighted assets, the level estimated by the QIS that large (Group 1) banks would have had at
end-2009 under Basel III capital requirements, to 7%, which under Basel III is equal to the sum of the
minimum CET1 ratio and the capital conservation buffer. The shaded areas show the range of estimated

While the MAG analysis focused on the transitional costs of the new
regulatory framework, a Basel Committee subgroup examined the long-term
economic impact (LEI) of the reforms, comparing costs with benefits. The
costs mainly related to higher lending rates linked to a higher cost of
bank funding.5 The group noted that this was actually a conservative
assumption, since it ignored the fact that safer bank balance sheets should
reduce the costs of banks’ equity and debt funding to an extent that would
at least partly compensate for the cost of holding more equity relative to
debt. Another conservative assumption was that any increase in bank funding
costs would be passed entirely into lending rates. These costs were set
against a number of benefits, including a likely reduction in the frequency and
severity of banking crises. The group found that, historically, banking crises
occur in any given country on average once every 20–25 years. Estimated
cumulative discounted output losses from banking crises vary widely but
have a median of 60% of pre-crisis GDP. Thus, for example, a 1 percentage
point reduction in the likelihood of a crisis should yield a benefit of around
0.6% of GDP.

See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, An assessment of the long-term economic impact of
stronger capital and liquidity requirements, August 2010.

BIS 81st Annual Report

73

The LEI group concluded that the long-term benefits of stronger capital
and liquidity requirements substantially exceed the costs for a broad range of
minimum capital requirements6 (Graph V.4). The magnitude of the benefits
depends critically on whether output after a financial crisis eventually returns
to where it would have been had no crisis taken place (the benefits portrayed
by the green lines in Graph V.4) or permanently moves to a lower path (that
is, a permanent relative reduction, in which case the benefits are as portrayed
by the red lines). If, as concluded by most studies, a crisis leads to a permanent
relative reduction in output, then the net benefit from reducing the risk of a
crisis should be correspondingly greater.
Along with other analyses, the MAG and LEI studies played an important
role in informing the decisions ultimately taken by policymakers, namely to
mandate relatively high minimum buffers for high-quality capital and liquidity
while allowing banks a lengthy transition period. With the outlines of the
international framework now essentially settled, banks have started to adjust
their balance sheets and business models to the new requirements, while
the regulatory agenda has moved on to a number of other, complementary
issues.

The net economic benefits portrayed by the red line are derived from the assumption that the effects of
crises on output are permanent but moderate, which also corresponds to the median estimate across all
comparable studies. For the benefits portrayed by the green line, the assumption is that the output effects
of crises are only transitory. The capital ratio (horizontal axis) is defined as tangible common equity (TCE)
over risk-weighted assets (RWA). The origin corresponds to the pre-reform steady state, approximated by
historical averages for total capital ratios (7%) and the average probability of banking crises. Net benefits
(vertical axis) are measured by the difference between expected benefits and expected costs and are
measured by the percentage impact on the level of output. Expected benefits equal the reduction in the
probability of crises times the corresponding output losses.

The LEI exercise used capital ratios calculated under the older, pre-Basel III definitions for capital and
risk-weighted assets. The findings of the QIS suggest that banks’ current ratios of tangible common
equity (TCE) to risk-weighted assets (RWA) under the Basel III definitions tend to be roughly two thirds
of those calculated using previous concepts. The figures on the horizontal axis in Graph V.4 should be
adjusted accordingly.

Outstanding issues and future work
The reform agenda now encompasses implementation of regulations
complemented by more intensive and intrusive supervision; more extensive
regulation and supervision of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs)
and development of effective cross-border resolution regimes; and broader
consideration of non-bank financial firms and the shadow banking system.
The Basel Committee is also reviewing the distinction between the regulatory
banking book and the trading book.

banks must begin

Full, timely and
consistent
implementation is
needed

The Basel III rules need to be implemented in a timely and globally consistent
manner. All member countries of the Basel Committee must now translate the
Basel III texts into national regulations and legislation in time to meet the 2013
deadline.
The Committee and its oversight body of Governors and Heads of
Supervision have consistently stated that the new standards will be introduced
in a manner that does not impede the economic recovery. Thus, they have
chosen a staggered timeline for implementation (Graph V.1). For example, the
July 2009 enhancements that strengthen regulatory capital and disclosure
requirements are due to take effect no later than the end of 2011. The Basel III
requirements themselves begin to take effect from the beginning of 2013 and
will be phased in by 2019. This time frame includes an observation period to
review the implications of the liquidity standards for individual banks, the
banking sector and financial markets, with a view to addressing any unintended
consequences. Similarly, the Committee will assess the impact of the leverage
ratio on business models during the transition period in order to ensure that
it achieves its objectives.
Like all Basel Committee standards, Basel III sets out minimum
requirements, and the transitional arrangements are the deadlines for
adopting the new standards. Countries should move faster if their banks are
profitable and are able to apply the standards without having to restrict credit.
Banks should not be permitted to increase their capital distributions simply
because the deadline for achieving the minimum standards is still some way off,
particularly if there are signs of growing macroeconomic risks and imbalances.
Therefore, banks, for their part, must also begin to plan and to prepare.
Basel III is the core regulatory response to problems revealed by the
financial crisis. Delay or weakening of the agreements would jeopardise
financial stability and the robustness of the recovery over the long term. The
full, timely and consistent implementation of all relevant standards by banks,
along with rigorous enforcement by supervisors, is critical. Ultimately, both
the official and the private sector will reap the benefits of a more stable
financial system.
More intensive and more intrusive supervision
Implementation efforts need to be supplemented by strong and enhanced
supervision of individual banks. Strong supervision is needed to ensure that
banks operate with capital levels, liquidity buffers and risk management

practices that are commensurate with the risks taken. It must also address the
consequences of financial innovation or risks of regulatory arbitrage that
regulation cannot fully capture and, more generally, address the firm-level
consequences of emerging risks and economic developments. National
authorities must supervise in a more intensive and more intrusive fashion,
especially for the largest and most complex banks. It will also be important to
reinforce both the firm-specific and macroprudential dimensions of supervision
and the way they interact.
In particular, as it carries forward its work on the implementation of the
supervisory review process under Basel II (ie Pillar 2), the Basel Committee will
foster the adoption of better supervisory practices.

Supervisors need

and a

Systemically important financial institutions
Reducing the risks posed by financial institutions that are systemic in a global
context (global systemically important financial institutions, or G-SIFIs) is a
high priority for the international regulatory community. Basel III will enhance
the quality and quantity of capital for all banks, but it does not fully address the
externalities or spillover effects that G-SIFIs generate. Additional policy tools
are necessary.
In November 2010, the FSB introduced a policy framework for these
institutions. It recommends that G-SIFIs have higher loss-absorbing capacity
to reflect the greater risks that they pose to the global financial system and
that these institutions be subject to more intensive and coordinated resolution
planning to reduce the probability and impact of their failure. This will help
ensure that G-SIFIs can be closed or wound up quickly without destabilising
the financial system or exposing the taxpayer to the risk of loss. In addition,
the FSB calls for enhanced supervision of SIFIs that will be more intensive and
effective than in the past.
The Basel Committee has developed quantitative indicators and qualitative
elements to identify G-SIFIs. Work is also continuing on calibrating the
additional loss absorbency that G-SIFIs should have, which could be met
through some combination of common equity and contingent capital. The
Committee will pursue this work in close cooperation with the FSB in the
coming months.

… including capital

More effective cross-border bank resolution
Higher loss-absorbing capacity for G-SIFIs and their effective resolution
complement each other, but neither by itself is sufficient. The financial crisis
also illustrated the importance of effective cross-border crisis management.
The scope, scale and complexity of international financial transactions
expanded at an unprecedented pace in the years preceding the crisis, while the
tools and techniques for handling cross-border bank resolution have hardly
evolved. Some of the events during the crisis revealed gaps in intervention
techniques and, in many countries, a lack of appropriate resolution tools.
Actions taken to resolve cross-border institutions during the crisis tended to
be ad hoc, severely constrained by time, and dependent on a significant
amount of official support.

… and better and
more coordinated
resolution regimes

In March 2010, the Basel Committee issued recommendations to
strengthen national resolution powers and their cross-border implementation.
The recommendations also covered firm-specific contingency planning for banks
and home and host country authorities. Contagion can be reduced through
risk mitigation mechanisms such as netting arrangements, collateralisation
practices and the use of regulated central counterparties. These and other measures
would help limit the market impact of a bank failure. The recommendations
should lead to practical and credible plans to promote resilience in periods of
severe financial distress and to facilitate a rapid resolution if necessary.
Building on the recommendations, the Basel Committee and the FSB are
assessing progress in national and multinational efforts to enhance authorities’
ability to manage and resolve distressed banking institutions in a manner that
minimises disruptions to the financial system. The two bodies are evaluating
legal and policy changes that would assist authorities in addressing future
needs for crisis management and bank resolution.
Other financial sectors and firms

Review of insurance
companies’ systemic
importance

Work to strengthen the regulation of SIFIs also needs to take account of
differences across financial sectors. The FSB will review how the different
regulatory measures fit together and whether there are inconsistencies or
contradictions among the standards. For instance, deeper consideration is
needed to assess the systemic importance of insurance companies and their
role in financial stability. Insurance companies tend to have very different risk
characteristics from those of banks, particularly regarding liquidity. Insurance
company balance sheets also differ considerably across countries, for example
in terms of the exposure to equity markets (Graph V.5, left-hand panel). Except
for unusual cases such as American International Group (AIG) and the
monoline insurers, these institutions proved broadly resilient during the
financial crisis (Graph V.5, right-hand panel).

Hedge funds are another set of firms for which regulatory instruments
and objectives differ sharply from those appropriate to banks. Despite major
investment losses and outflows during the crisis, assets and leverage in
the hedge fund sector have been broadly stable in the post-crisis period
(Graph V.6).
Shadow banking
Shadow banking refers to credit intermediation that takes place outside the
traditional banking system and involves maturity or liquidity transformation.
Examples include the activities of money market funds, lending by unregulated
finance companies, the issuance by specialised conduits and investment
vehicles of commercial paper backed by longer-term assets, and the funding
of securitisation activities through repo markets. The shadow banking system
is, however, closely intertwined with the regulated system. Large banks
typically draw substantial income from shadow banking activities and retain
both direct and indirect credit and operational exposures to them through
business lines such as loan origination, credit enhancements, backup liquidity
lines, brokerage services, warehousing and credit insurance.
Shadow banking can perform valuable functions, including facilitating
credit extension to certain sectors and providing banks and investors with a
range of vehicles for managing credit, liquidity and maturity risks. However,
the financial crisis demonstrated that shadow banking can also give rise to a
number of risks in the broader financial sector. Some of these risks (such as
those related to bank exposures through contingent credit lines) are being
addressed through the improvements in bank regulation as well as through
initiatives such as stronger regulation of credit rating agencies and money

market funds. Other aspects are more difficult to deal with, especially those
that call for a high degree of coordination across regulatory agencies, both
within and across national boundaries. For example, judging the extent of
liquidity mismatch in a bank-sponsored investment vehicle may require input
from banking and market regulators in several jurisdictions.
Another lesson of the crisis was that activities in the shadow banking
system need to be monitored in order to improve the ability of authorities and
market participants to understand and anticipate the build-up of systemic
risks. For example, in the years leading up to the crisis, US money market
funds were important providers of funding to European banks. As a result, the
disruption to the US money market fund sector in the aftermath of the Lehman
Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008 had knock-on implications for
European bank funding as well as for foreign exchange swap markets because
the banks had used these instruments to swap their funding from dollars into
local currencies. Existing statistical frameworks do not provide adequate
information for assessing these risks (see Chapter VI).
Shadow banking’s potential threats to financial stability must be reduced.
First, firm-level disclosure and system-wide statistical frameworks need to be
improved to ensure that the build-up of risks can be monitored properly.
Improved data need to be accompanied by regular monitoring of those
indicators that can be informative about the nature and locus of potential
systemic risks. Second, gaps in regulation need to be identified and addressed,
with the goal of reducing risky build-ups of leverage and maturity and liquidity
mismatches, wherever these occur in the financial system. Rules that mitigate
these risks in a consistent way across different entities and activities would
reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage. Given the global nature of many
shadow banking activities, these efforts need to be coordinated at the
international level. At the request of the G20, the FSB plans to submit
recommendations on these issues in the course of 2011.
Other regulatory and supervisory initiatives

Fundamental
review of the
trading book
framework

The financial crisis exposed significant flaws in the existing regulatory capital
approach to market risk and trading activities. The most immediate shortcomings
were remedied in the July 2009 enhancements to the regulatory capital
framework. The Basel Committee is now also carrying out a fundamental
review of the trading book framework and expects to conduct a public
consultation on its findings around end-2011.
There are a number of key questions: how to remove opportunities for
arbitrage across the banking book and trading book, how to define trading
activities, and how to capture risks in trading books (and possibly market
risk more generally). Under the current regime, banking book exposures
are subject to capital charges against credit risk (through the Basel II credit
risk framework) and also against foreign exchange risk and commodities
risk (through the market risk framework). Positions in the trading book
are subject to capital charges against interest rate risk, foreign exchange
risk, equity position risk and commodities risk (through the market risk
framework).

BIS 81st Annual Report

The evolving financial system
The new regulatory framework is being implemented at a time when other
factors are also influencing the shape of the financial system in the aftermath
of the crisis. Market participants have resumed taking on risk. This can be
seen in the strength of credit and equity markets (Graph I.1), increased capital
flows to emerging economies (Graph I.2), and the revival of high-yield bond
issuance (Graph V.7, left-hand panel). There has also been a revival of financial
innovation, as can be seen in the growth in financial instruments such as
synthetic exchange-traded funds (ETF) (Graph V.7, centre panel) and
commodity-linked investment vehicles (Graph IV.B). In the near term, the
recovery of risk-taking and innovation across various dimensions will pose an
important challenge for authorities as they consider whether and how to deploy
the tools at their disposal to address potential threats to financial stability.
Over a longer horizon, banks and other financial institutions have begun
to modify their business models. As already noted, capital levels have
increased, mostly through the accumulation of retained earnings. Many banks
have started to put in place more stable and resilient funding structures,
improve their risk disclosures and exercise greater control over their costs.
These changes come in response not only to strengthened prudential
frameworks but also to a greater awareness of, and sensitivity to, institutionlevel risks on the part of banks’ managers, shareholders and counterparties.
This evolution in bank business models will necessarily be reflected in
lower, more stable returns on equity (ROEs), since bank balance sheets will be
less risky. However, it is not yet clear that bank managers and shareholders
have revised their targeted ROEs accordingly. In the years leading up to the
crisis, many banks targeted ROEs of 20% or more, although the global banking
sector as a whole achieved a median ROE of 15–16% (Graph V.8). ROEs fell
sharply for both banks and non-bank financial firms during the crisis,
suggesting that the earlier high levels were in fact a result of higher leverage

and risk-taking, some of which was hidden from view at the time (see BIS,
80th Annual Report, Chapter VI). Over a longer time horizon, financial firms
have tended to achieve ROEs of 11–12%, which is close to the average for
non-financial corporations. Unusually high financial ROEs are a likely indicator
of a build-up of risk-taking, especially if ROEs are seen to rise across many
institutions at the same time.
Bank business models have also evolved with respect to funding structures
and strategies. In the near term, central banks are likely to withdraw the
extraordinary funding they provided to wholesale markets during the crisis,
while banks’ funding maturities remain short, leaving many banks exposed to
substantial near-term refinancing needs (Graph V.9). Banks in many of the
advanced economies have funded themselves at very low interest rates for
several years, potentially leaving them exposed to any increase in rates and
exposing the system as a whole to interest rate risk.
Looking at longer-term trends, heightened awareness of banks’ funding
liquidity risks on the part of fixed income investors has resulted in increased
covered bond issuance (Graph V.7, right-hand panel). The growth in covered
bonds also reflects uncertainty about the status of unsecured creditors under
possible revisions to resolution frameworks. Legislative frameworks for
covered bonds have been enacted or are under consideration in a number of
jurisdictions where these structures had not previously been in use.
Regulatory frameworks will be more effective to the extent that they
support and reinforce the aspects of these trends that are beneficial for
financial stability while addressing any potentially destabilising side effects.
For example, the increased emphasis on common equity capital in Basel III
both reflects and reinforces a heightened focus on higher-quality capital on
the part of bank investors and counterparties. Covered bonds offer a second
example: increased covered bond issuance will need to be accompanied by
improved disclosure of the overall encumbrance of bank assets, in order to
allow secured and unsecured creditors to make an accurate assessment of
balance sheet risks.

Summing up
The financial crisis severely tested banking systems, and the deficiencies it
revealed warranted a swift and comprehensive official response. The Basel
Committee and the FSB introduced a series of strong international measures,
capped by the Basel III framework issued in December 2010. The crisis revealed
that risk can be transmitted through unexpected channels. Thus, while Basel III
responded to the lessons learned from the recent financial crisis, it is primarily
designed to improve the resilience of all banks regardless of complexity and
size and in all jurisdictions. Moreover, while the global regulatory reform
programme will impose some transitional costs, rigorous analyses conducted
by the Basel Committee, the FSB and the BIS have concluded that the mediumand long-term investment in improving banking system resilience will yield
benefits that far outweigh the costs. Banks have already begun to adjust to the
new requirements, although they have also resumed taking on higher levels
of risk.
Achieving international agreement on stronger policy frameworks was
the first step in global regulatory reform. The next step is full and timely
implementation of the new global standards and all other prudential standards.
More intensive and intrusive supervision will be needed to help ensure that
banks implement these standards and that all jurisdictions enforce them in a
coordinated, consistent manner.
The policy response to the weaknesses revealed by the crisis continues.
Outstanding issues include dealing with systemically important institutions,
designing more effective cross-border bank resolution regimes, and addressing
the risks relating to shadow banking activities. Meeting these challenges will
be the focus of the next phase of global regulatory reform.

VI. Closing data gaps to enhance systemic risk
measurement

The recent financial crisis highlighted shortcomings in policymakers’ ability to
measure systemic risk. Gaps are evident in both the analytical framework and
the available firm-level and aggregate data that policymakers and market
participants use in making decisions. These gaps hinder market participants
in pricing and managing risk and policymakers in monitoring and responding
to vulnerabilities. This experience should prompt improvements in macro
surveillance and data collection.
Systemic financial risk can be defined as the risk of disruption to financial
services that results from an impairment of the financial system, with the
potential to harm the real economy. It can arise anywhere in the financial
system and may be amplified as market participants overreact to incomplete
or incorrect information. How this risk is distributed across entities and sectors
depends on the structure of balance sheet linkages, which can be complex.
Policymakers who monitor systemic risk therefore need an analytical
framework to capture this complexity. This requires multiple indicators, based
on a range of data, that provide a broad view of the financial system, ideally
from several vantage points. Market participants too need better information
about market structure and aggregate positions so that they can manage their
risks appropriately.
Initiatives in two areas deserve high priority. First, an international datasharing framework should be established to give supervisory authorities a
common view of the balance sheet positions of the largest global financial
institutions. For crisis prevention, regulators must be able to jointly analyse
the balance sheets of many banks in order to detect, for example, common
exposures to particular asset classes or concentrations in funding markets. As
crises unfold, regulators shift their focus to crisis management. Here, their
critical task is to assess counterparty credit risk in the interbank market in real
time to gauge what effect the failure of a particular institution might have. This
requires detailed and high-frequency information on bilateral linkages, that is,
firm-level balance sheet positions including data on individual counterparties.
To varying degrees, these types of data are already accessible to individual
bank supervisors. But without their wider dissemination, nationally and
internationally, a richer analysis of systemic risk is impossible.
The second area that deserves attention is the updating of standard
aggregate statistics to reflect changes in the financial landscape over the past
25 years. Aggregate statistics for flow of funds and international investment
positions,1 for example, are essential tools for capturing balance sheets at the

sectoral and country level. Yet these statistics were never designed to
consistently capture sector-level balance sheet linkages in a globalised world,
where financial institutions and corporations have operations in many
countries. Improvements to these statistics would greatly enhance the ability
to monitor system-level vulnerabilities in the non-bank sectors that lie beyond
the reach of regulators. The enhanced aggregate statistics necessary to reveal
sector-level stresses would then inform targeted analysis of firm-level data.
The first part of this chapter highlights some core elements of systemic
risk – common exposures, leverage and maturity transformation – all of which
involve measurement challenges and data gaps. The second part discusses
the further issues that arise when we seek to measure these systemic
vulnerabilities in a world of multinational financial institutions and corporations.
The final part examines in more detail the areas in which more or better data
are needed.

Systemic risk: where should we look?
Heightened systemic risk often results from unsustainable expansions in
private sector balance sheets during periods of benign economic conditions,
making these balance sheets more fragile when conditions change. This
process may start with an increase in asset prices, triggered initially by some
piece of good news or by financial innovation. Rising asset prices allow
investors to take on more debt, thanks to the growing value of their collateral.
Some of the increased borrowing may flow into the booming asset class,
further raising asset and collateral values.
The boom can conceal growing risks: as market participants finance an
increasing share of their assets with debt, leverage increases. This often
entails an ever greater reliance on short-term debt, thereby heightening their
maturity mismatch and thus their funding liquidity risk. Seemingly attractive
investment opportunities and herding incentives mean that financial firms
build up common exposures on both the assets side and the liabilities side
of their balance sheets. Negative shocks will then affect many institutions
simultaneously.
In short, common exposures, leverage and funding liquidity risk all feed
into systemic risk. When the underlying market and balance sheet conditions
are fragile – and systemic risk is high – a seemingly trivial shock can escalate
into an outright crisis. At this stage, the reactions of market participants are
virtually impossible to predict.
In an ideal world, policymakers would have a unified theoretical framework
for identifying and quantifying systemic risk. Such a framework would capture
all key drivers of systemic risk, such as market structure, institutional
incentives, risk (mis)measurement and market participants’ reactions to events.
But no such framework exists. What is required, therefore, is a multipronged
approach to systemic risk assessment that relies on a number of different
indicators, each crafted from a different perspective.
Broad-level indicators derived from aggregate data can help reveal
emerging vulnerabilities. Graph VI.1 clearly reveals boom-bust cycles of the

type discussed above: credit, property and equity prices all tend to rise above
their long-run trends in the run-up to crises. These measures provide helpful
leading indicators of financial stress, as they capture the most systematic and
general signs of the build-up of vulnerabilities across sectors, countries and
policy regimes.2 But their lack of specificity means that such indicators can
serve only as a starting point for a fuller analysis based on more detailed data.
Often, though, market data on prices act more as contemporaneous
indicators of financial stress than as leading indicators. As Graph VI.2
illustrates, spreads and volatilities were unusually low in the run-up to the
recent crisis. As real-time measures of market stress, they rose only after the
scale of the underlying balance sheet problems, which had been building for
years, became clear.
It is thus essential to supplement market data on prices with data on
quantities – specifically, data on balance sheet positions and balance sheet
health – at both the firm and aggregate (sectoral) level. Such balance sheet
data are critical to identifying any build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial
system. The remainder of this section examines three key aspects of systemic
risk – common exposures, leverage and maturity transformation – and
highlights some of the critical data gaps that hindered risk assessment and
crisis management in the recent episode.
Common exposures
Common exposures increase systemic risk as they lead to a less diversified
system. On the assets side, they arise when several financial institutions are
exposed to the same institution or asset class. On the liabilities side, common

exposures result from concentrated funding dependencies – ie when many
financial institutions borrow from the same source, for example from money
market funds.
Importantly, simply encouraging institutions to diversify their portfolios is
not enough to ensure sufficient diversification at the system level. If all
institutions have diversified in the same way, each may be individually less
likely to fail, but they are all equally vulnerable to the same shocks. As the
crisis showed, the financial system was anything but well diversified. Many
institutions had crippling exposures to the same toxic assets, and the resulting
illiquidity in funding markets affected virtually the entire system.
In principle, the likelihood of multiple failures arising from common
exposures could be empirically assessed and the drivers appropriately
monitored. Regulators would have full information about the level and riskiness
of exposures and the capacity of institutions to absorb risk (in terms of both
capital and liquidity), and they would know in detail how shocks are transmitted
(through direct interlinkages as well as market reactions). This would amount
to a unified framework to measure systemic risk.
A first step in this direction is to obtain data that identify common
exposures, especially for banks. While banks are not the only institutions
policymakers are concerned about, they are the core of the credit intermediation
process and thus a high priority. A key data gap during the crisis was the lack
of information on banks’ asset and liability positions broken down by currency,
counterparty sector, counterparty country and instrument type. For example,
no public information was available on large banks’ exposures to structured
products. As late as February 2008 (when financial statements for end-2007
had already come out), the publicly available data were still patchy and lacking
in comparability (Table VI.1). The resulting market uncertainty about the

location of risks in the financial system prompted some institutions to hoard
or withhold liquidity, contributing to funding problems even at institutions
which had no direct exposures.
The starting point for any analysis of common exposures is consistent
information about key aspects of financial institutions’ balance sheets that can
affect their capital or funding. That information must include all on- and offbalance sheet exposures such as committed credit lines. Data are also required
on both gross exposures and exposures net of risk mitigants such as collateral,
third-party guarantees or hedges. For example, a bank that owns $10 billion
in structured products backed by subprime debt may have a much smaller
ultimate exposure if the credit risk is hedged by other instruments.
Risk is more difficult to assess at the system level than at the institutional
level, where measures of net and gross exposures are fairly straightforward.
The systemic impact of a shock to a particular asset class may be much larger
than the sum of the firm-level direct net exposures to this asset class if, for
example, hedges are concentrated among particular counterparties and thus
do not work as expected. American International Group (AIG), which was
ultimately rescued by the US authorities, was the counterparty to more than
$440 billion in notional positions in credit default swap contracts; its failure
would have ramified throughout the financial system.
Such problems show that data on banks’ exposures to other large
individual counterparties (that is, bilateral data) are critical for crisis
management purposes. These data requirements go beyond the abovementioned high-level breakdowns that are used to assess common exposures
to specific asset classes. During a crisis, authorities must make quick decisions

BIS 81st Annual Report

87

that take into account how the failure of one institution will affect others. To
that end, financial institutions must be able to produce updates of their bilateral
exposures at short notice, something which was lacking in many countries
during the recent crisis.
Leverage
Multiple bank failures are more likely if the system’s capacity to absorb losses
is low. This is the case when financial firms are highly leveraged. Usually
defined as the ratio of total assets to equity, leverage is a useful indicator of
institutional fragility.3 In essence, it is a multiplier tracking the magnitude of
the change in capital arising from a change in asset values. For instance, a
financial institution with $100 billion in assets and $5 billion in capital has a
leverage ratio of 20. Thus, a 1% drop in the value of the institution’s assets
would lead to a 20% drop in the value of its equity.
The leverage ratio is a crude measure of fragility. First, it does not take
account of how risky banks’ assets may be. Second, it excludes off-balance
sheet exposures such as credit and liquidity lines. Economically, this leverage
is present, but it is beyond the scope of conventional balance sheet analysis.
Regulators are now working on reforms aimed at eliminating hidden leverage
by ensuring that banks clearly consolidate all their exposures on their balance
sheets (see Chapter V).
Even though leverage ratios require only two inputs (total assets and
equity), they epitomise the broader problems associated with the crosscountry comparability of data. Differences in regulatory regimes and listing
requirements mean that data released to the public are not comparable across
institutions. Nor are the confidential data accessed by supervisors necessarily
comparable, since data needs differ across jurisdictions. Finally, accounting
differences can have a first-order impact. For example, netting of derivative
positions with counterparties, which is allowed under US generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) but not under International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), greatly reduces the amounts outstanding. While the top five
US banks reported almost $5.4 trillion in gross derivative positions at the end
of 2010, their net derivative position was less than 6% of this amount. In turn,
including gross rather than net derivative positions in these banks’ total assets
yields an average leverage measure that is 80% higher than otherwise.
Tracking system-wide as opposed to firm-specific leverage poses further
challenges. Consider a simple system-level analogue: the ratio of aggregate
assets to aggregate capital for a particular group of banks. One problem with
this measure is that it may not truly reflect the multiplier effect that a change
in aggregate asset values has on aggregate capital. On the one hand, doublecounting occurs when assets and equity are aggregated by simply summing
positions across banks. Balance sheet interlinkages in the form of lending,
off-balance sheet positions or cross-shareholdings by construction mean that
one institution’s asset is another’s liability, which should be netted out in the

3
Basel III defines the leverage ratio inversely as equity over total assets, in line with other regulatory
capital ratios that reflect the ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets.

aggregate. On the other hand, system-wide losses are not simply the sum of
initial losses at individual institutions. The same balance sheet interlinkages
can amplify shocks in a non-linear fashion, as the chain of bilateral exposures
can lead, for example, to cascading defaults. Quantifying these effects ex ante
is difficult as they are inherently driven by market reactions and the particular
structure of balance sheets at the moment when stress materialises.
That said, the ability to monitor leverage ratios – even simple weighted
sums of firm-level leverage – consistently across different parts of the financial
system would represent a big step forward in tracking systemic risk. It would
require, at a minimum, internationally comparable measures of total assets and
equity for individual financial institutions. Importantly, the measure of total
assets would have to include all off-balance sheet positions that could affect
a bank’s capital.
Maturity transformation and funding risk

Funding
vulnerabilities went
undetected before
the crisis …

Many parts of the financial sector – banks, in particular – use short-term
funding to finance long-term investments. While maturity transformation
performs an important economic function, it exposes financial institutions to
funding liquidity risk, ie the risk that they will not be able to meet cash
commitments as they come due.
Tracking funding risk presents its own set of difficulties. In principle, it is
straightforward to measure contractual maturity mismatches (that is,
differences in the remaining maturities of assets and liabilities) on an
institution’s balance sheet. And it is also possible, at least in principle, to track
off-balance sheet positions that are tied to funding (eg contingent commitments
or foreign exchange swaps and options). But key determinants of liquidity
risk, such as rollover risk (the inability to roll over short-term funding) on the
liabilities side or market liquidity risk (the inability to sell at a moment’s notice
and with little loss) on the assets side, are difficult to measure since they
depend on rapidly changing market perceptions at times of stress.
The introduction of minimum liquidity requirements under Basel III will
improve the measurement of risks concerning funding liquidity at the firm level
and will enhance liquidity risk management more generally (see Chapter V).
The new liquidity rules should make internationally comparable data on
individual banks’ funding liabilities available for the first time, thereby enabling
supervisors to monitor funding pressures across key institutions.
However, the measurement of maturity transformation at the system
level requires an even broader perspective. Throughout much of the crisis, but
particularly following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the
scale of the global demand among European and Japanese banks for US dollar
funding took both policymakers and markets by surprise. In the end, banks’
dollar liquidity needs could be met only through the establishment of central
bank swap lines. The lines were re-established in May 2010 as concerns over
European banks’ exposures to sovereign risk intensified. These experiences
have given central banks a keen interest in monitoring the extraterritorial use of
their currency. To that end, they will need comprehensive information – for a
much larger universe of financial institutions than just banks – covering

aggregate international balance sheet positions by currency, including gross
and net currency derivatives.
It is now clear that data available before 2008 could have helped to
identify, albeit imprecisely, the growth in non-US banks’ dollar funding needs
in the run-up to the crisis. Graph VI.3 (right-hand panel) shows the net US
dollar asset and liability positions of the major European banks since 2000.
Information on the counterparty type (monetary authority, non-bank, interbank)
is used to proxy for the (unavailable) remaining maturity of positions, where
interbank positions and net foreign exchange swap (“Cross-currency”) positions
are assumed to have a shorter average maturity than positions vis-à-vis nonbanks. The graph is highly suggestive of a growing funding risk prior to the
crisis, as the longer-term investments in non-banks became increasingly
dependent on short-term foreign currency funding. But only broad tendencies
can be identified: there are no actual data on remaining maturities or on the
use of foreign exchange swap markets (see box).

Data needs in a globalised world
The frameworks for data collection must take into account the global scale of
many financial institutions and their complex organisational structures.
According to their annual reports, the 10 largest global banks on average have
3,500 subsidiaries located in about 80 countries. Some bank operations outside
the home country are more systemically relevant than domestic operations; a
significant part of European banks’ US dollar portfolios, which deteriorated so
significantly during the crisis, rested on the balance sheets of their branches
and subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and the United States.

… and lack of data

The BIS international banking statistics: uses and enhancements
The BIS international banking statistics (IBS) are a long-established dataset for monitoring internationally
active banks’ foreign positions. The IBS actually combine several datasets, each collected with a different
objective in mind. Collectively, they are a key source of information for analysing financial stability issues
including banks’ country risk, funding risks in different currencies and role in the transmission of shocks
across countries. This box describes the characteristics of the IBS data that make them useful in these
analyses, and outlines some initiatives designed to improve their usefulness.
Country risk
The BIS consolidated banking statistics (CBS) track banks’ worldwide consolidated gross claims and
other exposures to individual countries and sectors. They thus provide internationally comparable
measures of national banking systems’ exposures to country risk. The statistics were expanded in the
early 1980s after debt crises in emerging markets highlighted the need for information on banks’ transfer
risk, ie the risk associated with policy measures that have a territorial jurisdiction, such as capital controls
and payments moratoriums. By the time of the Asian financial crisis, attention had shifted from transfer
risk to the broader concept of country risk, or the risk associated with the economic, business, political
and social elements of the environment in which the debtor operates. In the late 1990s, the statistics
were expanded again to capture guarantees and other credit enhancements that result in the reallocation
of reporting banks’ risk exposures from the immediate borrower to another (ultimate) obligor. These
ultimate risk data have recently proved useful in tracking banks’ exposures to troubled European sovereigns.
The global financial crisis revealed some shortcomings in these data. First, the counterparty
breakdown (bank, non-bank private sector and public sector) is too coarse to permit analysis of banks’
exposures to particular parts of the non-bank private sector, in particular non-bank financials and
households. Mortgage lending by foreign banks in many countries has been rising significantly over the
past decade. Similarly over this period, banks’ exposures to special purpose vehicles, securities brokers,
hedge funds and other non-bank financials have built up significantly. A second shortcoming in the data
is that banks do not report exposures vis-à-vis residents of their home country. These are generally large
and thus should be included in any assessment of banks’ overall country risk.
Funding risk
The IBS are also a key source of information on the currency composition of banks’ balance sheets.
Indeed, the BIS locational banking statistics (LBS) were originally established to track the growth in US
dollar deposits outside the United States in the late 1960s. The LBS follow balance of payments accounting
and are collected on a residence basis, meaning that the reporting unit is a bank located in a given
country. Because reporting countries also provide information on the nationality (ie the home country)
of the reporting banks in their jurisdiction, the statistics can also be aggregated along the lines of
consolidated national banking systems, as in the CBS described above. These data provide a broad
picture of the currency breakdown of banks’ consolidated foreign positions. When combined with the
CBS data, they help to track, at the bank nationality level, banks’ cross-currency funding and investment
patterns (Graph VI.3), which proved fragile during the crisis.
Again, however, the crisis has highlighted some limitations in the data. Estimates of banks’
US dollar funding needs are approximate at best since there is no actual information on the maturity of
banks’ assets and liabilities in specific currencies, nor on banks’ use of foreign exchange swaps or other
currency options. And the counterparty sector split that is used to proxy for residual maturity is very
coarse. Moreover, the IBS only cover banks’ international activities, not their domestic currency positions
against residents of their home country. This incomplete picture of banks’ balance sheets makes it
difficult to monitor system-level funding risks in other currencies, particularly the euro.
Country-to-country linkages
Both the CBS and LBS have a bilateral component, that is, information on the financial linkages between
banking systems and countries. Thus, it is possible to partially assess the impact that shocks in one
 See “What the BIS banking statistics say (and what they do not) about banking systems’ exposures to particular countries and
sectors”, BIS Quarterly Review, March 2011, pp 16–17; and P McGuire and P Wooldridge, “The BIS consolidated banking
statistics: structure, uses and recent enhancements”, BIS Quarterly Review, September 2005, pp 73–86.

market or region might have on borrowers elsewhere. For example, in the LBS, shifts in the investment
patterns of residents of surplus countries show up as changes in the amount, the location and the
currency of deposits placed in BIS reporting banks. Similarly, in the CBS, banks distinguish between their
cross-border claims on particular countries, on the one hand, and their local operations, on the other.
This information is valuable because, for example, the problems of banks in advanced economies might
have less severe consequences for borrowers in emerging market economies if most of the claims are
booked in the local operations and funded with local liabilities. By the same token, this structure could also
help limit the extent to which an economic shock in a given country affects internationally active banks.
Enhancements
Forthcoming enhancements to the IBS will help to address some of the above shortcomings. In broad
terms, these enhancements will (i) provide more information on banks’ counterparties, specifically on
their location and sector; and (ii) extend the coverage of the statistics to banks’ entire balance sheets,
not just their foreign positions.
One key enhancement is to include an additional dimension in the LBS. Currently, it is not possible
to simultaneously see a bank’s location, its nationality and its counterparty’s location (eg liabilities to
Middle East oil exporters booked in the UK offices of Swiss-headquartered banks). To use the example
of Graph VI.4, the data provide a picture of the balance sheet for TRUST Ltd’s operations in each oval
but no information on the arrows. Starting in late 2012, information on the country location of banks’
counterparties should be available for the main bank nationalities in each reporting jurisdiction. This will
facilitate a more detailed analysis of how shocks in one part of the world might affect borrowers elsewhere.
Second, the coverage of the LBS will be broadened so as to capture banks’ financial assets and
liabilities in their entirety. That is, banks will start to report their local currency positions vis-à-vis residents
of the host country. This will make it easier to assess system-level funding risks across a much wider
range of currencies. It will also allow the scale of banks’ international activities to be compared with their
total balance sheets. Similar enhancements to the CBS are being considered for the longer term. The
possible inclusion of banks’ claims against residents of their home country would give a more complete
picture of the overall size of their balance sheets and their exposures to home country risk.
The BIS has been working to improve its dissemination of the IBS to central banks and the public.
Besides providing regular commentary on the full set of statistics in the BIS Quarterly Review and other
publications, the BIS makes available the data behind the graphs that appear in these publications. It
has also simplified access by launching a new online database for the IBS. Finally, the level of detail on
banks’ credit exposures to particular countries and sectors has been significantly increased.

See “Table 9E: Consolidated foreign claims and other potential exposures – ultimate risk basis” on the BIS statistics website,
www.bis.org/statistics/consstats.htm.

The nature of the data needed to reveal the risk profiles of institutions
which operate globally is determined by the question asked. Many analyses
need a group-level view, where all of an institution’s operations are consolidated
into a single global entity. For instance, leverage ratios should be based on
banks’ consolidated balance sheets, since only these consistently relate
exposures to the capital base ultimately supporting them. Similarly, any effort
to identify common exposures across banks to particular sectors or
counterparties will require a complete picture of all their exposures, including
those of subsidiaries. In short, many of the analytical questions that concern
policymakers can be answered with institution-level data collected on a
globally consolidated basis.
But consolidated data are not enough. Some analyses require information
about the geographical structure of banks’ global operations. Funding risks
can arise in particular subsidiaries or countries but, as explained below, they

data …

can easily go undetected in consolidated data. Similarly, analysing how stress
may propagate across sectors and national borders depends on being able to
see balance sheet linkages across locations. Complementary information about
the location of activities is necessary for a complete analysis.
To see what is lost when data are consolidated, it helps to visualise
the operational structure of a hypothetical institution. TRUST Ltd, shown in
Graph VI.4, represents any multinational financial or non-financial institution
with a large balance sheet and offices in different jurisdictions connected via
inter-office funding. In this example, four different TRUST Ltd offices have
claims in three different currencies on non-banks in Korea. In turn, TRUST Ltd’s
liabilities are a combination of euro deposits, wholesale dollar borrowing,
commercial paper issuance, petrodollar deposits and euro inter-office funds
swapped for dollars. That is, across the four locations, four different liability
structures support the four components on the assets side.
Consolidated data can provide only a limited picture of the funding risks
embedded in TRUST Ltd’s global balance sheet. In such data, offices that are
dollar providers to the foreign exchange swap or wholesale interbank markets
are netted against those that are dollar borrowers, yielding an overall net
borrowing figure for the consolidated entity. This netting implicitly assumes
that resources in one location can immediately be used elsewhere – in other
words, that the institution’s “internal capital market” is frictionless. However,
this is unlikely to be the case, given that assets would have to be liquidated
and hedges unwound to free up funds – a potentially costly process during a
crisis. Moreover, a host country’s capital and liquidity regulations might
prevent a local office from making large balance sheet adjustments to support
affiliates elsewhere. For instance, in the recent case of Icelandic banks, foreign
authorities restricted the transfer of their assets across jurisdictions.

More broadly, consolidated data are of limited use in anticipating how
shocks might propagate across sectors and national borders. Given a world
with many multinational banks like TRUST Ltd, consider what might happen
if one of the funding sources – wholesale funding or petrodollar deposits, say
– were suddenly to dry up. Which banks would be hit hardest and which
borrowers in which countries would bear the brunt of the impact? Determining
this with any precision is impossible without making a host of assumptions
about how banks and borrowers would react to the shock. But data on the
geographical structure of banks’ operations are useful, as they can help to
gauge the likely scale and propagation path of the impact. Such analysis is
especially useful for countries where the non-bank sector relies heavily on
cross-border credit.
It is difficult if not impossible to fully trace the linkages depicted in
Graph VI.4 at the micro level. An attempt to do so would require data from all
the individual entities which make up TRUST Ltd, complete with information
on the location and sector of each entity’s full set of counterparties. In practice,
any such attempt would be ruled out by the amount of data required, the cost
of collection, and the confidentiality issues it would raise.
The task is to find a data mix that will give policy analysts a detailed
enough picture of key institutions and their activities. Consolidated balance
sheets are the only suitable tool for policymakers who need detailed breakdowns
by sector, country, currency and instrument. By contrast, unconsolidated
information must be less detailed if it is to be tractable. As described in the
following section, an unconsolidated view of the financial sector (and other
sectors) could for example be derived, with improvements, from existing
aggregate statistics.

… hindering crossborder analysis

Filling the data gaps
The recent financial crisis highlighted the need to supplement microprudential
supervision with a macroprudential analytical framework based on a broader
view of the system. A comprehensive approach to identifying and responding
to systemic risks requires a broad range of measures and indicators to be
generated and monitored.
Data collection is, however, costly for both reporting institutions and
compilers. Further, significant confidentiality and legal issues arise in sharing
data. Firms are naturally sensitive about revealing private information that
could reduce their profit opportunities – which is why firm-level data are
protected by strict confidentiality rules even within national governments. Yet
the extent to which the recent crisis spread across markets, different types of
institution and national borders strongly suggests that effective systemic
stability assessment will require information about individual firms’ balance
sheets to be shared more widely than before. Given the challenges involved,
existing reporting frameworks should be used as much as possible.
A top priority is to obtain better and more consistent firm-level data on
balance sheet positions for the financial sector. Existing supervisory data
might be used to assemble a global picture of the financial sector if a formal

94

international framework could be devised to address the legal and
confidentiality concerns that restrict information-sharing. To that end, the BIS
strongly supports the ongoing G20 data gaps exercise, which aims to develop
an institution-level data template for global systemically important financial
institutions and a framework for data access and usage.4
Given the confidentiality issues, much of this detailed information will
have to remain in the hands of supervisory teams charged with systemic risk
analysis. However, a critical output would be the aggregation and dissemination
of key indicators so as to strengthen market discipline by allowing market
participants to better price and manage systemic risk.
At the same time, if updated to reflect the modern global financial
landscape, existing sets of aggregate statistics (eg flow of funds or balance of
payments data) can help to identify pressure points in many non-bank sectors
over which regulators have a limited reach.5 A further advantage is that
confidentiality issues generally do not arise in the sharing of such data. Many
sets of aggregate statistics need updating because they were designed for a
less internationally integrated world and therefore often lack the information
on currencies and instruments needed to track the types of vulnerabilities
discussed in previous sections. Most critically, however, they lack the nationality
data essential to the construction of consistent sectoral balance sheets.6 That
is, because existing aggregate statistics are collected on a residence basis,
the balance sheet positions of all entities located in a particular country are
aggregated regardless of the reporting entity’s nationality (ie country of
incorporation). While such a perspective may be valid for the household and
government sectors, which operate almost entirely domestically, problems
arise for the financial and non-financial corporate sectors, which have operations
in many countries.
The limitations of strictly residence-based reporting are illustrated by the
case of the US automotive industry when it encountered financial difficulties
in 2009. Market participants and policymakers worldwide struggled to identify
the sectors and countries that would be affected by any credit event at a
US carmaker. The potential implications for the European insurance sector at
the aggregate level, for example, could not be discerned because European
insurance companies operate globally, and investments are made by their
offices outside Europe. Similarly, some of the bonds purchased by these
insurance companies are issued by US carmakers’ operations outside the
United States. Thus, it was not possible to capture European insurers’ worldwide
consolidated exposures given that the aggregate data were collected on only
a residence basis.

To provide a view of sector or country exposures on a consolidated
basis, residence-based aggregate data would have to convey four pieces of
information: the reporter’s location and nationality (eg German insurance
companies in Germany, German insurance companies in the United States);
and the borrower’s location and nationality (eg US automobile companies in
the United States, US automobile companies in Brazil). If aggregate data
collected in all countries reflected all four components – location and nationality
for both the reporting company and the borrower – it would be possible to
construct a worldwide consolidated balance sheet for a particular national
sector (here, the German insurance sector) as well as for its counterparty (here,
US automobile companies worldwide). Such a reporting system could provide
a picture of the exposure of (consolidated) sectors or countries to each other.
Existing sets of aggregate statistics capture one or more of the four pieces
of information specified above, but none captures all of them simultaneously.
That said, several current initiatives are moving in the right direction. For
example, improvements to the BIS banking statistics, which cover only
internationally active banks, are currently being worked on. These include the
expansion of coverage to three of the four fields, which would deliver a sectorlevel view of national banking systems akin to that for TRUST Ltd in Graph VI.4
(see also box). Similar improvements to the other sets of aggregate statistics
are also desirable since they are the primary source of information on the
balance sheet positions of non-banks, which are generally beyond the reach
of regulators.

Summing up
Better data will not prevent the next crisis, but they can help policymakers to
measure and monitor systemic risk, identify pressure points and see where
targeted investigations are needed. Arrangements which facilitate the broader
sharing of firm-level data among policymakers will support financial stability
policy decisions. A complementary element would be the regular analysis of
aggregate data that track risk factors in both regulated and unregulated sectors
of the economy, thus providing a broad picture of where vulnerabilities are
building. And the provision of timely data on aggregate market positioning
will improve market participants’ ability to price and manage their risks.
To stay current and relevant, improved data frameworks require enhanced
review mechanisms so that they will continue to reflect new developments in
the global economy. Finance will continue to evolve, and new financial
instruments will emerge. Over time, moreover, institutions will find ways of
concealing risks in the data they report. Here, transaction-level data from data
warehouses and trading platforms can provide helpful additional information,
including early indications of changes in market structure or business lines.
These, in turn, could guide ad hoc data collection efforts and inform adjustments
to established data templates.

BIS 81st Annual Report

The BIS: mission, activities, governance and
financial results

The mission of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is to serve central
banks in their pursuit of monetary and financial stability, to foster international
cooperation in those areas and to act as a bank for central banks.
In the light of the Bank’s mission, this chapter reviews the activities of the
BIS, and the groups it hosts, for the financial year 2010/11; describes the
institutional framework that supports their work; and presents the year’s
financial results.
In broad outline, the BIS pursues its mission by:
•
promoting discussion and facilitating collaboration among central banks;
•
supporting dialogue with other authorities that are responsible for
promoting financial stability;
•
conducting research on policy issues confronting central banks and
financial supervisory authorities;
•
acting as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial
transactions; and
•
serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international financial
operations.
The BIS promotes international cooperation on monetary and financial
policy through its meetings programmes for central bank officials and through
the Basel Process – hosting international committees and standard-setting
bodies and facilitating their interaction.
In particular, the BIS hosts the Financial Stability Board and supports its
mandate: to coordinate at the international level the work of national financial
authorities and international standard-setting bodies in order to develop and
promote the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory and other
financial sector policies.
The BIS research and statistics function addresses the needs of monetary
and supervisory authorities for data and policy insight.
The BIS banking function provides prime counterparty, agent and trustee
services appropriate to the BIS mission.

The meetings programmes and the Basel Process
The BIS promotes international financial and monetary cooperation in two
major ways:
•
through hosting bimonthly and other meetings of central bank officials;
and
•
through the Basel Process, which facilitates cooperation of the committees
and standard-setting bodies hosted by the BIS in Basel.

Bimonthly meetings and other regular consultations
At bimonthly meetings, normally held in Basel, Governors and other senior
officials of BIS member central banks discuss current developments and the
outlook for the world economy and financial markets. They also exchange
views and experiences on issues of special and topical interest to central
banks. In addition to the bimonthly meetings, the Bank regularly hosts
gatherings that variously include public and private sector representatives and
the academic community.
The two principal bimonthly meetings are the Global Economy Meeting
and the All Governors’ Meeting.
Global Economy Meeting
The Global Economy Meeting (GEM) comprises the Governors from 30 BIS
member central banks in major advanced and emerging market economies
that account for about four fifths of global GDP. Governors from another 15
central banks attend the GEM as observers.1 The GEM has two main roles:
(i) monitoring and assessing developments, risks and opportunities in the
world economy and the global financial system; and (ii) providing guidance
to the Basel-based central bank committees, especially the main three – the
Committee on the Global Financial System, the Committee on Payment and
Settlement Systems and the Markets Committee. The GEM also receives
reports from the chairs of those committees and decides on publication.
As the Global Economy Meeting is quite large, it is supported by an
informal group called the Economic Consultative Committee (ECC). Limited to
18 participants, the ECC includes all BIS Board member Governors, the central
bank Governors from India and Brazil, and the BIS General Manager. The ECC
assembles proposals for consideration by the GEM. In addition, the ECC
Chairman initiates recommendations to the GEM on the appointment of chairs
of the main central bank committees and on the composition and organisation
of those committees.
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, has been elected by the BIS
Board as Chairman of both the GEM and the ECC.
All Governors’ Meeting
The All Governors’ Meeting comprises the Governors of all BIS member
central banks and is chaired by the BIS Chairman. It gathers during the
bimonthly meetings to discuss selected topics of general interest to its
members. In 2010/11, the topics discussed were:
•
strategies for exit from unconventional central bank balance sheet policies;
•
the reform proposals of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision;

1
The members of the GEM are the central bank Governors of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil,
Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia,
Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States and also the President of the
European Central Bank and the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Governors
attending as observers are from Algeria, Austria, Chile, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Portugal and Romania.

statistics needed for financial stability analysis;
managing inflation expectations following the financial crisis;
implications of the expansion of central bank balance sheets in Asia; and
the role of central banks in government debt markets since the beginning
of the financial crisis.
In agreement with the BIS Board and the GEM, the All Governors’ Meeting
guides the work of the Central Bank Governance Group, which also meets
during the bimonthly meetings, and the Irving Fisher Committee on Central
Bank Statistics. The All Governors’ Meeting is better suited than the GEM for
this responsibility because the membership of the two groups goes beyond
the participants in the GEM.
Other regular consultations

During the bimonthly meetings, Governors of central banks in (i) major
emerging markets and (ii) small open economies gather to discuss themes of
special relevance to their economies.
The Bank hosts regular meetings of the Group of Central Bank Governors
and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), which oversees the work of the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision. The GHOS met three times during the
year to consider the Basel III reform package being developed by the BCBS to
strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking
sector. At its meetings, the GHOS agreed on key design elements of the
package, on calibration of the capital and liquidity measures, and on the pace
of transition to the implementation phases of the plan.
The Bank regularly arranges informal discussions among public and private
sector representatives that focus on their shared interests in promoting a sound
and well functioning international financial system. In addition, the Bank
organises various other meetings for senior central bank officials on a regular
or ad hoc basis, to which other financial authorities, the private financial sector
and the academic community are invited to contribute. These meetings include:
•
the meetings of the working parties on domestic monetary policy, held in
Basel but also hosted at a regional level by a number of central banks in
Asia, central and eastern Europe, and Latin America;
•
the meeting of Deputy Governors of emerging market economies; and
•
the high-level meetings organised by the Financial Stability Institute in
various regions of the world for Deputy Governors and other senior-level
supervisors.

The Basel Process
The Basel Process refers to the facilitative role of the BIS in hosting and
supporting the work of the international secretariats engaged in standard
setting and the pursuit of financial stability. A key example of the Basel Process
is the support the BIS provides to the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which
coordinates the work of national financial authorities and international
standard-setting bodies and whose work programme has been endorsed by
the G20 heads of state and government. Another aspect of the Basel Process

BIS 81st Annual Report

103

is the mandate given by the BIS to its own Financial Stability Institute (FSI),
namely to assist financial sector supervisory authorities worldwide in
strengthening oversight of their financial systems.
Features of the Basel Process
The Basel Process is based on four key features: (i) the synergies of co-location;
(ii) flexibility and openness in the exchange of information; (iii) support from
the economic research expertise and banking experience of the BIS; and
(iv) the dissemination of work.
Synergies. The BIS hosts the secretariats of nine groups, including the FSB,
that contribute to the pursuit of financial stability. The agendas of the following
six are set by the global community of central banks and/or supervisory
authorities:
•
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS): addresses
supervision at the level of individual institutions and its relation to
macroprudential supervision;
•
the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS): monitors and
analyses macrofinancial stability issues;
•
the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS): analyses
and sets standards for the payment, clearing and settlement infrastructure;
•
the Markets Committee: examines the functioning of financial markets;
•
the Central Bank Governance Group: examines issues related to the
design and operation of central banks; and
•
the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC): addresses
statistical issues of concern to central banks, including those relating to
economic, monetary and financial stability.
The remaining three groups hosted at the BIS have separate governance
and reporting lines:
•
the FSB;
•
the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI); and
•
the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS).
The physical proximity of these groups at the BIS creates synergies that,
regardless of the variation in governance arrangements, produce a broad and
fruitful exchange of ideas.
Flexibility. The limited size of these groups leads to flexibility and openness in
the exchange of information, thereby enhancing the coordination of their work
on financial stability issues and avoiding overlaps and gaps in their work
programmes. At the same time, their output is much larger than their limited
size would suggest, as they are able to leverage the expertise of the international
community of central bankers, financial regulators and supervisors, and other
international and national public authorities.
Supportive BIS expertise and experience. The work of the Basel-based
committees is informed by the BIS’s economic research and banking experience.
The latter is derived from the BIS Banking Department’s working relationships

104

with market participants and its implementation of regulatory standards and
financial controls for the conduct of its banking operations.
Dissemination. Dissemination of the standard-setting bodies’ work to official
organisations is facilitated by the FSI.

Activities of BIS-hosted groups in 2010/11
The following pages review the year’s principal activities of the nine groups
hosted at the BIS.

Financial Stability Board
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) coordinates the work of national financial
authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops policies to
enhance global financial stability. It closely monitors whether implementation
of these policies takes place in a full and consistent manner.2
More specifically, under its mandate from the G20, the FSB:
•
assesses vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system and identifies
and reviews the regulatory, supervisory and related actions needed to
address them, including the outcomes of those actions;
•
promotes coordination and information exchange among authorities
responsible for financial stability;
•
monitors and advises on market developments and their implications for
regulatory policy;
•
monitors and advises on best practice in meeting regulatory standards;
•
undertakes joint strategic reviews of the international standard-setting
bodies to ensure that their policy development work is timely, coordinated
and focused on priorities, and that it addresses gaps;
•
sets guidelines for and supports the establishment of supervisory colleges;
•
supports contingency planning for cross-border crisis management,
particularly with respect to systemically important firms; and
•
collaborates with the IMF to conduct early warning exercises.
The membership of the FSB consists of senior officials from finance
ministries, central banks and financial regulators and supervisors of 24 countries
and territories (the country members of the G20 plus Hong Kong SAR, the
Netherlands, Singapore, Spain and Switzerland) as well as from the ECB and
the European Commission. It also includes representatives of international
financial institutions and of international standard-setting and central bank
bodies.3 The FSB is chaired by Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy.

2
The FSB was established by the G20 Leaders (heads of state and government) at their April 2009
London Summit. The G20 comprises 19 countries and the European Union. The charter setting out the
objectives, mandate, membership and organisational processes of the FSB took effect in September 2009,
when it was endorsed by the G20 Leaders at their Pittsburgh Summit.

The international financial institutions are the BIS, the IMF, the OECD and the World Bank. The international
standard-setting and central bank bodies are the BCBS, the CGFS, the CPSS, the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB), the IAIS and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).

•
a Standing Committee on Standards Implementation, chaired by Tiff
Macklem, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada.
Through work at the plenary meetings in June, September and October 2010,
the FSB and its members further developed the international regulatory reform
programme aimed at creating a sounder financial system and reducing systemic
risk globally. Two central elements of that programme were endorsed by the Seoul
Summit of the G20 in November 2010: (i) a strengthened global framework for
bank capital and liquidity; and (ii) a comprehensive policy framework to address
the moral hazard associated with institutions that are too big or too complex to
fail. In addition, during the past year the FSB set out principles and timetables, and
monitored implementation, in a wide range of other areas, as detailed below.
Strengthening the global capital and liquidity framework for banks
The FSB and the Basel Committee, in collaboration with the BIS and the IMF,
jointly assessed the macroeconomic implications of the transition to the new
capital and liquidity reform proposals in Basel III. The resulting transitional
arrangements have been designed to ensure that the implementation does
not harm the economic recovery.
Reducing the moral hazard posed by systemically important financial
institutions (SIFIs)
In October 2010, the FSB adopted a policy framework as well as work processes
and timelines for addressing the systemic risks and moral hazard posed by
SIFIs.4 The framework comprises action in five areas:
•
improvements to resolution regimes to ensure that any financial institution
can be resolved without disruption to the financial system and without
taxpayer support;
•
a requirement that SIFIs and initially in particular G-SIFIs have additional
loss absorption capacity beyond the Basel III standards to reflect the
greater risks these institutions pose to the global financial system;
•
more intensive supervisory oversight for financial institutions that may
pose systemic risk;
•
stronger robustness standards for the core financial infrastructure to
reduce contagion risks from the failure of individual institutions; 5 and

A SIFI is a firm whose disorderly failure would cause significant disruption to the wider financial
system and to overall economic activity because of its size, complexity and systemic interconnectedness.
Global SIFIs (G-SIFIs) are SIFIs that are systemically important in a global context.

assessment, by an FSB Peer Review Council, of the effectiveness
and consistency of national policy measures for G-SIFIs, beginning by
end-2012.

In November 2011, the FSB will finalise a package of measures covering:
an identification methodology for G-SIFIs; the amounts of additional goingconcern and gone-concern loss absorbency that G-SIFIs will need and the
instruments by which that can be met; and improvements to resolution tools
and regimes. Draft proposals for these measures and their phase-in periods
will be issued for public comment.
Improving the OTC and commodity derivatives markets
In October 2010, the FSB published 21 recommendations for implementing – in
an internationally consistent and non-discriminatory way – the G20 commitments
for improving by end-2012 the functioning, transparency and oversight of the
over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market. The G20 commitments relate to
increased standardisation, central clearing, organised platform trading, and
reporting of all trades to trade repositories.
The FSB has planned a series of six-month reports – derived from a
survey of FSB members – on progress in reforming OTC derivatives markets.
The report scheduled for release in April 2011 found that major implementation
projects are under way in the largest OTC derivatives markets, and international
policy development is proceeding according to timetable. Nevertheless, the
FSB expressed concern that many jurisdictions may not meet the end-2012
deadline unless they take substantial, concrete steps towards implementation
immediately. It saw inconsistencies in approaches between jurisdictions
emerging in some areas. The FSB will continue to monitor developments to
check whether progress on implementation is on track and to identify any
further emerging inconsistencies that should be addressed.
At their Seoul Summit, the G20 Leaders called for a report from IOSCO
on the regulation, supervision and transparency of commodity derivatives
markets and the financial market for oil, and for the FSB to consider next
steps. IOSCO’s report, scheduled for April 2011, was to cover the work being
undertaken in the short term in these areas; consider a broadened mandate to
include other commodities, including agricultural and soft commodities; and
outline the medium- to longer-term work being considered. The FSB supports
those actions and in October 2011 will again consider next steps on the basis
of a further IOSCO report.
Strengthening the oversight and regulation of shadow banking
As the recent financial crisis has shown, the “shadow banking system” – credit
intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regulated banking
system – can be a source of systemic risk both directly and through its
interconnectedness with the regular banking system. Shadow banks can also
create opportunities for arbitrage that might undermine stricter bank regulation
and lead to a build-up of additional leverage and risks in the financial system
as a whole. The FSB is therefore developing recommendations to strengthen

BIS 81st Annual Report

107

the oversight and regulation of the shadow banking system. It scheduled the
release of a background note on its work for April 2011.
Reducing reliance on credit rating agencies (CRAs)
The use of CRA ratings in regulatory regimes for banks and other financial
institutions contributes to a mechanistic market reliance on ratings. Because
of such reliance, a downgrading by a CRA can push the rating of a securities
issuer below a threshold rating level and thereby create a “cliff effect” of
widespread disinvestment in the securities of that issuer, leading to sharp
price declines and further disinvestment. Such cliff effects amplify procyclicality
and can generate systemic disruptions. In October 2010, the FSB issued
principles for reducing the reliance of market participants on ratings from
CRAs and requested standard setters and regulators to consider next steps to
translate the principles into more specific policy actions. The principles are
applicable to central bank operations, the prudential supervision of banks,
internal limits and investment policies of investment managers, private sector
margin agreements, and disclosures by issuers of securities. The FSB is
monitoring progress on the translation of the principles into policy actions.
Developing macroprudential frameworks and tools
The financial crisis exposed gaps in the public policy toolkit for dealing with
systemic risk, and it has intensified the official sector’s interest in strengthening
the macroprudential aspect of current policy arrangements. The FSB, the IMF
and the BIS are working on a joint report, to be delivered at the November 2011
G20 Summit, outlining both international and national advances in the design
of macroprudential frameworks and tools. To survey experience, the three
organisations scheduled two meetings for 2011: a high-level conference to be
held in Washington in April and a roundtable to be held in Basel in June.
Addressing data gaps
The FSB is developing a template of metrics and procedures that would improve
consistency in the collection and sharing of data on the interconnectedness
and common exposures of SIFIs. The project is part of a broader exercise by
the IMF and the FSB, set out in their November 2009 report, The financial
crisis and information gaps, which proposed improvements to data collection
to better capture the build-up of risk in the financial sector.
Strengthening accounting standards
The FSB supports the development of a single set of high-quality global
accounting standards. To that end, it continues to encourage the IASB and
the United States’ Financial Accounting Standards Board to complete their
convergence project by the end of 2011.
Strengthening adherence to international standards
The FSB is fostering a “race to the top” by encouraging all jurisdictions to raise
their level of adherence to international financial standards. It has updated its
Compendium of Standards, including the 12 key standards that it designates

108

BIS 81st Annual Report

as deserving of priority implementation. FSB member jurisdictions will lead
by example by implementing the standards and disclosing their level of
adherence to them.
Under a programme of country and thematic peer reviews that began in
2010, FSB member jurisdictions are evaluating each other’s implementation
of internationally agreed standards and policies. The FSB has now completed
country peer reviews of Italy, Mexico and Spain and thematic peer reviews of
compensation practices, of mortgage underwriting and origination, and of
risk disclosures for structured credit products and other exposures. A country
peer review of Australia is under way, and reviews of Canada and Switzerland
will be launched in the second half of 2011. The FSB is conducting a second
review of the implementation of sound compensation practices and will
conduct a thematic review of deposit insurance systems during the second
half of 2011.
Using a network of national experts, the FSB is closely monitoring
implementation of its post-crisis policy recommendations to strengthen
financial stability. The FSB scheduled the release of detailed information on
national implementation for April 2011, and in November 2011 it will publish
updated information based on a further survey.
The FSB is also encouraging jurisdictions throughout the world to follow
international financial standards, including through an initiative to evaluate
jurisdictions’ adherence to standards for supervisory and regulatory
cooperation and information exchange. By November 2011, the FSB will
publish a list of all jurisdictions evaluated.
Advancing consumer finance protection
At the request of the G20, the FSB is collaborating with the OECD and other
international organisations in a study of options for advancing consumer
finance protection, including the development of common principles. A report
is scheduled for release by November 2011.
Financial stability in emerging market and developing economies
The FSB, the IMF and the World Bank are jointly writing a report to the G20
identifying and examining financial stability issues of particular relevance to
emerging market and developing economies. The report will include policy
recommendations that could be taken forward by national authorities and
international standard-setting bodies.
Regional consultative groups
To facilitate its interaction with a wider group of countries, the FSB is setting
up six regional consultative groups that will bring together the members of
the FSB and more than 60 jurisdictions outside the FSB’s membership. The
regional groups – covering the Americas; Asia; the Commonwealth of
Independent States; Europe; the Middle East and North Africa; and subSaharan Africa – will provide the opportunity to discuss vulnerabilities
affecting the regional and global financial systems and the financial stability
initiatives of the FSB and of the various jurisdictions. The first meetings will

BIS 81st Annual Report

109

take place in 2011. In addition, the FSB intends to conduct outreach as needed
concerning its policy initiatives with an even wider range of interested countries.
FSB capacity, resources and governance
The demands on the FSB have grown since its establishment in 2009. To help
the FSB keep pace with these demands, the G20 has asked it to make proposals
for strengthening its capacity, resources and governance. These will be reviewed
at the G20’s October 2011 meeting.

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision seeks to improve supervisory
understanding and the quality of banking supervision worldwide. It supports
supervisors by providing a forum for exchanging information on national
supervisory arrangements, improving the effectiveness of techniques for
supervising international banks, and setting minimum supervisory standards.
The Committee, which generally meets four times a year, consists of senior
representatives of bank supervisory authorities and central banks responsible
for banking supervision or financial stability issues in the Committee’s member
countries.6 The Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) is the
governing body of the Basel Committee and consists of central bank governors
and (non-central bank) heads of supervision from member countries. Nout
Wellink, President of the Netherlands Bank, is chairman of the Basel Committee.
On 16 December 2010, the Basel Committee published a set of global
standards to address both firm-specific risks and broader, systemic threats so
as to promote a more resilient banking sector. The framework, “Basel III”,
responded to the core of the global financial reform agenda and was endorsed
by the G20 Leaders at their 2010 Seoul Summit. Basel III, together with the
underlying Basel II framework and the reforms approved by the Committee in
July 2009,7 represents a major step in strengthening bank soundness and
financial stability.
Over the course of 2010, the Committee also released a number of
standards and proposals to enhance risk management and supervision in
concert with the higher standards in Basel III.
The Basel III framework
Basel III strengthens international prudential requirements for capital and
liquidity. It raises the minimum amount of capital that banks must hold against

Authority, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the Financial Stability Institute and the
International Monetary Fund.

risk-weighted assets and requires capital of greater loss-absorbing capacity.
Further, Basel III improves the risk coverage of the regulatory framework. It
also introduces an overall leverage ratio that will apply against unweighted
assets and off-balance sheet exposures to provide another check on excessive
credit expansion at the level of the firm. In addition, Basel III addresses the
liquidity aspect of the recent crisis by requiring a larger stock of liquid reserves
and a reduction in maturity mismatches.
The GHOS agreed on transitional arrangements for implementing the
new standards. These will help ensure that the banking sector can meet the
higher standards through reasonable amounts of earnings retention and new
capital without impairing lending activity.
Bank capital
Improving its quality. An essential element of Basel III is its stricter definition
of regulatory capital. Higher-quality capital means more loss-absorbing
capacity, which will allow banks to better withstand periods of stress. A key
aspect of the new capital definition is its greater focus on common equity, the
highest-quality component of a bank’s capital. Credit losses and writedowns
come directly out of retained earnings, which are part of a bank’s common
equity. The Basel III capital framework defines common equity more narrowly
than does the present rule. In a move that further extracts lower-quality capital
from required capital, the new rules require regulatory adjustments from the
capital base to be made against common equity rather than, as is done
currently, against the rest of Tier 1 or against Tier 2 capital.
During the financial crisis, taxpayers were exposed to loss when the
public sector injected capital into a number of large, internationally active
banks that were in distress. The extra funds rescued them from failure and
hence supported their depositors, but the infusion allowed investors in the
banks’ Tier 2 capital instruments (mainly subordinated debt) and in some
Tier 1 instruments to avoid loss. Therefore, the Basel III definition of capital
issued in December 2010 was supplemented by the GHOS in January 2011
with additional minimum requirements to ensure that, before taxpayers are
exposed to loss, all classes of bank capital fully absorb losses at the point
when the firm becomes non-viable.
Requiring higher amounts. The Basel III reforms increase the minimum
requirement of (now higher-quality) common equity from 2% to 4.5% of riskweighted assets. In addition, Basel III introduces a macroprudential overlay
requiring additional capital buffers (see below).
Expanding risk coverage of the framework. By itself, the new definition of
capital constitutes a significant improvement in the global capital regime. The
regime will be enhanced further by better risk coverage. The Basel III framework
introduces measures to strengthen capital requirements for counterparty credit
exposures arising from banks’ derivative, repo and securities financing activities.
The reforms will increase the capital required to back those exposures, reduce
procyclicality and provide additional incentives to move the trading of OTC

BIS 81st Annual Report

111

derivative contracts to central counterparties, thus helping reduce systemic risk
across the financial system. The reforms also provide incentives to strengthen
the risk management of counterparty credit exposures. In addition, as part of
its July 2009 reforms, the Committee adopted higher capital requirements for
trading and for derivative and securitisation activities, to become effective at
the end of 2011. The better risk coverage adopted in December 2010 reinforces
those requirements as well as the stronger definition of capital.
Introducing a leverage ratio. Basel III introduces a non-risk-based leverage
ratio to serve as a backstop to the risk-based capital requirement. The use of this
supplementary measure will help contain the build-up of excessive leverage
in the system. It will also serve as an additional safeguard against attempts to
“game” the risk-based requirements and will help address model risk.
Liquidity
Introducing global standards. Strong capital requirements are necessary to
the stability of the banking sector, but they are not sufficient. A strong liquidity
base reinforced through robust supervisory standards is of equal importance,
but until now no internationally harmonised liquidity standards have been
adopted. Basel III introduces two such supervisory standards – a liquidity
coverage ratio (LCR) and a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) – whose purpose is
to improve banks’ liquidity risk management and risk profile. The LCR is
designed to make banks more resilient to short-term disruptions in their
access to funding, while the NSFR addresses longer-term structural liquidity
mismatches in bank balance sheets.
The new liquidity framework includes a common set of monitoring
metrics to assist supervisors in identifying and analysing liquidity risk at both
the bank and system level. The metrics should be considered as the minimum
information that supervisors should use in monitoring liquidity risk profiles.
Macroprudential framework
Introducing capital buffers. A macroprudential element of the Basel III capital
framework is the requirement that, in good times, banks should build up
buffers – specifically, a capital conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer
– that can be drawn down in periods of stress. This approach promotes the
goal of mitigating procyclicality both in banking and in the broader financial
system. These buffers are in addition to the minimum capital requirements.
Losses that begin to reduce a bank’s capital conservation buffer, set
initially at 2.5% of common equity, would trigger constraints on its ability
to make discretionary distributions of capital. The constraints become
progressively tighter as the bank’s capital level moves closer to the minimum
requirement.
The countercyclical buffer, to be maintained at 0–2.5% of common equity
or other fully loss-absorbing capital, is aimed at the broader macroprudential
goal of protecting the banking sector in periods of excess aggregate credit
growth; such periods have often been associated with the accumulation of
system-wide risk. In December 2010, the Committee issued Guidance for

112

BIS 81st Annual Report

national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer as a supplement
to the requirements set out in the Basel III rules text. In addition to providing
supervisory guidance, that document should help banks themselves understand
and anticipate buffer-related decisions in jurisdictions to which they have
credit exposures.
Addressing systemically important institutions. During the crisis, when
procyclicality amplified shocks over time, excessive interconnectedness among
systemically important banks transmitted shocks across the financial system
and wider economy. To address the latter issue, the Basel Committee and the
FSB are developing an integrated approach to systemically important financial
institutions, which could include combinations of capital surcharges, contingent
capital and bail-in debt. As part of this effort, the Committee developed a
proposal on a provisional methodology to assess the systemic importance of
financial institutions at the global level. The framework to address systemically
important institutions will be finalised over the course of 2011.
Calibrating Basel III standards and assessing the impact
In developing Basel III, the Committee engaged in a four-month public
consultation on the proposed reform measures. As an important input to the
calibration of the new capital and liquidity standards, the Committee conducted
a comprehensive quantitative study to estimate the effects of the requirements
on individual banks, the results of which were published in December 2010. It
complemented this “bottom up” approach with an empirical assessment of
the overall level of capital that should be maintained within the banking
system (Calibrating regulatory minimum capital requirements and capital
buffers: a top-down approach). The top-down assessment, published in
October 2010, helped inform the calibration of the common equity and Tier 1
risk-based ratios and the Tier 1 leverage ratio, as well as of the regulatory
buffers above the minimum.
The Committee also conducted an assessment of the long-term economic
impact of the reforms and estimated the costs associated with transitioning
to higher capital and liquidity requirements. Its August 2010 report on that
work (An assessment of the long-term economic impact of stronger capital
and liquidity requirements) found clear net long-term economic benefits to
higher regulatory standards: the higher standards raise the safety and
soundness of the global banking system, which in turn reduces both the
probability of financial crises and the output losses associated with such
crises. And those benefits substantially exceed the potential output costs for
a range of higher capital and liquidity requirements. In addition, the
Committee and the FSB established the Macroeconomic Assessment Group
(MAG), an international team of researchers tasked with studying the
macroeconomic impact of the transition to the higher standards. The MAG
study is summarised in its December 2010 Final report: assessing the
macroeconomic impact of the transition to stronger capital and liquidity
requirements. It concludes that the transition is likely to have only a modest
impact on aggregate output.

Risk management and supervision
The stronger capital and liquidity standards in Basel III must be accompanied
by better risk management and supervision, particularly given the
international environment of fast-paced financial innovation. In 2010, the
Basel Committee issued standards and proposals and continued studies to
meet that need.
Improving cross-border bank resolution. In March 2010, the Basel Committee
issued 10 recommendations on effective cross-border resolution. The
Committee continues to work on the topic with the FSB, including monitoring
how the Committee’s recommendations are being implemented and where
additional work is needed to address conflicts across resolution regimes.
The Committee is conducting a comprehensive analysis and will review the
results in the first half of 2011. They will be used by the FSB and other
standard setters to formulate standards and guidance that countries can use
to reform their national resolution regimes and make them more consistent
with each other.
Addressing operational risk. The regulatory capital adequacy framework
envisages a gradual convergence of the operational risk discipline towards a
narrower band of effective risk management and measurement practices. In
December 2010, the Committee issued two consultative documents on
operational risk. Sound practices for the management and supervision of
operational risk updates the Committee’s 2003 guidance on the basis of current
industry best practice and supervisory experience in three areas: governance,
risk management and disclosure. The second consultative document,
Operational risk – supervisory guidelines for the advanced measurement
approaches, covers governance, data and modelling. Also dealing with
advanced measurement is the Committee’s October 2010 publication,
Recognising the risk-mitigating impact of insurance in operational risk
modelling, which also more broadly discusses the potential benefits and
shortcomings of insurance to mitigate operational risk.
Aligning remuneration and risk. The Committee’s October 2010 consultative
report Range of methodologies for risk and performance alignment of
remuneration analyses methods for incorporating risk and performance in
compensation schemes, including bonus pools, with the aim of furthering the
practice. The report notes practical and technical issues that complicate the
alignment effort and offers some clarifications on design options. The
Committee’s December 2010 consultative document Pillar 3 disclosure
requirements for remuneration, developed in consultation with the FSB, is
aimed at promoting consistency of disclosure. Such consistency would support
market discipline by helping market participants better assess the quality of
bank compensation practices.
Strengthening backtesting. Banks that are permitted to calculate their
regulatory capital with internal models are required to frequently validate their

114

BIS 81st Annual Report

models, and backtesting is integral to the process. In its December 2010
guidance Sound practices for backtesting counterparty credit risk models, the
Committee addresses weaknesses in backtesting that were revealed by the
financial crisis.
Improving supervisory colleges. The financial crisis highlighted the importance
of improving supervisory colleges to better support the effective supervision
of international banking groups. On the basis of the crisis experience, the
Committee issued a set of principles that aim to promote and strengthen
the colleges. The paper Good practice principles on supervisory colleges
supplements broader guidance issued by the Basel Committee on crossborder cooperation and information-sharing. The principles are designed to
provide the flexibility needed to implement the guidance for a wide range of
banks across jurisdictions.
Enhancing corporate governance. Drawing on the lessons of the crisis, and
following a public consultation, the Committee in October 2010 updated and
reinforced its guidance on corporate governance, last issued in 2006. The new
document, Principles for enhancing corporate governance, sets out revised
statements of best practice in key areas and urges regular supervisory
evaluation of banks’ corporate governance practices and their consistency
with the Committee’s principles.
Addressing microfinance. In August 2010, the Basel Committee issued the
final version of its paper Microfinance activities and the Core Principles
for Effective Banking Supervision, which provides guidance on the range
of practices employed in the regulation and supervision of microfinance
activities.
Assessing the impact on trade finance. As announced in December 2010, the
Committee is assessing the specific impact of the regulatory regime on the
capital treatment of trade finance, particularly in low-income countries.
Accounting and transparency
The Committee analyses and submits written comments on all consultative
drafts issued by standard setters on international accounting and auditing
issues relevant to banks and supervisors. During the year, the Committee
developed a concrete proposal to make operational an expected loss approach
to provisioning as an input to the IASB’s reform efforts in that area.
More broadly, the Committee is promoting the development of a single set
of high-quality global accounting standards, and towards that end it supports
the convergence of accounting standards of the IASB and those established in
the United States by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. In response to
the financial crisis, the two boards have created accounting projects on several
topics, including financial instruments and fair value measurements, to which
the Committee has contributed.

Committee on the Global Financial System
The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) monitors financial market
developments and analyses their implications for financial stability. The chair
of the CGFS is Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, who succeeded
Donald L Kohn, then Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, on 1 July 2010. Committee members consist of the Deputy
Governors and other senior officials from the central banks of 23 advanced
and emerging market economies and the Economic Adviser of the BIS.
Assessment of the recent sovereign debt problems in the euro area and their
effects on financial stability and bank funding shaped much of the Committee’s
discussions. Committee members also examined the global implications of
monetary stimulus programmes in the major advanced economies, particularly
their effects on portfolio flows to emerging market economies.
To deepen its understanding of current policy issues, the Committee
organised a number events bringing together representatives of financial
institutions and central banks:
•
meetings with market participants on the outlook for investments in bank
debt given the prospective phasing-out of public sector support for banks
and the proposed changes in bank regulation;
•
a workshop for central banks, hosted by the People’s Bank of China, to
assess the implications of capital flows for financial stability and the role of
monetary policy and exchange rates in dealing with capital flow pressures;
and
•
discussions with representatives from insurance firms and pension funds
on the new international accounting standards and ongoing regulatory
initiatives as they might affect their demand for fixed income assets and
the functioning of financial markets generally.
The Committee established a study group on macroprudential polices to
address build-ups of systemic financial risk in the light of the recent crisis.
Other groups worked on international banking issues, including changes in
banks’ management of funding and liquidity in response to the crisis, and on
the implications of sovereign debt management for central bank operations
and monetary and financial stability.
The Committee participated in global policy forums to discuss the broader
implications of the recent financial reform agenda. These included a high-level
workshop it co-sponsored with IOSCO and the CPSS related to access to
central counterparties (CCPs) in OTC derivatives markets; another such forum
was a joint workshop with the CPSS and the Markets Committee examining
the issue of liquidity for CCPs. The CGFS also further developed its plans to
close gaps in statistical data, focusing particularly on enhancements to the BIS
international banking statistics.
CGFS: www.bis.org/cgfs

Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems
The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) contributes to the
strengthening of financial market infrastructure by promoting safe and efficient

116

BIS 81st Annual Report

payment, clearing and settlement arrangements. The Committee also facilitates
cooperation among non-CPSS central banks on payment, clearing and settlement
issues and provides support and expertise to meetings it organises in cooperation
with regional central banks. The CPSS is chaired by William C Dudley, President
and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Review of standards
In March 2011, the CPSS and IOSCO jointly released a consultative report,
Principles for financial market infrastructures. The document proposes new
international standards to govern systemically important financial market
infrastructures (FMIs) – payment systems, central securities depositories,
securities settlement systems, CCPs and trade repositories. The proposals
reflect the lessons learned from the recent financial crisis as well as the experience
gained from applying the existing standards during the past decade.
When finalised, the new principles will replace the three existing sets of
CPSS and CPSS-IOSCO standards, namely the Core principles for systemically
important payment systems (2001); the Recommendations for securities
settlement systems (2001); and the Recommendations for central counterparties
(2004). The CPSS and IOSCO believe that a single set of principles will provide
greater consistency in the oversight and regulation of FMIs worldwide.
Compared with the existing standards, the new principles introduce more
demanding requirements. Perhaps the most crucial of those concern the
financial resources and risk management procedures through which an FMI
copes with the default of a participant; the mitigation of operational risk; and
the links and other interdependencies among FMIs through which operational
and financial risks can spread. Moreover, the new principles address issues
that are not covered by the existing standards, for example segregation and
portability, tiered participation and general business risk.
The consultation period ends on 29 July 2011, and the CPSS and IOSCO
will publish a final report in early 2012.
Market structure in the clearing industry
A November 2010 CPSS report, Market structure developments in the clearing
industry: implications for financial stability, assesses how far recent developments
have given rise to new risks and outlines practical issues that regulators and
overseers may wish to consider, either as part of their oversight role or in the
context of their broader financial stability mandate. The report also examines
two other topics: whether changes in market structure or ownership might
affect the expansion of central clearing services, and the effect of ownership
on CCPs’ incentives to manage counterparty risk.
Clearing and settling repos
During the recent financial crisis, some markets for repurchase agreements
(repos) proved to be less reliable than expected as a source of funding liquidity.
In September 2010, the Committee published the report Strengthening repo
clearing and settlement arrangements. Based on a survey of selected CPSS
member countries, it identifies issues concerning clearing and settlement

BIS 81st Annual Report

117

arrangements for repos that could undermine the resilience of repo markets
and outlines ways in which these issues can be addressed.
Other activities
In January 2011, the Committee co-sponsored with IOSCO and the CGFS a
high-level workshop to discuss issues related to access to CCPs in OTC
derivatives markets. In March 2011, it held a joint workshop with the CGFS
and the Markets Committee to take stock of issues related to the liquidity
needs of CCPs.
CPSS: www.bis.org/cpss

Markets Committee
The Markets Committee, chaired by Hiroshi Nakaso, Assistant Governor of
the Bank of Japan, is a forum for senior central bank officials to jointly
monitor developments in financial markets and assess their implications for
central bank liquidity management operations. Currently, 21 central banks are
represented on the Committee.
Turmoil in sovereign debt markets, the continued use of unconventional
policies and ongoing financial sector reforms provided the backdrop for the
Committee’s discussions. The Committee closely followed developments in
the euro area government bond markets and banking sector and examined
their impact on funding markets and central bank operations. It also considered
related technical issues such as the current practice of using credit support
annexes in derivative transactions between public and private sector entities.
Renewed market turmoil and slower than expected economic recovery in
2010 held back the exit of major central banks from unconventional policies
and prompted additional actions in some cases. The effects of such policies
on the targeted markets and on the risk-taking behaviour of investors across
asset classes constituted another key theme in the Committee’s deliberations.
The Committee paid increasing attention to the financial market
implications of post-crisis reform initiatives that were approaching or entering
the implementation stage. These included the introduction of new liquidity
standards in the Basel III framework and the push towards greater use of
CCPs. The Committee held a joint workshop with the CGFS and the CPSS in
March 2011 to take stock of issues related to the liquidity needs of CCPs.
In March 2011, the Markets Committee set up a small group of central
bank experts to conduct a fact-finding study on high-frequency trading in
foreign exchange markets. Its purpose is to inform, among other things, the
interpretation of the results of the April 2010 BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey
of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity.

Central Bank Governance
The Central Bank Governance Group, comprising representatives from nine
central banks and chaired by Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel,

118

BIS 81st Annual Report

serves as a venue for the exchange of views on the design and operation of
central banks as public policy institutions. In addition, it prioritises work on
this topic which is then carried out through the BIS and the Central Bank
Governance Network, consisting of more than 50 central banks. During the
past year, the Governance Group examined the implications of central banks’
changing financial stability responsibilities and initiated work on the financial
strength that central banks need in order to be effective in the post-crisis world.

Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics
The Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC) provides a forum
for central bank economists and statisticians to address statistical topics
related to monetary and financial stability. Seventy-two central banks and
relevant international and regional organisations are members of the
Committee, which is chaired by Manuel Marfán, Deputy Governor of the
Central Bank of Chile. The Committee’s fifth conference at the BIS convened
in August to review work to resolve data gaps revealed by the financial crisis.
Attendees also discussed the findings of a survey of the Committee’s
membership on data initiatives related to financial stability.
The IFC organised workshops on:
•
the use of business surveys by central banks (with the National Bank of
Ukraine);
•
data requirements for monitoring derivatives market activity (with the
People’s Bank of China);
•
inflation measurement (one with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency
and one with the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies and the
Central Bank of Peru); and
•
residency versus nationality views of financial positions (with the InterAgency Group on Economic and Financial Statistics).
It also organised two training events, one on national accounts (with the
National Bank of Belgium) and one on statistical challenges for the European
System of Central Banks (with the ECB). In November, the IFC presented its
first annual report to the BIS All Governors’ Meeting.

International Association of Deposit Insurers
The International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) provides a forum for
deposit insurers, central banks and international organisations to enhance the
effectiveness of deposit insurance and bank resolution systems and cooperate
on related financial stability issues. Currently, 82 organisations, including 63
deposit insurers, are IADI members or participants. IADI draws upon its
membership to provide guidance on the establishment or enhancement of
effective deposit insurance systems as well as on training, outreach, educational
programmes and research.
In June 2009, IADI together with the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision issued the final version of Core principles for effective deposit

BIS 81st Annual Report

119

insurance systems. The principles are designed to guide jurisdictions in
strengthening existing systems as well as in creating deposit insurance
systems where they do not currently exist. During 2010, a methodology for
assessing compliance with the core principles was developed jointly by IADI,
the BCBS, the IMF, the World Bank, the European Forum of Deposit Insurers
(EFDI) and the European Commission. The FSB has included the core principles
in its Compendium of standards and in 2011 will include them in its list of
“key standards for sound financial systems”. Efforts are under way for the
core principles and the associated assessment methodology to be included in
the IMF and World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and for
the FSB and the G20 to use them in their peer review programme to assess
and improve national deposit insurance systems.
IADI’s Training and Conference Committee developed a comprehensive
training programme on a wide variety of topics critical to effective practice for
deposit insurers. IADI strengthened its partnerships with the FSI, EFDI and the
South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN) Research and Training Centre to
deliver these training programmes. IADI and the FSI jointly developed five
deposit insurance e-learning tutorials and modules to present to all FSI
Connect subscribers, including IADI members.
IADI held its Ninth Annual General Meeting and Conference in Tokyo on
26–28 October 2010. More than 240 participants from over 50 countries attended
the conference, entitled “Financial safety-nets: Going forward”. In addition,
IADI’s seven regional committees and 12 partner organisations brought together
professionals throughout the year for specialised and region-focused events
such as “Bank insolvency in the Caribbean: Law and best practice”; a seminar
on “Resolution of problem banks” and another on “Claims management:
Reimbursement to insured depositors”; a Latin American seminar, “The role of
banks in economic stability and growth”; a regional conference, “The benefits
of deposit insurance in Africa”; and an Asia-Pacific conference, “Lessons
learned and challenges of the deposit insurers in dealing with crisis”.
IADI’s Research and Guidance Committee (RGC) established a Financial
Inclusion and Innovation Subcommittee to focus on deposit insurance issues
related to financial inclusion and to formally engage on the topic with interested
entities such as the G20 Financial Inclusion Experts Group (FIEG). In February
2011, the subcommittee held a Financial Inclusion Workshop at the BIS for
IADI members in cooperation with the World Bank Consultative Group to
Assist the Poor (CGAP) and the Basel Committee.

International Association of Insurance Supervisors
The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is the international
standard-setting body for prudential supervision of the insurance industry.
The mission of the IAIS is to promote effective and globally consistent
regulation and supervision of the insurance industry in order to develop and
maintain fair, safe and stable insurance markets for the benefit of policyholders;
and to contribute to global financial stability.

120

BIS 81st Annual Report

The IAIS is actively involved in assessing the regulatory reforms
recommended by the FSB. An important issue that the IAIS Financial Stability
Committee is considering is the indicators that should be used in assessing
the systemic importance of insurers. The committee is also considering
macroprudential tools and developing proposals on macroprudential surveillance.
Insurance core principles
In February 2011, the IAIS concluded a two-year review of its supervisory
material with the release of a comprehensive draft revision for a 60-day
consultation period. The draft incorporates lessons of the financial crisis,
addresses FSB recommendations and reflects the evolution of supervisory
and industry practices. It organises the supervisory material into a hierarchy
with insurance core principles (ICPs) at the top, standards for implementation
of the ICPs at the next level and guidance third. The IAIS plans to submit a
final draft for adoption at its general meeting on 1 October 2011.
Accounting
The IAIS has a strong interest in ensuring high-quality financial reporting that
offers a meaningful, economically sound portrayal of insurers’ financial health.
It closely monitors the international financial reporting developments that
will most influence the overall accounting model for regulated insurance
enterprises. In July 2010, the IASB released a consultative draft regarding
insurance contracts. The IAIS provided extensive comments and continues to
provide input to the IASB on the matter.
Group-wide supervision
Responding to recommendations by the G20, the FSB and the Joint Forum,8
the IAIS adopted a Guidance paper on treatment of non-regulated entities in
group-wide supervision in April 2010 to address key regulatory gaps observed
from the crisis and to minimise opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. The
paper calls for appropriate consideration of the complexity of group structures
and the full spectrum of risks posed by non-regulated entities through
measures such as capital adequacy and governance requirements.
Internationally active insurance groups
The IAIS is developing the Common Framework for the Supervision of
Internationally Active Insurance Groups (ComFrame), a multilateral framework
reaching beyond the regulatory approaches of individual jurisdictions and
regions. ComFrame should lead to more consistency regarding each jurisdiction’s
supervision of internationally active insurance groups. The IAIS plans to
conclude its development of ComFrame by mid-2013, after which it will
undertake an impact assessment.

8
The Joint Forum was established in 1996 under the aegis of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, IOSCO and the IAIS to deal with issues common to the banking, securities and insurance
sectors, including the regulation of financial conglomerates. Membership consists of senior supervisors
from the three sectors (www.bis.org/bcbs/jointforum.htm).

BIS 81st Annual Report

121

Reinsurance
Global reinsurers – firms that, for a fee or premium, agree to indemnify an
insurer against losses on one or more contracts – are important for the efficient
functioning of sound insurance markets. Reinsurance bolsters the ultimate
security of ceding insurers, thereby protecting customers and contributing to
overall financial stability.
The December 2010 issue of the IAIS’s twice-yearly Global reinsurance
market report showed that reinsurers were profitable in 2009, benefiting from
sound management of asset portfolios and diversification of insurance risks
as well as from a moderate year for claims arising from catastrophes. The
August 2010 mid-year edition discussed macroprudential surveillance in
insurance and reinsurance.
Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding
The IAIS Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMoU), which became
operational in June 2009, is a framework for cooperation and exchange of
information with an overall goal of improving the effectiveness of cross-border
supervision of insurance companies. It is also expected to contribute to the
global efforts to enhance the regulation of systemically important financial
institutions. Participation in the MMoU has grown to 14 signatories as of
February 2011, and another 23 applications are being validated.
Standards observance
In October 2010, the IAIS established a Standards Observance Subcommittee
to support the implementation of standards through the development of selfassessment and peer review mechanisms. The subcommittee will coordinate
closely with the FSB to ensure the fulfilment of FSB recommendations for the
insurance industry.
In addition, and more broadly, the IAIS organises regional seminars and
workshops to assist insurance supervisors in implementing its principles,
standards and guidance material in collaboration with the FSI, national
insurance supervisory authorities and other bodies.
IAIS: www.iaisweb.org

Financial Stability Institute
The Financial Stability Institute (FSI) supports global financial stability by
disseminating supervisory standards and sound practices and assisting in
their implementation.
High-level meetings, seminars and conferences
The FSI conducts a well established series of high-level meetings, seminars
and conferences. The 47 events held in 2010 for banking and insurance
supervisors, many conducted in partnership with regional groups of
supervisors, focused on current regulatory reforms and drew more than 1,700
participants. In particular, the FSI’s meetings for Deputy Governors of central
banks and heads of supervisory authorities took place this year in Africa, Latin

122

BIS 81st Annual Report

America, the Middle East and, in partnership with the IMF, in Washington for
a global audience. These meetings addressed the ongoing development of
supervisory reforms in response to the financial crisis as well as the
implementation of existing standards.
FSI Connect
FSI Connect is an online information resource and learning tool provided by
the FSI for financial sector supervisors at all levels of experience and expertise.
Through FSI Connect, close to 8,500 users at more than 225 subscribing institutions
have access to more than 200 tutorials on banking, insurance, deposit insurance,
and payment and settlement systems. The FSI is revising the tutorials related
to bank capital to ensure that they are consistent with the regulatory developments
contained in Basel III. In addition, the FSI is continuing to expand FSI Connect’s
coverage of insurance risks and related supervisory issues and techniques.
Other major initiatives
In 2010, the FSI finalised its latest survey on Basel II implementation around
the world. In addition, it awarded its fifth biennial FSI Award for research on
an issue of importance to the global supervisory community.

Research and statistics
The BIS carries out research and analysis on issues of interest to central banks
and, increasingly, financial supervisory authorities. Most of this work appears
in the Bank’s regular outlets, such as the Annual Report, the Quarterly Review
and the BIS Papers and Working Papers series, as well as in external
professional publications and on the Bank’s website (www.bis.org). In addition,
the research function develops background material for meetings of senior
central bankers and provides secretariat and analytical services to the various
groups hosted by the BIS in Basel. It also collects, analyses and disseminates
statistical information for central banks and the general public on key elements
of the international financial system.
The FSB and the IMF have made recommendations to the G20 regarding
data gaps and the financial crisis. Those recommendations, a number of them
involving the BIS and some of the Basel-based committees, were endorsed by
the G20 in November 2009, and progress and plans for completion were
reported back to the G20 by the FSB and the IMF in May 2010.

Research focus
In line with the Bank’s mission, the focus of BIS research is on monetary and
financial stability. As in the previous year, a principal theme of the work was
the policy implications of the global financial crisis. A major strand of this
analysis addressed the implications of the crisis for bank regulation and
supervision and economic activity. The analysis explored the short-term and
long-term implications of Basel III for the real economy as well as the design
of the macroprudential overlay of the new standards, including the identification

BIS 81st Annual Report

123

of systemically important banks and options for countercyclical capital
schemes. This work was largely carried out in support of the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision, but some of the more technical analyses were also
released in the BIS Working Papers series.
A second strand of the crisis-related work explored possible improvements
in financial statistics that could strengthen the monitoring of systemic risks.
Several studies examined how the BIS international banking statistics could
help in this context and provided the basis for data collection exercises
under the aegis of the CGFS. The release of the 2010 Triennial Central Bank
Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity supported
several studies that examined major structural changes in these markets.
A third strand assessed the implications of the financial crisis for the
functioning of the financial system, post-crisis macroeconomic trends and
monetary policy. Work analysed the behaviour of markets under stress, notably
the foreign exchange swap market; the provision of central bank liquidity
assistance to markets and institutions; the need for balance sheet and operational
restructuring in the financial industry; the deleveraging of private sector balance
sheets; and changes in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.
The BIS research function annually organises a number of conferences
and workshops in which participation bridges the worlds of policy, research
and business. The leading event, the BIS Annual Conference, brings together
senior policymakers, leading academics and market participants. In June 2010,
the Ninth BIS Annual Conference addressed the future of central bank
governance under post-crisis mandates.

International statistical initiatives
This year, the few remaining BIS member central banks that had not been
supplying national data to the BIS Data Bank started to report key
macroeconomic statistics on a regular basis. The coverage of the Data Bank
continued to expand in areas related to financial stability, including debt
issuance by major sectors of the economy and financial positions of non-bank
financial institutions. With the approval of the respective central banks, data
on residential property prices are posted on the BIS public website.
In June 2010, additional data were reported by central banks from major
financial centres to the semiannual collection of statistics on OTC derivatives,
including on transactions cleared with central counterparties. Some additional
centres will start contributing to this data collection, for which much more
detail will become available at the end of the year. More than 50 central banks
participated in the 2010 Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and
Derivatives Market Activity; a special effort was made to improve the timeliness
of the publication of the data. In May 2011, the BIS was scheduled to release
a new online database on its website to better disseminate its international
banking statistics.
The Inter-Agency Group on Economic and Financial Statistics, which
consists of the BIS, the ECB, Eurostat, the IMF, the OECD, the United Nations
and the World Bank, has been tasked to follow up on a number of the

124

BIS 81st Annual Report

recommendations made by the FSB and the IMF – and endorsed by the G20
in November 2009 – regarding data gaps revealed by the financial crisis.
In May 2010, the Working Group on Securities Databases, which consists
of the BIS, the ECB and the IMF, released the second part of a Handbook on
Securities Statistics, which covers holdings of debt securities.
The BIS is represented in a number of other international committees
focused on statistics. All these groups worked during the year to address the
information gaps revealed by the financial turmoil. Together with the IMF, the
OECD and the World Bank, the BIS maintains the Joint External Debt Hub,
which consolidates information on external debt from creditor and debtor
sources. The BIS co-sponsors the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange
(SDMX) programme, which produces and maintains technical standards and
content-oriented guidelines for the dissemination of statistical information.
The BIS, other international organisations and various central banks are using
SDMX to provide their statistics on their websites in standardised electronic
formats and to efficiently exchange data bilaterally.

Other central bank initiatives to which the BIS lends support
The BIS contributes to the activities of regional central bank groupings by
providing speakers with relevant expertise for their meetings. During the past
year, such speakers, including those from the secretariats of the Basel-based
groups and the BIS Representative Offices, contributed to events organised by:
•
the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies (inflation measurement,
monetary policy, payment systems, reserve management);
•
the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN) Research and Training
Centre (payment systems, risk management, macroeconomic and monetary
policy management, central bank communication strategy, asset price
inflation, financial markets, reserve management);
•
the Southern African Development Community central banks (capital flows);
•
the Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute of Eastern and
Southern Africa (financial market development, payment systems,
portfolio management); and
•
the Centre Africain d’Études Supérieures en Gestion (Masters in Banking
and Finance programme).
BIS experts also contributed to events organised by:
•
the Deutsche Bundesbank;
•
the Bank of France’s International Banking and Finance Institute;
•
the Bank of England’s Centre for Central Banking Studies; and
the Bank of Japan.
•

Financial services of the Bank
The BIS offers a wide range of financial services tailored specifically to assist
central banks and other official monetary authorities in the management of
their foreign reserves. Some 140 such institutions, as well as a number of
international organisations, make active use of these services.

BIS 81st Annual Report

125

Safety and liquidity are the key features of the BIS’s credit intermediation
services, which are supported by a rigorous internal risk management
framework. In accordance with best practice, a separate risk control unit
reporting directly to the Deputy General Manager monitors the Bank’s credit,
liquidity and market risks. Similarly, a compliance and operational risk unit
controls the Bank’s operational risks.

Scope of services
In response to the diverse – and constantly evolving – needs of central banks, the
BIS offers an extensive array of investment possibilities in terms of currency
denomination, maturity and liquidity. In addition to traditional money market
placements such as sight/notice accounts and fixed-term deposits, the Bank offers
tradable instruments (Fixed-Rate Investments at the BIS – FIXBIS, and MediumTerm Instruments – MTIs), in maturities ranging from one week to five years, and
structured products with embedded optionality. The BIS also provides short-term
liquidity facilities and extends credit to central banks, usually on a collateralised
basis. The Bank also acts as trustee and collateral agent (see below).
The Bank transacts foreign exchange and gold on behalf of its customers,
providing access to a large liquidity base in the context of, for example, regular
rebalancing of reserve portfolios or major changes in reserve currency
allocation. The foreign exchange services of the Bank encompass spot
transactions in major currencies and Special Drawing Rights (SDR), as well as
swaps, outright forwards, options and dual currency deposits (DCDs). In
addition, the Bank provides gold services such as sight accounts, fixed-term
deposits, earmarked accounts, upgrading and refining, and location exchanges.
The BIS provides asset management services in sovereign securities and
high-grade credit fixed income instruments. These may take the form of either
a dedicated portfolio mandate negotiated between the BIS and a customer or
an open-end fund structure – the BIS Investment Pool (BISIP) – allowing
customers to invest in a common pool of assets. Both investment structures
are offered as either single currency or multicurrency mandates in the world’s
major reserve currencies: the US dollar, euro, sterling and yen. For
multicurrency mandates, the investor can choose from portfolios that are
either hedged back into the base currency or left unhedged.
Dedicated mandates are designed according to each customer’s
preferences with regard to investment guidelines and benchmarks. In contrast,
BISIPs are similar to mutual funds or unit trust funds but specifically cater to
the investment criteria typical of central banks and international institutions.
The two Asian Bond Funds, ABF1 and ABF2, are administered by the BIS
under the BISIP umbrella: ABF1 is managed by the BIS and ABF2 by a group
of external fund managers.
BIS financial services are provided from two linked trading rooms: one in
Basel, at the Bank’s head office, and one in Hong Kong SAR, at its Asian Office.
The Banking Department of the BIS also hosts global and regional
meetings, seminars and workshops on reserve management issues. These
meetings facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience among reserve

126

BIS 81st Annual Report

managers and promote the development of investment and risk management
capabilities in central banks and international organisations.

Financial operations in 2010/11
In 2010/11, financial markets started to settle into a calmer mode despite some
bouts of high volatility and weak investor confidence. Against this steadier
background, the Bank’s customer currency deposit base reached SDR 207.1
billion at the end of 2010/11, representing an increase of SDR 11.3 billion
during the financial year.
The total balance sheet of the BIS increased by SDR 2.2 billion, following
a marginal increase of SDR 3.5 billion in the previous year. As a result, the
balance sheet total at 31 March 2011 was SDR 261.1 billion.
Liabilities
Customer currency and gold placements constitute the largest share of total
liabilities (see graph). On 31 March 2011, customer placements (excluding
repurchase agreements) amounted to SDR 228.4 billion, compared with
SDR 227.8 billion at the end of 2009/10. This net increase resulted from the
combined effect of a decrease in gold deposits and an increase in customer
currency deposits.
Around 91% of customer placements are denominated in currencies, with
the remainder in gold. Currency deposits increased from SDR 195.8 billion a
year ago to SDR 207.1 billion at end-March 2011. That balance represents some
3.1% of the world’s total foreign exchange reserves of nearly SDR 6.2 trillion,
up from SDR 5.7 trillion at end-March 2010.9 The share of currency placements

denominated in US dollars was 68%, while euro- and sterling-denominated
funds accounted for 19% and 5%, respectively.
The net increase in customer currency placements resulted mainly from
the combined increases of 14%, 25% and 4% in investments in fixed-term
deposits, FIXBIS and MTIs, respectively, and a decrease of 38% in sight and
notice accounts.
Gold deposits amounted to SDR 21.3 billion at end-March 2011, a decrease
of SDR 10.8 billion over the financial year.
A breakdown of placements with the BIS by geographical region shows
that Asian customers account for the highest share.
Assets
Most of the assets held by the BIS consist of government and quasi-government
securities, including reverse repurchase agreements and, to an extent similar
to that in the previous financial year, investments with highly rated commercial
banks of international standing. In addition, the Bank owned 119 tonnes of
fine gold at 31 March 2011. The Bank’s credit exposure is managed in a
conservative manner, with almost all of it rated A– or higher at 31 March 2011
(see note 3. “Credit risk”, in the “Risk management” section of the financial
statements).
The Bank’s holdings of currency assets totalled SDR 209.3 billion on
31 March 2011, up from SDR 199.0 billion at the end of the previous financial
year (see note 5 to the financial statements).
The Bank uses various derivative instruments to manage its assets and
liabilities efficiently (see note 7 to the financial statements).

Trustee for international government loans
In conformity with the agreements in force, the Bank continued to perform its
functions as trustee for the funding bonds 1990–2010 of the Dawes and Young
Loans (for details, see the BIS’s 63rd Annual Report of June 1993).
For all funding bonds 1990–2010, the financial year 2009/10 ended on
3 October 2010, on which date all the outstanding funding bonds fell due for
redemption.
The Deutsche Bundesbank, as paying agent, notified the Bank that in
2010 the Bundesamt für zentrale Dienste und offene Vermögensfragen
(BADV – Federal Office for Central Services and Unresolved Property
Issues) had arranged for payment of approximately E 90.4 million, covering
interest payments for the maturity dates of 3 April 2010 and 3 October 2010
and the final redemption due on 3 October 2010. Redemption values and
other details were published by the BADV in the Bundesanzeiger (Federal
Gazette).
The following table shows the position with regard to both loans upon
final redemption.
Drawings and final redemption payments were made for the most part
in euros at the Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt am Main, in its capacity as
principal paying agent.

the issue value of the Dawes Loan (Young Loan) funding bonds, a total of 35%
(17.5%) of the issue value had been redeemed by 3 October 2009. Accordingly,

to 65% (82.5%) of the issue value.10

Representative Offices
The BIS has a Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific (the Asian Office),
located in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s
Republic of China; and a Representative Office for the Americas (the Americas
Office), located in Mexico City. The Representative Offices promote cooperation
within each region by organising meetings, conducting policy research and
fostering the exchange of information and data. The Asian Office also provides
banking services to the region’s monetary authorities.

The Asian Office
With strong support from the BIS shareholding central banks in the AsiaPacific region, the Asian Office took on a new research programme while
continuing to co-organise high-level policy meetings in the region and to offer
its specialised banking services.

10 See the BIS’s 50th Annual Report of June 1980 with respect to the Bank’s reservations regarding the
application by the BADV of the exchange guarantee clause for the Young Loan, which reservations also
extend to the funding bonds 1990–2010.

BIS 81st Annual Report

The Asian Consultative Council
The Asian Consultative Council (ACC), comprising the Governors of the 12 BIS
shareholding central banks in the region,11 helps guide the activities of the
Asian Office and reports to the BIS Board on those activities. In October, Zeti
Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, completed her term as
chair of the ACC, and the BIS Board appointed Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor
of the Bank of Japan, to serve as chair for the next two years.
At its semiannual meeting in June 2010, the Council endorsed a BIS
proposal for a two-year research strategy to be carried out by the Asian Office.
At its January 2011 meeting, the Council discussed the progress of the research
and offered suggestions to help the Office pursue the strategy more effectively.
Two-year research strategy for the Asian Office
The research strategy addresses two themes of high relevance to ACC central
banks: on the monetary side, the role of central bank balance sheets in
monetary policy and exchange rate issues; and on the financial side, property
prices. Much of this work is being carried out in collaboration with academics
and central bank researchers, and the effort will culminate in research
conferences.
The research on the implications of the size and structure of central bank
balance sheets addresses four topics: (i) the implications of prolonged
intervention in currency markets; (ii) modelling the balance sheet transmission
mechanism; (iii) international spillovers of monetary policy; and (iv) the use of
reserve requirements. The conference to present this research is scheduled for
late 2011.
The research on property markets in the region covers four broad issues:
(i) measurement and valuation; (ii) housing finance systems; (iii) the relationship
of property markets to the health of the banking sector; and (iv) the ability of
various policy instruments to influence property prices and market activity. A
research workshop will be held jointly with the Monetary Authority of
Singapore in September 2011, and the conference to present completed work
is scheduled for late 2012.
The Asian Office has engaged in collaborative research with most BIS
shareholding central banks in the region as well as with regional organisations
of central banks. The work has fed into the numerous meetings organised by
the Asian Office and produced several articles in refereed journals and the
major BIS publications.
The Special Governors’ Meeting and other high-level meetings in Asia
The Asian Office organised 14 high-level policy meetings in the region during
the period. Each meeting was held jointly with a central bank in the region or
with a regional body of central banks, such as the Executives’ Meeting of East
Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) and the South East Asian Central Banks
(SEACEN) Research and Training Centre.

11 The central banks of Australia, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New
Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.

BIS 81st Annual Report

The annual Special Governors’ Meeting was organised jointly with the
Bank of Japan and held in Kyoto in January 2011. The event gathered together
the Governors of the major central banks in the region and other Governors
from around the world. The Governors discussed the domestic and international
implications of the expansion of central bank balance sheets in Asia. For the
first time, the event also included a meeting of the Governors with the chief
executive officers of large financial institutions in the region, in which views
were exchanged on the evolving business models of banking in Asia.
Other high-level events included the June 2010 meeting of the Working
Party on Monetary Policy in Asia, co-hosted by the People’s Bank of China in
Xi’an; the September 2010 BIS meeting on Monetary Policy Operating
Procedures, co-hosted by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in Manila; the
November 2010 Sixth High-Level Seminar on Financial Markets, co-hosted by
the Bank of Japan in Hong Kong; the January 2011 BOK-BIS Conference on
Macroprudential Regulation and Policy, co-hosted by the Bank of Korea in
Seoul; and the January 2011 SEACEN-BIS Exco Seminar, co-hosted by the
National Bank of Cambodia in Phnom Penh.
Banking activity and the Asian Bond Funds
Ongoing concerns about the global economic and financial environment led
central banks in the region to remain cautious in their reserve portfolio
management and to rely especially on the short-term liquid instruments
offered by the BIS Banking Department.
As fund administrator, the BIS continued to support the second Asian
Bond Fund (ABF2), an EMEAP initiative to foster the development of local
currency bond markets. At the end of March 2011, the combined size of the
funds stood at $4.0 billion, an increase from $3.5 billion at the end of March
2010. Private sector investment amounted to $1.1 billion, of which investments
in the Pan Asia Bond Index Fund (PAIF) accounted for about 86% and
investments in the eight single-market funds the remainder. The total return
on the PAIF from its inception on 7 July 2005 to the end of March 2011 was
50.5%, which compared favourably with the 31.9% return on a US Treasury
index of similar duration.

The Americas Office
The Americas Office, together with staff at the BIS head office, is monitoring
the way capital inflows may be influencing regional monetary policy and how
the new recommendations to enhance key supervisory standards and
strengthen financial stability will affect local economies. Within the region, the
Office is disseminating BIS research and analysis on these and related topics.
The Office’s work with BIS member banks, non-shareholding central
banks, regulatory authorities and the academic community generated several
publications this year, including “Currency collapses and output dynamics: a
long-run perspective”, “Monetary policy in the presence of informal labor
markets” and “The use of reserve requirements as a policy instrument in Latin
America”, all available on the Americas Office pages of the BIS website.

BIS 81st Annual Report

131

At the November 2010 annual meeting of the Latin American and
Caribbean Economic Association (LACEA), the Americas Office and the BIS
Monetary and Economic Department organised a discussion with academics,
regional central bank directors and former Governors. They also sponsored a
session on each of two contributed papers, one on the implications of global
factors for monetary policies in emerging market economies and the other on
financial stability considerations in monetary frameworks.
The Office co-organised and contributed to meetings at regional central
banks, including the September 2010 meeting of the Working Party on
Monetary Policy in Latin America, convened at the Central Bank of Brazil, and
offered support to several training events organised by the BIS’s Financial
Stability Institute in cooperation with regional groupings of supervisors. In
October 2010, the Office hosted and co-chaired a regional meeting of heads of
internal audit from central banks in the Americas; and in December 2010, it
hosted a meeting in Mexico City on the future of international banking,
organised jointly by the BIS and the Bank of Spain. The Office provided
speakers to, or participated in, various conferences and meetings convened by
regional central banks and research organisations.
The Consultative Council for the Americas
The Office serves as the secretariat to the Consultative Council for the Americas
(CCA). The CCA, which comprises the Governors of the six BIS member central
banks in the Americas,12 was established in May 2008 as an advisory committee
to the BIS Board of Directors. Henrique de Campos Meirelles chaired the CCA
from March 2010 until the end of his term as Governor of the Central Bank of
Brazil, on 1 December 2010. In January 2011, the BIS Board appointed José de
Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, to a two-year term as chair.
CCA members are regularly informed of the work of the BIS and the Americas
Office in the region and provide valuable guidance on current and possible
future work at the BIS of interest to the Americas.

Governance and management of the BIS
The governance and management of the Bank are conducted at three principal levels:
•
the General Meeting of BIS member central banks;
•
the BIS Board of Directors; and
•
BIS Management.
The BIS has its head office in Basel, Switzerland. At the end of the 2010/11
financial year, the BIS employed 604 staff members from 53 countries.

The General Meeting of BIS member central banks
Fifty-six central banks and monetary authorities are currently members of the
BIS. These 56 institutions have rights of voting and representation at General

12

The central banks of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico and the United States.

BIS 81st Annual Report

Meetings. The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is held no later than four
months after 31 March, the end of the BIS financial year. The AGM decides the
distribution of the dividend and profit of the BIS, approves the annual report
and the accounts of the Bank, makes adjustments in the allowances paid to
Board members and selects the Bank’s external auditors.

The BIS Board of Directors
Consisting of 19 members, the Board of Directors is assisted by four committees
of Board members: the Administrative Committee, the Audit Committee, the
Banking and Risk Management Committee, and the Nomination Committee.
The main responsibilities of the Board are determining the strategic and policy
direction of the BIS and supervising the Bank’s Management.
Hans Tietmeyer retired from the Board of Directors at the end of his term,
31 December 2010. He had been a member of the Board since 1993 and
had served as its Vice-Chairman since 2003. At its January 2011 meeting, the
BIS Board elected Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to
succeed Mr Tietmeyer as Vice-Chairman for a three-year term commencing on
10 January 2011. At the same meeting, the Board appointed Philipp Hildebrand,
Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, to succeed
Mr Tietmeyer as Chairman of the Bank’s Administrative Committee with effect
from 10 January 2011.
Henrique de Campos Meirelles stepped down as Governor of the Central
Bank of Brazil, and therefore as a member of the BIS Board, at the end of
December 2010. In January 2011, the Board elected Agustín Carstens, Governor
of the Bank of Mexico, as a member of the Board for the remainder of
Mr Meirelles’ term.
In March 2011, the Board re-elected Stefan Ingves, Governor of Sveriges
Riksbank, for a further period of three years ending on 31 March 2014.
Baron Guy Quaden retired as Governor of the National Bank of Belgium
at the end of March 2011. Luc Coene succeeded Baron Quaden as Governor
on 1 April 2011 and became an ex officio member of the Board of Directors.
Mr Coene subsequently appointed Baron Quaden as a member of the Board
until 31 March 2014.
Axel Weber stepped down as President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, and
therefore as a member of the BIS Board, on 30 April 2011. On 1 May 2011,
Jens Weidmann succeeded Mr Weber at the Deutsche Bundesbank and
became an ex officio member of the Board.
Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, reappointed Jean-Pierre
Landau, Second Deputy Governor of the Bank of France, as a member of the
BIS Board until 31 December 2011. Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of
England, reappointed Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England,
as a member of the Board until 31 December 2011.

Bank budget policy
The process of formulating the Bank’s expenditure budget for the next financial
year starts about six months in advance with the setting by Management of a
broad business orientation and financial framework. Within this context,
business areas specify their plans and the corresponding resource requirements.
The process of reconciling detailed business plans, objectives and overall
resource availability culminates in a draft financial budget. The budget must
be approved by the Board before the start of the financial year.
The budget distinguishes between administrative and capital expenditures.
In common with organisations similar to the BIS, Management and staff
expenditure – including remuneration, pensions, and health and accident

136

BIS 81st Annual Report

insurance – amounts to around 70% of administrative expenditure. The other
major expenditure categories, each accounting for about 10% of administrative
spending, are information technology (IT), telecommunications, and building
and equipment. Capital spending mainly relates to building expenses and IT
investment and can vary significantly from year to year. Most of the Bank’s
administrative and capital expenditure is incurred in Swiss francs.
Administrative expenditure before depreciation13 for the financial year
2010/11 amounted to 253.7 million Swiss francs, 3.0% below the budget of
261.6 million Swiss francs, while capital expenditure, at 21.7 million Swiss
francs, was 1.8 million under budget. The largest sources of the underspending
in administrative expenditure were lower than budgeted management and
staff costs and IT and telecommunications spending.
Administrative and capital expenditure in 2010/11 reflected the main
priority in the budget, which was to further reinforce the Bank’s response to
the global financial crisis in the following areas:
•
Human and financial resources devoted to financial stability issues were
increased by the creation of additional staff positions to support the work
of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (BCBS) and the Committee on the Global Financial System
(CGFS). A key achievement was the completion of the new Basel III reform
package and its endorsement by the G20. This was the outcome of major
efforts by the BCBS, the FSB and the BIS’s Monetary and Economic
Department.
•
In the Banking Department and the Risk Control, Finance and Compliance
units, dealing with the aftermath of the financial crisis was the main
priority. Work in the banking business was oriented towards carefully
managing the balance sheet and enhancing risk management, valuation,
operational controls and management accounting.
Also in 2010/11, the Banking Department started work on the asset
management infrastructure project, which will further enhance data
management, compliance checking, portfolio analysis, order management and
trade processing.
In March 2011, the Board approved a 2.6% increase in the administrative
budget for the financial year 2011/12, to 268.5 million Swiss francs. It approved
an increase of 3.1 million Swiss francs in the capital budget, to 26.6 million.
The Bank’s business plan, on which the proposed administrative budget
for 2011/12 is based, builds on the achievements in 2010/11 and gives priority
to further enhancing financial stability activities. It allocates additional human
and financial resources to deal with the expanding financial stability workload,
particularly in the FSB, the BCBS and the Committee on Payment and
Settlement Systems. The additional work includes disseminating the Basel III
package to the global community of central banks and financial supervisors

13 The Bank’s budgetary accounting is cash-based and excludes certain financial accounting adjustments,
principally relating to retirement benefit obligations, which take into account financial market and
actuarial developments. These additional factors are included under “Operating expense” disclosed in
the profit and loss account (see “Net profit and its distribution”).

BIS 81st Annual Report

137

and enhancing the Bank’s statistical capacity for the monitoring of financial
markets and institutions.
Strengthening the resilience of BIS banking activities based on appropriate
levels of profitability and financial risk from a medium-term perspective will
be the main priority of the Banking Department and the Risk Control, Finance
and Compliance units. Additional resources were also made available in the
budget to complete the asset management infrastructure project started in
2010/11.
Bank remuneration policy
The jobs performed by BIS staff members are assessed on the basis of a
number of objective criteria, including qualifications, experience and
responsibilities, and are classified into distinct job grades. The job grades are
associated with a structure of salary ranges. Every three years, a comprehensive
survey benchmarks BIS salaries against compensation in comparable
institutions and market segments. When benchmarking BIS salaries against
comparators, the Bank focuses on the upper half of market compensation in
order to attract highly qualified staff. The analysis takes into account differences
in the taxation of compensation for the staff of the surveyed institutions. The
most recent survey took place in the second half of 2010. As of 1 July 2011, it
will result in an alignment of the midpoints of the Bank’s salary ranges with
the observed market benchmarks.
In years between comprehensive salary surveys, the salary structure is
adjusted on the basis of the rate of inflation in Switzerland and the weighted
average change in real wages in advanced economies. In view of the
negative inflation and real salary growth in the reference period, the salary
structure was reduced by 1% on 1 July 2010. Movements of salaries of
individual staff members within the ranges of the salary structure are based
on performance.
Through the Bank, BIS staff members have access to a contributory health
insurance plan and a contributory defined benefit pension plan. Non-locally
hired, non-Swiss staff members recruited for a position at the Bank’s
headquarters, including senior officials, are entitled to an expatriation
allowance. It currently amounts to 14% of annual salary for unmarried staff
members and 18% for married staff members, subject to a ceiling. Expatriate
staff members are also entitled to receive an education allowance for their
children subject to certain conditions. In the Representative Offices, the BIS
makes a distinction between staff members on an international assignment
from the headquarters and staff members recruited directly for a position in a
Representative Office. The employment conditions of the former are determined
in accordance with the Bank’s international assignment policy. For staff
recruited directly, employment conditions are aligned with those in the market
in which the Office is located, but they include access to the same health
insurance and pension plans available to staff engaged at the Bank’s
headquarters.
The salaries of senior officials are regularly benchmarked against
compensation in comparable institutions and market segments. As with the

138

BIS 81st Annual Report

survey for other staff, the most recent executive compensation survey took
place in the second half of 2010. The results confirmed the appropriateness of
the current practice of annually adjusting the salaries of senior officials for the
rate of Swiss inflation.
As of 1 July 2010, the annual remuneration of senior officials, before
expatriation allowances, is based on the following salary structure:
•
General Manager14
758,600 Swiss francs
•
Deputy General Manager
641,900 Swiss francs
Heads of Department
583,550 Swiss francs
•
The Annual General Meeting approves the remuneration of members of
the Board of Directors, with adjustments taking place every three years. The
total fixed annual remuneration paid to the Board of Directors was 1,049,520
Swiss francs as at 1 April 2011. In addition, Board members receive an
attendance fee for each Board meeting in which they participate. Assuming
the full Board is represented in all Board meetings, the annual total of these
attendance fees amounts to 973,788 Swiss francs.

Net profit and its distribution
The Bank recorded a net profit of SDR 816.0 million for the 81st financial
year, ended 31 March 2011. This result represents a return to a more normal
level of profitability in comparison with the exceptionally high profit of
SDR 1,859.8 million recorded for the preceding financial year, which was
achieved against the background of recovery in global financial markets,
particularly in the credit markets, where many spreads against Libor had
narrowed back to pre-September 2008 levels. The principal factors behind the
2010/11 result are discussed below.

Principal factors behind the 2010/11 profit
The financial year 2010/11 was marked by changeable global financial market
conditions. In the first quarter of the financial year, tensions in the euro zone
credit markets resulted in widened credit spreads against Libor for the debt
instruments in the Bank’s borrowed funds credit portfolios. In the second
quarter, the tensions eased and credit spreads narrowed somewhat. This
quarterly pattern of change in euro zone tensions and credit spreads in the
first half of the financial year was repeated in the second half. Money market
and foreign exchange spreads were, however, more stable than in the previous
three financial years.
Net interest income amounted to SDR 1,465.4 million in 2010/11, compared
with SDR 1,431.2 million in the preceding financial year. This increase was
mainly attributable to:
•
a 2.7% increase in the average volume of currency deposits from
customers; and

14 In addition to the basic salary, the General Manager receives an annual representation allowance and
enhanced pension rights.

BIS 81st Annual Report

139

•

the impact of early repurchases of Medium-Term Instrument (MTI)
liabilities and the associated hedging arrangements. This increase is
offset by an equivalent loss within net valuation movements.15
The impact of these positive factors was reduced by narrowing
intermediation margins in the second half of the financial year.
Net valuation movements amounted to a loss of SDR 509.2 million in
contrast to a gain of SDR 520.5 million last year.
The valuation loss in 2010/11 was mainly attributable to:
•
the impact of MTI hedging mentioned above; and
•
widening credit spreads on euro zone debt instruments held by the Bank’s
credit portfolios.
Operating expense (see note 24 to the financial statements) amounted to
SDR 205.0 million, 7.4% above the preceding year’s figure of SDR 190.8 million.
Expressed in Swiss francs, the currency in which most of the Bank’s administrative
expenditure is incurred, operating expense rose by 1.1%. Administrative
expense before depreciation, at SDR 190.8 million, exceeded the previous
year’s figure of SDR 177.7 million by 7.4%. The depreciation charge of
SDR 14.2 million was 9.2% above the previous year’s level of SDR 13.1 million.
After taking into account the above factors, the Bank’s operating
profit amounted to SDR 738.5 million, SDR 1,015.9 million below the
SDR 1,754.4 million recorded in 2009/10.
Over the past two financial years, the Bank sold investment securities to
align the portfolio with its benchmark duration of three years. The 2010/11
operation, which involved securities that had been acquired when interest rates
were higher, produced a net gain of SDR 55.7 million. The sales in 2009/10
generated a net gain of SDR 105.4 million.
The Bank gained SDR 21.8 million on the sale of one tonne of its gold
investment assets. The Bank made no such sales in 2009/10.
As a result of these factors, the net profit for 2010/11 amounted to
SDR 816.0 million, SDR 1,043.8 million below the preceding year’s
SDR 1,859.8 million.

Movements in equity
The Bank’s revaluation accounts, one for investment securities and one for
gold, form part of the Bank’s equity. They consist of net realised gains or
losses – which are transferred to the profit and loss account – and net
unrealised gains or losses.
The securities revaluation account decreased by SDR 197.3 million
because of net unrealised losses on investment securities (–SDR 141.6 million),
Holders of MTIs may sell these financial instruments back to the BIS at their current market value.
When an MTI is repurchased by the BIS, the corresponding assets and hedging arrangements are retained
and are normally refinanced through the issue of new liability financial instruments with similar market
risk characteristics. Recent repurchases have taken place in a period when interest rates have been lower
than when the repurchased MTIs were originally issued. As a result, the Bank’s interest accrual margin
has widened because the interest rates paid on the refinanced liabilities are lower than on the original
MTIs. This has produced a higher net interest income, but this benefit is offset by a correspondingly
lower net valuation movement as the assets and hedging arrangements converge to par value at maturity.

15

140

BIS 81st Annual Report

incurred as interest yields began to rise in the second half of the financial
year; and, as noted above, because of the transfer to the profit and loss
account of realised gains (–SDR 55.7 million) on sales.
The gold revaluation account increased by SDR 650.4 million because of
net unrealised gains (+SDR 672.2 million) on the Bank’s own gold investment
assets, which were attributable to the year-on-year appreciation of gold; and,
as noted above, because of the transfer to the profit and loss account of
realised gains (–SDR 21.8 million) on the sale of one tonne of gold.
After taking these gains into account, the Bank’s total return16 for 2010/11
was SDR 1,269.1 million. This represented a return of 7.8% on average equity
of SDR 16,238 million. In 2009/10, the total return was SDR 2,204.1 million, or
14.9%, on average equity of SDR 14,795 million. Taking into account the
payment of the dividend of SDR 374.1 million for 2009/10, the Bank’s equity
increased by SDR 895.0 million during the year ended 31 March 2011.

Proposed dividend
The Board’s review of the BIS dividend policy in 2009/10 took into consideration
the Bank’s capital needs and the interests of BIS shareholders in obtaining a fair
and sustainable return on their investments in BIS shares. In framing the
dividend policy, the Board adopted a number of governing principles, which are:
•
First, the need for the Bank to maintain a strong capital base at all times,
including during financial stress.
•
Second, the dividend should be relatively stable, set at a sustainable level
and changing in a predictable manner each year.
•
Third, while the Bank’s dividend policy should provide guidance for the
medium term, the dividend should continue to reflect the prevailing
financial circumstances of the Bank and should remain an annual decision
of the Board.
The dividend policy takes into account the Bank’s capital adequacy and
leverage ratio requirements. The policy, which is due to be reviewed again in
2014/15, incorporates:
•
a normal sustainable dividend, decided ex ante in conformity with the
medium-term dividend policy, which would increase by SDR 10 per
annum; and
•
a supplementary dividend, which would be decided ex post, while keeping
leverage and economic capital within desired ranges.
The policy ensures that earnings are retained to augment the Bank’s
capital at a sufficient rate to support the Bank’s business and maintain its
capital position relative to the size of the balance sheet and its economic
capital requirements. In normal circumstances, it results in a steady progression
in annual dividends while retaining the flexibility to be operable in years of
low or high profits. In addition, the final approval of the dividend each May
coincides with the outcome of the annual economic capital allocation process

16 The total return is shown as “Total comprehensive income” in the table entitled “Statement of
comprehensive income” on page 146 in the financial statements.

BIS 81st Annual Report

141

(see note 2 of the capital adequacy section of the financial statements),
enabling the Board to pay an appropriate dividend while ensuring that the
Bank’s capital base remains strong.
Consistent with this dividend policy, it is proposed for the financial year
2010/11 to declare a normal dividend of SDR 295 per share, SDR 10 above the
normal dividend for 2009/10. Last year, a supplementary dividend of SDR 400
per share was paid in recognition of the exceptionally high net profit. Given
the return to a more normal level of profit, no supplementary dividend will be
proposed for 2010/11.

Proposed distribution of the net profit for the year
On the basis of Article 51 of the Statutes, the Board of Directors recommends
to the Annual General Meeting that the net profit of SDR 816.0 million for the
financial year 2010/11 be applied by the General Meeting in the following
manner:
(a) SDR 161.1 million to be paid as a normal dividend of SDR 295 per share;
(b) SDR 65.5 million to be transferred to the general reserve fund;17
(c) SDR 6.0 million to be transferred to the special dividend reserve fund;
and
(d) SDR 583.4 million, representing the remainder of the available net profit,
to be transferred to the free reserve fund.
If approved, the dividend could be paid out on 1 July 2011 in any
constituent currency of the SDR, or in Swiss francs, according to the instructions
of each shareholder named in the Bank’s share register on 31 March 2011.
The number of issued and paid-up shares is 547,125. Of these shares,
1,000, namely the suspended shares of the Albanian issue, were held in
treasury at 31 March 2011. No dividend will be paid on treasury shares;
therefore, the dividend will be paid on 546,125 shares.

Report of the auditors
The Bank’s financial statements have been duly audited by Deloitte AG, who
have confirmed that they give a true and fair view of the Bank’s financial
position at 31 March 2011 and the results of its operations for the year then
ended. Their report is to be found immediately following the financial
statements.

17 The general reserve fund exceeded four times the Bank’s paid-up capital at 31 March 2011. Article 51
of the Bank’s Statutes requires that 10% of the profit after payment of the dividend be paid into the
general reserve fund until its balance equals five times the paid-up capital.

Accounting policies

The accounting policies set out below have been applied
to both of the financial years presented unless otherwise
stated.

assets and liabilities are recorded in SDR at the exchange
rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Profits and
losses are translated into SDR at an average rate. Exchange
differences arising from the retranslation of monetary
assets and liabilities and from the settlement of transactions
are included as net foreign exchange gains or losses in the
profit and loss account.

1. Scope of the financial statements
These financial statements contain all assets and liabilities
that are controlled by the Bank and in respect of which the
economic benefits as well as the rights and obligations lie
with the Bank.
Assets and liabilities in the name of but not controlled by
the Bank and in respect of which the economic benefits as
well as the rights and obligations do not lie with the Bank
are not included in these financial statements. Information
on off-balance sheet assets and liabilities is disclosed in
note 31.

4. Designation of financial instruments
Upon initial recognition the Bank allocates each financial
instrument to one of the following categories:

•
•

Loans and receivables

•
•

Available for sale financial assets

Financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair
value through profit and loss

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

The allocation to these categories is dependent on the
nature of the financial instrument and the purpose for
which it was entered into, as described in Section 5 below.

2. Functional and presentation currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Bank is the
Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
The SDR is calculated from a basket of major trading
currencies according to Rule O–1 as adopted by the
Executive Board of the IMF on 30 December 2010 and
effective 1 January 2011. As currently calculated, one
SDR is equivalent to the sum of USD 0.660, EUR 0.423,
JPY 12.1 and GBP 0.111. Prior to 1 January 2011, one
SDR was equivalent to the sum of USD 0.632, EUR 0.410,
JPY 18.4 and GBP 0.0903. The change in the composition
of the SDR basket was such that the values of the SDR
under the old and new baskets were equivalent at
31 December 2010 and no significant gains or losses
resulted from the change in the weights of the currencies.
The composition of the SDR currency basket is subject to
review every five years by the IMF; the next review is due
to be undertaken in December 2015.
All figures in these financial statements are presented in
SDR millions unless otherwise stated.

3. Currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into SDR at
the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Other

BIS 81st Annual Report

The resulting designation of each financial instrument
determines the accounting methodology that is applied, as
described in the accounting policies below. Where the
financial instrument is designated as held at fair value
through profit and loss, the Bank does not subsequently
change this designation.

5. Asset and liability structure
Assets and liabilities are organised into two sets of
portfolios:

A. Banking portfolios
These comprise currency and gold deposit liabilities and
related banking assets and derivatives.
The Bank operates a banking business in currency and
gold on behalf of its customers. In this business the Bank
takes limited gold price, interest rate and foreign currency
risk.
The Bank designates all currency financial instruments in
its banking portfolios (other than cash and sight and notice
accounts with banks, and sight and notice deposit account
liabilities) as held at fair value through profit and loss. The
use of fair values in the currency banking portfolios is
described in Section 9 below.

151

All gold financial assets in these portfolios are designated
as loans and receivables and all gold financial liabilities are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised
cost.

8. Sight and notice deposit account liabilities

B. Investment portfolios

Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments
are designated as financial liabilities measured at
amortised cost. They are included in the balance sheet at
their principal value plus accrued interest. Interest is
included in interest expense on an accruals basis.

These comprise assets, liabilities and derivatives relating
principally to the investment of the Bank’s equity.
The Bank holds most of its equity in financial instruments
denominated in the constituent currencies of the SDR,
which are managed using a fixed duration benchmark of
bonds.
Except for the currency assets described in the next
paragraph, currency assets (other than cash and sight and
notice accounts with banks) are designated as available
for sale. Related securities sold under repurchase
agreements are designated as financial liabilities
measured at amortised cost.
In addition, the Bank maintains some of its equity in more
actively traded portfolios. The currency investment assets
in these portfolios are trading assets and as such are
designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
The remainder of the Bank’s equity is held in gold. The
Bank’s own gold holdings are designated as available for
sale.

6. Cash and sight accounts with banks
Cash and sight accounts with banks are included in the
balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued interest
where applicable.

Sight and notice deposit accounts are short-term monetary
liabilities. They typically have notice periods of three days
or less and are included under the balance sheet heading
“Currency deposits”.

9. Use of fair values in the currency banking
portfolios
In operating its currency banking business, the Bank acts
as a market-maker in certain of its currency deposit
liabilities. As a result of this activity the Bank incurs
realised profits and losses on these liabilities.
In accordance with the Bank’s risk management policies,
the market risk inherent in this activity is managed on an
overall fair value basis, combining all the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios.
The realised and unrealised profits or losses on currency
deposit liabilities are thus largely offset by realised and
unrealised losses or profits on the related currency
banking assets and derivatives, or on other currency
deposit liabilities.
To reduce the accounting inconsistency that would arise
from recognising realised and unrealised gains and losses
on different bases, the Bank designates the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios
as held at fair value through profit and loss.

7. Notice accounts

10. Currency deposit liabilities held at fair value
through profit and loss

Notice accounts are short-term monetary assets. They
typically have notice periods of three days or less and are
included under the balance sheet heading “Loans and
advances”. They are considered to be cash equivalents for
the purposes of the cash flow statement.

As described above, all currency deposit liabilities, with
the exception of sight and notice deposit account liabilities,
are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.

Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments
are designated as loans and receivables. They are included
in the balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued
interest. Interest is included in interest income on an
accruals basis.

These currency deposit liabilities are initially included in
the balance sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The
subsequent accrual of interest to be paid and amortisation
of premiums received and discounts paid are included
under the profit and loss account heading “Interest
expense” on an effective interest rate basis.
After trade date, the currency deposit liabilities are
revalued to fair value, with all realised and unrealised
movements in fair value included under “Net valuation
movement”.

152

BIS 81st Annual Report

11. Currency assets held at fair value through
profit and loss
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and
government and other securities.
As described above, the Bank designates all of the relevant
assets in its currency banking portfolios as held at fair
value through profit and loss. In addition, the Bank
maintains certain actively traded investment portfolios.
The currency investment assets in these portfolios are
trading assets and as such are designated as held at fair
value through profit and loss.
These currency assets are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The subsequent
accrual of interest and amortisation of premiums paid and
discounts received are included in the profit and loss
account under “Interest income” on an effective interest
rate basis.
After trade date, the currency assets are revalued to fair
value, with all realised and unrealised movements in fair
value included under “Net valuation movement”.

12. Currency investment assets available
for sale
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and
government and other securities.
As described above, the Bank designates as available for
sale all of the relevant assets in its currency investment
portfolios, except for those assets in the Bank’s more
actively traded investment portfolios.
These currency investment assets are initially included
in the balance sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The
subsequent accrual of interest and amortisation of
premiums paid and discounts received are included in the
profit and loss account under “Interest income” on an
effective interest rate basis.
After trade date, the currency investment assets are
revalued to fair value, with unrealised gains or losses
included in the securities revaluation account, which is
reported under the balance sheet heading “Other equity
accounts”. The movement in fair value is included in the
statement of comprehensive income under the heading
“Unrealised loss on securities available for sale”. Realised
profits on disposal are included in the profit and loss
account under “Net gain on sales of securities available
for sale”.

13. Short positions in currency assets
Short positions in currency assets are included in the
balance sheet under the heading “Other liabilities” at fair
value on a trade date basis.

14. Gold
Gold comprises gold bar assets held in custody at central
banks and sight accounts denominated in gold. Gold is
considered by the Bank to be a financial instrument.
Gold is included in the balance sheet at its weight in gold
(translated at the gold market price and USD exchange
rate into SDR). Purchases and sales of gold are accounted
for on a settlement date basis. Forward purchases or sales
of gold are treated as derivatives prior to the settlement
date.
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses
on gold is described in Section 17 below.

15. Gold loans
Gold loans comprise fixed-term gold loans. Gold loans are
included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis at
their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price
and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest.
Accrued interest on gold loans is included in the profit and
loss account under “Interest income” on an effective
interest rate basis.

16. Gold deposits
Gold deposits comprise unallocated sight and fixed-term
deposits of gold from central banks.
Unallocated gold deposits provide customers with a
general claim on the Bank for delivery of gold of the same
weight and quality as that delivered by the customer to the
Bank, but do not provide the right to specific gold bars.
Unallocated gold deposits are included in the balance sheet
on a trade date basis at their weight in gold (translated at
the gold market price and USD exchange rate into SDR)
plus accrued interest. Accrued interest on gold deposits is
included in the profit and loss account under “Interest
expense” on an effective interest rate basis.
Allocated (or “earmarked”) gold deposits provide
depositors with a claim for delivery of the specific gold
bars deposited by the customer with the Bank on a
custody basis. Beneficial ownership and risk remain with
the customer. As such, allocated gold deposit liabilities

BIS 81st Annual Report

153

and the related gold bar assets are not included on the
Bank’s balance sheet. They are disclosed as off-balance
sheet items (see note 31).

17. Realised and unrealised gains or losses
on gold

18. Securities sold under repurchase agreements
Where these liabilities are associated with the
management of currency assets held at fair value through
profit and loss, they are designated as financial
instruments held at fair value through profit and loss.
Where these liabilities are associated with currency assets
available for sale, they are designated as financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost.

The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses
on gold depends on the designation as described below:

They are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of interest is
included in the profit and loss account under “Interest
expense” on an effective interest rate basis.

A. Banking portfolios, comprising gold deposits
and related gold banking assets

After trade date, those liabilities that are designated as
held at fair value through profit and loss are revalued to
fair value, with unrealised gains or losses included under
“Net valuation movement”.

The Bank designates gold loans in its banking portfolios
as loans and receivables and gold deposits as financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost. The gold derivatives
included in the portfolios are designated as held at fair
value through profit and loss.

19. Derivatives

Gains or losses on these transactions in gold are included
in the profit and loss account under “Net foreign exchange
gain / (loss)” as net transaction gains or losses.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the net position in
gold in the banking portfolios are included under “Net
foreign exchange gain / (loss)” as net translation gains or
losses.

B. Investment portfolios, comprising gold
investment assets
The Bank’s own holdings of gold are designated and
accounted for as available for sale assets.
Unrealised gains or losses on the Bank’s gold investment
assets over their deemed cost are taken to the gold
revaluation account in equity, which is reported under
the balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”. The
movement in fair value is included in the statement of
comprehensive income under the heading “Unrealised
gain on gold investment assets”.
For gold investment assets held on 31 March 2003 (when
the Bank changed its functional and presentation currency
from the gold franc to the SDR) the deemed cost is
approximately SDR 151 per ounce, based on the value of
USD 208 that was applied from 1979 to 2003 following a
decision by the Bank’s Board of Directors, translated at
the 31 March 2003 exchange rate.
Realised gains or losses on disposal of gold investment
assets are included in the profit and loss account as “Net
gain / (loss) on sales of gold investment assets”.

Derivatives are used either to manage the Bank’s market
risk or for trading purposes. They are designated as
financial instruments held at fair value through profit and
loss.
Derivatives are initially included in the balance sheet on a
trade date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of
interest and amortisation of premiums paid and discounts
received are included in the profit and loss account under
“Interest income” on an effective interest rate basis.
After trade date, derivatives are revalued to fair value,
with all realised and unrealised movements in value
included under “Net valuation movement”.
Derivatives are included as either assets or liabilities,
depending on whether the contract has a positive or a
negative fair value for the Bank.
Where a derivative contract is embedded within a host
contract which is not accounted for as held at fair value
through profit and loss, it is separated from the host
contract for accounting purposes and treated as though it
were a standalone derivative as described above.

20. Valuation policy
The Bank’s valuation policy has been approved by the
Board of Directors. In this policy the Bank defines how
financial instruments are designated, which determines
their valuation basis and accounting treatment. This policy
is supplemented with detailed valuation procedures.
The majority of the financial instruments on the balance
sheet are included at fair value. The Bank defines the fair
value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable,
willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.

154

BIS 81st Annual Report

The use of fair values ensures that the financial reporting
to the Board and shareholders reflects the way in which
the banking business is managed and is consistent with
the risk management and economic performance figures
reported to Management.
The Bank considers published price quotations in active
markets as the best evidence of fair value. Where no
published price quotations exist, the Bank determines fair
values using a valuation technique appropriate to the
particular financial instrument. Such valuation techniques
may involve using market prices of recent arm’s length
market transactions in similar instruments or may make
use of financial models. Where financial models are used,
the Bank aims at making maximum use of observable
market inputs (eg interest rates and volatilities) as
appropriate, and relies as little as possible on its own
estimates. Such valuation models comprise discounted
cash flow analyses and option pricing models.
Where valuation techniques are used to determine fair
values, the valuation models are subject to initial approval
and periodic review in line with the requirements of the
Bank’s model validation policy.

22. Accounts receivable and accounts payable
Accounts receivable and accounts payable are principally
very short-term amounts relating to the settlement of
financial transactions. They are initially recognised at fair
value and subsequently included in the balance sheet at
amortised cost.

23. Land, buildings and equipment
The cost of the Bank’s buildings and equipment is
capitalised and depreciated on a straight line basis over
the estimated useful lives of the assets concerned, as
follows:

•

The Bank has an independent valuation control function
which periodically reviews the value of its financial
instruments, taking into account both the accuracy of the
valuations and the valuation methodologies used. Other
valuation controls include the review and analysis of daily
profit and loss.

The Bank’s land is not depreciated. The Bank undertakes
an annual review of impairment of land, buildings and
equipment. Where the carrying amount of an asset is
greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written
down to that amount.

The Bank values its assets at the bid price and its
liabilities at the offer price. Derivative financial instruments
are valued on a bid-offer basis, with valuation reserves,
where necessary, included in derivative financial liabilities.
Financial assets and liabilities that are not valued at fair
value are included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.

24. Provisions

21. Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those designated as held at
fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for
indications of impairment at each balance sheet date. A
financial asset is impaired when there is objective evidence
that the estimated future cash flows of the asset have been
reduced as a result of one or more events that occurred
after the initial recognition of the asset. Evidence of
impairment could include significant financial difficulty,
default, or probable bankruptcy / financial reorganisation
of the counterparty or issuer.
Impairment losses are recognised to the extent that a
decline in fair value below amortised cost is considered
other than temporary. Impairment of currency assets is
included in the profit and loss account under “Net valuation
movement”, with impairment of gold loans included under
“Interest income”. If the amount of the impairment loss
decreases in a subsequent period, the previously recognised
impairment loss is reversed through profit and loss to the
extent that the carrying amount of the investment does not
exceed that which it would have been had the impairment
not been recognised.

BIS 81st Annual Report

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present
legal or constructive obligation as a result of events arising
before the balance sheet date and it is probable that
economic resources will be required to settle the obligation,
provided that a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation. Best estimates and assumptions
are used when determining the amount to be recognised
as a provision.

25. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment benefit
arrangements for staff pensions, Directors’ pensions, and
health and accident insurance for current and former staff
members. An independent actuarial valuation is performed
annually for each arrangement.

A. Staff pensions
The Bank provides a final salary defined benefit pension
arrangement for its staff, based on a fund without separate
legal personality, out of which benefits are paid. The fund

155

assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of
current and former members of staff who participate in the
arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all
benefits due under the arrangement.
The liability in respect of the staff pension fund is based on
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the
balance sheet date, less the fair value of the fund assets at
the balance sheet date, together with adjustments for
unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and past service
costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated using
the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined from the estimated
future cash outflows. The rate used to discount the cash
flows is determined by the Bank based on the market yield
of highly rated corporate debt securities in Swiss francs
which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of
the related liability.

the corridor is amortised over the expected remaining
service period of the staff concerned.

26. Cash flow statement
The Bank’s cash flow statement is prepared using an
indirect method. It is based on the movements in the
Bank’s balance sheet, adjusted for changes in financial
transactions awaiting settlement.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and sight and
notice accounts with banks, which are very short-term
financial assets that typically have notice periods of three
days or less.

The amount charged to the profit and loss account
represents the sum of the current service cost of the
benefits accruing for the year under the scheme, and
interest at the discount rate on the defined benefit
obligation. In addition, actuarial gains and losses arising
from experience adjustments (where the actual outcome is
different from the actuarial assumptions previously made),
changes in actuarial assumptions and amendments to the
pension fund regulations are charged to the profit and loss
account over the service period of staff concerned in
accordance with the “corridor accounting” methodology
described below. The resulting liabilities are included
under the heading “Other liabilities” in the balance sheet.

B. Directors’ pensions
The Bank provides an unfunded defined benefit
arrangement for Directors’ pensions. The liability, defined
benefit obligation and amount charged to the profit and loss
account in respect of the Directors’ pension arrangement
are calculated on a similar basis to that used for the staff
pension fund.

C. Post-employment health and accident benefits
The Bank provides an unfunded post-employment health
and accident benefit arrangement for its staff. The liability,
benefit obligation and amount charged to the profit and
loss account in respect of the health and accident benefit
arrangement are calculated on a similar basis to that used
for the staff pension fund.

D. Corridor accounting
Actuarial gains or losses arise from experience
adjustments (where the actual outcome is different from
the actuarial assumptions previously made), changes in
actuarial assumptions and amendments to the pension
fund regulations. Where the cumulative unrecognised
actuarial gains or losses exceed the higher of the benefit
obligation or any assets used to fund the obligation by
more than a corridor of 10%, the resulting excess outside

Notes to the financial statements

1. Introduction
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS, “the Bank”) is an international financial institution which was established pursuant
to the Hague Agreements of 20 January 1930, the Bank’s Constituent Charter and its Statutes. The headquarters of the Bank
are at Centralbahnplatz 2, 4002 Basel, Switzerland. The Bank maintains representative offices in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (for Asia and the Pacific) and in Mexico City, Mexico (for the Americas).
The objectives of the BIS, as laid down in Article 3 of its Statutes, are to promote cooperation among central banks, to provide
additional facilities for international financial operations and to act as trustee or agent for international financial settlements.
Fifty-six central banks are currently members of the Bank. Rights of representation and voting at General Meetings are
exercised in proportion to the number of BIS shares issued in the respective countries. The Board of Directors of the BIS is
composed of the Governors and appointed Directors from the Bank’s founding central banks, being those of Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, as well as the Governors of the central banks of
Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland, and the President of the European Central Bank.

2. Use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the Bank’s Management to make some estimates in arriving at the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the financial year. To arrive at these estimates,
Management uses available information, makes assumptions and exercises judgment.
Assumptions include forward-looking estimates, for example relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities, the assessment
of post-employment benefit obligations and the assessment of provisions and contingent liabilities.
Judgment is exercised when selecting and applying the Bank’s accounting policies. The judgments relating to the designation
and valuation of financial instruments are another key element in the preparation of these financial statements.
Subsequent actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

A. The valuation of financial assets and liabilities
There is no active secondary market for certain of the Bank’s financial assets and financial liabilities. Such assets and liabilities
are valued using valuation techniques which require judgment to determine appropriate valuation parameters. Changes in
assumptions about these parameters could materially affect the reported fair values. The valuation impact of a 1 basis point
change in spread assumptions is shown in the table below:

B. Impairment provision on financial assets
Gold loans include a provision of SDR 29.0 million following an impairment review as at 31 March 2011 (31 March 2010:
SDR 23.5 million). The impairment review was conducted at an individual counterparty level, identifying those counterparties which
were experiencing significant financial difficulties at the balance sheet date. The increase in the provision during the financial
year ended 31 March 2011 is due to changes in gold prices and exchange rates, which are included under the profit and
loss account heading “Net foreign exchange loss”. No additional impairment charge was recognised during the financial year
(2010: nil). Impairment charges, when recognised, are included in the profit and loss account under the heading “Net interest income”.

C. Actuarial assumptions
The valuation of the Bank’s pension fund and health care arrangements relies on actuarial assumptions which include
expectations of inflation, interest rates, medical cost inflation and retirement age and life expectancy of participants. Changes
to these assumptions have an impact on the valuation of the Bank’s pension fund liabilities and the amounts recognised in the
financial statements.

3. Cash and sight accounts with banks
Cash and sight accounts with banks consist of cash balances with central banks and commercial banks that are available to the
Bank on demand.

Included in “Gold” is SDR 11,940.5 million (409 tonnes) of gold (2010: SDR 8,160.1 million; 346 tonnes) that the Bank holds in
connection with its gold swap contracts. Under such contracts the Bank exchanges currencies for physical gold, and has an
obligation to return the gold at the end of the contract. See note 7 for more details on gold swap transactions.

B. Gold investment assets
The Bank’s gold investment assets are included in the balance sheet at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price
and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest. The excess of this value over the deemed cost value is included in the
gold revaluation account which is reported under the balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”; the movement in this value
is included in the statement of comprehensive income under the heading “Unrealised gain on gold investment assets”. Realised

gains or losses on the disposal of gold investment assets are recognised in the profit and loss account under the heading “Net
gain on sales of gold investment assets”.

5. Currency assets
A. Total holdings
Currency assets comprise treasury bills, securities purchased under resale agreements, fixed-term loans and advances, and
government and other securities.
Currency assets held at fair value through profit and loss comprise those currency banking assets that represent the
reinvestment of currency deposit liabilities along with currency investment assets that are part of more actively traded
portfolios. The remaining part of the Bank’s currency investment assets are categorised as available for sale and, together with
the gold investment assets, largely represent the investment of the Bank’s equity.
Treasury bills are short-term debt securities issued by governments on a discount basis.
Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse repurchase agreements”) are usually short-term transactions under
which the Bank makes a fixed-term loan to a counterparty which provides collateral in the form of securities. The rate on the
loan is fixed at the beginning of the transaction, and there is an irrevocable commitment to return the equivalent securities
subject to the repayment of the loan. During the term of the agreement the Bank monitors the fair value of the collateral
securities and may call for additional collateral or be required to return collateral based on the movement in its market value.
Fixed-term loans are primarily investments made with commercial banks. Also included in this category are investments made
with central banks, international institutions and other public sector organisations. This includes advances made as part of
committed and uncommitted standby facilities. These loans are recognised in the balance sheet total “Loans and advances”,
which also includes notice accounts (see note 6).
Government and other securities are debt securities issued by governments, international institutions, other public sector
institutions, commercial banks and corporates. They include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, fixed and floating rate
bonds, covered bonds and asset-backed securities.

Loans and advances comprise fixed-term loans to commercial banks, advances and notice accounts. Advances relate to committed
and uncommitted standby facilities which the Bank provides for its customers. Notice accounts are very short-term financial
assets, typically having a notice period of three days or less.
Fixed-term loans and advances are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss. Notice accounts are designated as
loans and receivables and are included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.

The amount of the change in fair value recognised in the profit and loss account on fixed-term loans and advances is
SDR 12.3 million (2010: SDR –11.6 million).

7. Derivative financial instruments
The Bank uses the following types of derivative instruments for economic hedging and trading purposes.
Interest rate and bond futures are contractual agreements to receive or pay a net amount based on changes in interest rates or
bond prices on a future date. Futures contracts are settled daily with the exchange. Associated margin payments are settled by
cash or marketable securities.
Currency and gold options are contractual agreements under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation,
to either buy (call option) or sell (put option), by or on a set date, a specific amount of a currency or gold at a predetermined
price. In consideration, the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.

BIS 81st Annual Report

161

Currency and gold swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps are bilateral contractual agreements to
exchange cash flows related to currencies, gold or interest rates (for example, fixed rate for floating rate). Cross-currency interest
rate swaps involve the exchange of cash flows related to a combination of interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Except for
certain currency and gold swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, no exchange of principal takes place.
Currency and gold forwards are bilateral contractual agreements involving the exchange of foreign currencies or gold at a future
date. This includes undelivered spot transactions.
Forward rate agreements are bilateral interest rate forward contracts that result in cash settlement at a future date for the
difference between a contracted rate of interest and the prevailing market rate.
Swaptions are bilateral options under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a
currency or interest rate swap at a predetermined price by or on a set date. In consideration, the seller receives a premium from
the purchaser.
In addition, the Bank sells products to its customers which contain embedded derivatives (see notes 10 and 11). Where the host
contract is not accounted for as held at fair value, embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract for accounting
purposes and treated as though they are regular derivatives. As such, the gold currency options embedded in gold dual currency
deposits are included within derivatives as currency and gold options.

Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs) are fixed rate investments at the BIS for quarterly maturities of up to 10 years.
Callable MTIs are MTIs that are callable at the option of the Bank at an exercise price of par, with call dates between June 2011
and December 2011 (2010: June 2010 and December 2010). The balance sheet total for callable MTIs includes the fair value of the
embedded interest rate option.
FIXBIS are fixed rate investments at the Bank for any maturities between one week and one year.
FRIBIS are floating rate investments at the Bank with maturities of one year or longer for which the interest rate is reset in line
with prevailing market conditions.
Fixed-term deposits are fixed rate investments at the BIS, typically with a maturity of less than one year.
Dual Currency Deposits (DCDs) are fixed-term deposits that are repayable on the maturity date either in the original currency or
at a fixed amount in a different currency at the option of the Bank. The balance sheet total for DCDs includes the fair value of the
embedded foreign exchange option. These deposits all mature between 4 April 2011 and 9 May 2011 (2010: between 21 April 2010
and 12 May 2010).
Sight and notice deposit accounts are very short-term financial liabilities, typically having a notice period of three days or less.
They are designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
The Bank acts as the sole market-maker in certain of its currency deposit liabilities and has undertaken to repay at fair value some
of these financial instruments, in whole or in part, at one to two business days’ notice.

A. Valuation of currency deposits
Currency deposits (other than sight and notice deposit accounts) are included in the balance sheet at fair value. This value differs
from the amount that the Bank is contractually obliged to pay at maturity to the holder of the deposit. The amount the Bank is
contractually obliged to pay at maturity in respect of its total currency deposits (including accrued interest to 31 March 2011) is
SDR 206,432.4 million (2010: SDR 193,896.3 million).
The Bank uses valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of its currency deposits. These valuation techniques comprise
discounted cash flow models and option pricing models. The discounted cash flow models value the expected cash flows of
financial instruments using discount factors that are partly derived from quoted interest rates (eg Libor and swap rates) and partly
based on assumptions about spreads at which each product is offered to and repurchased from customers.

164

BIS 81st Annual Report

The spread assumptions are based on recent market transactions in each product. Where the product series has been closed to
new investors (and thus there are no recent market transactions) the Bank uses the latest quoted spread for the series as the basis
for determining the appropriate model inputs.
The option pricing models include assumptions about volatilities that are derived from market quotes.

B. Impact of changes in the Bank’s creditworthiness
The fair value of the Bank’s liabilities would be affected by any change in its creditworthiness. If the Bank’s creditworthiness
deteriorated, the value of its liabilities would decrease, and the change in value would be reflected as a valuation movement in
the profit and loss account. The Bank regularly assesses its creditworthiness as part of its risk management processes. The Bank’s
assessment of its creditworthiness did not indicate a change which could have had an impact on the fair value of the Bank’s
liabilities during the period under review.

11. Gold deposits
Gold deposits placed with the Bank originate entirely from central banks. They are all designated as financial liabilities measured
at amortised cost.

12. Accounts payable
Accounts payable consist of financial transactions awaiting settlement, relating to short-term payables (typically payable within
three days or less) where transactions have been effected but cash has not yet been transferred. This includes assets that have
been purchased and liabilities that have been repurchased.

13. Other liabilities

15. Statutory reserves
The Bank’s Statutes provide for application of the Bank’s annual net profit by the Annual General Meeting on the proposal of the
Board of Directors to three specific reserve funds: the legal reserve fund, the general reserve fund and the special dividend
reserve fund; the remainder of the net profit after payment of any dividend is generally allocated to the free reserve fund.
Legal reserve fund. This fund is currently fully funded at 10% of the Bank’s paid-up capital.
General reserve fund. After payment of any dividend, 10% of the remainder of the Bank’s annual net profit currently must be
allocated to the general reserve fund. When the balance of this fund equals five times the Bank’s paid-up capital, (see note 14),
such annual contribution will decrease to 5% of the remainder of the annual net profit.
Special dividend reserve fund. A portion of the remainder of the annual net profit may be allocated to the special dividend reserve
fund, which shall be available, in case of need, for paying the whole or any part of a declared dividend. Dividends are normally
paid out of the Bank’s net profit.
Free reserve fund. After the above allocations have been made, any remaining unallocated net profit is generally transferred to
the free reserve fund.
Receipts from the subscription of the Bank’s shares are allocated to the legal reserve fund as necessary to keep it fully funded,
with the remainder being credited to the general reserve fund.
The free reserve fund, general reserve fund and legal reserve fund are available, in that order, to meet any losses incurred by the
Bank. In the event of liquidation of the Bank, the balances of the reserve funds (after the discharge of the liabilities of the Bank
and the costs of liquidation) would be divided among the Bank’s shareholders.

18. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment arrangements:
1. A final salary defined benefit pension arrangement for its staff. The pension arrangement is based on a fund without separate
legal personality, out of which benefits are paid. The fund assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of current and
former members of staff who participate in the arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all benefits due under the
arrangement.
2. An unfunded defined benefit arrangement for its Directors, whose entitlement is based on a minimum service period of four
years.
3. An unfunded post-employment health and accident benefit arrangement for its staff. Entitlement to this arrangement is based
in principle on the employee remaining in service up to 50 years of age and the completion of a minimum service period of 10
years.
All arrangements are valued annually by independent actuaries.

Long-term medical cost inflation assumption

The assumed increases in staff salaries, Directors’ pensionable remuneration and pensions payable incorporate an inflation
assumption of 1.5% at 31 March 2011 (2010: 1.5%).
The expected rate of return on fund assets is based on long-term expectations for inflation, interest rates, risk premia and asset
allocations. The estimate takes into consideration historical returns and is determined in conjunction with the fund’s independent
actuaries.
The assumption for medical inflation has a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the profit and loss account. A 1%
change in the assumption for medical inflation compared to that used for the 2010/11 calculation would have the following effects:

included at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and the USD exchange rate into SDR). At 31 March 2011 gold
bars held under earmark amounted to 297 tonnes of fine gold (2010: 212 tonnes).
The financial instruments held under the above arrangements are deposited with external custodians, either central banks or
commercial institutions.
In addition to the off-balance sheet items listed above, the Bank also manages portfolios of BIS currency deposits on behalf of its
customers. These totalled SDR 5,776.7 million at 31 March 2011 (2010: SDR 5,713.0 million). The assets in these portfolios are
included in the balance sheet under the heading “Currency deposits”.

32. Commitments
The Bank provides a number of committed standby facilities for its customers on a collateralised or uncollateralised basis.
As at 31 March 2011 the outstanding commitments to extend credit under these committed standby facilities amounted to
SDR 2,287.7 million (2010: SDR 4,919.8 million), of which SDR 189.4 million was uncollateralised (2010: SDR 2,420.7 million).

33. The fair value hierarchy
The Bank categorises its financial instrument fair value measurements using a hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs
used in measuring fair value. The valuation is categorised at the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement in its entirety. The fair value hierarchy used by the Bank comprises the following levels:
Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
Level 2 – inputs other than those in level 1 which are observable for the financial instrument either directly (ie as a price) or
indirectly (ie derived from prices for similar financial instruments). This includes observable interest rates, spreads and volatilities.
Level 3 – inputs that are not observable in financial markets.

The Bank considers published price quotations in active markets as the best evidence of fair value. The financial instruments
valued using active market quotes are categorised as level 1.
Where reliable published price quotations are not available for a financial instrument, the Bank determines fair value by using
market standard valuation techniques. These valuation techniques include the use of discounted cash flow models as well as
other standard market valuation methods. Where financial models are used, the Bank aims at making maximum use of observable
market inputs. The financial instruments valued in this manner are categorised as level 2.
A small percentage of the Bank’s financial instruments valuations are produced using valuation techniques that utilise significant
unobservable inputs. The financial instruments valued in this manner are categorised as level 3. The financial instruments
categorised as level 3 at 31 March 2010 and 2011 comprise illiquid corporate bonds.
The accuracy of the Bank’s valuations is ensured through an independent price verification exercise performed by the valuation
control function.

The Bank assesses its capital adequacy continuously. The assessment is supported by an annual capital and business planning
process.
The Bank has implemented a risk framework that is consistent with the revised International Convergence of Capital Measurement
and Capital Standards (Basel II Framework) issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in June 2006. The implementation
includes all three pillars of the Framework, and takes the particular scope and nature of the Bank’s activities into account. Since
the Bank is not subject to national banking supervisory regulation, the application of Pillar 2 is limited to the Bank’s own
assessment of capital adequacy. This assessment is based primarily on an economic capital methodology which is more
comprehensive and geared to a substantially higher solvency level than the minimum Pillar 1 capital level required by the Basel II
Framework.

2. Economic capital
The Bank’s own assessment of its capital adequacy is performed on the basis of its economic capital frameworks for market risk,
credit risk, operational risk and other risks. These are designed to determine the amount of equity needed to absorb losses arising
from its exposures to a statistical level of confidence consistent with the objective of maintaining superior credit quality. The
Bank’s economic capital frameworks measure economic capital to a 99.995% confidence level assuming a one-year horizon,
except for other risks. The amount of economic capital set aside for other risks is based on Management’s assessment of risks
which are not, or not fully, reflected in the Bank’s economic capital calculations.
The following table summarises the Bank’s economic capital utilisation for credit risk, market risk, operational risk and other risks:

For credit risk, the Bank has adopted the advanced internal ratings-based approach for the majority of its exposures. Under this
approach, the risk weighting for a transaction is determined by the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own
estimates for key inputs. For certain exposures, the Bank has adopted the standardised approach. Under this approach, risk
weightings are mapped to exposure types.
Risk-weighted assets for market risk are derived following an internal models approach. For operational risk, the advanced
measurement approach is used. Both these approaches rely on value-at-risk (VaR) methodologies. The minimum capital
requirements are derived from the VaR figures and are translated into risk-weighted assets taking into account the 8% minimum
capital requirement.
More details on the assumptions underlying the calculations are provided in the sections on credit risk, market risk and operational
risk.

4. Tier 1 capital ratio

As required by the Basel II Framework, expected loss is calculated for credit risk exposures subject to the advanced internal
ratings-based approach. The expected loss is calculated at the balance sheet date taking into account the impairment provision
which is reflected in the Bank’s financial statements. Note 2B to the financial statements provides details of the impairment
provision. In accordance with the requirements of the Basel II Framework, the expected loss is compared with the impairment
provision and any shortfall is deducted from the Bank’s Tier 1 capital. At 31 March 2011 the impairment provision exceeded the
expected loss.
The Bank maintains a very high creditworthiness and performs a comprehensive capital assessment considering its specific
characteristics. As such, it maintains a capital position substantially in excess of the minimum requirement.

Risk management

1. Risks faced by the Bank
The Bank supports its customers, predominantly central banks, monetary authorities and international financial institutions, in the
management of their reserves and related financial activities.
Banking activities form an essential element of meeting the Bank’s objectives and, as such, ensure its financial strength and
independence. The BIS engages in banking activities that are customer-related as well as activities that are related to the
investment of its equity, each of which may give rise to financial risk comprising credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The
Bank is also exposed to operational risk.
Within the risk framework defined by the Board of Directors, the Management of the Bank has established risk management
policies designed to ensure that risks are identified, appropriately measured and controlled as well as monitored and reported.

2. Risk management approach and organisation
The Bank maintains superior credit quality and adopts a prudent approach to financial risk-taking, by:

•
•
•
•

maintaining an exceptionally strong capital position;

•

maintaining a high level of liquidity.

investing its assets predominantly in high credit quality financial instruments;
seeking to diversify its assets across a range of sectors;
adopting a conservative approach to its tactical market risk-taking and carefully managing market risk associated with the
Bank’s strategic positions, which include its gold holdings; and

A. Organisation
Under Article 39 of the Bank’s Statutes, the General Manager is responsible to the Board for the management of the Bank, and is
assisted by the Deputy General Manager. The Deputy General Manager is responsible for the Bank’s independent risk control and
compliance functions. The General Manager and the Deputy General Manager are supported by senior management advisory
committees.
The key advisory committees are the Executive Committee, the Finance Committee and the Compliance and Operational Risk
Committee. The first two committees are chaired by the General Manager and the third by the Deputy General Manager, and all
include other senior members of the Bank’s Management. The Executive Committee advises the General Manager primarily on
the Bank’s strategic planning and the allocation of resources, as well as on decisions related to the broad financial objectives for
the banking activities and operational risk management. The Finance Committee advises the General Manager on the financial
management and policy issues related to the banking business, including the allocation of economic capital to risk categories.
The Compliance and Operational Risk Committee acts as an advisory committee to the Deputy General Manager and ensures the
coordination of compliance matters and operational risk management throughout the Bank.
The independent risk control function for financial risks is performed by the Risk Control unit. The independent operational risk
control function is shared between Risk Control, which maintains the operational risk quantification, and the Compliance and
Operational Risk Unit. Both units report directly to the Deputy General Manager.
The Bank’s compliance function is performed by the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit. The objective of this function is to
provide reasonable assurance that the activities of the Bank and its staff conform to applicable laws and regulations, the BIS
Statutes, the Bank’s Code of Conduct and other internal rules, policies and relevant standards of sound practice.
The Compliance and Operational Risk Unit identifies and assesses compliance risks and guides and educates staff on compliance
issues. The Head of the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit also has a direct reporting line to the Audit Committee, which is
an advisory committee to the Board of Directors.
The Finance unit and the Legal Service complement the Bank’s risk management. The Finance unit operates an independent
valuation control function, produces the Bank’s financial statements and controls the Bank’s expenditure by setting and monitoring
the annual budget. The objective of the independent valuation control function is to ensure that the Bank’s valuations comply with
its valuation policy and procedures, and that the processes and procedures which influence the Bank’s valuations conform to best

The Legal Service provides legal advice and support covering a wide range of issues relating to the Bank’s activities. The Legal
Service has a direct reporting line to the General Manager.
The Internal Audit function reviews internal control procedures and reports on how they comply with internal standards and
industry best practices. The scope of internal audit work includes the review of risk management procedures, internal control
systems, information systems and governance processes. Internal Audit has a direct reporting line to the Audit Committee and is
responsible to the General Manager and the Deputy General Manager.

B. Risk monitoring and reporting
The Bank’s financial and operational risk profile, position and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis by the relevant
units. Financial risk and compliance reports aimed at various management levels are regularly provided to enable Management
to adequately assess the Bank’s risk profile and financial condition.
Management reports financial and risk information to the Board of Directors on a monthly and a quarterly basis. Furthermore,
the Audit Committee receives regular reports from Internal Audit, the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit and the Finance unit.
The Banking and Risk Management Committee, another advisory committee to the Board, receives an annual report from the Risk
Control unit. The preparation of reports is subject to comprehensive policies and procedures, thus ensuring strong controls.

C. Risk methodologies
The Bank revalues virtually all of its financial assets to fair value on a daily basis and reviews its valuations monthly, taking into
account necessary adjustments for impairment. It uses a comprehensive range of quantitative methodologies for valuing financial
instruments and for measuring risk to its net profit and equity. The Bank reassesses its quantitative methodologies in the light of
its changing risk environment and evolving best practice.
The Bank’s model validation policy defines the roles and responsibilities and processes related to the implementation of new or
materially changed risk models.
A key methodology used by the Bank to measure and manage risk is the calculation of economic capital based on value-at-risk
(VaR) techniques. VaR expresses the statistical estimate of the maximum potential loss on the current positions of the Bank
measured to a specified level of confidence and a specified time horizon.
The Bank’s economic capital calculation is designed to measure the amount of equity needed to absorb losses arising from its
exposures to a statistical level of confidence determined by the Bank’s aim to remain of the highest creditworthiness.
The Bank assesses its capital adequacy on the basis of economic capital frameworks for market risk, credit risk, operational risk
and other risks, supplemented by sensitivity and risk factor analyses. The Bank’s economic capital frameworks measure economic
capital to a 99.995% confidence interval assuming a one-year holding period.
The Bank allocates economic capital to the above risk categories. An additional amount of economic capital is set aside based on
Management’s assessment of risks which are not, or not fully, reflected in the economic capital calculations.
A comprehensive stress testing framework complements the Bank’s risk assessment including its VaR and economic capital
calculations for financial risk. The Bank’s key market risk factors and credit exposures are stress-tested. The stress testing includes
the analysis of severe historical and adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, as well as sensitivity tests of extreme but
still plausible movements of the key risk factors identified. The Bank also performs stress tests related to liquidity risk.

BIS 81st Annual Report

3. Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to meet its obligations in accordance with the agreed contractual terms and
conditions. A financial asset is considered past due when a counterparty fails to make a payment on the contractual due date.
The Bank manages credit risk within a framework and policies set by the Board of Directors and Management. These are
complemented by more detailed guidelines and procedures at the level of the independent risk control function.

A. Credit risk assessment
Credit risk is continuously controlled at both a counterparty and an aggregated level. As part of the independent risk control
function, individual counterparty credit assessments are performed subject to a well defined internal rating process, involving 18
rating grades. As part of this process, counterparty financial statements and market information are analysed. The rating
methodologies depend on the nature of the counterparty. Based on the internal rating and specific counterparty features, the Bank
sets a series of credit limits covering individual counterparties and countries. Internal ratings are assigned to all counterparties.
In principle, the ratings and related limits are reviewed at least annually. The main assessment criterion in these reviews is the
ability of the counterparties to meet interest and principal repayment obligations in a timely manner.
Credit risk limits at the counterparty level are approved by the Bank’s Management and fit within a framework set by the Board
of Directors.
On an aggregated level credit risk, including default and country transfer risk, is measured, monitored and controlled based on
the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit risk. To calculate economic capital for credit risk, the Bank uses a portfolio VaR
model. Management limits the Bank’s overall exposure to credit risk by allocating an amount of economic capital to credit risk.

B. Default risk
The following tables show the exposure of the Bank to default risk, without taking into account any collateral held or other credit
enhancements available to the Bank. Credit risk is further mitigated through the use of collateral and legally enforceable netting
or setoff agreements. The corresponding assets and liabilities are not offset on the balance sheet.
The exposures set out in the tables below are based on the carrying value of the assets on the balance sheet as categorised by
sector, geographical region and credit quality. The carrying value is the fair value of the financial instruments, including derivatives,
except in the case of very short-term financial instruments (sight and notice accounts) and gold, which are shown at amortised
cost net of any impairment charge. Commitments are reported at their notional amounts. Gold and gold loans exclude gold bar
assets held in custody, and accounts receivable do not include unsettled liability issues, because these items do not represent
credit exposures of the Bank.
The vast majority of the Bank’s assets are invested in securities issued by G10 governments and financial institutions rated A– or
above by at least one of the major external credit assessment institutions. Limitations on the number of high-quality counterparties
in these sectors mean that the Bank is exposed to single-name concentration risk.
Gold loans include a provision of SDR 29.0 million following an impairment review as at 31 March 2011 (31 March 2010:
SDR 23.5 million). The increase in the provision during the reporting period ended 31 March 2011 is due to changes in gold prices
and exchange rates.
As at 31 March 2011, no financial assets were considered past due (31 March 2010: nil).

C. Credit risk mitigation
Credit risk is mitigated through the use of collateral and legally enforceable netting or setoff agreements. The corresponding
assets and liabilities are not offset on the balance sheet.
The Bank requires counterparties to provide collateral, under reverse repurchase agreements, some derivative financial instrument
contracts and certain drawn-down facility agreements, to mitigate counterparty default risk in accordance with the respective
policies and procedures. During the term of the agreement, the Bank monitors the fair value of the collateral securities and may
call for further collateral or be required to return collateral based on the movement in its market value.
The Bank mitigates settlement risk by using established clearing centres and by settling transactions where possible through a
delivery versus payment settlement mechanism. Daily settlement risk limits are monitored on a continuous basis.
The table below shows the collateral obtained by the Bank. It excludes transactions which have yet to settle (on which neither
cash nor collateral has been exchanged).

The Bank is allowed to sell or pledge collateral obtained, but must deliver equivalent financial instruments upon expiry of the
contract. The Bank accepts sovereign securities and cash as collateral for derivatives. Eligible collateral for reverse repurchase
agreements comprises sovereign and supranational debt as well as US agency securities. Eligible collateral for loans and advances
includes currency deposits with the Bank as well as units in the BIS Investment Pools (BISIPs) and securities in portfolios managed
by the BIS.

As at 31 March 2011 the total amount of undrawn facilities which could be drawn down subject to collateralisation by the
counterparty was SDR 2,098.3 million (2010: SDR 2,499.1 million).
The Bank did not provide collateral on any of its financial instrument contracts as at 31 March 2011 (2010: nil).

D. Economic capital for credit risk
The Bank determines economic capital for credit risk using a VaR methodology on the basis of a portfolio VaR model, assuming

E. Minimum capital requirements for credit risk
Exposure to sovereigns, banks and corporates
For the calculation of risk-weighted assets for exposures to banks, sovereigns and corporates, the Bank has adopted an approach
that is consistent with the advanced internal ratings-based approach.
As a general rule, under this approach risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying the credit risk exposures with risk
weights derived from the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs. These estimates for
key inputs are also relevant to the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit risk.
The credit risk exposure for a transaction or position is referred to as the exposure at default (EAD). The Bank determines the EAD
as the notional amount of all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures, except derivatives. The EAD for derivatives is calculated
using an approach consistent with the internal models method proposed under the Basel II Framework. In line with this
methodology, the Bank calculates effective expected positive exposures that are then multiplied by a factor alpha as set out in
the Framework.
Key inputs to the risk weight function are a counterparty’s estimated one-year probability of default (PD) as well as the estimated
loss-given-default (LGD) and maturity for each transaction.
Due to the high credit quality of the Bank’s investments and the conservative credit risk management process at the BIS, the Bank
is not in a position to estimate PDs and LGDs based on its own default experience. The Bank calibrates counterparty PD estimates
through a mapping of internal rating grades to external credit assessments taking external default data into account. Similarly,
LGD estimates are derived from external data. Where appropriate, these estimates are adjusted to reflect the risk-reducing effects
of collateral obtained giving consideration to market price volatility, remargining and revaluation frequency.
During the reporting period methodological refinements have been implemented to shift the recognition of the risk-reducing
effects of collateral obtained for derivative contracts, reverse repurchase agreements and collateralised advances to the EAD. In
addition, refinements have been implemented with the aim of extending the scope for the recognition of netting agreements.
The table below details the calculation of risk-weighted assets. The exposures are measured taking netting and collateral
benefits into account. The total amount of exposures reported in the table as at 31 March 2011 includes SDR 463.0 million for
interest rate contracts (31 March 2010: SDR 4,687.7 million) and SDR 287.5 million for FX and gold contracts (31 March 2010:
SDR 6,028.4 million).

F. Securitisation exposures
The Bank only invests in highly rated securitisation exposures based on traditional, ie non-synthetic, securitisation structures.
Given the scope of the Bank’s activities, risk-weighted assets under the Basel II Framework are determined according to the
standardised approach for securitisation. Under this approach, external credit assessments of the securities are used to determine
the relevant risk weights. External credit assessment institutions used for this purpose are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard
& Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Risk-weighted assets are then derived as the product of the notional amounts of the exposures and
the associated risk weights.
The following table shows the Bank’s investments in securitisation analysed by type of securitised assets:

4. Market risk
The Bank is exposed to market risk through adverse movements in market prices. The main components of the Bank’s market risk
are gold price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The Bank measures market risk and calculates economic capital
based on a VaR methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Risk factor volatilities and correlations are estimated
using a one-year observation period. Furthermore, the Bank computes sensitivities to certain market risk factors.
In line with the Bank’s objective of maintaining its superior credit quality, economic capital is measured at the 99.995% confidence
interval assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank’s Management manages market risk economic capital usage within a
framework set by the Board of Directors. VaR limits are supplemented by operating limits.
VaR models depend on statistical assumptions and the quality of available market data and, while forward-looking, they extrapolate
from past events.
To ensure that models provide a reliable measure of potential losses over the one-year time horizon, the Bank has established a
comprehensive regular backtesting framework, comparing daily performance with corresponding VaR estimates. The results are
analysed and reported to Management.
The Bank also supplements its market risk measurement based on VaR modelling and related economic capital calculations with
a series of stress tests. These include severe historical scenarios, adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios and sensitivity
tests of gold price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements.

A. Gold price risk
Gold price risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in the price of gold.
The Bank is exposed to gold price risk principally through its holdings of gold investment assets, which amount to 119 tonnes
(2010: 120 tonnes). These gold investment assets are held in custody or placed on deposit with commercial banks. At 31 March 2011
the Bank’s net gold investment assets amounted to SDR 3,451.2 million (2010: SDR 2,811.2 million), approximately 21% of its
equity (2010: 18%). The Bank sometimes also has small exposures to gold price risk emerging from its banking activities with
central and commercial banks. Gold price risk is measured within the Bank’s VaR methodology, including its economic capital
framework and stress tests.

B. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates including credit spreads.
The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk through the interest bearing assets relating to the management of its equity held in its
investment portfolios and investments relating to its banking portfolios. The investment portfolios are managed using a fixed
duration benchmark of bonds.
The Bank measures and monitors interest rate risk using a VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses taking into account
movements in relevant money market rates, government bonds, swap rates and credit spreads.
The tables below show the impact on the Bank’s equity of a 1% upward shift in the relevant yield curve per time band:

C. Foreign exchange risk
The Bank’s functional currency, the SDR, is a composite currency comprising fixed amounts of USD, EUR, JPY and GBP. Currency
risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in exchange rates. The Bank is exposed to foreign
exchange risk primarily through the assets relating to the management of its equity. The Bank is also exposed to foreign exchange
risk through managing its customer deposits and through acting as an intermediary in foreign exchange transactions between
central and commercial banks. The Bank reduces its foreign exchange exposures by matching the relevant assets to the constituent
currencies of the SDR on a regular basis, and by limiting currency exposures arising from customer deposits and foreign exchange
transaction intermediation.
Foreign exchange risk is measured and monitored based on the Bank’s VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses considering
movements in key foreign exchange rates.
The following tables show the Bank’s assets and liabilities by currency and gold exposure. The net foreign exchange and gold
position in these tables therefore includes the Bank’s gold investments. To determine the Bank’s net foreign exchange exposure,
the gold amounts need to be removed. The SDR-neutral position is then deducted from the net foreign exchange position
excluding gold to arrive at the net currency exposure of the Bank on an SDR-neutral basis.

D. Economic capital for market risk
The Bank measures market risk based on a VaR methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique taking correlations
between risk factors into account. Economic capital for market risk is also calculated following this methodology measured to the
99.995% confidence interval and assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank measures its gold price risk relative to changes
in the USD value of gold. The foreign exchange risk component, resulting from changes in the USD exchange rate versus the
SDR, is included in the measurement of foreign exchange risk. The table below shows the key figures of the Bank’s exposure to
market risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years.

E. Minimum capital requirements for market risk
For the calculation of minimum capital requirements for market risk under the Basel II Framework, the Bank has adopted a
banking book approach consistent with the scope and nature of its business activities. Consequently, market risk-weighted assets
are determined for gold price risk and foreign exchange risk, but not interest rate risk. The related minimum capital requirement
is derived using the VaR-based internal models method. Under this method, VaR calculations are performed using the Bank’s VaR
methodology, assuming a 99% confidence interval, a 10-day holding period and a one-year historical observation period.
The actual minimum capital requirement is derived as the higher of the VaR on the calculation date and the average of the daily
VaR measures on each of the preceding 60 business days (including the calculation date) subject to a multiplication factor of three
plus a potential add-on depending on backtesting results. For the period under consideration, the number of backtesting outliers
observed remained within the range where no add-on is required. The table below summarises the market risk development
relevant to the calculation of minimum capital requirements and the related risk-weighted assets over the reporting period.

5. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises when the Bank may not be able to meet expected or unexpected current or future cash flows and collateral
needs without affecting its daily operations or its financial condition.
Outstanding balances in the currency and gold deposits from central banks, international organisations and other public
institutions are the key drivers of the size of the Bank’s balance sheet. The Bank has undertaken to repurchase at fair value certain
of its currency deposit instruments at one or two business days’ notice. The Bank has developed a liquidity management
framework based on a statistical model underpinned by conservative assumptions with regard to cash inflows and the liquidity
of liabilities. Within this framework, the Board of Directors has set a limit for the Bank’s liquidity ratio which requires liquid assets
to be at least 100% of the potential liquidity requirement. In addition, liquidity stress tests assuming extreme withdrawal scenarios
are performed. These stress tests specify additional liquidity requirements to be met by holdings of liquid assets. The Bank’s
liquidity has consistently been materially above its minimum liquidity ratio and the requirements of its stress tests.
The Bank’s currency and gold deposits, principally from central banks and international institutions, comprise 93% (2010: 93%) of
its total liabilities. At 31 March 2011 currency and gold deposits originated from 171 depositors (2010: 174). Within these deposits,
there are significant individual customer concentrations, with four customers each contributing in excess of 5% of the total on a
settlement date basis (2010: six customers).
The following tables show the maturity profile of cash flows for assets and liabilities. The amounts disclosed are the undiscounted
cash flows to which the Bank is committed.

6. Operational risk
Operational risk is defined by the Bank as the risk of financial loss, or damage to the Bank’s reputation, or both, resulting from
one or more risk causes, as outlined below:

•

Human factors: insufficient personnel, lack of requisite knowledge, skills or experience, inadequate training and development,
inadequate supervision, loss of key personnel, inadequate succession planning, or lack of integrity or ethical standards.

•

Failed or inadequate processes: a process is poorly designed or unsuitable, or is not properly documented, understood,
implemented, followed or enforced.

•
•

Failed or inadequate systems: a system is poorly designed, unsuitable or unavailable, or does not operate as intended.
External events: the occurrence of an event having an adverse impact on the Bank but outside its control.

Operational risk includes legal risk, but excludes strategic risk.
The Bank’s operational risk management framework, policies and procedures comprise the management and measurement of
operational risk, including the determination of the relevant key parameters and inputs, business continuity planning and the
monitoring of key risk indicators.
The Bank has established a procedure of immediate reporting for operational risk-related incidents. The Compliance and
Operational Risk Unit develops action plans with the respective units and follows up on their implementation on a regular basis.
For the measurement of operational risk economic capital and operational risk-weighted assets, the Bank has adopted a VaR
approach using a Monte Carlo simulation technique that is consistent with the advanced measurement approach proposed under
the Basel II Framework. In line with the assumptions of the Basel II Framework, the quantification of operational risk does not take
reputational risk into account. Internal and external loss data, scenario estimates and control self-assessments to reflect changes
in the business and control environment of the Bank are key inputs in the calculations. In quantifying its operational risk, the Bank
does not take potential protection it may obtain from insurance into account.

BIS 81st Annual Report

A. Economic capital for operational risk
Consistent with the parameters used in the calculation of economic capital for financial risk, the Bank measures economic capital
for operational risk to the 99.995% confidence interval assuming a one-year holding period. The table below shows the key figures
of the Bank’s exposure to operational risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years.

Independent auditor’s report
to the Board of Directors and to the General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements, Basel
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Bank for International Settlements,
which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 March 2011, and the profit and loss account, the
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies
and other explanatory information.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements
in accordance with the Statutes and with the principles of valuation described under significant
accounting policies in the notes, and for such internal control as management determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal
control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the
Bank for International Settlements as at 31 March 2011 and of its financial performance and its
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the accounting principles described in the
notes to the financial statements and the Statutes of the Bank.
