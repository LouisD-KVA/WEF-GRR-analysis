mitigate them and the critical role of the
younger generation. To do so, it offers
deep-dive analytical insights into
interconnected risks with the potential
to have systemic consequences in the
geopolitical, socio-economic and
digital spheres. The report features an
analysis of a survey of over 700 leaders
and decision-makers from the World
Economic Forum’s global
multistakeholder community on 31
selected global risks. For the first time,
survey respondents were asked
directly to nominate their risks of
highest concern, which placed
economic and social issues firmly at
the top.

Our lives are changing at an
unprecedented pace. Transformational
shifts in our economic, environmental,
geopolitical, societal and technological
systems offer unparalleled
opportunities, but the interconnections
among them also imply enhanced
systemic risks. Stakeholders from
across business, government and civil
society face an evolving imperative in
understanding and managing
emerging global risks which, by
definition, respect no national
boundaries.
Conceptual models are needed to
define, characterize and measure the
potential negative impacts of
interconnected global risks. It is in this
spirit that I present the Global Risks
2014 report, now in its ninth edition.
This report aims to enhance our
understanding of how a
comprehensive set of global risks is
evolving, how their interaction can lead
to unexpected and often systemic
impacts, and the trade-offs involved in
managing them.
Global Risks 2014 is a stimulus for
reflection for policy-makers, chief
executive officers, senior executives
and thought leaders around the world.
It is also a call to action to improve
international efforts at coordination and
collaboration, going beyond the
traditional roles and responsibilities of
the public and private sectors to equip
institutions to understand, map,
monitor, manage and mitigate global
risks.
The report emphasizes the importance
of understanding systemic risks,
long-term thinking to address and

I would like to thank the partners of the
Global Risks 2014 report, without
whose expert contributions this report
would not have been possible: Marsh &
McLennan Companies, Swiss Re and
Zurich Insurance Group, as well as the
National University of Singapore,
Oxford Martin School at the University
of Oxford and the Wharton Risk
Management and Decision Processes
Center at the University of
Pennsylvania. My appreciation also
goes to the World Economic Forum’s
Network of Global Agenda Councils for
their important insights, under the
leadership of Martina Gmür. I am also
grateful to Jennifer Blanke, Chief
Economist, and the Global Risks 2014

Thierry Geiger and Tania Gutknecht for
their critical contributions to making this
report possible.
Moving from urgency-driven risk
management to more collaborative
efforts to strengthen risk resilience
would benefit global society. Together,
leaders from business, government
and civil society have the foresight and
collaborative spirit to shape our
global future.

Executive Summary
The Global Risks 2014 report highlights how global risks are
not only interconnected but also have systemic impacts. To
manage global risks effectively and build resilience to their
impacts, better efforts are needed to understand, measure
and foresee the evolution of interdependencies between
risks, supplementing traditional risk-management tools with
new concepts designed for uncertain environments. If global
risks are not effectively addressed, their social, economic
and political fallouts could be far-reaching, as exemplified by
the continuing impacts of the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
The systemic nature of our most significant risks calls for
procedures and institutions that are globally coordinated yet
locally flexible. As international systems of finance, supply
chains, health, energy, the Internet and the environment
become more complex and interdependent, their level of
resilience determines whether they become bulwarks of
global stability or amplifiers of cascading shocks.
Strengthening resilience requires overcoming collective
action challenges through international cooperation among
business, government and civil society.

Box 1: Objectives of the Global Risks 2014 Report
The world faces risks that can be addressed only by
long-term thinking and collaboration among business,
governments and civil society. The Global Risks 2014
report aims to support this process by:
– exploring the nature of systemic risks
– mapping 31 global risks according to the level of
concern they arouse, their likelihood and potential
impact, as well as the strength of the
interconnections between them
– looking in-depth at the ways in which three
constellations of global risk – centred on youth,
cyberspace and geopolitics – could interplay and
have systemic impact

Mapping Global Risks in 2014
Based on a survey of the World Economic Forum’s
multistakeholder communities, the report maps 31 global
risks according to level of concern, likelihood and impact and
interconnections among them.
– The risks of highest concern to respondents are fiscal
crises in key economies, structurally high unemployment
and underemployment, and water crises (Table 1).

Note: From a list of 31 risks, survey respondents were asked to identify the five they
are most concerned about.

– The risks considered high impact and high likelihood
are mostly environmental and economic in nature: greater
incidence of extreme weather events, failure of climate
change mitigation and adaptation, water crises, severe
income disparity, structurally high unemployment and
underemployment and fiscal crises in key economies.
Female respondents perceived almost all global risks as
both more likely and more impactful than did males,
especially in the environmental category. Younger
individuals gave higher scores for the impact of almost all
of the risks, particularly environmental risks, such as
water crises, greater incidence of natural catastrophes,
the loss of biodiversity and greater incidence of extreme
weather events.
– The risks perceived to be most interconnected with
other risks are macroeconomic – fiscal crises, and
structural unemployment and underemployment – with
strong links between this macroeconomic risk nexus and
social issues, such as rising income inequality and
political and social instability. The failure of global
governance emerges as a central risk that is connected
to many different issues. Mapping perceived
interconnections between risks helps to understand the
potential transmission channels between them.
– The decline of trust in institutions, lack of leadership,
persisting gender inequalities and data mismanagement
were among trends to watch, according to survey
respondents. Experts added further concerns including
various forms of pollution, and accidents or abuse
involving new technologies, such as synthetic biology,
automated vehicles and 3-D printing.

Three Risks in Focus
Of the many conceivable ways in which possible
interconnections and interdependencies between global
risks could play out systemically over the 10-year horizon
considered by this report, three are explored in depth:
– Instabilities in an increasingly multipolar world:
Changing demographics, growing middle classes and
fiscal constraints will place increasing domestic demands
on governments, deepening requirements for internal
reform and shaping international relations. Set against the
rise of regional powers, an era of greater economic
pragmatism and national self-protection might increase
inter-state friction and aggravate a global governance
vacuum. This may hinder progress on cross-cutting,
long-term challenges, and lead to increased inefficiencies
and friction costs in strategically important sectors, such
as healthcare, financial services and energy. Managing
this risk will require flexibility, fresh thinking and
multistakeholder communication.
– Generation lost? The generation coming of age in the
2010s faces high unemployment and precarious job
situations, hampering their efforts to build a future and
raising the risk of social unrest. In advanced economies,
the large number of graduates from expensive and
outmoded educational systems – graduating with high
debts and mismatched skills – points to a need to adapt
and integrate professional and academic education. In
developing countries, an estimated two-thirds of the
youth are not fulfilling their economic potential. The
generation of digital natives is full of ambition to improve
the world but feels disconnected from traditional politics;
their ambition needs to be harnessed if systemic risks are
to be addressed.
– Digital disintegration: So far, cyberspace has proved
resilient to attacks, but the underlying dynamic of the
online world has always been that it is easier to attack
than defend. The world may be only one disruptive
technology away from attackers gaining a runaway
advantage, meaning the Internet would cease to be a
trusted medium for communication or commerce. Fresh
thinking at all levels on how to preserve, protect and
govern the common good of a trusted cyberspace must
be developed.
Collaborative multistakeholder action is needed. Wide
variance in how risks are identified and managed still exists.
Businesses, governments and civil society alike can improve
how they approach risk by taking steps such as opening
lines of communication with each other to build trust,
systematically learning from others’ experiences, and finding
ways to incentivize long-term thinking. By offering a
framework for decision-makers to look at risks in a holistic
manner, the Global Risks 2014 report aims to provide a
platform for dialogue and to stimulate action.

Global Risks 2014

Introduction
Accelerating change in the 21st century has bound
countries, economies and businesses ever more tightly
together through better infrastructure, faster and more
efficient communication systems, and closer trade and
investment links. Innovations such as the Internet and
mobile phone have boosted productivity, created new
business opportunities and enhanced access to information.
Economic growth has lifted millions of people out of poverty.
Yet the same dynamic that lies behind these gains –
everything being more connected and interdependent
– also threatens to undermine them. Economic growth,
for example, may be inexorably undermining its own
foundations through its negative side-effects on ecosystems,
biodiversity and the climate – effects that cannot be stopped
at national borders. Disruptions in the online environment are
becoming as impactful as those in the physical world, if
not more.
Since 2006, the Global Risks report has been calling
attention to global risks that can be systemic in nature,
causing breakdowns of entire systems and not only their
component parts.
These risks can come from many sources. The greater the
interdependencies between countries and industries, the
greater the potential for events to bring about unforeseen,
cascading consequences. The year 2013 alone witnessed
a number of illustrations of such risks, bringing significant
losses in terms of both human life and wealth. The fiscal
crisis in the United States (US), the subsiding threat of
sovereign default in eurozone countries and popular protests
in emerging markets all presented economic risks far
beyond national borders. Typhoon Haiyan took a heavy toll
on the Philippines, even as global leaders debated climate
change in Warsaw in November 2013. Syria’s refugee crisis
destabilized the entire Middle East. Revelations about data
leakage and new forms of espionage created geopolitical
tensions that may yet have far-reaching implications in the
years to come. These events have painfully emphasized that
the world is not equipped to deal with global risks.
This year, as in past editions, the Global Risks report
represents a step in a continuous process of improving
how global risks and their interconnections can be put
on decision-makers’ radar screens, to provide a basis for
dialogue on how governments, business and civil society
can work together effectively to build resilience and mitigate
any negative effects accruing from them.

Part 1 of the report presents the results of this year’s
Global Risks Perceptions Survey, enumerating the 10
risks that respondents nominated as being of highest
concern and also those they thought were most likely and
potentially impactful. It also maps the strength of perceived
interconnections among these risks to provide a holistic
picture of the complexity and broad framework needed to
understand their full potential impact. Finally, it includes a
“risks and trends to watch” section, noting additional issues
that respondents and experts were concerned about.
Part 2 selects and explores in detail three constellations
of global risks from the Risks Interconnections Map.
“Instabilities in an Increasingly Multipolar World” examines
possible interconnections among risks related to the
changing geopolitical order. “Generation Lost?” looks at how
high rates of youth unemployment risk stoking social unrest
and squandering human and economic potential, and how
the current situation will affect tomorrow’s youth. “Digital
Disintegration” imagines how cyberspace could become
severely affected through growing strength of attacks and
dwindling trust, at a huge cost to economies and societies.
The report also features contributions from several of the
Forum’s Global Agenda Councils, which bring together
thought leaders from academia, business, government,
international organizations and other civil society
organizations to set the global agendas in their respective
fields. The Councils’ contributions explore a selection
of specific risks that rank highly on the Global Risks
Perceptions Survey.
The multistakeholder collaboration required to address
global risks should take place through effective mechanisms
of global governance, as global risks can only be addressed
at a global level. Addressing risks effectively takes not only
a common understanding of the issues and a willingness
to work together but also the building of mutual trust and
nurturing of the capacity for long-term thinking – issues
further explored in the concluding section of Part 2.
Part 3 analyses the main learnings from past Global Risks
reports and looks ahead towards the 10th anniversary of the
report in 2015.
To work together to prepare and mitigate risks and
strengthen resilience, leaders in business, politics and civil
society all need to first identify, understand and monitor the
most important global risks. The Global Risks 2014 report
aims to facilitate this process and provide a platform
for dialogue.

Understanding Systemic
Risks in a Changing Global
Environment

Part 3

A global risk is defined as an occurrence that causes
significant negative impact for several countries and
industries over a time frame of up to 10 years. A key
characteristic of global risks is their potential systemic nature
– they have the potential to affect an entire system, as
opposed to individual parts and components – as defined in
Box 1.1 below.
Box 1.1: What Is Systemic Risk?
Systemic risk is the risk of “breakdowns in an entire
system, as opposed to breakdowns in individual parts
and components”.1 Systemic risks are characterized by:
– modest tipping points combining indirectly to
produce large failures
– risk-sharing or contagion, as one loss triggers a chain
of others
– “hysteresis”, or systems being unable to recover
equilibrium after a shock

Environmental Risks
Risks in the environmental category include both natural
disasters, such as earthquakes and geomagnetic storms,
and man-made risks such as collapsing ecosystems,
freshwater shortages, nuclear accidents and failure to
mitigate or adapt to climate change.
Geopolitical Risks
The geopolitical category covers the areas of politics,
diplomacy, conflict, crime and global governance. These
risks range from terrorism, disputes over resources and war
to governance being undermined by corruption, organized
crime and illicit trade.
Societal Risks
The societal category captures risks related to social stability
– such as severe income disparities, food crises and
dysfunctional cities – and public health, such as pandemics,
antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the rising burden of chronic
disease.
Technological Risks
The technological category covers major risks related to the
growing centrality of information and communication
technologies to individuals, businesses and governments.
These include cyber attacks, infrastructure disruptions and
data loss.

This report considers a core set of 31 global risks in five
categories (see Table 1.1): economic, environmental,
geopolitical, technological, and societal (Appendix A
provides the definitions of individual risks).

Economic Risks
Risks in the economic category include fiscal and liquidity
crises, failure of a major financial mechanism or institution,
oil-price shocks, chronic unemployment and failure of
physical infrastructure on which economic activity depends.

Global Risks 2014

The core set of global risks considered in this report is not
exhaustive, and the Forum attempts to continually refine it as
the global risks landscape evolves. The list also includes
“vulnerabilities”, or those trends that are already manifest
and that affect other risks – for example, an ageing
population represents a vulnerability potentially affecting a
country’s fiscal situation. This distinction is further explored
in Part 3 of this report.
Since 2009, the Global Risks report has evaluated risks over
a 10-year time horizon through the Global Risks Perception
Survey, which gathers the perceptions of the World
Economic Forum’s multistakeholder communities across
different areas of expertise, geographies and age groups. It
includes representatives of the World Economic Forum’s

Ten Global Risks of Highest Concern
in 2014
Economic, societal and environmental risks dominate the list
of global risks that the respondents are most concerned
about, with fiscal crises emerging as the top issue (Table
1.2). Despite the efforts of many eurozone countries to
control their deficit and debt levels, concerns regarding fiscal
crises persist. They are also fuelled by the high levels of
public debt in Japan and the US, where political gridlock has
exacerbated perceptions. Fiscal crises can severely affect
the stability of the global economy, as explored further in
Box 1.2.

the respondents are most concerned about, as uncertainty
about the quality of many banks’ assets remains.5

members of this community. Appendix B lays out a detailed
description of the survey sample and methodology.

Part 1

Structural unemployment and underemployment appears
second overall, as many people in both advanced and
emerging economies struggle to find jobs. The youth and
minorities are especially vulnerable. Youth unemployment
rates hover around 50% in some countries (such as Greece,
Spain, South Africa).
Part 2
Part 3

Closely associated in terms of societal risk, income disparity
is also among the most worrying of issues. It raises concerns
about the Great Recession and the squeezing effect it had
on the middle classes in developed economies, while
globalization has brought about a polarization of incomes in
emerging and developing economies. This is true despite
the obvious progress in countries such as Brazil and lower
levels of poverty in several developing countries in Asia and
Africa.
Environmental risks also feature prominently in this year’s list,
appearing as three of the top 10 global risks of greatest
concern. Water crises, for instance, rank as the third highest
concern (see Box 1.3). This illustrates a continued and
growing awareness of the global water crisis as a result of

mismanagement and increased competition for already
scarce water resources from economic activity and
population growth. Coupled with extreme weather events
such as floods and droughts, which appears sixth on the list,
the potential impacts are real and happening today.6
Climate change, ranked fifth on the list (see Box 1.4), is the
key driver of such uncertain and changing weather patterns,
causing an increased frequency of extreme weather events
such as floods and droughts. It is important to consider the
combined implications of these environmental risks on key
development and security issues, such as food security, and
political and social instability, ranked eighth and 10th
respectively.7
Given that global risks can be addressed effectively only
through international collaboration, it is hardly a surprise that
global governance failure is also included in the list as the
risk of seventh highest concern.

Box 1.2: Fiscal Crises: Just When You Thought It Was Safe to Go Back…
Contributed by the Global Agenda Council on Fiscal Sustainability
The risk of fiscal crises features as the top risk in this year’s Global Risks report. Governments often run deficits, spending
more than they raise in taxes. They make up the shortfall by selling bonds – borrowing money from private investors with
the promise of repaying it, with interest, at a specified future date. A fiscal crisis occurs when investors begin to doubt the
government’s future ability to repay; the government then has to offer higher interest on its bonds to compensate investors
for the increased risk. A vicious cycle starts: ballooning interest payments add to government debt, increasing the doubts
of investors and forcing interest rates up still further. This can rapidly turn into a fatal spiral, in which fears that a country will
default on its debt become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
As government bonds tend to be held in substantial part by domestic banks, when the government defaults, the resulting
losses on these bonds endanger banks’ solvency. In this way, a fiscal crisis can lead to financial crisis. The causation can
also run the other way: the government may be forced to bail out large banks at risk of default to avoid a systemic financial
crisis. However, the additional debt taken on can plunge the government from an already-precarious fiscal position into a
full-blown fiscal crisis.
Unsustainable debt developments ultimately force governments to undertake painful fiscal adjustments by cutting
expenditures and/or raising taxes. If such austerity is not timed well, it can trigger a deep recession and a strong increase
in unemployment, a dynamic which has played out in many advanced economies since the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
By contrast, most emerging markets were able to quickly recover from the recent financial crisis. Latin American and Asian
countries, which had experienced their own fiscal crises in the 1980s and 1990s, had implemented reforms to bring
government debt under control. When they were hit by the fallout of the financial crisis, they had the fiscal leeway to
stimulate economic activity through the opposite of austerity – increasing spending and/or cutting taxes.
Advanced economies remain in danger of fiscal crises. Given the US’s official public debt of more than 100% of its GDP,
and Japan’s of more than 230%, investors may at some point conclude that these levels are unsustainable. In the short
run, the risks are higher for eurozone countries, which lack the option of devaluing their currencies to ease the necessary
fiscal adjustment. Although ostensibly in a better position, many emerging markets have seen credit bubbles in recent
years that could turn into financial crises, and then fiscal crises, for example, the rapid credit growth in Asia since 2008.1 A
fiscal crisis in any major economy could easily have cascading global impacts.
Finding ways to deal effectively with the current risks of fiscal crises is, therefore, important. Making fiscal frameworks more
resilient in the future is even more important given the substantial longer-run fiscal challenges created by an ageing
population.

Part 1

The Global Risks Landscape 2014

Climate change features among the five most likely and most
impactful risks. Among other environmental risks, extreme
weather events are considered the second most likely, and

Box 1.3: Risks that Flow from Water
Contributed by the Global Agenda Council on Water Security
Water crises and extreme weather events have been identified by the World Economic Forum community as two of the
top 10 global risks. This is hardly surprising, given the devastating impacts of having too little water, or too much. While
water’s immediate impacts are often local, water security is now recognized as a systemic global risk.
In 2010, floods in Pakistan paralysed large parts of the country for many weeks, killing thousands of people and
wrecking the rural economy. Thailand’s slow-onset flood in 2011 caused fewer deaths but showed how one local event
could have an impact across the world: global car production slowed as supplies of components were cut, and harddrive manufacture for the world’s computers was slashed. Similarly, Japan’s GDP and global industrial production
dipped significantly following the tsunami of March 2011.
Too little water can also have systemic impacts. Drought in Russia in 2010 led to restrictions on agricultural exports,
causing the price of staple grains to rise across North Africa and the Middle East. The resulting food shortages and price
rises aggravated the tensions that led to the Arab Spring. Some studies suggest that water scarcity could reduce grain
production by as much as 30%.
In the future, geopolitical tensions over access to strategic water resources could become more systemically impactful,
and water shortage coupled with poverty and societal instability could weaken intra-state cohesion. Because of the
systemic importance of water for global economic activity, any failings in its planning, management and use in one
country can ripple across the world. That management is becoming increasingly complex and difficult as populations
expand and people grow wealthier, demanding more freshwater to supply cities and factories and consuming more
foods, such as dairy and meat, that need more water to produce. Water is equally key for energy production. While the
world population grew fourfold in the 20th century, freshwater withdrawals grew nine times.
While there is growing concern about future climate change exacerbating water-related risk, many countries cannot
even manage today’s climate variability. Drought and flood could increasingly ravage the economies of poorer countries,
locking them more deeply into cycles of poverty.
Beyond water quantity, water quality is another critical issue. Pollution incidents have paralysed business operations in
parts of China and elsewhere, disrupting global value chains and damaging corporate reputations – poor water quality
or shortages are often blamed on business operations even when businesses comply fully with regulatory requirements.
How can the global community respond? The overarching prescription is for a package of investments in information,
institutions and infrastructure. But successful water management needs the cooperation of a wide network of water
users, public and private institutions.

Part 3

The upper right quadrant shows those global risks that are
perceived by the respondents as both potentially impactful
and likely to occur. Similar to the risks of highest concern,
this quadrant is dominated by economic, social and
environmental risks. Fiscal crises and structural
unemployment and underemployment are among the most
impactful risks; the latter also feature among those most
likely to occur, with knock-on effects on income disparities,
which is regarded as the overall most likely risk.

The upper left quadrant shows those risks that are
considered less likely to happen, but would be impactful if
they did. The deployment of weapons of mass destruction is
perceived to be high-impact yet the least likely of the 31
risks, despite recent developments such as North Korea’s
alleged third nuclear test and the deployment of chemical
weapons in Syria. Other lower-likelihood, high-impact risks
are the political collapse of a nation of geopolitical
importance, an oil-price shock and the inability to deal with
pandemics.

Part 2

Figure 1.1 plots the aggregated survey responses on the
perceived likelihood and impact of the 31 risks. The risks are
grouped in four quadrants as delineated by the averages of
their overall likelihood and impact. As evident, most risks
cluster around the two upper quadrants, which identify risks
with high impact.

water crises also appear high on the list. This suggests a
pressing need for better public information about the
potential consequences of environmental threats, given that
collective action will need to be based on common
understanding.

Global Risks 2014

Part 1

Complementing Figure 1.1, the five risks considered most
likely and most impactful since 2007 are shown in Table 1.3.
Although the set of risks and their definitions have been
continually revised over the years, the comparison still
provides some qualitative insight into how global risk
perceptions have evolved.

Part 2

Environmental risks, such as climate change, extreme
weather events and water scarcity, have become more
prominent since 2011, while health-related risks (pandemics
and chronic disease) have become less so. Concern about

geopolitical risks, such as global governance failure, has
given way to concern about socio-economic risks such as
income disparity, unemployment and fiscal crises. In addition
to the socio-economic and environmental risks, cyber
attacks and the breakdown of critical information
infrastructure are prominent risks. This arguably reflects the
increasing digitization of economies and societies, where
rising dependence on information and data, as well as the
systems to analyse and use them, has made attacks more
likely and their effects more impactful.

Note: Global risks may not be strictly comparable across years, as definitions and the set of global risks have been revised with new issues having emerged on the 10-year
horizon. For example, cyber attacks, income disparity and unemployment entered the set of global risks in 2012. Some global risks were reclassified: water supply crises
and income disparity were reclassified as environmental and societal risks, respectively, in 2014.

Responses to the survey can be disaggregated by gender,
as shown in Figure 1.2. An extensive body of literature
exists on the link between gender and risk perceptions,
suggesting women are typically more sensitive to risk than
men.8 Studies also show that women are more likely to be
concerned about environmental issues.9 Some argue that
this reflects a tendency for women to think more of the long
term than men, and to have a more network-focused rather
than linear approach to problem-solving.10

Global Risks 2014

It is also possible to isolate the perspective of young
respondents, those aged under 30 years. In general, the
younger generation is more concerned about the potential
impact of global risks, while perceptions of likelihood show
no such consistent deviation.
In particular, younger individuals gave higher scores for the
impact of almost all of the risks with the exception of
liquidity crises (Figure 1.3). The young consider an oil-price
shock, the loss of biodiversity and collapse of the

ecosystem, and the occurrence of natural catastrophes as
considerably more likely and impactful than those over 30
years of age. Furthermore, while both age groups agree on
the likelihood of environmental risks, younger respondents
consider risks such as water crises, man-made natural
catastrophes, the loss of biodiversity and extreme weather
events more impactful if they were to occur. As with gender
differences, similar findings emerge from broader literature
about links between age and concern for the environment.11

Younger respondents were also more concerned than their
older counterparts about the impact of the failure of a major
financial institution, unemployment and political and social
instability, which fits with the mindset of the “Generation
Lost”, explored in Part 2.3.

The Global Risks 2014 Interconnections
Map

Part 2

While the 31 risks have been separated out for analytical
purposes, the numerous and complex interconnections
between them can create consequences that are
disproportionate and difficult to contain or predict. The
Global Risks Interconnections Map (Figure 1.4) seeks to
connect the dots by identifying and visualizing the underlying
patterns. This allows for a better understanding of the impact
of systemic risks so as to mitigate them by identifying the
transmission channels between risks and potential secondand third-order effects.

Part 3

These interconnections do not represent direct causality.
They are likely to be indirect, for example through parallel
impacts or mitigation trade-offs.
The Global Risks Interconnections Map shows how all global
risks are connected to others and underlines the complexity
of dealing with global risk in an effective manner. The map
visualizes the strength of connection between individual risks
– the most strongly connected risks could merit additional

attention due to the multiple ways they affect or are affected
by other risks.
Respondents viewed global governance failure as one of the
risks most connected to others. A well-functioning system
could contribute to preventing and mitigating the
consequences of global risks, which by definition require
internationally-coordinated responses. The need for an agile
and responsive multilateral governance system that can
identify, forecast and respond to the multiple and
interconnected risks of today’s globalized world is explored
in Part 2.2 of this report, with particular reference to
economic and geopolitical risks.
Macroeconomic risks were strongly linked by respondents to
various socio-economic issues. Failure of a financial
mechanism or institution, fiscal crises and liquidity crises are
risks closely interrelated among themselves and also with
the risks of high levels of unemployment and
underemployment, income disparity and political and
social instability.

Box 1.4: Poor Countries Are Losing Ground in the Race to Adapt to a Changing Climate
Contributed by the Global Agenda Council on Climate Change
The year 2014 is likely to be crucial for addressing climate risks, a point made by United Nations (UN) climate chief
Christiana Figueres at the Warsaw Climate Change Conference. Countries made only limited progress on issues such
as emissions reduction, loss and damage compensation, and adaptation. Greater progress is urgently needed to create
incentives and mechanisms to finance action against climate change while efforts are made to keep temperature rise
below 2 degrees Celsius.
Even as governments and corporations are called upon to speed up greenhouse gas reduction, it is clear that the race is
on not only to mitigate climate change but also to adapt. Droughts, super-storms and other natural disasters are
increasingly causing systemic risks around the world.
Failure to adapt most strongly affects the most vulnerable, especially those in the least developed countries. They tend
to lack the infrastructure and capacity to deal with extreme droughts and floods, reduced crop yields and increased
stresses on energy and water supplies.
According to the latest Notre Dame-Global Adaptation Index, it will take more than 100 years for the world’s poorest
countries to reach the current adaptive capacity of higher-income OECD countries. The World Bank estimates the cost
of climate change adaptation for developing countries at US$ 70-100 billion per year through to 2050.
Gradually, however, promising models are emerging of collaboration between the public and private sectors and civil
society to strengthen resilience to climate change. An example is the US$ 3 billion Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor
of Tanzania (SAGCOT), intended to create the infrastructure to nurture new value chains. Through techniques such as
rainwater harvesting, efficient irrigation and crops that can produce more nutrients for the same input of water, SAGCOT
aims to increase food production in a way that is both environmentally sustainable and benefits small-scale farmers and
the rural poor.
Such innovative and ambitious projects, unlocking investment funds through public-private partnership, showcase the
kind of multistakeholder collaboration that will be needed across all sectors to meet the twin priorities of climate change
mitigation and adaptation.

Recent examples illustrate the reality of these
interconnections – the failure of financial institutions brought
about a financial crisis that resulted in liquidity crises
affecting multiple national economies. This in turn led to
higher levels of unemployment, widened income disparity
and associated political and social tensions and protests,
notably in some European countries and large emerging
markets. Part 2.3 of this report examines these
interconnections through the lens of the challenges facing
today’s youth.

Environmental risks such as water crises, extreme weather
events, natural catastrophes, man-made environmental
catastrophes and climate change present another important
cluster in the interconnections map. While all these risks are
interlinked, climate change is of pivotal importance. The risk
of climate change by far displays the strongest linkages and
can be seen to be both a key economic risk in itself and a
multiplier of other risks, such as extreme weather events and
water and food crises. The latest work by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – its 5th
Assessment released in late 2013 – states that warming of
Global Risks 2014

21

Part 1
Part 2

the climate system is unequivocal and that each of the last
three decades has been successively warmer at the earth’s
surface than any preceding decade since 1850. This is the
strongest IPCC statement on climate change yet. The
increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as
storm surges and droughts, is consistent with the latest
IPCC modelling.12 The damage to economic assets, such as
city and industrial infrastructure, agriculture and key global
supply chains, caused by such extreme weather events is
becoming more evident, as is the fragility of the global
logistics and mobility systems (see Box 1.5). Consequently,
“resilience” has become a key policy and agency theme to
counteract the growing sense of economic, political and
social risk that changing climatic conditions pose.

Part 3

The risk of global governance failure, which lies at the heart
of the risk map, is linked to the risk of climate change.
Negotiations on climate change mitigation and adaptation
are progressing by fits and starts, perpetually challenged to
deliver a global legal framework. Meanwhile, a regime of
national, regional and public-private collaborative efforts to
address the problem is gathering pace. This may represent
the future of global governance – a more intricate lattice of
multiple, interconnected government agreements related to

relatively simple global “goals” (such as a commitment to
limit warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius), supported
by a framework of collaborative alliances and partnerships to
help deliver on that target across different themes, regions or
sectors. Arguably, such a heterogeneous and diverse
intergovernmental and public-private response to the
climate-change risk could offer more resilience and flexibility
to the dynamic challenge of climate change than a
homogenous, single global framework.
The technological risks of cyber attacks, data fraud/theft and
critical information infrastructure breakdown are strongly
connected to each other and to risks such as terrorist
attacks and global governance failure. This reflects the
changing nature of vulnerability in an increasingly digitized
world, and the need for global multistakeholder collaboration
to maintain the resilience of cyberspace. These issues are
explored in Part 2.4 of this report.

Box 1.5: Growing Cities, Growing Risks
More than half of the world’s population now lives in cities. By 2050, the urban population will have nearly doubled to an
estimated 6.4 billion. Most of the increase in urban populations will be in middle- and lower-income countries, which
have more limited capacity to manage the new risks being created – and existing risks being exacerbated – by the global
urban transition.
While urbanization provides important economic and social gains, it substantially increases risks related to ecological
disruptions, pollution, climate change and environmental disasters. Populations are agglomerating along coastal areas
where climate change portends rising sea levels, extreme weather events, earthquakes and tsunamis. Urban flooding
has already become the leading form of disaster in the world, and the UN forecasts that the number of people in large
cities exposed to cyclonic winds, earthquakes and flooding will more than double in the first half of this century.
Around 1 billion people, one-third of the world’s urban population, live in slums1 – a number that has been increasing in
the current era of high and widening income inequalities. This growing population of urban poor is vulnerable to rising
food prices and economic crises, posing significant risks of chronic social instability.
Communicable diseases can spread more quickly in densely-populated areas, increasing the risk of global pandemics.
For example, if a new strain of avian flu were to spread globally through the air travel network that connects the world’s
major cities, 3 billion people could potentially be exposed to the virus within a short span of time.
More generally, cities are connected systemically through physical and informational networks in ways that may become
apparent only when events in one location are rapidly transmitted globally in unexpected trajectories. For example, the
2011 earthquake in Japan and subsequent nuclear power plant meltdown had cascading impacts through global supply
chains that immediately led to decreases in auto production around the world.
As urban populations grow, multistakeholder processes of inclusive governance will increasingly be needed to make
cities resilient against these complex and interconnected risks. While cities have been efficient at driving change in some
areas, substantial improvements in urban governance capacities will be needed to address risks, especially in the
emerging economies where future urbanization will mostly take place, and which are especially vulnerable to
systemic risks.

Risks and Trends to Watch

Figure 1.5: Risks and Trends to Watch

Part 2

Adopting a proactive, precautionary approach to anticipating
future challenges can help to avoid being caught by surprise
and forced into a fully reactive mode. A range of assessment
methodologies can be applied to identifying and
understanding emerging risks.

Demographic trends have been flagged, including the risk
of being unable to deal with rapid population growth and the
growing burden of an ageing population – which could also
be a source of great opportunities for society and business if
managed effectively. Concerns were also raised about
unmanaged migration flows, overpopulation and energy
crises.
Societal concerns include the breakdown of social
structures, the decline of trust in institutions, the lack of
leadership and persisting gender inequalities. Risks related
to ideological polarization, extremism – in particular those of
a religious or political nature – and intra-state conflicts such
as civil wars, were also frequently highlighted. Several
concerns in this category relate to the future of the youth: the
quality of and access to education, the marginalization of
young generations and high rates of youth unemployment
(see Part 2.3 for more on this topic).
Technological concerns include data mismanagement,
loss of privacy, increase in surveillance, and possible abuse
of new and more complex information technology, which is
further explored in Part 2.4. These risks are becoming
potentially more impactful as social media transitioned from
a purely social pastime into the corporate communications
environment.
In addition, risk experts in the insurance industry have
nominated further trends worth highlighting, which could
evolve into significant risks:
Environmental: Two kinds of pollution are especially worth
noting. First, plastic waste pollution could degrade marine
ecosystems and spoil shorelines, posing a credible threat to
ecosystems and human health.13 Second, endocrine
disruptors in the environment have been linked to human
health problems through interference with hormonal
systems.14

Part 3

In this year’s report, respondents to the survey were asked
to identify additional global risks that are already or could
become relevant and were not explicitly surveyed. Figure 1.5
shows categories of issues that respondents mentioned
most frequently. Gathered into three broad categories, the
most commonly identified issues are presented here,
followed by additional assessments and comments from
experts.
Science and technology: Several emerging risks are
associated with the use of new technology, such as the
potential toxicity of nanomaterials, the future evolution and
impact of 3-D printing, and uncertainty about the potential
impact of widespread use of autonomous vehicles, which
are capable of sensing their environment and navigating on
their own. The potential for abuse, or an accident involving
synthetic biology, could even pose an existential risk, as
discussed in Box 1.7.16
Economic: As a consequence of the 2008 financial crisis,
central banks in many countries have been pursuing an
ultra-loose monetary policy. Although theoretical fears of
high inflation and unintended asset bubbles have so far
mainly been contained, central banks are expected to
tighten monetary policy.17 The resulting higher interest rates
could see volatility in asset prices, capital flows and
exchange rates, and rising government debt due to higher
interest costs.18
The rise of the bitcoin and the possibility of other new modes
of payment could create new risks as well as opportunities.
Risks relate to the facilitation of money laundering,
corruption, illicit financial flows as well as volatility and
susceptibility to security threats and market manipulation.
China is among the governments that have already begun to
restrict the use of virtual currencies.19
Social and political: The “costs of living longer” was raised
as an X-factor risk to watch in the 2013 edition of this report,
and risks related to longevity remain significant as medical
advances increase life expectancy, posing funding
challenges in retirement financing, long-term care and
healthcare.20 Along the same lines, the prevalence of
overweight and obesity is increasing and could result in
significant economic cost.21

Another environmental trend to track is the development and
production of unconventional oil and natural gas resources,
such as oil sands and shales, which require processes and
technologies (e.g. fracking) that differ considerably from
those used for conventional resources in terms of energy
input, cost and environmental impact.15 Their impact and
sustainability are being increasingly questioned.

Global Risks 2014

23

Part 1

Box 1.6: Sustainable Competitiveness and Global Risks
Appreciation is growing that high historical rates of economic progress, especially those experienced by emerging
markets, may not be sustainable in the future.
Part 2

Environmental pressures that could undermine competitiveness include pollution, biodiversity loss and climate change,
while scarcity of mineral resources could endanger future consumption as demand continues to climb. The implications
of water shortages, for example, are explored in Box 1.3. Social tensions could also undermine competitiveness, as
people fear that economic growth may not translate into the desired results for society in terms of inclusion, equity and
cohesion.
Although it is clear that these systemic risks can undermine economic competitiveness, the magnitude of their capacity
to do so and their complex interactions are not well understood.

Part 3

Building on its Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), the World Economic Forum is working on a sustainability-adjusted
GCI that captures the extent to which prosperity is being generated in a sustainable way, taking into account
environmental stewardship and social sustainability.1 The findings suggest that there is no necessary trade-off between
being economically competitive and being sustainable. Many countries at the top of the competitiveness ranking are
also the best performers in terms of sustainability measures – for instance, Switzerland, Finland, Germany, Sweden and
the Netherlands.
The sustainability-adjusted GCI can be seen as capturing a country’s preparedness to face many of the systemic global
risks explored in this report. Among the core factors it measures are environmental degradation, strength of governance,
provision of health and education, and macroeconomic stability – all factors that influence how sustainable a country’s
economic competitiveness is, and how resilient it is to risk. Understanding the relationship between sustainability and
competitiveness is crucial to understanding how to mitigate and build resilience to global risks.

Box 1.7: An Emerging Spectrum of Catastrophic Risks: Existential Threats
Contributed by the Global Agenda Council on Catastrophic Risks
Throughout history, humanity has been all too familiar with catastrophes affecting life and livelihoods on a major scale:
earthquakes, floods, droughts, tsunamis, cyclones and so on. Increasingly, however, the new risks coming into focus are
more complex, more uncertain and potentially exponentially more consequential. These are existential risks – those that
could either annihilate intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential.1
Natural disasters could conceivably trigger existential risks in combination with new technologies – a possibility
suggested by the March 2011 tsunami that caused a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan. There is
also the theoretical potential for “error or terror” in emerging sciences, such as nanotechnology or synthetic biology;
within a few decades, for example, it may become as feasible to create real viruses in a home laboratory as it now is to
create computer viruses on a home computer.
Among other existential risks is the possibility that breakthroughs in artificial intelligence could move rapidly in
unexpected directions; the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria could dramatically set back modern medicine; solar
super-storms could devastate vital information and communications technology networks; climate change could tip into
a self-reinforcing, runaway phase of rising temperatures; a meteorite could hit a densely-populated area or an asteroid
could strike the earth.
Although these threats sound forbidding, there are ways to prevent most of them, or at least to mitigate their impacts.
While research and innovation can provide new approaches, established institutions can also play an important role. For
example, in October 2013 the UN General Assembly approved the creation of an International Asteroid Warning Group.
It is important for the public and private sectors to work together to address existential risks. The private sector has
experience and expertise to offer in the realms of strategic planning, organizational design, institutional adaptation,
research, scientific investigation and technological innovation. However, effective public-private collaboration will require
vision, strategy and commitment to more extensive, consistent and systematic approaches at the country, regional and
international levels. This, in turn, requires an appreciation that existential risks exist not only in the realms of science

According to the US Department of Agriculture, the US experienced its most
severe and extensive drought in 25 years in 2012, with some 80% of all US
agricultural land experiencing drought. This in turn caused around US$ 40
billion in lost crops and livestock, according to the National Climatic Data
Center, and spikes in commodity prices such as corn, which peaked at US$
7.63 a bushel – more than one dollar over its high of 2011.

For example, while there is no doubt a number of reasons caused the
devastating civil war, recent research is unearthing the hidden role that climate
change, extreme weather events and a water crisis also played in Syria.
Between 2006 and 2011, up to 60% of Syria’s land experienced one of the
worst long-term droughts in modern history (Werrell et al. 2013). Together with
the mismanagement of water resources, this drought led to total crop failure for
75% of farmers, forcing their migration and increasing tensions in urban cities
that were already experiencing economic insecurity and instability.

The risk multiplier that climate change presents to water shortages,
biodiversity loss, ocean damage and deforestation also creates a complex
“heterarchy”, rather than a simple hierarchy, of environmental risks, often with
non-linear patterns of change and self-fuelling feedback mechanisms. This
heterarchy is not contained within IPCC models, but could encompass the
greatest economic risk of all from climate change.

Part 3

Global risks can only be effectively dealt with if there is a
common understanding of their importance and
interconnected nature, and a readiness to engage in
multistakeholder dialogue and action. The effectiveness of
such an approach was demonstrated when a protectionist
response to the 2008 crisis was contained through a joint
effort by multilateral institutions, the private sector and the
G20. This report offers a framework for decision-makers to
look at risks in a holistic manner and to stimulate discussions
on ways to address global risks more effectively.

Part 2

Economic, societal and environmental concerns continue to
dominate the global risks landscape in the minds of leaders
around the globe, with the threat of fiscal crises in key
economies topping the list. The results emphasize the
interconnectedness of all the global risks analysed in this
chapter, underscoring the need for effective global
governance and a better understanding of causes and
consequences to be able to prepare for, mitigate and
strengthen resilience to these risks.

2.1 Introduction: Understanding
Global Systemic Risk

energy and water supply networks, and global information
technology infrastructure can become either a strong
support for global stability or an amplifier of cascading
shocks.

If societies are to thrive in the face of the global risks explored
in the last section, each element of the global system −
finance, supply chains, health, energy, the Internet, the
environment and others − must become more resilient as
most of the global risks are systemic in nature. This part of
the Global Risks report contains three explorations of how
systemic risks could interplay in the coming decade,
focusing respectively on instabilities in a multipolar world, the
challenges facing the current generation of youth, and the
possibility of a breakdown in trust in the Internet.

Multiple trends are contributing to linking global systems ever
more closely and in more complex ways. For example, the
increased carbon emissions and reduced ecological
diversity resulting from unsustainable economic growth now
fundamentally threaten to undermine not only the stability of
the global ecosystem but also the economies that depend
on it.

In general, the biggest challenge in making systems resilient
to systemic risk is managing their growing complexities and
interdependencies, by proactively addressing collective
action failures and resolving problems through international
cooperation.
To do this, efforts to understand, measure and foresee the
evolution of these complex systems must first be improved.
Next, procedures and institutions that are globally
coordinated yet locally flexible and responsive must be
developed. To meet rising complexity effectively, regulation
must not become more complex but, perhaps paradoxically,
more simple. Simple and flexible rules are required as rising
complexity cannot be matched by ever more complex and
burdensome regulations.
Risk in the hyperconnected environment can no longer be
treated as something that is confined to particular sectors or
domains. Physical transport, trade and travel networks,

Perhaps the oldest form of systemic risk is that arising from
viruses and pandemics, a threat that has entered a
dangerous new phase as people and goods move at
increasing speeds and over greater distances, with many
passing through a small number of airports and other hubs.
Increasing antibiotic resistance is a major concern, while
new technologies that promise to revolutionize healthcare
also pose risks of contagious diseases being constructed
synthetically in laboratories. The potential of food-based
pandemics or the spread of toxic elements in an increasingly
globally integrated food chain also raises major concerns.
Society can also generate its own systemic risks, notably
from growing economic inequality and weakening social
cohesion within countries, which threaten political stability.
Globalization has left some countries behind and has been
associated with rising inequality between and within
countries. This is augmented by restrictions on migration
and a failure of policies at the national and global levels to
promote a more inclusive system. Together, these factors
render poor people and poor countries vulnerable to
systemic risks.

This section of the Global Risks report on systemic risk draws heavily on Ian
Goldin and Mike Mariathasan, The Butterfly Defect: How globalization creates
systemic risk, and what to do about it, Princeton University Press, Forthcoming
Spring 2014. Readers are referred to this book for an extensive discussion of all
the issues that are summarized in this section and for further analysis of
systemic risk.

Part 1

2.2 Instabilities in an Increasingly
Multipolar World
Part 2

Institutions are failing to tackle these problems. The growing
complexity of today’s interconnected world reduces the
ability to make well-informed decisions, leading to a loss of
responsibility. Politicians often do not gather the support
required to focus on longer-term strategic concerns. As
social cohesion weakens and citizens seek to wrest control
from distant and apparently unaccountable institutions, there
is more visible support for extremist parties, as well as
nationalistic, protectionist and xenophobic behaviour.

Cyber attacks

Corruption

The financial crisis of 2007-2008 was the new century’s most
widely experienced systemic crisis, and others are likely to
follow. The same dynamic of individually rational decisions
leading to greater systemic vulnerability is at work elsewhere.
For example, in global supply chains, individual firms
increase efficiency through just-in-time and other
streamlined management practices, but the removal of
spare capacity can reduce resilience as each firm believes
that system stability and sustainability are not their
responsibility.
Systemic risks are a modern manifestation of the tragedy of
the commons. They typically transcend national boundaries
and involve shared resources as well as causality that are
indirect and time-delayed.2 They are resistant to direct
technical solutions, requiring instead changes to
stakeholders’ behaviour. Hence, all stakeholders must
display greater responsibility – including global businesses,
governments, international organizations and civil society
– while efforts are made to fundamentally reform global
governance. The current system, created in response to the
Second World War, requires radical changes, including a
renewal of mandates, shareholding and skills to reflect
21st-century realities.
Yet, as the interconnections between transport,
communication, financial and other world systems become
increasingly complex, the traditional concepts of risk have
become inappropriate as a basis of modern global
governance. Systemic risks include elements that cannot be
easily quantified using traditional tools and formulas from
probability theory and mathematics, or made to fit the
classical distinction between risk and uncertainty. As it
becomes increasingly difficult to identify direct causality,
traditional risk management needs to be supplemented with
new concepts designed for uncertain environments.
The next three sections explore in more detail how individual
risks could combine to create systemic global risks. These
sections are followed by an analysis of concrete actions that
leading companies and nations are taking to deal with such
risks, both individually and through public-private
partnerships.

When “foreign” becomes synonymous with “threat”, the
case for collective action is made more difficult. Yet it is only
through collective action that resilience can be built and the
gravest systemic threats mitigated. Social cohesion could,
therefore, underpin more effective management of systemic
threats – as could a greater understanding of causal
connections between actions and events, allowing for the
construction of decision-making scenarios in which the
consequences of actions may be anticipated.1

Income
disparity
State collapse

Interstate conflict

Domestic pressures are denting both the appetite and the
ability of advanced economies to maintain their authority on
the global stage. Large emerging-market countries are keen
to play a significant role but are struggling to reconcile rapid
economic growth, dramatic social change and complex
political reform. At the same time, global multilateral
institutions are finding it hard to achieve consensus, and thus
concerted action, on critical matters due to the proliferation
of assertive, discordant voices. Figure 1.4 in Part 1 shows
how the failure of global governance is connected with other
risks.
Already, states are prioritizing short-term or proximate
concerns over long-term or more global issues.3 Not only
may a resulting global leadership vacuum fuel geopolitical
instability in the years to come, it may also exacerbate global
governance challenges and have undesirable consequences
for the long-term development of systemically important
sectors such as energy, financial services and healthcare.
Demographic and economic changes, such as growing
middle classes in most emerging-market countries, ageing
populations in Europe, China and Japan, and fast-expanding
populations across much of North Africa, the Middle East
and India, are transforming societal expectations and
shaping national political priorities. In parallel, ever more
extensive trading relationships, international travel, migration
and technological advances are increasing the speed at
which ideas, information, people, capital, goods and
services cross borders.
Against this backdrop, key geopolitical variables will
influence global development over the next decade. These
include the ability of key emerging markets to successfully
deliver on substantial economic and political reforms, and
the willingness of leading powers to cooperate economically
and on global governance issues. Thus, across the world,

tension between the domestic imperatives of growth and
stability is setting the mood for international relations.

The Risk Landscape of the Future
Part 2

With a five-to-ten year lens, four potential threats can be
identified in light of current trends: emerging-market
uncertainties, commercial and political frictions between
countries, the proliferation of low-level conflict, and slow
progress on global challenges.

Emerging Market Uncertainties

Part 3

The four BRIC nations now rank among the 10 largest
economies worldwide and China is predicted to top the table
on a purchasing power parity basis within the next three to
eight years.4 But emerging markets in general are by no
means a unified group, and in the coming years their
economic performance is likely to diverge. Arguably, these
countries are reaching an inflection point in their
development where the growth model of their economies
cannot continue to support the creation of wealth.5

implementation of far-reaching domestic reforms, even more
so where political succession planning is unclear. While
increased global trade and the faster movement of capital in
a more integrated global economy generally support
economic growth, they can expose countries to volatility
induced by hot money flows, the fragility of traditional trading
partners and a prolonged ebb in the commodity supercycle, resulting in financial system fragilities. Additional
challenges will arise as countries allocate a more prominent
role to market forces and extend welfare frameworks,
especially where this rubs up against institutional inertia and
vested interests in society.
As Figure 2.1 shows, popular discontent with the status quo
is already apparent among rising middle classes, digitally
connected youth populations and marginalized groups (for
example, ethnic minorities and the new urban poor).
Collectively, they want better services (such as healthcare),
infrastructure, employment and working conditions. They
also want greater accountability of public officials, better
protected civil liberties and more equitable judicial systems.
The misuse of power, official complacency and greater
public awareness of widespread corruption have sharpened
popular complaints.

Existing undertones of social unrest may be aggravated by
externally driven economic shocks and the unsatisfactory

Domestic economic goals will increase pressure on
international commercial partnerships. While global trade
deals might be harder to come by, notwithstanding the
success of the World Trade Ministerial Conference in Bali in
December 2013, deals that involve smaller groups of
countries are on the rise, with several extensive frameworks
currently under negotiation (for example, the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, TPP, and Transatlantic Trade and Investment
Partnership, TTIP, – see Figure 2.2). These aim for greater
economic harmonization on standards and regulations, in
addition to tariff reductions. For some governments, a
significant political price will have to be paid for being on the
inside, such as the opening up of protected industries, while
others may face choices that will position their allegiances for
years to come.

Growing opportunities for asymmetrical warfare heighten the
risk of national security crises. The risks for developed states
posed by traditional forms of terrorism have proved less
potent in recent years. At the same time, the number of
attacks in the “south” has grown quite quickly and
alarmingly. The risk is that terrorist activities in weak or fragile
states can undermine states, cause unrest and then spill
over into neighbouring countries, causing regional instability.

Some countries may use trade and investment relationships
as a means of projecting geopolitical power and achieving
strategic advantage. At the same time, pursuing geopolitical
interests may damage economic confidence, notably in
South-East Asia, where rising nationalist expectations and
growing pressure on leaders for success is already affecting
trade relations in key markets.6 Given the large number of
potential flashpoints, political missteps may reduce trust and
have lasting economic consequences.

Technology-based aggressions from state and non-state
actors are on the rise.7 In the world of cyber warfare,
strategic advantage will remain for the foreseeable future
with aggressors – barring radical changes to the structure of
the Internet (see Part 2.4) – with multiple incidents in every
region of the world. Similarly, the inevitable spread of drone
technology will create new hard-to-address capabilities for
rogue actors – highlighted by the ability of a camera drone to
get within three metres of German Chancellor Angela Merkel
in September 2013. Multilateral agreements in these lowlevel conflict areas would help to manage the associated
risks, if not eliminate them.

Interstate Frictions – Commercial and Political

Part 1

Adding to the factors that will weigh on growth, the greater
role of regional forums and tendencies towards deglobalization may complicate progress towards sustainable
global development. Cross-cutting, slow-burn, systemic
challenges, such as climate change, widespread illicit trade,
the management of the oceans (including a more accessible
Arctic), Internet governance, international cooperation on
space missions, and the enhancement of human rights, may
prove more intractable when the prioritization of domestic
economic and social concerns undermines the ability of
states to coordinate and implement policy remedies.

The persistent deadlock and declining expectations
regarding international agreements on greenhouse gas
emissions exemplify the difficulty in securing collective
national self-sacrifice on topics that are not immediately
pressing for all and subject to commonly held values. But
policy uncertainty surely undermines the global investment
environment and deepens scepticism about the ability and
willingness of leaders to solve pressing transnational
problems.
The growing scale and assertiveness of leading emerging
market countries will increasingly challenge the legitimacy,
relevance and efficacy of incumbent global multilateral
organizations or groupings. Some already face accusations
that they reflect an outdated post-Second World War
balance of global power, while others are so large,
ideologically diverse or financially constrained that decisionmaking and implementation is hard to achieve. Reenergizing their mandates and encouraging convergence on
key goals would be a helpful counterpoint to topics that
might best be handled at the regional level.

Implications for Systemically Important
Sectors
Geopolitical risks will not only affect the interaction between
countries but will also affect, and be affected by,
developments in three sectors that are critical to the wellbeing of the global economy: energy, financial services and
healthcare. Box 2.1 shows how key themes from the
previous section play out in these areas.

Box 2.1: Geopolitical Implications for Systemically Important Sectors
Energy
Geopolitical and energy sector dynamics will remain deeply intertwined over the next decade as a number of key
countries strive for greater energy independence, supply chain control and/or supply diversification. Over the coming
decade, the US is likely to become the world’s top oil producer and a net exporter of natural gas (see Figure A).1 China is
likely to extend its multiple strategic investments in energy assets across the Middle East, Africa and the Americas, and
deepen its energy relationship with the Russian Federation. Many European nations, intent on diversifying by fuel type
and supply countries, will strengthen their commitment to locally produced renewable energy and also the construction
of liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals.

Moreover, in a world where fiscal constraints, legitimacy
concerns and domestic demands compete for attention,
established powers will be more reluctant to accept new
responsibilities abroad. As a result, conflicts within and
between states may more easily deteriorate into crises.
Potential nuclear proliferation in the Middle East will continue
to draw high-level political attention in Washington and in
Europe. But the capacity to resolve problems elsewhere will
likely depend on the creation of regional coalitions of the
willing, able and like-minded, given regular impasses in the
UN Security Council. This challenge may become especially
complex in East and South-East Asia, a region that lacks a
viable regional security framework and contains nations that
still depend strongly on the US security “umbrella”.

Part 2

The implications for international relations are far-reaching. US energy self-sufficiency and lower feedstock prices are
likely to encourage further onshoring of energy-intensive manufacturing. Reduced US dependency on the Middle East
may shape perceptions of the region’s vulnerability to security crises, with other countries obliged to play greater roles.
New unconventional oil supplies, along with financial pressures in emerging-market countries to boost production, will
further limit the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to set prices. More widely
available LNG supplies could undermine the Russian Federation’s negotiating leverage with consumers in Europe and
Asia. Washington may use LNG exports to achieve foreign policy goals – for example, to encourage the key energy
growth markets of Asia to accept US terms for admission into the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Part 3

National oil companies are likely to expand their international reach (especially into Africa), using the financial and political
backing of their governments to outbid international oil companies (IOCs) on assets, although IOCs will be better
positioned for (joint) ventures, such as shale gas, where the latest technologies are required – provided the risks of
intellectual property loss and potentially escalating royalties can be managed. In some parts of the world, domestic
concerns about local content, employment and energy prices may delay or derail the market reforms needed to facilitate
energy sector collaborations and investment in infrastructure. In Europe, policy uncertainty resulting from the desire to
balance price objectives and environmental commitments may result in inefficient energy systems featuring stranded
assets, continued subsidization, investment delays and higher levels of government interference.
Financial services
Stability will be a key objective in this sector. Advanced economies will focus on implementing major reforms designed to
improve market resilience. The application of reform principles is already politicized, with domestically drafted regulations
(e.g. Dodd-Frank) set up to protect national financial systems at the expense of extraterritorial institutions.2 The drive
towards regional harmonization by the European Union (EU) is set to continue, generating political friction as members
seek to protect their national interests, an example being the negotiation of safeguards in the EU banking union and
market legislation by the United Kingdom (UK).
The complex interplay between layers of regulation and the differences between regimes and philosophies – for
example, the UK’s values-based approach versus the US’s rules-based approach – will increase friction and costs
related to compliance, transactions and reporting. This may encourage institutions to reconsider the scope and footprint
of their operations. Likewise, the deleveraging of the regulated financial system, via higher capital requirements, might
force increasing amounts of financial activity outside the regulatory parameter into the shadow banking system in the
pursuit of higher returns.
In emerging-market countries, the extent of financial sector liberalization will be shaped by three factors: recognition of
the importance of the financial sector as a strategic area of growth; the country’s ability to deliver substantial structural
economic reform without significant domestic instability; and the strength of domestic financial lobbies. Countries that
do open up are likely to set a relatively higher bar to entry for foreign institutions, both to prevent distortions and to
protect domestic incumbents.
While some measures – such as the establishment of wholly-owned subsidiaries with local capital and governance –
should limit systemic risk impacts, other measures may inhibit innovation that could support economic growth. A
measured approach to liberalization may help some countries avoid stop-start policies, as seen in Brazil’s insurance
market, as well as reduce the risk of the unwelcome macroeconomic consequences that come with hot money and
incorrectly sequenced reforms, notably inflationary pressures, exchange rate appreciation and asset-price bubbles.3
Leading emerging markets may increasingly seek to position themselves as regional financial centres and reduce their
vulnerability to volatile foreign capital flows while increasing their domestic investor base. To attract talent and capital,
regional hubs – existing (such as Hong Kong SAR and Singapore) and aspiring (including Istanbul, Shanghai, Moscow,
Johannesburg and Dubai) – will need to strategically identify the areas in which they will specialize to better understand
the opportunities and risks presented by partners and competitors.
Healthcare
Due to slower economic growth, healthcare funding will be a defining challenge for all countries over the next 10 years.
Ageing populations and the persistent rise in chronic and lifestyle diseases (see Figure B) will force both developed and
emerging economies to transform provisions and how they are paid for.

In emerging markets, any failure to create sustainable universal healthcare systems – a constitutional obligation in Brazil

markets, a failure to transform care would threaten the implied social contract with citizens and imperil countries’ abilities
to finance other public priorities, such as foreign policy. Future cost pressures are likely to fall increasingly on employers
and insurance programmes, with an increasing role for the financial sector in all countries.
Necessary reforms in the health sector could have geopolitical implications. A shortage of qualified physicians could
increase poaching between countries. Inefficient, localized models of care may give way to consolidated structures.
Increasing cost pressures are likely to broaden the supply and demand of health tourism, with the potential for large cost
savings. Innovations in care delivery models, such as more radically separating acute specialist care from more remote
monitoring / telemedicine could further open up provision of healthcare.4 A sharper policy focus on lifestyle
improvements could affect the global food production industry, among others.
It is likely that emerging markets will pragmatically open up investment opportunities for foreign firms in healthcare and
pharmaceutical provision, albeit sometimes in partnership arrangements. Foreign involvement will probably be blocked
in areas that are easily managed domestically, such as the production of simple generic drugs, though more complex
areas, such as biologics, may well remain open. Requirements for technology transfer and assistance for local research
and development (R&D) are likely to intensify, however – as is apparent in the Russian Federation’s Pharma 2020
strategy.5
Cost pressures in these countries are likely to lead to the increasing use of compulsory licences, harder scrutiny of
pharmaceutical patents and demands for transparency on pricing, as well as controversial pricing mechanisms to lower
drug costs. India has already implemented such measures, and similar approaches are anticipated in Brazil, South
Africa and possibly China. Rather than taking a blanket protectionist stance, it is likely that governments will target the
drugs that cost them the most money, such as those for oncology. This pressure, already echoed in such developed
countries as Germany, asks big questions about the feasibility of large-scale research and development work and thus
the ability to meet future healthcare needs.

Strengthening Resilience

2.3 Generation Lost?

Given the potential for reversals and unwelcome surprises,
strategic diversification will be critical. Just as governments
should avoid relying on individual security, trade and
investment partnerships, so companies should take a
portfolio view of their risk exposures to particular markets
and seek natural hedges against them.

Broad-based coalitions, where they are not overly ambitious,
may help to overcome new barriers that could emerge from
the focus on domestic priorities. Multistakeholder initiatives
may increasingly prove key to building consensus, unlocking
capital and developing innovative solutions to national,
regional and global challenges. It will often be important to
nurture relations with all useful partners, regardless of
political differences. But careful alignment in areas of mutual
benefit will enable participants to harness a wide range of
future opportunities.

Part 3

Successful risk mitigation for all participants will also involve
a constant challenge to engage and communicate more
deeply. Legitimacy will be increasingly important for
multilateral organizations, accountability for governments
and transparency for companies. When these aspects are
not adequately addressed, loss of trust will have significant
political and economic consequences.

Part 2

Navigating through a fractured and potentially volatile
geopolitical environment will require foresight, flexibility and
fresh thinking for countries, companies and multilateral
organizations alike. In the face of potential surprises and
reversals, the agile and the adaptable are most likely to
thrive.

Income
disparity

Around the world, the generation coming of age in the 2010s
is most affected by the legacy of the financial crisis and slow
economic growth. In many countries, dramatically high
unemployment is frustrating young people’s efforts to earn,
generate savings, gain professional experience and build
careers. Traditional higher education is ever more expensive
and its payoff more doubtful. These issues need to be
addressed inclusively on local, national and global levels to
minimize the risks of a breakdown in social cohesion and
enduring loss of human and economic potential.
In general, the mentality of this generation is realistic,
adaptive and versatile. Smart technology and social media
provide new ways to quickly connect, build communities,
voice opinion and exert political pressure.8 This generation of
digital natives is full of ambition to make the world a better
place, yet feels disconnected from traditional politics and
government – a combination which presents both a
challenge and an opportunity in addressing global risks.

A Generation at Risk
The generational frame in this chapter focuses on a cohort
aged roughly between 13 and 23 in 2013. It will be aged
about 23 to 33 in 2023. This category overlaps with the
millennials or the millennial generation, defined as those born
between 1980 and 2000.9
Young people entering the job market today are at high risk
of unemployment or precarious job situations. Youth
unemployment rates have soared since the financial crisis.
The situation is especially dire in the Middle East and
advanced economies, notably some European countries
such as Spain and Greece. Moreover, employment statistics
do not reveal that in many developing regions – where 90%
of the global youth population lives – a majority of young
people are employed only informally.10
Global Risks 2014

Part 1

In advanced economies, jobs with long-term prospects – the
normal situation for previous generations – have become
scarce. Young people are vulnerable to being entrapped by
either long-term unemployment or the inability to move on
from low-quality and temporary or part-time employment.11

Young people in low-income economies usually cannot
benefit from social protection systems. The extent of
unemployment and underemployment risks generating
social instability, especially in post-conflict settings or fragile
states, is evidenced by the Arab Spring. Nearly two-thirds of
the youth in developing economies are not achieving their full
economic potential, which holds back these economies.15

Note: 2012 and 2013 are projections.

In advanced economies, the challenge of finding stable and
remunerative employment comes on top of the burden of
fulfilling the social contract with an ageing society. Today’s
youth need to support a growing population of the elderly
and save for their own old age. This burden is carried to
extremes in Japan, a country with one of the world’s highest
life expectancies and lowest birth rates, due partly to the lack
of widespread support structures for young families.
Prospects for the young generation are brighter in highgrowth markets, particularly in Asia, where the middle
classes are rising. Yet – as explored in the previous section
– the transition of these economies from emerging to
advanced is not without problems, including the same
demographic burden which afflicts advanced economies.
Emerging markets may not have a top-heavy age structure
yet, but soon will. While it took 115 years for France’s
population of over-65s to double from 7% to 14%, it will take
China, South Korea and Singapore only about 20 years.12

34

In contrast to most advanced nations, the developing
economies of China, Latin America and Africa face additional
pressures of population growth as rural-urban migration
creates megacities with complex risks and vulnerabilities
(see Part 1 – Box 1.5 on urbanization and risk).13 Africa’s
youth population, for example, currently totals 200 million
and is projected to double by 2045.14 Sufficient economic
opportunities will need to be generated to absorb this
growing and increasingly better-educated labour force. In
many countries, the young need to adapt quickly as
traditional societies change and new skills are required; skills
mismatch is a particular problem in Africa and the Middle
East. The growth of populations and cities puts pressure on
food production, so the prospects for a young generation of
farmers also need to be addressed.

Global Risks 2014

In some emerging economies, demographic shifts mean the
relative supply of labour will be decreasing within a decade
or two. In China, for example, the number of university
graduates currently exceeds market demand in many
regions, but the situation is projected to flip by 2020 with
demographic change and the shift from industries to
services. Very quickly, demand for skilled and educated
people is expected to exceed supply.16
This will ease the problems of unemployment and
underemployment for the next generation, but many of the
current generation may remain “lost” in unstable, low-paid
and low-productivity jobs in the informal economy. Access to
lifelong education is a possible solution, but requires
addressing wider problems in the education sector.

Part 1

Box 2.2: Acquiring Productive Skills without Losing the Bigger Picture
Contributed by the Global Agenda Council on Education & Skills
Demand for higher education is set to grow in the coming decades. Secondary school graduates will increase in number
and a rising share will strive to continue their schooling at the tertiary level in pursuit of “good jobs”.
Part 2

Unfortunately, these future students have no guarantee that their tertiary education will actually equip them with the skills
they need to fill those jobs. Many current graduates are discovering that despite their academic qualifications – often
gained at significant expense – they lack the specific technical and professional skills demanded by the ever-changing
jobs market.

Part 3

An obvious response to this problem is to reform the traditional model of academic universities aimed at the middle classes
in advanced economies so that it places more emphasis on professional and vocational education and training. Many
countries that score highly on the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index have such systems, which can
be adapted to the needs of emerging economies where much of the increase in demand for tertiary education will be
centred.
As the resource-strapped public sector struggles to meet rising demand for higher education, it is also likely that for-profit
institutions will play a growing supply role. The necessarily high tuition and fees at many such institutions may lead them
naturally to focus on the preparation of jobs-ready graduates, at the expense of disciplines with less attractive career
payoffs, such as the arts and humanities.
This, in turn, raises the risk of eroding higher education’s role as a vital space for social discourse. As well as producing
graduates with specific skills demanded by the labour market, societies need graduates who can engage in informed and
thoughtful discussions of values and norms. An interconnected world cannot afford to neglect nurturing a new generation
of well-informed opinion leaders who can guide societies in beneficial directions.
The challenge is not only to prepare the future workforce, but to do so in a way that preserves the role of higher education
in focusing minds on the bigger picture.

The Future of Education
As public finances come under pressure, the rising costs of
higher education are increasingly borne by the individual.
Many graduates in developed economies leave university
not only highly educated but also highly indebted.17
Unfortunately, many then struggle to find their way into
careers commensurate with their education levels or
sufficiently remunerated to pay off their debts. According to
the International Labour Organization (ILO), under-30s in
advanced economies are far more likely than over-30s to be
taking up jobs for which they are overqualified. Often they
change frequently from one temporary job to another. Even
before the crisis, the term “Generation 700 Euros” had
become a common way to describe this phenomenon in
Greece.18
If potential students perceive higher education as a risky
investment, they may increasingly embark on university
degrees only if their families are able to offer financial
support. Higher education has traditionally been a way of
reducing income disparities by enabling people to move up
the social ladder, but it may now be starting to entrench
income disparities instead, with potentially dire
consequences for social cohesion. Some of the challenges
higher education institutions face are discussed in Box 2.2.

will also be reluctant to take on more financial risk to reeducate or invest in a start-up, which could potentially
reduce the dynamism of economies.
Fortunately, the disruptive role of technology may ultimately
restore the equalizing role of higher education. The spread of
high-speed Internet is opening up access to free or
inexpensive quality online courses. Such courses also
promise to help make education and further training a
lifelong possibility in developed as well as developing
economies, enabling people to update their skills in
response to the fast-changing job markets of modern
knowledge economies.
Educational establishments and businesses also need to
work together to ease the school-to-work transition. The
professional education system needs to be revised in many
countries. A dual education system, such as in Germany and
Switzerland – with professional education on the job and
parallel education at a vocational school – may lower many
of the barriers and risks depicted above. Other models for
public-private partnerships to mitigate risks for effective
investment in skills and training are at hand.19

Highly indebted students who cannot find a career allowing
them to pay back their debts will not be in a position to save
for the future, storing up trouble for social safety nets. They

Pragmatism and Political Engagement
A recent global opinion survey sheds light on the awareness,
priorities and values of global youth.20 All around the world,
young people are well aware of the challenges, such as
pressures on old-age pensions, an increase in the
occurrence and intensity of natural catastrophes, meeting
the energy needs of the world in 2050 or feeding 9 billion
people. Indeed, this survey confirms the result of the Global
Risks Perception Survey, where young people under 30
came across as more concerned with risks on average and
with environmental risks in particular.
The breadth and homogeneity of their awareness speaks of
their high level of interconnectedness. Global events are
quickly brought to the local level, often with a personal touch
due to friends in social networks.21 These personal channels
filter the world of the “digital natives” – the first generation to
be brought up with everyday communication and information
dominated by Web browsers and smartphones.22
Another picture repeated over the world is that young people
look for solutions first among themselves and second in the
circle of family and friends. They are willing to invest more in
private pension schemes, rely on close personal contacts in
case of natural catastrophes, want to do more to prevent
food waste and are willing to invest in clean energy sources.
What does not appear on their radar screen of solutions is
the state or government. They think independently of this
basic fallback system of the older generation – governments
providing a safety net.23

36

Global Risks 2014

This points to a wider distrust of authorities and institutions.
The mindset of this age cohort has been shaped by
experiences such as the apparent helplessness of
governments in the face of the recent economic downturn
and recent revelations about online spying by US intelligence
agencies.24 Anti-austerity movements and other protests
give voice to an increasing distrust in current socioeconomic and political systems. The young are an important
constituent of the general disappointment felt in many
nations with regional and global governance bodies such as
the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
This generation draws confidence for taking things into their
own hands from the technical developments they
experienced while growing up. The digital revolution gave
them unprecedented access to knowledge and information
worldwide. They are used to collaborating and sharing, and
addressing global issues on their respective local levels.
They value collaboration and transparency, are able to build
abstract networks addressing single issues and place less
importance on traditionally organized political parties and
leadership.
The challenge for those in positions of authority in existing
institutions is to find ways to engage the young generation.
Young people’s enthusiasm to address global risks is there
to be tapped, but they will engage in conventional
governance only if mechanisms to do so can be devised to
fit with their new ways of operating.

Part 1

Investing in the Future

First, youth must be prioritized in political agendas. The
younger generation needs jobs and career opportunities and
adequate education, as discussed in Box 2.3, as well as
power in political forums and discourse. Only if young people
see and get a chance to make a living, a career – or just a
liveable life – will they integrate into the global society. This will

Second, a systemic environment that fosters long-term
investments will be crucial to prevent this young generation
from being lost. To bridge the pension and social protection
gap affecting the young, countries will have to strengthen
both the economic security of the young generation and
ensure robustness of old-age pension systems. In emerging
markets, the challenge is to put systems in place to ensure
that the current youth will not have to face the same problems
as their counterparts in advanced economies.

Part 3

Box 2.3: The Challenge of Youth Unemployment
Contributed by the Global Agenda Council on Youth Unemployment
Urgent, bold and collective action is required to promote job creation and address the skills mismatch. Government, business,
education, civil society and the financial sector all have a role to play.
About 300 million young people – over 25% of the world’s youth population – have no productive work, according to World
Bank estimates.1 An unprecedented demographic “youth bulge” is bringing more than 120 million new young people on to the
job market each year, mostly in the developing world.2
Youth unemployment on this scale is not only a waste of human capital and potential but also threatens to halt economic
progress, creating a vicious cycle of less economic activity and more unemployment. It also raises the risk of social unrest by
creating a disaffected “lost generation” who are vulnerable to being sucked into criminal or extremist movements.
Part of the problem is that economic growth is no longer generating enough of the skilled and stable jobs that previous
generations took for granted. This is a by-product of years of technological advances and globalization, along with labour
market regulations that incentivize companies to prefer retaining older workers to hiring new ones.
Of course, technology is also creating many new jobs, businesses and even industries. These jobs demand more from
workers than basic skills, but there is a growing skills mismatch. In a recent global survey, one in three employers claimed to
have trouble filling open positions with qualified candidates. Many school leavers lack both the specific credentials and “soft”
skills – such as critical thinking, problem solving, time management and communication – they need to compete for jobs or
become entrepreneurs.
Concerted effort is required to match education and training to the new digital opportunities. Technology is a significant aspect
of the employment landscape and opportunity for young people, and one that government and the private sector can directly
nurture and support at both the national and sub-national levels. Governments, for example, can mobilize stakeholders behind
properly funded national action plans with measurable outcomes, and look for ways to incentivize employers to hire younger
workers.
The private sector can guide curriculum and training programme design by communicating about projected skills needs.
Businesses can work with the educational sector to establish partnerships with schools and improve apprenticeship
opportunities. Educational and civil society organizations, in partnership with industry, can prioritize entrepreneurship
education, soft skills and earlier delivery of sector-relevant and professional skills in schools, all of which promote employability.
There are encouraging examples: Serbia’s National Action Plan for Youth Employment has been cited as a model by the
Council of Europe, while Germany’s apprenticeships programme has helped cut its youth unemployment rate to less than half
the European average.
Successful initiatives need to be urgently replicated and scaled up to solve this complex, cross-sector challenge. Youth
employment policies must also be designed and implemented with the experience of the youth in mind to understand their
attitudes and abilities.

Part 1
Part 2

Third, political and regulatory conditions need to be adjusted
to strengthen and incentivize investments with a long-term
perspective.25 Companies and financial systems need to give
greater priority to their long-term resilience and look beyond
short reporting cycles, as explored in Part 2.5.26 At the same
time, opportunities must be enhanced for individuals to build
assets, to save and to invest.

Part 3

The public and private sectors can work together to foster
lending and investment with long-term perspective. The
insurance industry can play a central role in risk mitigation for
entrepreneurs and collectives, but governments and
international institutions have to facilitate intergenerational
asset transfer as well. Only fair and sustainable systems of
tax and subsidy redistribution will ensure growth that also
encompasses social protection, remedies poverty and
allows for resource-friendly and environmentally sound
development.
Finally, migration needs to be managed with a long-term and
global perspective. Migration can reallocate skilled
workforces, providing an opportunity to address the skills
mismatch, but with the risk of brain drain in the countries
from which skilled labour migrates.27 To make migration a
win-win situation for the country of origin and the receiving
economy, it is crucial to incentivize a subsequent return of
the skilled emigrants to their country of origin and to
strengthen the related international agreements.

While cyberspace has proved largely resilient to attacks and
other disruptions so far, its underlying dynamic has always
been such that attackers have an easier time than
defenders. There are reasons to believe that resilience is
gradually being undermined, allowing this dynamic of
vulnerability to become more impactful.
First, the growth of the “Internet of Things” means that ever
more devices are being connected online, touching many
more parts of life and widening both the potential entry
points for and impacts of disruption. Second, there is
ever-deepening complexity of interactions among the many
aspects of life that are dependent on connected devices,
making those impacts potentially harder to predict.
Together, these twin trends demand new thinking about
global governance of the Internet. Yet the prospect of
achieving this has been undermined by recent revelations
about the extent to which national security organizations are
shaping cyber policy and conducting espionage and
attacks, eroding trust among the very stakeholders whose
collaboration will be necessary to avert a conceivable
“Cybergeddon”.

Offence vs Defence in Cyberspace
Cyber risks are not new. It was written in 1988 that
“espionage over networks can be cost-efficient, offer nearly
immediate results, and target specific locations … insulated
from risks of internationally embarrassing incidents.”28
Warnings about a “cyber Pearl Harbor” extend back to
1991.29 However, although online espionage and crime
remain daily issues, cyberspace has so far been resilient to
truly disruptive infrastructure attacks, those that could break
systems or societies and not just pilfer information.

38

Global Risks 2014

Part 1

Many companies use a “red team”, or penetration testers, to
try to break into their own online systems to improve their
security. This practice dates back to at least 1979, when the
ARPANet had not yet become the Internet and TCP/IP
protocols were not yet standard. As one report put it back
then: “Few, if any, contemporary computer security controls
have prevented a [red team] from easily accessing any
information sought.”30 The same remains true today, and
cyber risks will likely continue to get more serious, year after
year, until global stakeholders can upturn this underlying
dynamic or restore trust.
This is not impossible. In physical warfare, the dynamic
between attackers and defenders has flip-flopped with
inventions such as the machine gun and the tank. It will,
however, be made more difficult by the online world’s
increasing interconnectedness and complexity.

Interconnectedness, Complexity and
Systemic Risks
A threat to the Internet increasingly means a threat to
everything. Every part of the world’s societies and
economies uses the same underlying infrastructure, the
same hardware, software and standards with billions of
devices connected to the Internet, from simple e-book
readers to electrical distribution networks.31
In the past, cyber attacks typically had only a limited effect
because they broke only ones and zeroes or things made of
silicon. Organizations under attack might have a bad week,
but after that they generally could execute business
continuity plans, rebuild computers and use data from
securely backed-up vaults. However, projects such as the
Smart Grid – online connection of electrical power
generation and transmission – are increasing the possibility
of cyber attacks breaking things made of concrete and steel.

What kinds of disruption are possible? Cyber risks are often
summarized through the acronym CHEW – crime,
hacktivists, espionage and war.35 But there are other risks in
cyberspace that could have systemic impacts. For example,
a large cloud provider could suffer an Enron- or Lehmanstyle failure virtually overnight.
Environmental triggers could also easily play a role,
especially given the inherent fragility of the underlying
physical infrastructure. A long-dreaded earthquake on the
San Andreas fault could devastate the world’s technical
centre of Silicon Valley. A solar super-storm could cause
substantial outages of national grids, satellites, avionics or
signals from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). The
growing mass of “space junk” in orbit around the earth also
poses a threat to GNSS.
A surprising number of critical systems rely on GNSS,
including emergency 911 calls, ATMs and other financial
infrastructure, and both wired and wireless communications
networks.36 Wireless is fast becoming the vital “last few
metres” of Internet connection, and there are growing
concerns that government sell-offs of the radio spectrum
may have made it more vulnerable to interruption. The World
Radiocommunication Conference in 2015 will analyse the
extent and potential consequences of this nascent risk.
Disruption to the critical systems that rely on GNSS could
have significant cascading effects while workarounds are
found for systems that now depend on hyperconnectivity,
since fewer and fewer people now remember the old
pen-and-paper ways of doing things. Risks arising from
hyperconnectivity urgently require multistakeholder
collaboration, but trust among stakeholders is under
pressure.

The Role of National Security
Organizations
Recent months have seen a series of revelations about the
online role of national security organizations. The
militarization of cyberspace was already common
knowledge: over 30 nations have a published cyber warfare
doctrine, with 12 having formal organizations (such as the US
Cyber Command).37 However, wider understanding of the
extent to which national security organizations have allegedly
been using the Internet for espionage now threatens
repercussions that may make it more difficult to prevent
widespread attacks, or contain them when they occur.
Global Risks 2014

39

Part 3

Nonetheless, risks to the Internet continue to grow more
serious for one key reason: attacking others in cyberspace
(breaking into or disrupting their system) has always been
easier than defending them. The offence has had the
advantage over the defence. This dynamic is in part historic:
the Internet was built for resilience rather than security, since
everyone using it in the earliest days was trusted. But the
practical underlying dynamic – an attacker needs only to find
a single way through defences at a single point in time, while
the defender must defend all vulnerable points forever –
increasingly threatens to undermine that resilience.

As Rod Beckstrom, former President of Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), puts it:
“Everything that is connected to the Internet can be hacked,
and everything is being connected to the Internet.”32 This
growing hyperconnectivity raises the prospect of disruptions
having systemic impact. Previous publications from the
World Economic Forum have highlighted that
interdependence introduces new vulnerabilities and
opportunities for failures cascading from unexpected
directions.33 This can have far-reaching impacts: “When the
shock to the system is greater than what the system can
tolerate, the number of functions the system can perform
may decrease dramatically.”34

Part 2

Cyber incidents have so far tended to have effects that are
either widespread but fleeting (such as the Morris Worm,
which took down an estimated 10% of the early Internet) or
persistent but narrowly focused (like the 2007 attacks on
Estonia). No attacks or even failures have been both
widespread and persistent. This is due to robust standards
and networks, high levels of investment and the ability of the
technical community to flock to and overwhelm disruptions
(such as undersea cable outages). Such feats are possible
only due to the open and participative structure of the
Internet, driven by non-state actors such as incidence
response teams and service providers.

Part 1
Part 2
Part 3

For national security organizations, the dynamic of attackers
having the advantage over defenders brings advantages of
being able to spy anonymously on their adversaries.
However, by the same logic, nations are also vulnerable to
the use of such tactics by others. Immediate benefits to
national security come at the price of more long-term cyber
risk for interconnected societies and economies.

have a profound effect on the value that society could and
should expect from the Internet in a more hyperconnected
world.

An increasing erosion – or even eventual breakdown – of
international trust seems a natural consequence. A lack of
trust and confidence helped to accelerate the financial crisis
(such as when nations limited the amount of help their banks
could give to subsidiaries in other nations) and could prove
similarly disastrous when dealing with international cyber
shocks.

While it is possible for the balance of advantage between
attackers and defenders to flip, it is also possible for it to
become more pronounced. A future in which attackers −
whether hackers, organized-crime groups or national
militaries − have an overwhelming, dominant and lasting
advantage over defenders could be just one disruptive
technology away.

There are already signs that revelations about the role of
national security organizations have exacerbated risks of
fragmentation of the Internet, which could lead to an overall
erosion of the factors that led cyberspace to be so
transformational in the first place. In the early days of the
Internet, the interests of industry, governments and society
largely converged. Now that the stakes are higher, these
interests are diverging and conflicting, which can lead to
suboptimal solutions, reduced innovation and investment,
and a risk of a fragmentation of the Internet; for example,
through the imposition of strong national boundaries where
none currently exists.

Attackers in this future could achieve a wide range of effects
with little input, making large-scale, Internet-wide disruptions
easy and common. The Internet would cease to be a trusted
medium for communication or commerce and would be
increasingly abandoned by consumers and enterprises.
Cyberspace would no longer be divided between attackers
and defenders but between predators and prey.

This trend is already apparent, most clearly with the
approach China has taken, but also with reports that the US
government may have leveraged US-based IT and telecom
companies as part of national security surveillance efforts.
As nations are increasingly distrustful of the US government
not to look at their data if it is stored in or transits that nation,
they are more likely to follow the lead of Brazil or the EU to
consider erecting laws to ensure that data on their citizens
does not leave their own jurisdictions.
Concerns about the US hosting ICANN, the main
governance body for the Internet, could further fuel a
Balkanization of the Internet. This trend is also apparent in
corporate “walled gardens” that attempt to lock users in or
restrict what software can be run in the walled environment,
and provisions by governments to block preferential market
access to IT firms in other countries.
The main casualty of US spying allegations may not be US
relations with Germany or Brazil, but people’s trust in their
government’s integrity on online privacy. Young people
around the world, disillusioned with traditional politics and
authorities as explained in the previous section of this report,
may increasingly see governments as an online aggressor to
be confronted. Behaviour such as online spying that national
governments and the Cold War generations might see as
business-as-usual are likely to be seen as much more
personal affronts today.
This complex interconnection of issues touches on multiple
interacting layers – standards, infrastructure, data and
derived knowledge – which have outpaced the adaptive
ability of the world’s governance response. Certainly the
governance approaches will have to change, which could

The Worst-case Scenario:
“Cybergeddon”

Worse yet, this situation could become entrenched as
the increasingly fragmented nature of the Internet
stymies attempts to reach global agreement on new,
more secure technologies or standards. Cooperation
among nations or non-governmental organizations
would become similarly useless either because there is
rampant mistrust in creating newer security standards
or because attackers are ubiquitous, relentless and
triumphant. A technology company has explored this
future in a scenario called “Insecure Growth”: “This is a
world in which users – individuals and business alike
– are scared away from intensive reliance on the
Internet. Relentless cyber attacks driven by wideranging motivations defy the preventive capabilities of
governments and international bodies. Secure
alternatives emerge, but they are discriminating
and expensive.” 38
This future has also been called a “Cybergeddon”.39 The next
generation could grow up with a cyberspace that is less
open, less resilient and fundamentally less valuable than the
one existing today. The most transformative technology
since Gutenberg would regress, to the loss of societies,
economies and humanity. Piecemeal, individual solutions
generally fail to address the underlying systemic issue: the
mismatch between attackers and defenders. The world will
not be able simply to secure, risk-manage or informationshare its way out of this situation to tip the balance of
advantage towards defenders.
Even if international trust were to be rebuilt, attackers would
still retain the advantage and new solutions would need to be
found. Global stakeholders should be under no illusion that
bigger budgets, more information-sharing or more regulation
will make much difference. To shift the advantage to the
defenders will require new thinking, and soon.

Box 2.4: Towards Measurement of Cyber Risks

Part 2

As constant digital connectivity becomes the new norm in economies and societies, there is a need to “normalize” cyber
risks. A critical step in advancing the collective capacity to manage systemic risks will be to develop methodologies to
measure and price these risks. Efforts to quantify such risks are needed, and in some cases have started, at
multiple levels.
At the enterprise level, moving towards a risk-based approach for dealing with cyber threats and vulnerabilities will require
improved methods to deal with such risks in line with broader enterprise risk management practices of the kind discussed
in Part 2.5. Many organizations are already attempting to evolve their internal practices in this regard, and collaboration
among companies to share ideas can also be observed.
A number of challenges must be overcome in such efforts. Not least of these is capturing the full range of potential
vulnerabilities – connected supply chains, outsourcing and other factors make the idea of the “enterprise network”
somewhat fluid – as well as determining the scope of impact, on stock prices or reputation, for example.

Part 3

Given the implied value of “intangibles and goodwill” threatened by cyber events, there would seem to be considerable
opportunity for the nascent cyber risk insurance market to evolve and mature. While insurance companies are no
strangers to underwriting events with a high degree of uncertainty, improved and standardized methods to capture and
account for risks at the enterprise level would clearly aid the development of this market. Other non-insurance, risk-transfer
markets could also be imagined; some central banks have begun to consider potential systemic risks posed by
cyber attacks.
Research has also started on understanding the macroeconomic impact of cyber risks on national competitiveness, GDP
and growth. Countries’ ability to drive competitiveness through technology has been documented by the Forum’s Global
Information Technology Report for many years, while other studies have focused on the Internet’s contribution to national
GDP. However, there are emerging research discussions on specifically measuring a country’s readiness or capacity to
deal with cyber risks, as well as the economic impact of slowed business investments due to concerns over such risks.
Finally, further research is required on the impact of concerns about cyber risks on global trade flows and output. Security
concerns can lead to, or be used to defend, protectionist positions that can have a negative impact on trading relations.
Should such concerns result in a fragmented policy landscape or the Balkanization of the Internet, global trade will suffer.

A Question of Trust
Increasingly, there is recognition that the growing role of
cyberspace is not only a technical and geopolitical concern
but also presents serious risks to economic well-being.
While the failure of critical online infrastructure represents a
systemic risk that could impact global growth, so does a
large-scale loss of trust in the Internet. Stakeholders may
need to move beyond traditional solutions, with fresher ideas
that can scale and move away from a national security
mindset.
Thinking of cyberspace in economic terms offers several
advantages. Economic cooperation and recognition of the
gains from global trade has provided a positive platform to
promote global international relations, rather than focusing
on narrow national interests and protectionism. This can be
directly applicable to cyber risks. Protecting the “common
good” of the Internet creates strong economic incentives
among the youngest generation, the “digital natives”.
Of course, the economic frame is more than an analogy.
Many corporations already think of cyber risks in terms of
reputational and stock-price impacts, raising the issue to the
strategic level that an effective strategy requires. Some
countries, too, have taken explicit steps to position
themselves as safe places to do business in the digital age,
integrating cybersecurity with capacity building.

Many of the gains already seen from globalization would not
have been possible without the Internet. Much of the
innovation and promise of growth foreseen in the coming
years is also predicated on an Internet as integrated as it is
today, and similar levels of trust. These innovations are
occurring at all levels, from entire industries (e.g. the
“connected car”) to individual entrepreneurs in emerging and
developing economies around the world.
The economic perspective does not preclude other
perspectives. Geopolitical, military and technical dialogue
will still need to continue. But to the extent that stakeholders
can recognize the tremendous gains from a stable, secure
and resilient Internet, the space for constructive discourse
can be expanded and a useful context provided for
discussions on protecting cyberspace.
A critical element in advancing this discussion will be
improving the collective ability to measure the economic
impact of cyber risks, at all levels – within individual
businesses, nationally and globally (see Box 2.4). Effective
methods for measuring and pricing cyber risks may even
lead to new market-based risk management structures,
which would help in understanding the systemic
interdependencies in the multiple domains that now depend
on cyberspace.

2.5 Strategies for Managing
Global Risks

The risk analysis and management process is broadly the
same across most firms, as depicted in Figure 2.5, but – as
explored in the following sections – there is a wide spectrum
of ways in which each step of the process is carried out.

The previous sections have explored ways in which global
risks could play out in the next decade – geopolitical turmoil,
the potentially far-reaching effects of youth unemployment
and cyber vulnerabilities. Many other ways are possible.

Figure 2.5: The Risk Analysis and Management Process

Part 3

Firms must distinguish between risks they can only hope to
manage, and risks they can also hope to address through
collaborative action; a consistent message of this report is
that global risks are best addressed collaboratively.
However, firms cannot rely on others, or on collaborative
measures alone, to minimize how they will be affected by
global risks. They need to prepare for them within their own
organizations.
More and more firms have learned the hard way that when it
comes to unlikely but impactful risks, such as natural
disasters, intercontinental pandemics or financial crises, it is
unwise to rely on the hope that they probably will not happen
in the next few years. Tempting as it is for managers to take a
NIMTOF (“not in my term of office”) approach to lowlikelihood risks, it can lead to severe adverse impacts if the
risk occurs.
This section examines the wide variety of ways in which firms
approach risk in general. It goes on to suggest strategies for
firms – and also governments – to build resilience to shocks
from systemic global risks that, through interconnections
and interdependencies, may impact them in unexpected
ways.

How Firms Approach Risk
Over the past decade, risk management has assumed a
much more important role in many firms across different
industry sectors. In general, there is a trend away from
technical planning for individual risks and towards holistic
planning for a range of unspecified risks. A spate of crises
and extreme events in recent years has convinced many
companies that the benefits of globalization have been
accompanied by a much greater degree of interdependency
and interconnectedness, bringing new vulnerabilities from
unexpected directions.
A related trend is for risk management to be approached
from a more strategic and enterprise-wide perspective,
typically with a chief risk officer (or some senior executive
playing this role) reporting to the chief executive officer and
the board, rather than decentralized to departments or
reporting to the chief financial officer. Having the chief risk
officer report to the top makes possible a more holistic
approach to risk, where previously individual departments
might have argued only for addressing risks that specifically
affected them. This dynamic applies to governments, too,
where there is also a tendency for departments to argue for
attention to their own sector-specific risks rather than take a
more holistic overview of the risks of the greatest national
importance that may interact with and reinforce others if not
mitigated.

Identifying and Assessing Risks
Firms’ perceptions and assessments of risks can be skewed
by decision-making biases, such as the “availability” bias.
This involves overestimating the likelihood of a recently
experienced disaster and underestimating the likelihood of
those that occurred in earlier years. For example, a firm in
Thailand whose building was burned down during political
unrest decided to build its new office nearer the airport,
which proved to be a high-risk location when floods afflicted
the country in 2011.
Another decision-making bias that can skew risk perception
is the tendency to put risks perceived as being below a
possible threshold of likelihood in the category of “it will not
happen to us”. For example, after the Japanese earthquake,
all seven production lines of one large IT firm shut down; its
risk planning had previously focused on a worst-case
scenario of only one or two lines going down. Finally, another
perception distortion is not realizing the hidden benefits of
pre-emptive measures such as redundancy.
These are examples of “intuitive”, in contrast to “deliberative”,
thinking about risk. Many firms now attempt to avoid the
pitfalls of intuitive thinking by employing more formal
deliberative techniques, such as scenario analysis, stress
tests and ranking/scoring metrics. Still, in some leading
firms, risk assessment does not go beyond qualitative
analysis through meetings and discussions. Figure 2.6
shows the range of methods employed by firms for
identifying and assessing risks, based on a series of
interviews of 100 S&P 500 firms conducted recently.40
In the finance and insurance sectors in particular, there is
strong reliance on quantitative measures of risk probability.
Some other firms, wary of being blindsided by erroneous

Part 1

assumptions in the numbers that go into calculating the
likelihood of adverse events, prefer to focus solely on the
severity of risks and disregard any attempt to estimate their
probability of happening.

Part 2

In most firms, risk assessment is now a highly formalized
process conducted systematically and regularly, whether
annually, quarterly, monthly or continuously. In some firms,
risk assessment is part of the process through which the
senior leadership defines the firm’s willingness to assume
certain risks as a matter of high-level corporate strategy.
Figure 2.7 shows the level at which risk identification,
prioritization and assessment are performed in various firms.

Firms are typically much more aware than they were even a
few years ago of how interdependencies can lead to shocks
affecting them in unexpected ways. For instance, historically
a crisis befalling a competitor might have been regarded
principally as an opportunity to gain market share; today,
there is an awareness of the possibility of knock-on
consequences, such as governments responding with hasty
and ill-considered regulatory changes affecting the entire
industry. Regulators are as prone as other decision-makers
to the bias of placing too much emphasis on recent
experiences.

Box 2.5: Managing Risk

Part 2

Risk-management strategies are guided by a firm’s risk appetite; the level of risk an organization is prepared to accept to
achieve its objectives, such as profitability and safety goals. Often, although not always, there is a trade-off between
profitability in times of normal operations and resilience in the face of negative events affecting the firm. Examples of risk
management and monitoring strategies include:
– Mitigation measures: Actions taken by the firm to reduce the likelihood and/or consequences of a negative event; for
example, designing plants to withstand specific levels of natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes.
– Accountability measures: Finding ways to incentivize individual employees not to cut corners in ways that would
normally be undetectable but would increase a firm’s vulnerability in a crisis, such as failing to maintain back-ups. Some
firms hire external consultants to assess how effectively they are mitigating risks identified as priorities.

Part 3

– Supply-chain diversification: Sourcing supplies and raw materials from multiple providers in different locations to
minimize disruption if one link in the supply chain is broken. Another hedge against sudden unavailability of inputs is to
maintain an excess inventory of finished products.
– Avoiding less profitable risks: Firms may decide to drop activities altogether if they represent a small part of their
overall business but a significant part of their risk profile.
– Transferring the risk: In addition to the range of insurance products available – liability, property, business interruption
– some large firms run their own “captive” insurance companies to distribute risks across their own different operations
and subsidiaries.
– Retaining the risk: When insurance is unobtainable or not cost-effective, firms can choose to set aside reserves to
cover possible losses from low-probability risks.
– Early warning systems: Some firms employ their own teams to scan for specific risks that may be brewing, from
political crises, for example, to storms off the coast of Africa that may become hurricanes in the US in the next fortnight.
– Simulations and tabletop exercises: Many firms simulate crisis situations; for example, by making critical staff
unexpectedly unavailable and assessing how other employees cope. Such exercises can capture lessons to be
integrated into the risk-management strategy.
– Back-up sites: Many firms are set up so that if one or more factory or office becomes unusable, others are quickly able
to assume the same functions.
A crisis-management strategy complements a firm’s risk-management strategy by defining roles and decision-making
procedures for preserving the continuity of business to reduce the economic, social and reputational impacts to the firm in
the event of an emergency. Crisis-management plans identify who will be the most relevant decision-makers in a crisis.
The key person is usually a manager in the affected location. In crises that are severe and span international boundaries,
the chief executive officer and the board of directors are often involved. A growing number of firms have developed a
general crisis plan to address unforeseen risks that complement specific plans for dealing with risks that have previously
been experienced or scenarios that are considered especially plausible.

The upside of this dynamic is that it creates awareness of the
potential benefits of opening up channels of communication
with competitors and the government so as to compare their
risk- and crisis-management strategies. Box 2.6 explores the
growing acceptance of the need for joint efforts involving
companies, governments, civil society and research
institutions to minimize the occurrence of global risks and
their impact.

Such dialogues enable mutual learning about risks on the
horizon; they also create trust, which can be extremely
helpful in navigating a crisis. Box 2.7 summarizes lessons
learned from recent disasters in Asia on the need for
“disaster governance” – coordinating diverse efforts among
public, private and non-profit responses in a crisis. Chile’s
44

rapid economic recovery after the devastating earthquake of
2010 is another important example of success in
government-led multistakeholder coordination.
Many firms have improved their risk management by
systematically learning from their own catastrophic losses
and near-misses as well as from other firms, even in different
industries. For example, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico
in 2010 prompted firms in various sectors to think more
about operational risk. One leading firm in the energy
industry studied the experience of investment banks after
the financial crisis of 2008 to gain a new perspective on
organizational blind spots. An auto-parts supplier revamped
its approach to enterprise risk management after studying
what happened to Enron and WorldCom.

Part 1

Box 2.6: Public-Private Partnerships for Managing Catastrophic Risks
Contributed by the Global Agenda Council on Catastrophic Risks

Part 2

No single entity possesses all the necessary authority, resources or expertise required to assure a community’s security
and resilience to catastrophic risks. Government action alone cannot be relied on to prevent, protect against, respond
to, recover from and mitigate the effects of adverse events. Governments need to be able to leverage the collective
strengths and capabilities of the private sector and non-profit communities.
As people and things are increasingly hyperconnected and many critical infrastructure systems are intrinsically
international in nature, the impacts of catastrophic events know no geographical, jurisdictional or industry boundaries.
The interdependencies inherent in shared and global infrastructure can compound existing systemic risks, making
consequences non-linear and hard to predict.

Part 3

In this environment, to strengthen overall resilience to catastrophic risk, the ability to create, effectively utilize and sustain
multistakeholder partnerships is crucial. The public and private sectors must establish channels for structured dialogue,
interaction and coordination to more comprehensively understand risks before they manifest and to more effectively
manage them when they do.
The public and private sectors bring different capabilities to the table. For example, the public sector can offer disaster
management frameworks, including legal protections, personnel and training. The private sector can offer products and
supplies, innovative business processes, community understanding and engagement, customer collaboration-driven
engagement, and intimate knowledge of how critical infrastructure and communities work at a local level. Both sectors
can offer research and development.
However, there is not always a perfect overlap between the interests of public and private sector stakeholders in
catastrophic risk management. While they share many interests – such as the safety and security of people and property
and continuity of business – the private sector is also interested in establishing competitive advantages. When seeking
to create a public-private partnership, all potential partners should be able to identify a value proposition for partnering
and demonstrate a return on investment. That means identifying what interests can be aligned and mutual benefits
gained.
Successful public-private partnerships also identify and agree to outcomes and objectives, establish roles and
responsibilities, leverage environmental factors that support such partnerships, and mitigate any environmental barriers
to the successful implementation of such partnerships. The World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on
Catastrophic Risks works to codify and articulate such leading practices about how public-private partnerships
can work.
A cultural shift is under way, out of necessity, towards the creation of public-private partnerships to address catastrophic
risks. Analysing the establishment and operations of these partnerships, as well as the effective use of the partners’
collective capabilities, is a vital step towards strengthening communal security and resilience.

Open dialogue about risk is important not only outside a
company but also within it, to ensure that the board of
directors, C-suite and employees share a common
understanding of the organizational approach. In fact, more
boards are becoming proactive by asking management
what the firm is doing to handle global risks as part of their
overall strategy. Communication with others in the supply
chain can be equally important, given that risk
interdependencies can create cascading effects across
borders and industry sectors. One of the most important
steps a firm can take to improve its own risk management is
to work with others in its supply chain to ensure that they are
doing the same.

Towards a Culture of Long-term Thinking
The growing trend for boards to be involved in risk
management is creating opportunities to shift organizational
cultures away from a focus on quarterly results or daily
share-price movements and towards the kind of longer-term
thinking that is a prerequisite for addressing global risks. A
similar shift is also urgently required in government, where
the natural focus is on electoral timeframes − the NIMTOF
philosophy.
The role of chief risk officer, reporting to the chief executive
officer and the board, is an institutional acknowledgement of
the challenges in combining long- and short-term thinking –

Box 2.7: Learning from Responses to Large-scale Disasters
Since the devastating tsunami in the Indian Ocean in December 2004, a multitude of large-scale disasters have hit the
Asia-Pacific region. Valuable lessons have been learned about the factors that determine how people and institutions cope
with disasters, and how to reduce the cascading or compounding effects of disasters.
Part 2

In the aftermath of a catastrophic event, it is challenging to coordinate the massive influx of resources and organizations to
meet pressing needs amid heavy damage to infrastructure. Emergency response to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in
2013, for example, was delayed as most airplanes carrying crucial relief supplies were too big to land on smaller airstrips,
causing bottlenecks at nearby international airports.
And beyond the first crucial weeks of the relief phase, coordination has become even more complex as more actors get
involved. Alongside national responders and international NGOs, external contributions now typically come from foreign
religious-affiliated institutions, private corporations and business networks. As the focus switches from immediate
humanitarian aid to longer-term recovery, this can create tensions with efforts to maintain national sovereignty.

Part 3

The past decade has consequently seen a shift away from “disaster management” to what is referred to as “disaster
governance”. There is growing attention to the need for “downward” accountability – ownership of relief and recovery
efforts by the beneficiaries in the affected regions – to match the attention already given to “upward” accountability, which
is about countering funders’ fears of waste and corruption.
In recent years, for example, ASEAN has partnered with civil society organizations on capacity building for downward
accountability. After the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, China paired institutions offering assistance with a specific region.
After 700 bushfires raged across Australia’s Victoria state in February 2009, the response operations featured sharing of
information across government agencies and with the public, along with community engagement and local decisionmaking in the subsequent rebuilding efforts.
In general, disasters are exacerbated by poverty, badly planned and badly managed urbanization, environmental
degradation and weak institutions for managing risk at local and national levels. These effects were exemplified by the
Thailand and Cambodia floods of 2011. Political support for disaster preparedness activities, from both the legislative and
executive bodies, is central, but there is still a lack of funding and prioritization from international organizations and national
governments, especially in lower-income countries. These countries may not have the liquidity or borrowing capacity to
expeditiously recover from natural disasters, but evidence has shown that risk transfer to insurance markets can be
particularly effective for these countries to avoid drastic disruptions to economic growth.
Going beyond the preparedness of institutions and formal mechanisms, containing damage from disaster also calls for an
expansion of preparedness in society as a whole. For example, the Singapore government conducts regular large-scale
exercises to stress-test crisis capabilities and rehearse the unfolding of interdependencies. An exercise in 2012 involved
18,000 employees participating in terror-attack simulation.
Scientific advances have been made in early-warning systems, digital technologies and in-time meteorological data, but
these must be coupled with awareness campaigns and mainstreaming disaster preparedness in educational systems.
Countless lives could have been saved as Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines had there been a greater level of popular
understanding of the devastating effects of the typhoon “surge”.

effectively outsourcing the full-time task of long-term
thinking, short-term aggregation and troubleshooting to a
designated individual and department. The equivalent in
governments is the growing interest in the possible
appointment of cabinet-level national risk officers, as was
proposed and discussed at the 2012 G20 in the context of
disaster risk-financing practices.41
While there will always be a temptation to prioritize shortterm concerns over long-term ones, both firms and
governments can seek to nurture an institutional culture of
valuing those in charge of thinking about risk, through
remuneration, such as contingent bonuses, and other
indications of prestige, such as high-level access.
46

Global Risks 2014

Incentive structures need to be closely analysed and, if
necessary, overhauled to encourage long-term thinking. For
instance, a culture that rewards decisions made quarterly or
annually will likely trigger short-term thinking, while a
knowledge management strategy is likely to contribute to
longer-term thinking. To foster long-term thinking and
commitment to the firm, a significant portion of bonuses in a
number of companies is now based on the effectiveness of
programmes and recommendations made 5-10 years back.
Despite encouraging trends around the world, discussions
with chief risk officers still reveal some frustration in their
attempts to get board members to take seriously risks that
are perceived as low-probability. Given that the cognitive

Part 1
Part 2

biases discussed above affect even senior executives and
directors, reframing issues can be surprisingly important.
Spreading upfront costs over time is another common
technique: amortizing the cost of investments in resilienceenhancing measures over a number of years can make the
upfront cost seem less forbidding. This strategy can be
combined with negotiating long-term insurance contracts
that have lower premiums to reflect investment in protective
measures as part of a risk-management strategy. If the
premium savings exceed the annual costs of a long-term
loan to finance the investment, the mitigation measures will
be cost-effective and financially attractive to undertake.

Part 3

Offering long-term loans to cover investments in resilience is
a strategy with wider applicability, being used, for instance,
by the World Bank to aid developing countries take steps to
reduce risks from adverse events. These could include
enforcing building codes to reduce losses from earthquakes,
floods and other natural disasters.
Many risk officers have also found that focusing on salient
events – describing concrete experiences rather than relying
on abstract statistics – is an effective tool to concentrate the
attention of high-level decision-makers. This strategy,
however, needs to be combined with efforts to ensure there
is no undue fixation on specific recently experienced risks.
Ultimately, leaders in both the public and private sectors
need to be able to ask themselves concrete questions. The
following checklist may provide guidance:
1. What are the top five risks facing the organization and
what does its risk appetite suggest with respect to
managing them?
2. What are the exposed assets, and how vulnerable are
they?
3. What options can address these risks relative to what is
being done currently?
4. What support is needed, and from whom?
Despite recent progress, many leaders are still unable to
answer these questions confidently. When all can, the world
will be better equipped to meet global, systemic risks.

Part 3: Towards Ten Years of
the Global Risks Report

Part 3

Since it was introduced in 2006, the Global Risks report has
provided a unique analysis of the risks that are shaping the
global environment, and the potentially cascading negative
consequences of their interactions. The overall goal is to
provide a platform for dialogue among business,
government and civil society on how countries, businesses
and people can prepare for, mitigate and build resilience in
the face of risks.
As the report nears its 10th edition in 2015, this section
reflects on the insights gathered from past reports on how to
map and address global risks. These reflections provide a
basis to reassess and update the approach and
methodology, to ensure that the report remains at the cutting
edge of collective understanding of global risks.

Defining and Identifying Global Risks
The number of global risks included in the Global Risks
report series has changed over time. While 25 risks were
included in 2006, 50 were identified in 2012 and 2013 and
were then streamlined to 31 in this report. The systemic
nature of global risks has been emphasized since the
beginning, while the report’s 10-year time horizon has
allowed for a focus on strategies and policies to anticipate
and manage potential risks, rather than merely react to them.
In the coming year, a number of expert workshops will be
held to review the definition of global risk – currently seen as
an occurrence that causes significant negative impact for
several countries and industries – to identify and understand
their nature, and to enhance comprehension of the
interconnections between them.
One challenge is to distinguish between a risk and a trend or
a vulnerability. Technically, a risk is something that has not
happened yet, whereas a trend or a vulnerability is already
under way. Some global risks in this year’s report, such as
severe income disparity, may be more accurately viewed as
a trend or a vulnerability. In many cases, the distinction is far
from clear – for example, opinions may differ on whether
major loss of biodiversity is an event that could yet happen
or a process that is already happening.
50

Global Risks 2014

Another challenge is to determine a common level of
granularity among global risks: Is a political collapse of a
nation of geopolitical importance at the same conceptual
level as overall global governance failure? Can the failure to
mitigate climate change that threatens to make the earth
increasingly uninhabitable be placed at the same level of
gravity as a one-off, large-scale cyber attack?

Mapping Global Risks
Throughout the Global Risks report series, risks have been
analysed on two dimensions: likelihood and impact. Both
can be important when aiming to prioritize which risks to
attempt to prevent (i.e. reducing the likelihood of the event)
and/or mitigate (i.e. reducing the severity of the impact).
Experience has shown, however, that neither can be
measured definitively. Initially, the report attempted to
measure impact by assigning (when possible) actuarial
values such as an estimated number of deaths or the
economic impact in US dollars, based on expert input. This
arguably had the advantage of being as objective a measure
as possible, but had the disadvantage of relying heavily on
assumptions and being unable to account for a range of
outcomes – there are, for example, widely varying estimates
of the financial impact of climate change depending on the
level of temperature rise. Also, this approach cannot be
extended to all risks: it is impossible to estimate the likely
financial and human cost of, for example, biodiversity loss or
geopolitical conflict.
Since 2009, the report has used expert surveys that ask
respondents to estimate impact and likelihood. This has the
advantage of being more applicable to risks of different
natures, allowing for greater ease of comparison. On the
downside, perception data can be skewed by cognitive
biases of the kind discussed in Part 2.5 of this report, which
predispose people to be more concerned with current
headlines and recently-experienced risks. Nonetheless, this
approach can highlight areas that are of most concern to
different stakeholders, and potentially galvanize shared
efforts to address them.

Part 1

Towards a Multistakeholder Approach

Part 2

The responsibility of preparing for, mitigating and building
resilience against many of the risks discussed in this report
remains fragmented and unclear. People in the best position
to influence solutions to a risk may not be the ones who have
most to lose from it. Questions surrounding who can and
should take ownership of planning for the risk, and what is
an acceptable level of risk, remain difficult to answer.

Part 3

With these concerns in mind, the Global Risks report series
has increasingly emphasized the importance of
interconnectivity and the systemic nature of global risks, with
the possibility of multiple simultaneous or sequential shocks.
By their nature, global risks cross borders. No country,
industry or organization can deal with them in isolation. They
require collective thinking and responses, taking a long-term
perspective. The report has increasingly moved towards
providing a basis for discussion among stakeholders on how
to mitigate risks, prepare for them and strengthen resilience
in a collaborative fashion.

Looking Ahead to the 10th Anniversary
The adjustments to the survey and analysis in this year’s
report are part of the ongoing efforts to provide a solid base
for the World Economic Forum’s work on global risks in the
future, and mirror the evolving nature of global risks. Drawing
on the Forum’s multistakeholder community of business,
academia, government and civil society, the methodology
and analysis will be reviewed and improved during the
course of 2014, in preparation for the report’s 10th
anniversary in January 2015.

Conclusion

This report has explored how a wide range of global risks –
from the possibility of fiscal crisis in an important economy to
the fallouts from new technologies, social tensions and
changing geopolitical relations – could have long-lasting and
far-reaching systemic impacts.
In exploring the global risks landscape for 2014, this report
has highlighted the importance of several underlying themes
in tackling global risks:
– Trust is necessary if stakeholders are to work together to
tackle global risks, but trust is being undermined in some
systemically important areas. For example, much of the
younger generation lacks trust in traditional political
institutions and leaders, while recent revelations about
cyber espionage have undermined trust in the Internet in
general and the governance of cyberspace in particular.
– Long-term thinking is a prerequisite for any approach to
global risks. This report has explored strategies through
which corporations and governments can attempt to
incentivize a shift from short-term to long-term time
horizons.
– Collaborative multistakeholder action is required as
businesses, governments, or civil society alone do not
have both the tools and the authority to tackle systemic
risks. We hope that the mapping of global risks and their
interconnections will provide a common base to better
understand risks and their consequences, and for
dialogue as a first step towards collective action.
– Global governance is key to addressing global risks
such as climate change or cybersecurity, but new
models are urgently needed as the world’s increasing
multipolarity renders its current global governance
structures unwieldy and outdated.

Global Risks 2014

This report has aimed to increase awareness of and inspire
action on the most important risks the world faces over the
next 10 years, in the hope of addressing the most pressing
of these challenges. The World Economic Forum will
continue to provide a platform for leaders to work together
on preparing for risks, mitigating them and strengthening
resilience.

Appendix A - Definitions of Global Risks 2014

Geopolitical Risks

Environmental Risks

Economic Risks

Global Risk

Description

Fiscal crises in key economies

Excessive debt burdens generate rising interest rates, inflationary
pressures and sovereign debt crises

Failure of a major financial mechanism or institution

A financial institution or currency regime of systemic importance
collapses, with implications throughout the global financial system

Liquidity crises

Shortages of financial resources from banks and capital markets
become extreme and recurring, while the ability to sell assets is
reduced

Structurally high unemployment/underemployment

A sustained high level of unemployment that is structural rather
than cyclical in nature coincides with a rising skills gap and high
underemployment, especially among youth populations

Oil-price shock to the global economy

Sharp and/or sustained oil price increases place further economic
pressures on highly oil-dependent industries and consumers, while
raising geopolitical tensions

Failure/shortfall of critical infrastructure

Chronic failure to adequately invest in, upgrade and secure
infrastructure networks leads to a major breakdown, with systemwide implications

Decline of importance of the US dollar as a major
currency

A shift away from the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency
impacts the global economic and financial system, and changes
the geopolitical balance

Greater incidence of extreme weather events (e.g.
floods, storms, fires)

Property, infrastructure and environmental damage linked to
development in hazard-prone areas increases, as does the
frequency of extreme weather events

Greater incidence of natural catastrophes (e.g.
earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions,
geomagnetic storms)

Existing precautions and preparedness measures fail in the face
of geophysical disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic activity,
landslides, tsunamis or geomagnetic storms, causing widespread
disruptions in interconnected supply chains and communication
networks

Greater incidence of man-made environmental
catastrophes (e.g. oil spills, nuclear accidents)

Existing precautions and preparedness measures fail to prevent
man-made catastrophes, causing greater harm to lives, human
health, infrastructure, property, economic activity and the
environment

Major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse (land
and ocean)

Degradation of biodiversity results in severely depleted resources
for industries such as fishing and forestry, with potentially
irreversible consequences for the environment

Water crises

A significant decline in the quality and quantity of fresh water
combines with increased competition among resource-intensive
systems, such as food and energy production

Failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation

Governments and businesses fail to enforce or enact effective
measures to protect populations and to help businesses impacted
by climate change to transition

Global governance failure

Weak or inadequate global institutions, agreements or networks,
combined with competing national and political interests, impede
attempts to cooperate on addressing global risks

Political collapse of a nation of geopolitical
importance

One or more systemically critical countries experience significant
erosion of trust and mutual obligations between states and
citizens, leading to state collapse, internal violence, regional or
global instability and, potentially, military conflict

Increasing corruption

The widespread and deep-rooted abuse of entrusted power for
private gain (by businesses and public officials) undermines the rule
of law and governance

Global Risks 2014

Description

Major escalation in organized crime and illicit trade

Highly organized and very agile global networks commit criminal
offences while the illegal trafficking of goods and people spreads
unchecked throughout the global economy

Large-scale terrorist attacks

Individuals or non-state groups successfully inflict large-scale
human or material damage, which is particularly problematic when
decentralized and widespread

Deployment of weapons of mass destruction

The availability of nuclear, chemical, biological and radiological
technologies and materials leads to major international crises

commodities, stockpile reserves and expropriate natural resources

Food crises

Access to appropriate quantities and quality of food and nutrition
becomes inadequate or unreliable

Pandemic outbreak

Inadequate disease surveillance systems, failed international
coordination and the lack of vaccine production capacity lead to
the uncontrolled spread of infectious disease

Unmanageable burden of chronic disease

Increasing burden of illness and long-term costs of treatment
threaten recent societal gains in life expectancy and quality while
overburdening strained economies

Severe income disparity

Widening gaps between the richest and poorest citizens threaten
social and political stability as well as economic development

Antibiotic-resistant bacteria

Growing resistance of deadly bacteria to known antibiotics inhibits
the ability to control deadly diseases

Mismanaged urbanization (e.g. planning failures,
inadequate infrastructure and supply chains)

Poorly planned cities, urban sprawl and associated infrastructure
amplify drivers of environmental degradation and cope ineffectively
with migration, demographic and health challenges

Profound political and social instability

Military actions or aggressive foreign or trade policies on the part
of global or regional powers disrupt political or social stability,
negatively impacting populations, investment and financial markets

Breakdown of critical information infrastructure and
networks

Appendix B - Global Risks Perception Survey and Methodology 2014

As discussed in Part 1, the Global Risk 2014 report has
adjusted the list of global risks to take into account learnings
from past editions as well as developments in the global risks
landscape. As a result, the set of global risks was
streamlined with a view to improving the fit of the individual
risks with the definition introduced in this year’s report. The
Global Risks Perceptions Survey has been adjusted
accordingly. The following section describes the survey and
methodology in greater detail.

The Global Risks Perceptions Survey
The Global Risks Perception Survey, discussed in Part 1, is
the main instrument for assessing global risks in this report.
The survey was conducted between October and November
2013 among the World Economic Forum’s multistakeholder
communities of leaders from business, government,
academia and non-governmental and international
organizations. The graph below shows the profile of the
survey respondents. To capture the voice of youth, the
survey also targeted the World Economic Forum’s
community of Global Shapers. Under-30s accounted for
approximately one-quarter of the respondents.

Risks of Highest Concern in 2014

Interconnections in 2014

To identify the top 10 global risks of highest concern,
described in Part 1, respondents answered the following
question: “From the following list of 31 risks, please select
the five risks of highest concern globally and rank these from
1 (of highest concern) to 5 (of lowest concern)”. A score was
assigned for each answer based on the rank, from 5 points
for the first-ranked risk to 1 point for the fifth-ranked. For
example, if the risk of water crises was cited as the risk of
biggest concern (Rank 1), the answer would be assigned five
points; if it was cited as the fifth risk of most concern, the
answer would be assigned one point. The score earned by
each risk corresponds to the total points earned by that risk
across all responses divided by the number of responses.
The risks with the 10 highest scores were selected as the
risks of highest concern.

To draw the interconnection map presented in Part 1, survey
respondents were asked to identify three to six pairs of risks
they believed were connected, disregarding directions of
causality. A tally was made of the number of times each pair
was cited. This value was then divided by the count of the
most frequently cited pair. As a final step, the square root of
this ratio was taken to dampen the long-tail effect (i.e. a few
very strong links, and many weak ones) and to make the
differences more apparent across the weakest connections.
The value of the interconnection determines the thickness of
each connecting line in the graph, with the most frequently
cited pair having the thickest line. Out of the 465 possible
pairs, 178 or 38% were not cited. Formally, the intensity of
the connection between risks i and j, denoted
interconnectionij, corresponds to:

Formally, for any given risk i from the list of 31 risks, the score
is derived as follows:

Global Risks Landscape in 2014
Respondents were asked to assess the likelihood and global
impact of each of the 31 risks. For each risk, they were
asked, “How likely is this risk to materialize globally within the
next 10 years?” and “What is the estimated impact globally if
this risk were to materialize? (Impact is to be interpreted in a
broad sense beyond just economic consequences)”. The
possible answers ranged from 1 (“very unlikely” and “low
impact”, respectively) to 7 (“almost certain” and “high
impact”, respectively). Respondents were given the
possibility to leave the answer blank if they felt unable to
provide an informed answer (“don’t know”). A simple average
for both likelihood and impact for each of the 31 global risks
was calculated on this basis. Formally, for any given risk i, its
likelihood and impact, denoted respectively likelihoodi and
impacti, are:

impacti =

where Ni is the number of respondents for risk i, and
likelihoodi,n and impacti,n are respectively the likelihood and
impact assigned by respondent n to risk i and measured on
a scale from 1 to 7. Moreover, Ni1≠ Ni2 as, for each risk i,
survey respondents could choose not to answer each
question (“don’t know”).

where N is the number of respondents. Variable pairij,n is 1
when respondent n selected the pair of risks i and j as part of
his/her selection. Otherwise, it is 0.

Risks and Trends to Watch in 2014
Survey respondents were asked two open questions:
“Which risk of major global concern is missing from the list of
the 31 risks (list one risk only)” and “Which additional issue
could potentially emerge as a risk of major global concern in
the future (list one issue only)?” Given the large range of
answers provided by the respondents, answers were
manually grouped into broader categories. Figure 1.5 in Part
1 is an illustration of the recurrence of these categories: the
larger the category the more often it was mentioned. The
purpose of these two questions was to stimulate debate on
the identification of future risks and trends.

Acknowledgements
The Global Risks 2014 report synthesizes the insights, ideas
and contributions of many individuals through workshops,
group calls and research. The World Economic Forum and
the Global Risks 2014 report team is grateful to all who took
part in the challenge to think hard about global risks. Without
their dedication, guidance and support, it would not have
been possible to develop this report.
