Key messages
The global mean temperature in 2021 was around 1.11 ± 0.13 °C above the 1850–1900
pre‑industrial average. This is less warm than some recent years due to the influence of
La Niña conditions at the start and end of the year. The most recent seven years, 2015 to 2021,
were the seven warmest years on record.
Global mean sea level reached a new record high in 2021, rising an average
of 4.5 mm per year over the period 2013–2021.
The Antarctic ozone hole reached a maximum area of 24.8 million km2
in 2021. This unusually deep and large ozone hole was driven by
a strong and stable polar vortex and colder-than-average conditions
in the lower stratosphere.
Greenland experienced an exceptional mid-August melt
event and the first-ever recorded rainfall at Summit Station,
the highest point on the Greenland ice sheet at an altitude
of 3 216 m.
Exceptional heatwaves broke records across western
North America and the Mediterranean. Death Valley,
California reached 54.4 °C on 9 July, equalling a
similar 2020 value as the highest recorded in the
world since at least the 1930s, and Syracuse in Sicily
reached 48.8 °C.
Hurricane Ida was the most significant of the North
Atlantic season, making landfall in Louisiana on
29 August, equalling the strongest landfall on
record for the state, with economic losses in the
United States estimated at US$ 75 billion.
Deadly and costly flooding induced economic losses of
US$ 17.7 billion in Henan province of China, and Western
Europe experienced some of its most severe flooding
on record in mid‑July. This event was associated with
economic losses in Germany exceeding US$ 20 billion.
Drought affected many parts of the world, including areas in Canada,
United States, Islamic Republic of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkey
and Turkmenistan. In Canada, severe drought led to forecast wheat and
canola crop production levels being 35%–40% below 2020 levels, while
in the United States, the level of Lake Mead on the Colorado River fell in
July to 47 m below full supply level, the lowest level on record.
The compounded effects of conflict, extreme weather events and economic shocks,
further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, undermined decades of progress
towards improving food security globally.

Hydro-meteorological hazards continued to contribute to internal displacement. The
countries with the highest numbers of displacements recorded as of October 2021
were China (more than 1.4 million), Viet Nam (more than 664 000) and the Philippines
(more than 600 000).

than the average annual growth rate over
the last decade. This is despite a decrease
in fossil fuel CO2 emissions of approximately
5.6% in 2020 due to restrictions related to the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Stabilizing global mean temperature at 1.5 °C
to 2 °C above pre-industrial (1850 –1900)
levels by the end of this century will require
an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions, which must accelerate during
this decade.

The release of the World Meteorological
Organization State of the Global Climate 2021
report comes a few months after the release
of the Working Group I, II and III contributions to the Sixth Assessment Report of
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC). The present WMO report
provides an update on the annual state of
the climate observed in the year 2021, and
shows continued trends (also reported in
the IPCC reports) in terms of key indicators.
These include concentrations of greenhouse
gases, global annual mean surface temperature, global mean sea level, ocean heat
content, ocean acidification, sea-ice extent
and changes in mass of the ice sheets and
glaciers. While the key indicators show that
climate continues to change, information
on socioeconomic impacts highlights the
vulnerability of populations to current weather
and climate events. Loss and damages of
more than US$ 100 billion, as well as severe
impacts on food security and humanitarian
aspects due to high-impact weather and
climate events have been reported.
The increase in atmospheric concentration of
CO2 from 2019 to 2020 was slightly lower than
that observed from 2018 to 2019, but higher

Early warning systems are critically required
across sectors for climate adaptation. However, less than half the Members report having
early warning systems in place. WMO and its
Members are working closely to substantially
improve this situation in the near future.
I take this opportunity to congratulate the
experts and the lead author, who compiled
this report using physical data analyses and
impact assessments. I thank all the contributors, particularly WMO Member National
Meteorological and Hydrological Services
and Regional Climate Centres and United
Nations agencies, for their collaboration and
input. The present report is intended to help
our organizations to update world leaders and
citizens on the latest information about the
state of the Earth system, the weather and
climate conditions in 2021, and the impacts
of weather and climate events. WMO remains
committed to supporting this publication and
communicating it widely for this purpose.

Global climate indicators
Global climate indicators1 provide a broad
view of climate change at a global scale,
encompassing the composition of the atmosphere, energy changes, and the response of
the land, ocean and ice. These indicators are
closely interrelated. For example, the rise in
CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leads to an imbalance of energy and
thus warming of the atmosphere and ocean.
Warming of the ocean in turn leads to rising
sea levels, to which is added the melting of ice
on land in response to increasing atmospheric
temperatures. The global indicators draw on
a wide range of data sets that are listed at
the end of the present report and which are
based on multiple observing systems (see
Observational basis for climate monitoring).
Together, the indicators build a consistent
picture of a warming world that touches all
parts of the Earth system.
The connections between global climate
indicators and the Sustainable Development
Goals were highlighted in Climate Indicators
and Sustainable Development: Demonstrating
the Interconnections (WMO-No. 1271). That
report traces the links and feedback loops
among the key climate indicators as a physical system and the cascading risks to most
of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
Monitoring the global climate indicators,
as well as their related risks and impacts, is
therefore of critical importance for achieving
the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

BASELINES
Baselines are specific periods, usually spanning one or more decades, that are used as a
fixed period against which current conditions
can be compared. A variety of baselines are

4

used in this report, and these are specified
in the text and figures where appropriate.
Where possible, the WMO climatological
standard normal, 1981–2010, is used as a
baseline for consistent reporting. 2 For some
indicators, however, it is not possible to
use this baseline, due to either a lack of
measurement during the whole period, or
because a longer period is needed to calculate
representative statistics.
There are two notable exceptions. Firstly,
for global mean temperature, a baseline of
1850–1900 is used. This is the baseline used in
recent IPCC reports (Sixth Assessment Report,3
Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5 °C 4) as
a reference period for pre-industrial temperatures, and is relevant for understanding
progress relative to the goal of the Paris
Agreement. Secondly, for greenhouse gases,
atmospheric concentrations can be estimated
much further back in time, using gas bubbles
trapped in ice cores. The year 1750 is therefore
used in this report to represent pre-industrial
greenhouse gas concentrations.

GREENHOUSE GASES
Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases reflect a balance between emissions
from human activities, natural sources, and
sinks in the biosphere and ocean. Increasing
levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities have been
the major driver of climate change since the
mid-twentieth century. Global average mole
fractions of greenhouse gases are calculated
from in situ observations made at multiple
sites in the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW)
Programme of WMO and partner networks.

1981–2010 is used in preference to 1991–2020, for consistency with climate reports from WMO Members, not all of whom
have yet transitioned to using the more recent period.

In 2020, greenhouse gas mole fractions reached
new highs, with globally averaged surface
mole fractions of carbon dioxide (CO2) at
413.2 ± 0.2 parts per million (ppm), methane (CH4) at 1889 ± 2 parts per billion (ppb) and
nitrous oxide (N2O) at 333.2 ± 0.1 ppb, respectively 149%, 262% and 123% of pre-industrial
(1750) levels (Figure 1). The increase in atmospheric concentration in CO2 from 2019 to 2020
was slightly lower than that observed from 2018
to 2019, but higher than the average annual
growth rate over the last decade. This is despite
a decrease in fossil fuel CO2 emissions of
approximately 5.6% in 2020 due to restrictions
related to the COVID-19 pandemic.5 For CH4
and N2O, the increase from 2019 to 2020 was
higher than that observed from 2018 to 2019
and also higher than the average annual growth
rate over the last decade.
Real-time data from specific locations, including Mauna Loa (Hawaii) and Cape Grim
(Tasmania) indicate that levels of CO2, CH4
and N2O continued to increase in 2021.

Atmospheric methane (CH4) increase is an
issue of concern because it is not only a powerful greenhouse gas, but it is also a precursor
of tropospheric ozone, with implications for
human health, agriculture and ecosystems.6
The mean annual increase of CH4 decreased
from approximately 12 ppb per year during
the late 1980s to nearly zero between 1999
and 2006. Since 2007, atmospheric CH4 has
been increasing, and in 2020 it increased by
11 ppb over 2019 levels. Studies using GAW
CH4 measurements indicate that increased
CH4 emissions from wetlands in the tropics
and from anthropogenic sources at the
mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere are
the likely causes of this recent increase.7 These
studies have also pointed to the short-term
climate benefits and cost-effectiveness of
mitigating CH4 emissions. Such mitigation
measures were presented in the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
methane assessment 8 and address major
emitting sectors, namely oil and gas, agriculture and waste management.

TEMPERATURE
The global mean temperature in 2021 was
1.11 ± 0.13 °C above the 1850–1900 average
(Figure 2). The six data sets used in the analysis (see Global temperature data) place 2021
between the fifth and seventh warmest year
on record globally, and all six show that the
most recent seven years, 2015 to 2021, were
the seven warmest years on record.
The year 2021 was less warm than some
recent years due to the influence of moderate
La Niña events at the start and end of the
year, known as a “double-dip” La Niña (see
Drivers of short-term variability). La Niña
has a temporary cooling effect on the global
mean temperature, which is strongest in the
year following an event. Aside from the weak
La Niña of 2018, the last significant La Niña
event was in 2011. The year 2021 was around
0.22 °C to 0.29 °C warmer than 2011. The year
2016, which started during a strong El Niño,

The method for calculating global temperature anomalies relative to the 1850–1900
baseline has been updated from previous
state of the global climate reports. The new
method uses the assessment of temperature
change and its uncertainties from the IPCC
Sixth Assessment Report as a foundation
for estimating changes since 1850–1900.
Details are given in the section on Global
temperature data.
In the IPCC Six th Assessment Repor t,
Summary for Policymakers, 9 temperature
crossing points – the point at which longterm warming exceeds a particular level
– were assessed using a 20-year average
centred on the crossing point. For the period
2001–2020, the average was estimated10 to be
0.99 [0.84–1.10] °C. The provisional 20-year

the average of the six data sets used in the
present report, was 1.01 ± 0.12 °C above the
1850–1900 average.
Near-surface temperatures in 2021 were
above the 1981–2010 average across a broad
swath of North America and Greenland,
Northern and Tropical Africa, the Middle
East and Southern Asia (Figure 3). Areas with
below-average temperatures included parts
of Northern Asia, Australia, Southern Africa

of La Niña can clearly be seen in the Tropical
Pacific. Cooler conditions in Southern Africa,
India, and eastern Australia are characteristic
of La Niña. The cooler-than-average area in
Northern Asia stands in contrast to 2020,
which saw exceptionally high temperatures
in the region. This is partly associated with
the different phases of the Arctic Oscillation
in early 2020 (strongly positive) and early
2021 (strongly negative, see the section on
Arctic Oscillation (AO)), which had an imprint

lowering the average pH of the water, a process known as ocean acidification. All these
changes have a broad range of impacts and

OCEAN HEAT CONTENT

OCEAN
Most of the excess energy that accumulates
in the Earth system due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is taken up
by the ocean. The added energy warms the
ocean, and the consequent thermal expansion
of the water leads to sea-level rise, to which
is added melting land ice. The surface layers
of the ocean have warmed more rapidly than
the interior, mirrored in the rise of global
mean sea-surface temperature and in the
increased incidence of marine heatwaves. As
the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere
increases, so too does the concentration of

Increasing human emissions of CO2 and other
greenhouse gases cause a positive radiative
imbalance at the top of the atmosphere – the
Earth energy imbalance (EEI) – leading to
an accumulation of energy in the form of
heat in the Earth system which is driving
global warming.12,13,14 Around 90% of this accumulated heat in the Earth system is stored
in the ocean, which is measured through
ocean heat content (OHC). A positive EEI
signals that the Earth’s climate system is
still responding to the current forcing15 and
that more warming will occur even if the
forcing does not increase further.16 This in
turn is reflected in a continued increase of

it is unequivocal that human influence has
warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land,
and that it is extremely likely that human
influence was the main driver of the ocean
heat increase observed since the 1970s.17
Historical measurements of subsurface
temperature back to the 1940s mostly rely
on shipboard measurement systems, which
constrain the availability of subsurface temperature observations at a global scale and

Various research groups have developed
estimates of global OHC, and all results
show continued ocean warming (Figure 4).
Differences between the estimates at annual
to decadal scale arise from the various statistical treatments of data gaps, the choice of
climatology and the approach used to account
for instrumental biases. 21,22,23 A concerted
effort has been established to provide an
international view on the global evolution of
ocean warming up to the year 2021. 24
The upper 2 000 m depth of the ocean continued to warm in 2021 and it is expected that it
will continue to warm in the future – a change
which is irreversible on centennial to millennial timescales.25,26 The ocean heat content in
2021 was the highest on record, exceeding
the 2020 value by 14 ± 9 ZJ (Figure 4). All
data sets agree that ocean warming rates
show a particularly strong increase in the
past two decades. Ocean warming rates for
the 0–2 000 m depth layer (relative to the
ocean surface) reached 1.0 (0.6) ± 0.1 W m -2

SEA LEVEL
Global mean sea level (GMSL) integrates
changes occurring in many components
of the climate system. On interannual to
multidecadal time scales, changes to GMSL
result from ocean warming via thermal
expansion of sea water, melting of land ice
and exchange of water with water bodies
on land. Measured since the early 1990s
by high-precision altimeter satellites, the
GMSL rose by 2.1 mm per year between 1993
and 2002, and by 4.5 mm per year between
2013 and 2021, an increase by a factor of
two between the periods, mostly due to
the accelerated loss of ice mass from the
ice sheets. 28 In 2021, GMSL reached a new
record high. Compared to previous El Niño
and La Niña years (for example, in 1997/1998,
2010/2011, 2015/2016), during which the GMSL
displayed temporary positive or negative
anomalies of several millimetres, 2021 was
marked by an increase of the GMSL that was
close to the long-term trend (Figure 5).

Although sea level has risen almost everywhere since 1993, it has not risen equally
everywhere. Regional patterns of sea-level
change are dominated by local changes in
ocean heat content and salinity. Several
regions continue to be affected by a rate of
sea-level rise substantially faster than the
global mean (see Figure 6, which shows the
difference between local and global sea level).
This is particularly the case in the western
Tropical Pacific, the South-west Pacific, the
North Pacific, the South-west Indian Ocean
and the South Atlantic. In other regions, local

sea level have only varied a little over the last

MARINE HEATWAVES AND COLD SPELLS
Analogous to heatwaves and cold spells on
land, marine heatwaves (MHW) and marine
cold spells (MCS) are prolonged periods of
extreme heat or cold that affect the ocean.
They can have a range of consequences for
marine life and dependent communities, 29
and MHWs have become more frequent over
the twentieth century. Satellite retrievals of
sea-surface temperature are used to monitor MHWs and MCSs, categorized here as
moderate, strong, severe or extreme (for
definitions, see Marine heatwave and marine
cold spell data).

Much of the ocean experienced at least
one “strong” MHW at some point in 2021
(Figure 7). Due to the below-average
sea-surface temperatures associated with
the double-dip La Niña (see El Niño–Southern
Oscillation (ENSO)), MHWs were conspicuously absent in the eastern Equatorial
Pacific Ocean, which was also one of the
only regions of the global ocean to see
broad coverage of MCSs (Figure 8). The
Laptev and Beaufort Seas experienced “severe” and “extreme” MHWs from January
to April 2021. The ice-edge regions to
the east of Greenland (August), north of
Svalbard (October), and east of the Ross
Sea (December) experienced notable “extreme” MHWs. In 2021, almost all MCSs
were “moderate”, except in areas of high
variability such as the poleward extension
of the Gulf Stream.
MHWs in 2021 showed an average daily coverage of 13%, which is less than the record of
17% in 2016 and 16% in 2020. For the eighth

OCEAN ACIDIFICATION
The ocean absorbs around 23% of the annual emissions of anthropogenic CO2 into
the atmosphere. 30,31 While this slows the
rise of atmospheric concentration of CO2, 32
CO2 reacts with seawater and reduces the
pH of the ocean, 33 a process known as ocean
acidification (Figure 9). The current global rate
of ocean acidification exceeds, by at least an
order of magnitude, the rates inferred for the
Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM),
which occurred around 56 million years ago
and was associated with large perturbations
of the global carbon cycle. 34 The IPCC Sixth

very high confidence that open ocean surface
pH is now the lowest it has been for at least

the pH of the ocean decreases, its capacity
to absorb CO 2 from the atmosphere also
declines. 35

CRYOSPHERE

Ocean acidification threatens organisms and
ecosystem services, and hence food security,
tourism and coastal protection. Local and
regional acidification is of great relevance to
marine organisms and biological processes.
However, there is high variability in coastal
areas due to a range of factors affecting CO2
levels. National data sets of ocean acidification observations submitted towards the

repeated observation and measurement of
ocean acidification along the coastlines and in
the open ocean. While there are currently still
gaps in the global coverage, capacity building
efforts increase the capability of many nations
to measure, manage and report ocean acidification data, as confirmed by the growing
number of countries participating in data

Melt rates were close to the 1981–2010 average early in the melt season. However,
sea-ice extent decreased very rapidly in
June and early July in the Laptev Sea and
east Greenland Sea regions. As a result,
the Arctic-wide sea-ice extent reached a
record low for the time of year in the first
half of July. The monthly July average was
the second to fourth lowest on record (tied
with 2012 and 2019), with strong regional
contrasts 38 (Figure 11). More ice than normal
(1981–2010) was found in the Beaufort and
Chukchi Seas, but the Siberian and European
sectors (Laptev Sea and East Greenland Sea)
had much less sea ice than normal. One
exception was the eastern Kara Sea, where
some sea ice persisted for the whole season.
Conditions shifted rapidly after July, with a
sustained period of colder weather across the
Arctic Ocean. This slowed the sea-ice melt
and August 2021 ended up with the tenth
lowest extent on record.
With the slowdown in melt in August, the
minimum September extent was greater
than in recent years but still well below the
1981–2010 average, representing the twelfth
lowest minimum ice extent in the 43-year
satellite record (Figure 10). The 2021 minimum
extent was observed39 on 16 September at
4.72 million km2, while the mean September
ice extent was 4.92 million km2, well below
the 1981–2010 average.

Antarctic sea ice
Sea-ice extent across the Southern Ocean
in 2021 was generally below the 1981–2010
mean, with below-average extents before the
February minimum, slightly above-average
extents during most of the winter, an exceptionally early maximum ice extent at the end
of August, and the establishment of extents
that were well below average by the end of
the year.
The minimum in the 2021 annual cycle occurred on 19 February, when sea ice covered
2.60 million km2, the fifteenth lowest extent
in the record (1979–present). The extent of

ice at the annual minima began to increase
in magnitude in the early 1990s, reaching a
maximum of 3.68 million km2 in 2013, before
dropping sharply to 2.08 million km2 in 2017,
the lowest ice extent in the period 1979–2021.
Since then, the extents at the annual minima
have increased slowly. In February, most
Antarctic sea ice was found in the Weddell
Sea and therefore the sea-ice extents at
the annual minima largely reflect regional
changes in that area.
Antarctic sea ice reached its maximum annual
extent of 18.80 million km2 on 30 August 2021.
This was close to the average magnitude
in terms of extent, and the twenty-second
largest in the 43 years of data. However,
this was the second earliest maximum, with
only one other maximum having occurred in
August (that of 2016).
After the middle of September, the sea-ice
extent for the whole Southern Ocean was persistently below average, with the ice extent decreasing to 6.77 million km2 (–1.82 million km2
below average) on 24 December, the third
lowest for that day in the record. At that
time, ice extents were below average in all
sectors around the continent, but the lack
of ice in the Weddell, Bellingshausen and
Ross Seas had the greatest impact on the
Antarctic-wide anomaly.

Glaciers are formed from snow that has
compacted to form ice, which can deform
and flow downhill to lower and warmer altitudes, where it melts. If the glacier terminates
in a lake or the ocean, ice loss also occurs
through melting, where ice and water meet,
or by calving of the glacier front to form
icebergs. Glaciers are sensitive to changes
in temperature, precipitation and sunlight,
as well as other factors, such as changes in
basal lubrication, warming ocean waters or
the loss of buttressing ice shelves.
Over the period 2000–2019, global glaciers
and ice caps (excluding the Greenland and
Antarctic ice sheets) experienced 40 an average mass loss of 267 ± 16 Gt per year.
Mass loss was higher, at 298 ± 24 Gt per
year, in the later part of the period from
2015–2019. Glaciers in several mid-latitude
regions thinned at more than double the
global average (0.52 ± 0.03 m per year) from

The World Glacier Monitoring Service collates
and analyses global glacier mass balance
data, including a set of 42 reference glaciers
with long-term observations. For the glaciological year 2020/2021, preliminary data
available from 32 of these reference glaciers
indicate an average global mass balance of
–0.77 m water equivalent (m w.e.41 Figure 12).
This is a smaller mass loss than the average
for the last decade (–0.94 m w.e. from 2011
to 2020), but is larger than the average mass
loss for the period 1991–2020, –0.66 m w.e.
Although the glaciological year 2020/2021
was characterized by a less negative glacier
mass balance than in recent years, there is a
clear trend towards an acceleration of mass
loss on multidecadal timescales (Figure 12).
On average, the reference glaciers have
thinned by 33.5 m (ice equivalent) since 1950,
with 76% of this thinning (25.5 m) occurring
since 1980.

An exceptionally warm, dry northern hemisphere summer in 2021 (see Heatwaves
and wildfires) exacerbated mass loss for
most glaciers in Alberta and southern British
Columbia in Canada, and the Pacific Northwest
of the United States of America. In the Coast
Mountains of British Columbia, Place and
Helm Glaciers lost more mass during the
period 2020–2021 than in any year since

measurements began in 1965 (Figure 13a).
In the Canadian Rocky Mountains, mass loss
from Peyto Glacier was the second greatest
since 1965, after the strong El Niño year of
1998 (Figure 13b). Repeat LiDAR surveys 43
indicate mass balances of –2.66, –3.30,
and –1.95 m w.e. on Place, Helm and Peyto
Glaciers, respectively. This represents roughly
twice the mean regional rate of thinning from
2015 to 2019.
Little snow remained on most of the mountain
glaciers in this region by mid-August 2021,
and many of these glaciers have lost their
firn zone, where multi-year snow undergoes
the transformation from snow to glacial ice.
Particulate deposition – including soot and
ash – from extensive regional wildfire activity
in summer 2021 meant that the surfaces
of the glaciers were unusually dark in July
and August and absorbed more sunlight

of ice (Figure 13c).

Ice sheets are expanses of glacial ice that
cover an area larger than 50 000 km2. In the
current climate, there are two ice sheets,
found on Greenland and Antarctica.

balance, which is the sum of mass losses at
the periphery from the calving of icebergs and
the melting of glacier tongues on contact with
the ocean; and the basal mass balance, which
consists of basal melting due to geothermal
heat and frictional heat generated by sliding
at the base of the glacier and by deformation
of the ice.
For Greenland, an ensemble of regional climate models44 gives an estimated total mass
balance45 of –166 Gt for the 2021 mass balance

Over the period September 1986 to August
2021, climate modelling indicates that the
Greenland ice sheet lost a total of 5 511 Gt
of ice, 49 an average mass loss of 157 Gt per
year (Figure 14). Mass loss has accelerated

The Antarctic ice sheet experiences negligible
surface melt compared to Greenland, but
some melt typically occurs on the Antarctic
Peninsula between November and February,
as well as on some of the low-lying ice shelves
and in coastal zones. The summer 2020/2021
melt season in Antarctica was moderate and
was below the 1990–2020 average. 55 The
northern Filchner Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea
experienced a strong but brief melt event in
mid-December 2020. The summer melt season in Antarctica concluded in mid-February
2021. The strongest positive melt anomalies

of the year were over the remnant Larsen B
and C ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula;
most other locations experienced near-normal
melt extent relative to the mean 1990–2020
conditions.
Despite near-normal surface melting in
Antarctica in summer 2020/2021, GRACEFO satellite gravity data indicate that the
Antarctic ice sheet continued to lose mass
in early 2021 (Figure 15), associated with
calving and marine ice sheet melting in the
Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica.
Antarctic ice sheet mass loss since 2010 is
largely driven by thinning and grounding-line
retreat of Thwaites Glacier, triggered by ocean
warming in this sector of the ice sheet. 56
GRACE-FO data 57 indicate that Antarctica
lost a mass of 296 Gt from November 2020
to November 2021, which is roughly double
the average rate of ice loss in Antarctica from
2002 to 2021 (Figure 15).

PERMAFROST
Permafrost occurs beneath about one eighth
of Earth’s exposed land area. It is ground
that remains at or below 0 °C for at least two
consecutive years. Permafrost thaw can lead
to landscape instability and other impacts,
including the emission of greenhouse gases
from previously frozen organic material. As
permafrost temperature approaches 0 °C,
changes in temperature in the ice-rich ground
are stalled due to the phase change between
ice and water. While temperature increase
may level off near 0 °C for several years
or decades due to the phase change, the
impacts of permafrost warming and thaw on
ground stability (including subsidence and
mass movements), hydrology, ecosystems
and infrastructure are often clearly visible
(Figure 18).
Since the 1990s, the Global Terrestrial Network
for Permafrost (GTN‐P) has compiled data sets
60

of permafrost temperatures (temperature
measured in boreholes) and active layer
thickness (the maximum thickness of the seasonally thawed layer above the permafrost).
GTN-P products rely mostly on research
projects to sustain activities. Long-term data
series from national and regional networks
operating in mountain and polar areas show
a continuation of past warming trends up to
2020, which is the most recent data available.

STRATOSPHERIC OZONE
Following the success of the Montreal
Protocol, the use of halons and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) has been reported as discontinued, although their levels in the atmosphere
continue to be monitored. Because of their
long lifetime, these compounds will remain
in the atmosphere for many decades. Even
if there were no new emissions, there is still
more than enough chlorine and bromine
present to cause the complete destruction
of ozone over Antarctica from August to
December. As a result, the formation of the
Antarctic ozone hole – an area of low ozone
concentration – continues to be an annual

The 2021 Antarctic ozone hole developed
relatively early and continued growing,
resulting in a large and deep ozone hole. It
expanded to 24 million km2 on 24 September
and remained close to this value until
mid-October 2021. The development of the
hole, and its extent and severity, were close
to that for the 2020 and 2018 seasons. The
ozone hole reached its maximum area of
24.8 million km2 on 7 October 2021, similar
to the areas in 2020 and 2018, and close
to the highest values observed in earlier
years, such as 28.2 million km2 in 2015 and
29.6 million km2 in 2006, according to an
analysis from the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) (Figure 19, left).
In terms of the total ozone column, NASA
reported a minimum ozone of 92 DU (Dobson
Units) on 7 October 2021, which was the lowest value for the 2021 season and for the past
17 years (Figure 19, right). After September
2021, the concentration of stratospheric
ozone was persistently reduced to near-zero
values between 15 and 20 km altitude over
Antarctica. Together with the 2020 season,
these are some of the lowest ozone values
ever measured via sondes at the Antarctic
stations, as reported by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

There are many different natural phenomena,
often referred to as climate patterns or climate
modes, that affect weather at timescales
ranging from days to several months. Surface
temperatures change relatively slowly over
the ocean, so recurring patterns in sea-surface
temperature can be used to understand and,
in some cases, predict the more rapidly
changing patterns of weather over land on
seasonal timescales. Similarly, albeit at a
faster rate, known pressure changes in the
atmosphere can help explain certain regional
weather patterns.

sixth deepest ozone hole in terms of minimum
ozone. The unusually deep and large ozone
hole in 2021 was driven by a strong and

major weather and climate events in different
parts of the world, and are described in further
detail below.

EL NIÑO–SOUTHERN OSCILLATION
ENSO is one of the most important drivers of
year-to-year variability in weather patterns
worldwide. It is linked to hazards such as
heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño, characterized by higher-than-average sea-surface
temperatures in the eastern Tropical Pacific
and a weakening of the trade winds, typically
has a warming influence on global temperatures. La Niña, which is characterized by
below-average sea-surface temperatures in
the central and eastern Tropical Pacific and
a strengthening of the trade winds, has the
opposite effect.
La Niña conditions emerged in mid-2020 and
peaked in the October–December period at
moderate strength, with average sea-surface
temperatures 1.3 °C below the 1991–2020
normal in the Niño 3.4 region (5°N–5°S,
120°W–170°W). La Niña weakened through
the first half of 2021, reaching an ENSOneutral state (temperatures within 0.5 °C of
normal) in May, according to both oceanic and
atmospheric indicators. However, sea-surface
temperatures cooled after mid-year, reaching
La Niña thresholds once again by the July–
September period. By the October–December
period, average sea-surface temperatures
once again reached moderate strength, at
1.0 °C below normal.
In addition to having a temporary cooling
influence on Earth’s global temperature,
La Niña is associated with drier-than-normal
conditions in East Africa. Kenya, Ethiopia
and Somalia experienced consecutive
below-average rainfall seasons in late 2020,
early 2021 and late 2021, which led to drought
in the region. In early 2021, precipitation
was higher than normal over the Maritime
Continent 61 (the climatologically important
region of islands and seas between mainland
South-east Asia and Australia and between

the Indian and Pacific Oceans) and lower than
normal in Patagonia at the beginning of the
year, which are typical patterns associated
with La Niña. Additionally, La Niña conditions
can contribute to above-average hurricane
activity in the North Atlantic, which experienced 21 named tropical cyclones during
its 2021 hurricane season (the 1981–2010
average for the entire season is 14). La Niña is
also associated with warmer and drier areas
across the southern tier of the United States
of America. In December, most states in this
region reported record or near-record high
temperatures, and several states were also
drier than average.

INDIAN OCEAN DIPOLE
The positive phase of the IOD is characterized
by below-average sea-surface temperatures in
the Eastern Indian Ocean and above-average
sea-surface temperatures in the west. The
negative phase has the opposite pattern. The
resulting change in the gradient of sea-surface
temperature across the ocean basin affects
the weather of the surrounding continents,
primarily in the southern hemisphere. Positive
IOD events are often associated with El Niño
and negative events with La Niña.62
A negative IOD developed during July 2021
and returned to neutral, although on the
negative side, by the end of the year. This
marked the first negative IOD since 2016.
In combination with La Niña, this phase
contributed to wet conditions in much of
Australia in the late austral winter and spring.
South-west Western Australia reported its
highest July rainfall totals since 1996, as did
many locations in South Australia. Australia
as a whole observed its tenth wettest spring
in its 122-year record, with the state of New
South Wales observing its fourth wettest.
November was the wettest November since
records began for both New South Wales
and Australia as a whole.63 Conversely, the
negative IOD, again in combination with
La Niña, likely contributed to the extreme
dry conditions in Eastern Africa.

ARCTIC OSCILLATION
The AO is a large-scale atmospheric pattern that influences weather throughout the
northern hemisphere.64 The positive phase is
characterized by lower-than-average air pressure over the Arctic and higher-than-average
pressure over the Northern Pacific and
Atlantic Oceans. The jet stream runs parallel
to the lines of latitude and farther north than
average, locking up cold Arctic air, and storms
can be shifted northward of their usual paths.
The mid-latitudes of North America, Europe,
Siberia and East Asia generally see fewer
cold air outbreaks than usual during the
positive phase of the AO. A negative AO has
the opposite effect, associated with a more
meandering jet stream and cold air spilling
south into the mid-latitudes where the jet
stream dips southward.
The AO was negative during the northern
hemisphere 2020/2021 winter and, seasonally,
was the most negative on record since winter
2009/2010 (Figure 20). The jet stream swept
down over North America, contributing to
the coldest February for the continent since
1994. However, the same wavy jet stream also
contributed to extreme warmth in parts of
Northern and Eastern Asia in February 2021
as it surged northward over the area, with

22

February

regions in Mongolia, China, Japan and the
Republic of Korea reporting record high temperatures for this time of year. The contrast
between the positive AO (winter 2019/2020)
and the negative AO (winter 2020/2021) could
explain some of the differences between
temperature patterns in the first quarters of
2020 and 2021. The negative winter phase
of the Arctic Oscillation has also been linked
to more moderate Arctic sea-ice loss the
following summer 65 (see Arctic sea ice).

SOUTHERN ANNULAR MODE
On the opposite side of the world, the SAM
(also referred to as the Antarctic Oscillation,
AAO) is a large-scale atmospheric pattern
that influences weather in the southern hemisphere. It is measured by the north–south
movement of the westerly wind belt that
circles Antarctica, dominating the middle to
higher latitudes of the southern hemisphere.
The positive phase is characterized by the
belt of strong westerly winds contracting
towards Antarctica and is linked to the La Niña
phase of ENSO. During a positive SAM, warm
and moist westerly flow over the northern
Peninsula leads to foehn warming on the
eastern side and anomalous warmth. The
negative phase, in contrast, is characterized

by an expansion of the belt of strong westerly
winds towards the equator.66 Notably, the
SAM can have large impacts on Antarctic
surface temperatures, ocean circulation and
rainfall patterns in parts of Australia.
The SAM was primarily positive or neutral
throughout 2021, and was strongly positive
both at the beginning of the year and near the
end of the year.67 This positive pattern likely
contributed to the record cold austral winter

and April–September cold season at the South
Pole, as it created anomalous low wind speed
and wind directions predominantly from the
northeast at the pole and prevented warm air
masses from reaching the area. Conversely,
Esperanza Station, on the north-east Antarctic
Peninsula, experienced its warmest year
on record, with an average temperature
of −2.6 °C. On 18 December, the temperature
reached 14.6 °C, an all-time December high
for the station.

High-impact events in 2021
Although understanding broad-scale changes
in the climate is important, the acute impacts
of weather and climate are most often felt
during extreme meteorological events such
as heavy rain and snow, droughts, heatwaves,
cold waves and storms, including tropical
storms and cyclones. These can lead to or
exacerbate other high-impact events such as
flooding, landslides, wildfires and avalanches.
This section is based largely on input from
WMO Members. The wider socioeconomic
risks and impacts associated with these
events are described in Risks and impacts.

HEATWAVES AND WILDFIRES
Exceptional heatwaves affected Western North
America on several occasions during June and
July. By some measures, the most extreme was
in late June in the north-western United States
and western Canada. Lytton, in south-central
British Columbia, reached 49.6 °C on 29 June,
breaking the previous Canadian national record by 4.6 °C, with temperatures reaching the
mid-40s as far west as the eastern suburbs
of Vancouver and the interior of Vancouver
Island. It was also more than 5 °C higher than
the previous highest known temperature north
of 50°N. Large numbers of heat-related deaths
occurred, with 569 reported in British Columbia
alone between 20 June and 29 July, 68 and
185 in Alberta,69 while in the United States
over a similar period, 154 heat-related deaths
were reported in Washington70 and at least 83
in Oregon.71 Many long-term stations broke
records by 4 °C to 6 °C, including Portland,
Oregon (46.7 °C). There were also multiple
heatwaves in the south-western United States.
Death Valley, California reached 54.4 °C on
9 July, equalling a similar 2020 value as the
highest recorded in the world since at least
the 1930s. It went on to be the hottest summer on record averaged over the continental
United States.

24

There were numerous major wildfires during
and after the heatwaves (including one which
largely destroyed the town of Lytton the
day after its record temperature). The Dixie
fire in northern California, which started
on 13 July, burned about 390 000 hectares
before being fully contained in October,
making it the largest single fire on record in
California. A rare winter wildfire caused major
property losses east of Boulder, Colorado on
30 December, with more than 1 000 homes
and other buildings destroyed or damaged.
The overall area burned during the season
in the United States was slightly below average,72 but in Canada it was well above average,
with Ontario having its largest seasonal area
burned on record and British Columbia its
third largest. Prolonged smoke pollution
affected many parts of North America during
the summer, with Calgary reporting a record
512 hours of smoke or haze, compared with
the long-term average of 12.
Ex treme heat af fected the broader
Mediterranean region on several occasions
during the second half of the nor thern
hemisphere summer. The most exceptional
heat was in the second week of August.
On 11 August, an agrometeorological station near Syracuse in Sicily, Italy, reached
48.8 °C, a provisional European record, while
Kairouan (Tunisia) reached a record 50.3 °C.
Montoro (47.4 °C) set a national record for
Spain on 14 August, while on the same day
Madrid (Barajas Airport) had its hottest day
on record with 42.7 °C. Earlier, on 20 July,
Cizre (49.1 °C) set a Turkish national record
and Tbilisi (Georgia) had its hottest day on
record (40.6 °C). Major wildfires occurred
across many parts of the region, with Algeria,
southern Turkey and Greece especially badly
affected. Over 40 deaths73 occurred in the
Algerian fires. France, Italy, North Macedonia,
Lebanon, Israel, Libya, Tunisia and Morocco
also experienced significant wildfires during
the period.

June was exceptionally warm in many parts
of Eastern and Central Europe. National June
records were set for Estonia (34.6 °C) and
Belarus (37.1 °C), while locations which had
their hottest June day on record included
St. Petersburg (35.9 °C) and Moscow (34.8 °C),
both on 23 June, Yerevan (Armenia, 41.1 °C)
on the 24th, and Baku (Azerbaijan, 40.5 °C)
on the 26th. Tampere in Finland reported its
highest temperature on record (33.2 °C) on
22 June. Latvia had its hottest June and summer on record. Further afield, Libya also saw
a prolonged heatwave in late June. Later in
the summer, abnormal warmth also reached
North-west Europe; 31.3 °C at Castlederg on
21 July was a record for Northern Ireland.
Two tropical nights were observed in Ireland
in July, with daily minimum temperatures
exceeding 20 °C in County Kerry.
For the third successive year, there were
major wildfires during the summer in Siberia,
particularly in the Sakha Republic around
Yakutsk. According to a report by the Federal
Forestry Agency of Russia, the number of fires
in Yakutia by the end of the summer was 2 295,
with an area of about 8.9 million hectares
burned since the beginning of the forest
fire season.
Fire activity in the Amazon region during the
August–September peak season was less than
in 2019 or 2020,74 but there was extensive
fire activity in other parts of Brazil, including
the Pantanal.

COLD SPELLS AND SNOW
Abnormally cold conditions affected many
parts of the central United States and northern
Mexico in mid-February. The most severe
impacts were in Texas, which generally
experienced its lowest temperatures since
at least 1989, with temperatures in some
areas staying below freezing continuously
for 6 to 9 days. On 16 February, Oklahoma
City reached −25.6 °C and Dallas −18.9 °C,
their lowest temperatures since 1899 and

1949 respectively. Electricity transmission
was severely disrupted, with power outages affecting nearly 10 million people at the
event’s peak. Frozen pipes were another major
cause of damage. A total of 226 deaths were
reported in the United States along with an
estimated US$ 24 billion in economic losses,
making it the costliest winter storm on record
for the United States.75
The winter of 2020/2021 was a cold winter
in many parts of Northern Asia. The Russian
Federation had its coldest winter since
2009/2010. Below-average temperatures
affected much of Japan in late December
and early January, with heavy snowfalls on a
number of occasions. A number of locations
on the Sea of Japan coast of Honshu had their
heaviest 72-hour snowfall on record in early
January. Much of China was also unusually
cold during this period, with Beijing reaching
−19.6 °C on 7 January, its lowest temperature
since 1966.
A severe snowstorm hit many parts of Spain
from 7 to 10 January, followed by a week of
freezing air temperatures. A total of 53 cm of
snow fell at the central city location of Retiro
(Madrid), and heavy falls were also reported
in many other parts of Spain.76 Some locations, including Toledo (−13.4 °C) and Teruel
(−21.0 °C), had their lowest temperatures
on record on 12 January in the wake of the
storm. There were major disruptions to land
and air transport. Later in the winter, in the
second week of February, the Netherlands
experienced its most significant snowstorm
since 2010, with heavy snow also falling in
Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom;
in the wake of the storm, Braemar recorded
−23.0 °C on 12 February, the lowest temperature in the United Kingdom since 1995.
In South-eastern Europe, Athens had its
heaviest snow since 2009 on 15 February.
Libya experienced unusual snowfalls between
15 and 21 February and again, on high ground,
in late December.
An abnormal spring cold outbreak affected
many parts of Europe in early April. Record

low April temperatures in France included
−7.4 °C at Saint-Etienne on the 8th and −6.9 °C
at Beauvais on the 6th, while Belgrade
(Serbia) had its heaviest April snowfall on
record on the 7th. It was the coldest April in
Poland in the twenty-first century. At high
elevations, national records for April were
set for Switzerland (−26.3 °C at Jungfraujoch)
and Slovenia (−20.6 °C at Nova vas na
Blokah). This followed a very warm end to
March with France having its warmest March
day on record on the 31st. Frost damage
to agriculture was widespread and severe,
with losses to vineyards and other crops
in France alone exceeding US$ 4.6 billion.
The United Kingdom went on to have its
lowest monthly mean temperature for April
since 1922.

PRECIPITATION
Compared to temperature, precipitation is
characterized by higher spatial and temporal variability. In 2021, large regions with
above-normal precipitation totals, relative to
the chosen climatology period (1951–2000),
were Eastern Europe, South-east Asia, the
Maritime Continent, areas of Northern South
America and parts of South-eastern North
America (Figure 21). Large regions with a
rainfall deficit included South-west Asia and

the Middle East, parts of Southern Africa,
parts of Southern South America and areas
in Central North America.
The onset of the West African Monsoon was
delayed. Later in the season, rainfall totals
were higher than normal, especially in the
western monsoon region. In total, the seasonal rainfall was close to normal. In Southern
Africa, in an area centred on Zambia, rainfall
amounts during the wet season until May
were below the long-term mean. It was at least
the second year in a row with below-normal
rainfall for Madagascar; rainfall totals have
been below average in most years since 2011.
In addition, both the wet seasons (April to May
and October to November) were drier than
usual in the Greater Horn of Africa region.
Above average rainfall totals were observed
in Alaska and the north of Canada, and in
the south-eastern United States and parts
of the Caribbean. Bet ween these t wo
wetter-than-average bands was a swath of
unusually dry conditions extending across
the width of the continent.
Unusually high precipitation amounts, relative
to the reference period, were recorded in
south-western and south-eastern Australia.

Unusually low precipitation amounts fell
around the Mediterranean Sea, while unusually high totals were detected around the
Black Sea and in parts of Eastern Europe.

FLOOD
Extreme rainfall, which was enhanced by
the moisture influx ahead of Typhoon In-fa,
hit Henan province in central China from
17 to 21 July. The most severely affected area
was around the city of Zhengzhou (the capital
of Henan Province), which on 20 July received
201.9 mm of rainfall in one hour (a Chinese
national record) and 382 mm in 6 hours.
For the event as a whole, the area received
720 mm, more than its annual average. The
city experienced extreme flash flooding,
with many buildings, roads and subways
inundated. The flooding was associated with
380 deaths or missing persons, and economic
losses of US$ 17.7 billion were reported.77
Further late-season flooding occurred in
early October, focused on Shanxi and Hebei
provinces.
Western Europe experienced some of its most
severe flooding on record in mid-July. The
worst-affected area was western Germany
and eastern Belgium, where 100 to 150 mm
of rain fell over a wide area on 14–15 July
onto ground which was already unusually wet
after high recent rainfall. Hagen (Germany)
reported 241 mm of rainfall in 22 hours.
Numerous rivers experienced extreme flooding, with several towns inundated, and there
were also several landslides. France, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland
also experienced significant flooding. The
number of deaths reported in Germany
was 183, and in Belgium it was 36, with
economic losses in Germany exceeding
US$ 20 billion.78
Persistent heavy rainfall in mid-March resulted
in major flooding in eastern New South Wales

in Australia.79 The week from 18 to 24 March
was the wettest on record averaged over
coastal New South Wales. The most severe
flooding was along the Hastings, Karuah and
Manning Rivers north of Sydney, but there
was also significant flooding in other areas,
including parts of western Sydney. There was
also flooding on many inland rivers, which
led to substantial recovery in water storages
severely depleted by the 2017–2019 drought.
At least US$ 2.1 billion in economic losses
were reported.
Two flash flood events associated with localized heavy rainfall occurred in Afghanistan
during 2021, in early May around Herat in the
west, and on 28–29 July centred on Nuristan
in the east. There was significant loss of life
in both events, with 61 deaths reported in
the May event and 113 in the July event.80
Flash flooding occurred on several occasions
around the Mediterranean and Black Sea
coasts. The most impactful event was on
the Black Sea coast of Turkey on 10 August,
where several towns experienced severe
damage and 77 deaths were reported. Rainfall
of 399.9 mm was recorded at Bozkurt in
24 hours. This event was associated with a
“Medicane” – a storm forming outside the
tropics that nevertheless has characteristics
of a tropical storm – in the Black Sea. Extreme
rainfall and flooding were also reported on
the Black Sea coast of the Russian Federation
from 12 to 14 August.
On 4 October, exceptional rainfall fell in coastal
regions of Liguria (north-west Italy), including
496.0 mm in 6 hours at Montenotte Inferiore
and 740.6 mm in 12 hours at Rossiglione.
Persistent above-average rainfall in the first
half of the year in parts of Northern South
America, particularly the northern Amazon
basin, led to significant and long-lived flooding in the region. The Rio Negro at Manaus
(Brazil) reached its highest level on record,
peaking at 30.02 m on 20 June.81 The most

widespread flooding was reported in northern
Brazil, but Guyana, Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela and Colombia were also affected.
The progress and withdrawal of the Indian
Monsoon was delayed, but overall Indian
monsoon rainfall was close to average, with
above-average rainfalls in the west offset
by below-average values in the north-east.
During the course of the season, 529 deaths in
India and 198 in Pakistan (as of 30 September)
were attributed to flooding, with further
deaths in Bangladesh and Nepal. 82 There
was further flooding in eastern India and
Nepal during the north-east monsoon season
in October and November. In Eastern Asia,
eastern China (except for Henan) was generally less wet during the monsoon season
than in 2020, but August was extremely wet
in Japan. Western Japan had its wettest
August on record, 83 with some locations
receiving more than 1400 mm of rain between
11 and 26 August. A tropical depression made
landfall in Malaysia on 16 December, leading
to severe flooding in Selangor and Kuala
Lumpur, with at least 52 deaths reported.
At Kuala Lumpur International Airpor t,
230 mm of rain was reported in 12 hours on
17–18 December.84
The rainy season in the African Sahel was
generally close to the average (1951–2000),
and less wet than in some recent years,
although there was still some significant
flooding reported, especially in Niger, Sudan
and South Sudan as well as Mali. Elsewhere
in Africa, Lake Tanganyika rose to more
than 3 m above its normal level in May, 85
displacing lakeshore residents in Burundi,
while Lake Victoria rose to its highest level
since satellite data began in 1992, surpassing
its peak from the previous year. High flows
in the Nile downstream of Lake Victoria,
along with substantial standing water still
remaining from floods in 2020, contributed to
continued flooding in parts of South Sudan

28

and Sudan despite near-normal rainfall
in 2021. In Southern Africa, much of which
had been experiencing long-term drought,
rainfall during the 2020/2021 rainy season
was above average in some regions, including
northern South Africa and Zimbabwe, with
some flooding reported, but was near or
below average further north.
Western Canada was affected by severe
flooding in November. At numerous locations
in southern British Columbia 200 to 300 mm
of rain fell in 60 hours, causing floods and
landslides (in some cases exacerbated by
runoff from fire-affected areas). Transport
was severely disrupted, with most major
routes connecting Vancouver with the rest
of Canada closed for several weeks, and
several communities were partly or wholly
inundated. Six deaths were reported, and
economic losses exceeded Can$ 2 billion.
Flooding also affected adjacent areas of the
north-western United States. Seattle and
Vancouver both had their wettest autumns
on record.

DROUGHT
Significant drought affected much of subtropical South America for the second successive year. Rainfall was well below average
over much of central and southern Brazil, 86
Paraguay, Uruguay and northern Argentina.
The drought led to significant agricultural
losses, exacerbated by a cold outbreak at the
end of July, in which maximum temperatures
were below 10 °C for five consecutive days
over higher parts of southern Brazil and which
contributed to damage in many of Brazil’s
coffee-growing regions. Low river levels
also reduced hydroelectricity production 87
and disrupted river transport. The Brazilian
government declared a situation of critical
scarcity of water resources in the Paraná

hydrographic region, with numerous water
stores at or near their lowest levels in the
last 20 years.88 The 24-month Standardized
Precipitation Index (SPI) over the region
reached its lowest level since the 1960s. The
Paraguay River at Asuncion fell to a record
low 0.75 m below the reference level on
6 October, 0.21 m below the previous record
set in 2020. In Chile, where long-term drought
has persisted for the last decade, 2021 was
another dry year, with most locations having
rainfall at least 30% below average. A number
of locations south of Santiago had their driest
year on record in 2021 with totals 40% to
50% below normal, including Concepción
(559.2 mm), Valdivia (949.0 mm) and Puerto
Montt (921.7 mm).
Widespread drought in Western Nor th
America, which had become established
during 2020, spread and intensified in 2021.
By September, extreme to exceptional drought
covered most of the United States over and
west of the Rocky Mountains, despite some
slight easing from July onwards in parts of the
inland south-west, due to an active summer
monsoon. Extreme to exceptional drought
also extended eastwards on both sides of the
United States–Canada border, affecting northern border states as far east as Minnesota and
the Prairie Provinces of Canada. The 20 months
from January 2020 to August 2021 were the
driest on record for the south-western United
States, 89 with precipitation more than 10%
below the previous record. Forecast wheat
and canola crop production for Canada in 2021
was 35% to 40% below 2020 levels,90 while in
the United States, the level of Lake Mead on
the Colorado River fell in July to 47 m below
full supply level, the lowest level on record
since the reservoir was fully commissioned.
The drought situation in California was eased
by heavy rain in late October and December –
Sacramento had its wettest day on record with
138 mm on 24 October, only days after ending
a record 211-day period with no measurable

precipitation – but drought continued away
from the west coast and extended farther
east through the south-central United States
as the year ended.
Significant drought af fec ted large areas of South - wes t A sia during 2021.
Well-below-average precipitation fell during
the 2020/2021 cool season in regions including most of the Islamic Republic of Iran,
Afghanistan, Pakistan, south-east Turkey, and
Turkmenistan. Pakistan had its third-driest
February and fifth-driest January–March
on record. Mountain snowpack was also
well below average, with snow cover extent
in Islamic Republic of Iran about half the
long-term average for most of January and
February, leading to reduced streamflow in
rivers depending on snowmelt, and reduced
water availability for irrigation.
Drought developed during the course of the
year in the Greater Horn of Africa region, particularly affecting Somalia, Kenya and parts of
Ethiopia, after three successive below-average
rainy seasons. The October–December rainy
season was especially poor, despite some
rains in Kenya late in the season.
A severe drought, which has persisted for at
least two years, continues to affect southern
Madagascar. 91 Rainfall for the 12 months
from July 2020 to June 2021 was around 50%
below normal over the region. There were
significant food security issues in the area,
with 1.14 million people classified by the
World Food Programme as needing urgent
assistance as of August 2021.92

had a very active season, with 21 named
storms, well above the 1981–2010 average
of 14. It was also an active season in the North
Indian Ocean, but activity in the western North
Pacific and eastern North Pacific was near to
or below average. The 2020/2021 southern
hemisphere season was also slightly below
average in both the Pacific and Indian Oceans.
The most significant hurricane of the North
Atlantic season was Ida. Ida made landfall as a
category 4 system in Louisiana (United States)
on 29 August with sustained one-minute
winds of 240 km per hour, equalling the
strongest landfall on record for the state,
with major wind damage and storm surge
inundation. The system then continued on
a north-east track over land with significant
flooding, especially in the New York City area.
New York, which had already experienced
flooding from Hurricane Henri two weeks
earlier, had a record hourly rainfall of 80 mm,
with 24-hour totals exceeding 200 mm in
parts of the city. Before it developed into a
tropical cyclone, Ida’s precursor system also
caused significant flooding in Venezuela. In
total, 72 deaths were directly attributed to Ida
and 43 deaths were indirectly attributed to it
in the United States and Venezuela, with economic losses in the United States estimated
at US$ 75 billion.93 Another significant landfall during the season was Grace, which hit
Veracruz (Mexico) as a category 3 hurricane,
having earlier resulted in impacts, mostly
from flooding, in Haiti (where it hindered
post-earthquake recovery), the Dominican
Republic, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago.
In the southern hemisphere, 2021’s most
significant cyclone 94 was Seroja in April.
Seroja formed south of Indonesia and tracked
south-east towards Western Australia. It
made landfall near Kalbarri on 11 April as an
(Australian) category 3 cyclone, the strongest
landfall so far south in Western Australia
since 1956. Seroja’s most severe impacts were

30

from flooding and associated landslides from
its precursor system in Timor-Leste, and the
Indonesian region of East Nusa Tenggara.
Kupang (Timor) received 700.4 mm of rainfall
in the four days from 2 to 5 April. A total of
226 deaths were associated with Seroja,
181 in Indonesia, 44 in Timor-Leste and one in
Australia.95 In January, Eloise contributed to
flooding in Southern Africa, with damage and
casualties reported in Mozambique, South
Africa, Zimbabwe, Eswatini and Madagascar,
while in the South Pacific, Ana and Niran
caused flooding and power outages in Fiji
and New Caledonia, respectively.
The most severe cyclone of the North Indian
Ocean season was Tauktae, which tracked
north off the west coast of India, with a peak
three-minute sustained wind speed 96 of
50–53 m per second, before making landfall
in Gujarat on 17 May at slightly below peak
intensity, equalling the strongest known
landfall in Gujarat. At least 144 deaths were
reported in India and 4 in Pakistan.97 Later in
the season, Cyclone Gulab crossed the eastern
coast of India from the Bay of Bengal in late
September; the remnant system crossed India
before emerging and re-intensifying in the
Arabian Sea, where it was renamed Shaheen.
Shaheen made landfall on 3 October on the
northern coast of Oman north-west of Muscat,
the first cyclone since 1890 to make landfall
in this area. Al Suwaiq recorded 294 mm rain
in 24 hours, about three times the region’s
annual average. A total of 39 deaths were
reported across India, Pakistan, Oman and the
Islamic Republic of Iran, mostly from flooding.
The most significant tropical cyclone of the
season in the western North Pacific was
Typhoon Rai (Odette), which crossed the
central Philippines on 16 December, making
landfall at near peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of 915 hPa, after rapidly
intensifying prior to landfall. It reintensified
on 18 December after entering the South

damage occurred across the Philippines, with
at least 406 deaths reported, while flooding
also occurred in Viet Nam. There were several
other significant landfalls, most notably from
Typhoon Chanthu on the Batanes Islands (the
Philippines). Chanthu and Typhoon In-fa, in
July, also both contributed to flooding and
disruptions to shipping around Shanghai,
while Dianmu contributed to flooding in
Thailand in September after making landfall
in Viet Nam.

SEVERE STORMS
There were multiple severe thunderstorm
outbreaks in Western and Central Europe
in the second half of June and in July.
An F4 tornado 98 struck several villages in
southern Moravia on 24 June, with major
damage and six deaths reported. This was
the strongest tornado on record in the Czech
Republic. Tornadoes were also reported
during the month in Belgium, France and
Poland. Large hail (6–8 cm in diameter) was
reported in multiple countries, including the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland and
Germany. In the Czech Republic alone, losses
were around US$ 700 million.
In the United States, 1 376 tornadoes were
provisionally reported during 2021, above the
1991–2010 average. A significant outbreak hit
the south-east on 25 March, with the most severe impacts in Alabama and western Georgia.

Six deaths and US$ 1.8 billion in economic
losses were reported. During December 2021,
there were 193 confirmed tornado reports,
around eight times the 1991–2010 December
average of 24. This was double the previous
record of 97 from 2002. On 10 December
there was an historic outbreak across several
south-eastern and central states in which
93 people died and economic losses of
US$ 3.9 billion were reported. This was the
deadliest December tornado outbreak in the
United States, surpassing the Vicksburg,
Mississippi tornado of 5 December 1953,
which led to 38 deaths. Hailstorms in Texas
and Oklahoma on 27–28 April resulted in
US$ 3.3 billion in losses.

ATTRIBUTION
Attribution of individual extreme events
can often take several months because of
the need to complete peer review. But it
is becoming increasingly possible to carry
out near-real-time attribution assessments
that use peer-reviewed methods to reach
conclusions within just a few days of a
weather record being broken. Such “rapid
attribution” studies have been carried out
for the heatwave in Western North America
in June and July,99,100,101 the floods in Western
Europe in July102 and the British Columbia
floods in November.103 Studies of the Western
North America heatwave found that while
such a heatwave is rare in today’s climate, it
would have been virtually impossible without
climate change.

98

On both the Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita scale, a tornado that causes devastating damage is classified as
category 4 tornado (F4 and EF4 respectively). The scales differ in the wind speeds thought to be associated with
“devastating damage”, with lower wind speeds assumed in the enhanced system for the same level of damage.

For the Western Europe flooding, the rapid
attribution study found that the detection of
trends in extreme precipitation at the scale of
the event in question was challenging, and that
saturated soils and the local hydrology were
also factors in the event. However, significant
trends in extreme precipitation were found
across a wider area of Western Europe, and the
study concluded that over this broader region,
human-induced climate change had increased
the likelihood of an extreme precipitation event
comparable to that which occurred.

104

32

More generally, events such as these fit
into a broader pattern of change. The IPCC
assessed104 that hot extremes in the regions
of Western North America and North-western
North America have increased, and that there
is at least medium confidence in a human
contribution to this increase. Similarly, the
IPCC assessed that heavy precipitation has
increased in the region of Western and Central
Europe affected by flooding, but that there
is currently low confidence in the attribution
of this change to human influence.

Risks and impacts
The risk of climate-related impacts depends on complex interactions between
climate-related hazards and the vulnerability,
exposure and adaptive capacity of human
and natural systems. Climate-related events
pose humanitarian risks to society through
impacts on health, food and water security
as well as human security, human mobility,
livelihoods, economies, infrastructure and
biodiversity. Climate and extreme weather
events also affect the use and distribution
of natural resources across regions and
within countries, and have large negative
impacts on the environment. These negative
environmental effects include impacts on the
land such as droughts, wildfires in forest and
peatland areas, land degradation, sand and
dust storms, desertification, flooding and
coastal erosion. At current levels of global
greenhouse gas emissions, the world remains
on course to exceed the agreed temperature
thresholds of either 1.5 °C or 2 °C above
pre-industrial levels, which would increase
the risks of pervasive climate change impacts
beyond what is already being seen.

FOOD SECURITY
GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY OUTLOOK
IN 2021
The compounded effects of conflict, extreme
weather events and economic shocks, further
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic,
have led to a rise in hunger, undermining
decades of progress towards improving food
security (Figure 22). Worsening humanitarian
crises in 2021 have also caused the number of
countries at risk of famine to grow. Of the total
number of undernourished people in 2020,
more than half live in Asia (418 million) and a
third in Africa (282 million). Following a peak
in undernourishment in 2020 (768 million
people), projections indicated a decline in
global hunger to around 710 million in 2021
(9% of the world population).105 However,
as of October 2021, the numbers in many
countries were already higher than in 2020.
This striking increase was mostly felt among
groups already suffering from food crises

or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above106); the
number of people in these groups rose
from 135 million in 2020 to 161 million by
September 2021, a 19% increase.107 Another
consequence of these shocks was growth in
the number of people facing starvation and a
total collapse of livelihoods (IPC/CH Phase 5);
a total of 584 000 people were in this group,
mostly in Ethiopia, South Sudan, Yemen and
Madagascar. The first quarter of 2021 also
saw the highest global consumer food prices
in the last six years, concentrated in Latin
America and the Caribbean.108 In West Africa,
prices of coarse grains increased, driving
food prices to record and near-record highs
in several countries. The price increases were
exacerbated by civil insecurity and torrential
rains. In North Africa, food inflation rates
remained at modest levels in 2021, buffered
by subsidies on many basic commodities
that prevented price increases.

IMPACTS OF HYDRO-METEOROLOGICAL
HAZARDS ON FOOD PRODUCTION
The 2020/2021 La Niña altered rainfall seasons, disrupting livelihoods and agricultural
campaigns across the world. Associated
extreme weather, water and climate events
during the 2021 rainfall season compounded shocks from the previous year or years,
making it increasingly difficult to quantify impacts resulting from a single event.
Consecutive droughts across large parts of
Africa, Asia and Latin America associated in
places with the double-dip La Niña, as well

34

as regional impacts from severe storms,
cyclones and hurricanes, have significantly
affected livelihoods and the ability to recover
from recurrent weather shocks.
Dry conditions across wide areas of South
America could further threaten crop yields
within this region. However, larger plantings
have largely compensated for crop productivity losses throughout the continent (−3.6% in
2021 compared to 2020).109 In the Caribbean,
Haiti has been triply hit – by earthquakes,
irregular rains and political instability –
contributing to agricultural damage and
significantly worsening food insecurity.
In West Africa, floods and dry spells have led
to crop damage and losses in localized areas
resulting in small production downturns
in 2021, but the forecasted aggregate outputs
for the whole continent of Africa remained
above average (+2.9% in 2021 over 2020).110
The 2021 first season harvest in central and
southern areas of East Africa was negatively
affected by prolonged droughts, mostly in
Kenya where maize outputs were officially
estimated to be 42%–70% below average.111
In northern parts of East Africa, the scale of
seasonal flooding and its impact on crops
was lower than in 2020. In Southern Africa,
the second consecutive below-average
rainfall season in Madagascar has led to
a severe reduction in staple food production and a decline in livestock herd size. In
addition, weather-related hazards, pests
and diseases were expected to result in
sharp harvest declines, with yield estimates

50%–70% below the five-year average.112 In
Mozambique, Cyclone Eloise made landfall in
late January during the region’s lean season,
when vulnerabilities are at their highest,
affecting communities still recovering from
Cyclone Idai barely two years ago. According
to the Government of Mozambique, more
than 441 000 people were affected by the
cyclone, which displaced nearly 44 000
and destroyed more than 45 000 hectares
of cropland.113
Drought conditions in South-west Asia and
the Middle East reduced cereal production
to below-average levels, exacerbating the
impacts on agriculture and food security in
fragile contexts, mostly in Afghanistan and
the Syrian Arab Republic. While cereal production decreased in the Middle East, wheat
production in Eastern Asia reached a record
high in 2021, with paddy rice outputs at high
levels due to suitable weather conditions. In
contrast, central China was hit by torrential
rains in mid-July 2021, leading to significant
loss of life and damage to property. This
sparked concerns over the nation’s food
supplies, as 1 million hectares of cropland –
mostly corn, soybeans and peanuts – were
affected, a third of which was wiped out by
heavy rains.

HUMANITARIAN IMPACTS AND
POPULATION DISPLACEMENT
Refugees, internally displaced people and
stateless people are often among those most
vulnerable to climate and weather-related
hazards. Many vulnerable individuals who
are displaced end up settling in high-risk
areas, where they are exposed to climate
and weather hazards at a range of scales.
Hydrometeorological hazards and human
mobility may also intersect with social and
political tensions and conflict in complex
settings and, therefore, require the integrated

consideration of multi-hazard disaster risk
reduction measures, including early warning
systems and preparedness, and longer-term
sustainable development concerns, such as
land use and urban planning.

CLIMATE-RELATED HAZARDS WERE A
MAJOR DRIVER OF NEW DISPLACEMENT
Extreme weather, water and climate events
and conditions had major and diverse impacts on population displacement and on
the vulnerability of people already displaced
throughout the year. From Afghanistan to
Central America, droughts, flooding and other
extreme events hit those least equipped to
recover and adapt.114 As in previous years,
many of the largest-scale displacements
in 2021 occurred in populous Asian countries.
Most disaster displacements in 2021 resulted
from tropical storms and floods in East Asia
and the Pacific, South Asia, the Americas and
Sub-Saharan Africa.
Over the course of 2021, hazardous hydrometeorological events and environmental
degradation fur ther contributed to the
displacement of millions more people in
exposed and vulnerable situations. This
includes the impact of rapid-onset events
such as floods, storms and wildfires, as well
as slow-onset processes such as drought and
desertification. This affects people’s safety
and ability to meet their basic needs for
survival such as food, water, resilient housing
and productive land. Over the first half of the
year in Afghanistan, for example, disasters
resulted in some 22 500 new displacements,
primarily linked to floods.115 In June, the
Government declared a national drought,
with 80% of the country classified as being
in either severe or serious drought status,
on top of escalating conflict, food insecurity,
and health and socioeconomic impacts of
COVID-19, with humanitarian, development
and government actors foreseeing that

agricultural families would very likely become
displaced.116 People forced to leave their
homes had to sell their assets and engage
in dangerous work to survive, while some
children were sent to work in other areas or in
neighbouring countries or were married off as
a way to reduce financial burdens.117 Displaced
people in the Syrian Arab Republic, a country
decimated by over a decade of conflict, also
faced flooding due to heavy rainfall, with
close to 142 000 internally displaced people
affected in mid-January 2021.118 In India, more
than 100 000 people were displaced between
November and December 2021.119
In line with established trends, 2021 saw the
overwhelming majority of new displacements
related to hazardous weather events take place
within national borders. Most of these internal
displacements were triggered by tropical
cyclones, floods, earthquakes and volcanic
eruptions, especially in the East Asia and
Pacific region. The countries with the largest
numbers of displacements recorded as of
October 2021 were China (more than 1.4 million
displacements recorded in July), Viet Nam
(more than 664 000 recorded in September),
and the Philippines (more than 214 000 in July
and more than 386 000 in October).120
In East Africa, floods and droughts resulted
in large-scale displacement, especially in
Somalia and Ethiopia. Many of the people
affected were already living in overcrowded
and insecure camps for internally displaced
people to which many newly flood-displaced
people also moved. Farmers whose crops
were devastated by desert locusts were
also forced to move in search of survival
assistance.121 In Sudan, Alganaa refugee camp

36

was submerged by flood waters in November
2021, leaving 35 000 South Sudanese refugees
in need of urgent assistance.122
High-income countries were also affected.
In the western parts of the United States
and Canada exceptional heatwaves, drought
and wildfires displaced thousands from their
homes. Wildfires also compounded risks related to other hazards, further increasing the risk
of displacement. For instance, 15 000 people
were displaced in California in January 2021,
following mandatory pre-emptive evacuation
orders following heavy rains.123

PROTRACTED, PROLONGED AND
REPEATED DISPLACEMENT FUELLED BY
HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL HAZARDS
Many displacement situations triggered by
hydrometeorological events have become
prolonged or protracted for people unable to
return to their former homes or without options
for integrating locally or settling elsewhere. At
the beginning of 2021, at least 7 million people
were living in internal displacement following
disasters124 related to natural hazard events
in previous years, according to the Internal
Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC). The
largest numbers of people in this situation
were in Afghanistan, India and Pakistan,
followed by Ethiopia, Sudan, Bangladesh,
Niger and Yemen.125
Due to continuing or growing risk in their
areas of origin (and return) or settlement,
people who have been displaced by hydrometeorological events may also be subject to
repeated and frequent displacement, leaving

little time for recovery between one shock
and the next. In Indonesia, for example,
557 000 new disaster displacements were
recorded in the first half of the year, mostly
triggered by major rainy season floods.
Human activities, including deforestation, urbanization and land degradation have reduced
the capacity of some regions of Indonesia
to absorb heavy rainfall. Between October
and November 2021, well before the peak of
the rainy season, heavy rainfall and flooding
further displaced more than 50 000, double
the figure for 2020.126 Such situations highlight
the importance of disaster preparedness and
risk management, but also the importance of
supporting solutions to displacement that are
sustainable and supporting the resilience of
people who might otherwise see their living
conditions progressively eroded through
repeated disasters and displacement.

HAZARDOUS EVENTS AND CHANGING
CLIMATIC CONDITIONS ALSO ADDED
TO THE MULTIPLE RISKS FACED IN
CONFLICT-AFFECTED COUNTRIES BY
INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE AND
REFUGEES
In Yemen, people’s vulnerabilities were
further exacerbated by hazard events, such
as floods and droughts, that have led to the
destruction of shelters and infrastructure,
restricted access to markets and basic services, wrecked livelihoods, facilitated the
spread of deadly diseases and contributed
to fatalities. In mid-April, heavy rain and
flooding hit several parts of the country,
affecting 7 000 people, 75% of whom were internally displaced people living in precarious
conditions.127 This contributed to population
displacement in what was already the world’s

fourth biggest internal displacement crisis,
with over 4 million internally displaced people. The annual rainy season brings heavy
rainfall, high winds and flooding, particularly
to coastal areas, with thousands of families
affected by flash floods in 2021. Flooding
also blocks roads, impeding the delivery of
life-saving assistance.128
In Mozambique, multiple tropical storms and
floods, on top of recurrent disease outbreaks
and conflict, significantly increased the vulnerability of affected people,129 including
thousands of families still displaced since
Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in 2019. In January,
strong winds and floods from Tropical Storm
Chalane and then Cyclone Eloise damaged
or destroyed the shelters of over 8 700 of
these internally displaced families as well as
schools and hospitals.130 These events also
resulted in new displacement, with Cyclone
Eloise displacing more than 43 300 people.131
Tens of thousands of people remain displaced
and held back from recovery.132 The impacts
of compounding disasters, recurrent disease
outbreaks and conflicts have significantly
increased the vulnerability of people in the
region. This situation, and similar ones in
other regions, could be ameliorated through
greater effort to reduce climate-related vulnerability and risks in fragile and conflict-affected
contexts and to strengthen community-based
preparedness.133
Nigeria also experienced drought and floods,
which affected agricultural activities, resulting
in loss of shelter and increased vulnerability
of people already displaced by conflict in
the north-east. The situation further deteriorated in the first half of 2021, with around
294 000 new displacements reported between
January and June 2021.134

In Bangladesh, monsoon rains led to massive
flooding and the displacement of millions
of people following Cyclone Yaas in May
and June 2021. Flooding in July 2021 in
the Rohingya refugee sites in Cox’s Bazar
damaged over 6 000 shelters and more than
25 000 refugees were forced to seek shelter in
communal facilities or with other families.135
Floods also heavily affected people living in
China, Nepal and the Philippines, where thousands of people were displaced by Typhoon
In-fa in July 2021. Without preparedness
measures undertaken in the camp areas,
including the strengthening of shelters, the
building of retaining structures on hillsides
and improved drainage, roads and bridges,
these impacts would have been far worse.

CLIMATE IMPACTS ON ECOSYSTEMS
Ecosystems – including terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems – and
the services they provide, are affected by
the changing climate, and some are more
vulnerable than others.136 In addition, some
ecosystems are degrading at an unprecedented rate, limiting their ability to support
human well-being and harming their adaptive
capacity to build resilience.137
For example, mountain ecosystems – the
water towers of the world – are vulnerable and
can be profoundly affected by climate change
due to their low capacity to adapt. This may

38

affect the 1.9 billion people living in mountain
areas or directly downstream from them.138
Climate change may exacerbate water stress,
especially in areas of decreased precipitation
and where groundwater is already depleted,
affecting agricultural production, arable land,
and the more than 2 billion people who already experience water stress.139
Climate change is also affecting climate­
sensitive species. There is evidence that
temperature-sensitive plants are flowering
and starting to produce leaves earlier in
spring and dropping their leaves later in
autumn.140 Also, there has been a clear shift
in the timing of marine and freshwater fish
spawning events and animal migrations
worldwide. Substantial changes in species’
abundance and distribution may in turn affect the interactions between species.141,142
Risks to ecosystems and individual species
from pests, pathogens and diseases are
changing. Climate change also exacerbates
other threats to biodiversity. The number of
species projected to become extinct increases
dramatically as global temperature rises – and
is 30% higher at 2 °C warming than at 1.5 °C
warming.143
Meanwhile, large-scale changes have been
observed in marine ecosystems, including
declining ocean productivity, migration of
species to higher latitudes and altitudes,
and damage to coral reefs and mangroves.
Warming towards 1.5 °C will increase water temperatures and change the ocean’s

chemistry (for example, acidification), resulting in new ecosystems. Species that are less
able to relocate are projected to experience
high rates of mortality and decline.144 Climate
change is also affecting the Greenland and
Antarctic ice sheets and increasing the chances of the Arctic Ocean being ice-free in the
summer, further disrupting ocean circulation
and Arctic ecosystems.145
Rising temperatures heighten the risk of
irreversible loss of marine and coastal

ecosystems, including seagrass meadows
and kelp forest. Coral reefs are especially
vulnerable to climate change. They are
projected to lose between 70% and 90%
of their former coverage area at 1.5 °C of
warming and over 99% at 2 °C. Between
20% and 90% of current coastal wetlands
are at risk of being lost by the end of this
century, depending on how fast sea levels
rise. This will further compromise food
provision, tourism and coastal protection, among other ecosystem services.146

Northern hemisphere summer extremes:
the role of the quasi-stationary planetary
waves and the Arctic warming amplification
José Álvaro Silva (WMO)

54.4 °C for the second year in a row (the
world’s highest recorded temperature in at
least the last 90 years).

2021 NORTHERN HEMISPHERE
EXTREMES: BRIEF DESCRIPTION

On 14 and 15 July, exceptional severe floods
occurred in some countries in the Western
part of Europe. Parts of western Germany and
eastern Belgium were the most affected by the
long-lasting heavy precipitation. Just a few
days later, in the Chinese province of Henan,
more rain fell on Zhengzhou between 17 and
21 July than falls there in an average year,
and a one-hour rainfall total of 201.9 mm, on
20 July, was a new record for China.

In 2021, during the boreal summer, several
extreme weather and climate events occurred in the mid-latitude regions of the
northern hemisphere (NH). Record hot days
and heatwaves, severe droughts, powerful
and destructive wildfires, and heavy rain
events led to vast damage and high death
tolls, as is described in depth in the section
on High-impact events in 2021.
Hot summer conditions started early, and
several NH regions experienced extreme
heat in June, including North Africa, Eastern
Europe and the Middle East. The high temperatures were particularly exceptional in
the north-western United States and western
Canada in late June (Figure 23). Lytton, in
British Columbia, recorded 49.6 °C on 29 June,
which was a new record for Canada. On 9 July,
during one of the multiple heatwaves that
affected the south-western United States
during the summer, the Furnace Creek weather station (Death Valley, California), reached

POTENTIAL CAUSES AND
MECHANISMS OF NORTHERN
HEMISPHERE SUMMER EXTREMES
Following the trend that has emerged in
recent decades, NH summer 2021 saw numerous weather and climate extremes. But
what might be the causes for the increase
in number and the intensification of the NH
summer extremes?
The frequency of certain types of weather
and climate extremes is increasing due to
climate change,1 and some attribution studies2,3,4,5,6,7,8 have shown that it has made many
single recent events more intense. Some of
these studies suggest that a wide diversity
of spatio-temporal scales and atmospheric
processes are involved in the evolution of
extreme events, but it is usually the anomalous large-scale circulation patterns that
set the background for their occurrence, and
quasi-resonant circulation regimes play an
important role here.

studies mentioned in the report identify a variety
of processes and positive feedbacks contributing to these phenomena.25 The first is related to
sea-ice loss (Figure 25), which causes a change
of surface albedo (reflective ice is replaced
by the darker ocean), leading to more heat
absorption from solar radiation. This is known
as the sea-ice albedo feedback. Other important
atmospheric processes inducing AA are the
temperature (both Planck and lapse rate) and the
cloud and water vapour feedbacks.26 Increases
in the atmospheric and oceanic equator-to-pole
transport of heat and moisture have also been
identified as drivers of AA.
In summary, research focusing on summer
circulation and climate change needs to be
further developed to fill important knowledge
gaps, but there is evidence to support the idea
that changes in mid-latitude summer circulation – amplified and more stationary planetary
waves, a weaker and wavier jet stream – associated with Arctic warming, may be linked to
increased blocking situations thus favouring
the occurrence of extreme events in the NH.

Over the past 50 years, temperatures in the
Arctic have increased at more than twice the
global rate,19 a prominent feature of climate
change known as Arctic amplification (AA). 20
The A A influences mid-latitude summer
circulation by weakening the storm tracks,
shifting the position of the jet stream and
amplifying the quasi-stationary waves. While
some uncertainties related to how these
dynamical changes affect regional weather
conditions remain, 21 it is generally accepted
that in recent decades the occurrence of conditions favourable for QRA 22,23 promoted the
occurrence of persistent extreme weather
events that might be linked to the amplified
Arctic warming, and thus that climate change
influence is carried through amplified arctic
warming. 24 Nevertheless, it is argued that the
observations and climate-model simulations
do not support a clear cause–effect relation,

ARCTIC WARMING AMPLIFICATION

2021-06-29

90ºW

There is growing evidence that physical
mechanisms involving atmospheric dynamics, in particular planetary wave dynamics,
can explain the characteristics associated
with persistent disturbances in the polar
jet stream and NH summer extremes. 9,10,11
The Rossby waves12 (Figure 24), particularly
the quasi-resonant amplification (QRA)13 of
these mid-latitude high-amplitude waves
(zonal wavenumber 6–8), is an important
mechanism driving the conditions associated
with extremes.14,15,16 The jet stream plays
a major role in shaping weather patterns,
and when it becomes weaker and wavier, in
association with these slow-moving waves,
the air motion from west to east is slowed,
leading to blocking situations in which
weather systems remain near-stationary
over a prolonged period which can last
several weeks.17,18

Observational basis for climate monitoring
Climate monitoring is performed by a system
of observing systems covering the atmosphere, the ocean, hydrology, the cryosphere
and the biosphere. Each of these areas is
monitored in different ways by a range of
organizations. Cutting across all these areas,
satellite observations provide major contributions to global climate monitoring.
In 1992, the Global Climate Obser ving
System (GCOS) was established by WMO,
the Intergovernmental Oceanographic
Commission (IOC) of the United Nations
Ed u c a t i o n a l, S c i e n t i f i c a n d C ul t ur a l
Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP) and the
International Science Council (ISC) to coordinate and facilitate the development and
improvement of global climate observations.
GCOS has identified a set of Essential Climate
Variables (ECVs) that together provide the
information necessary to understand, model
and predict the trajectory of the climate as well
as plan mitigation and adaptation strategies
(Figure 26). The status of the observational
basis for these ECVs is published in regular

status reports. GCOS also identifies what is
needed to improve the system in implementation reports.
In addition to observations provided by the
GCOS-coordinated Global Surface Network
(GSN) and Global Upper-Air Network (GUAN),
National Meteorological and Hydrological
Services (NMHSs) of WMO Members provide a more comprehensive and widespread
network of observation, acquired primarily
for operational weather prediction. WMO’s
Global Basic Observing Network (GBON), a
globally designed network with prescribed
capabilities and observing schedules and
for which international data exchange is
mandatory, will provide critically needed
observations for numerical weather prediction and will help substantially strengthen
climate monitoring.
In order to provide the necessary financial and
technical assistance for the implementation
and operation of GBON in the poorest and
most poorly observed areas of the globe,

Hydromet Development a are establishing
a Sys tematic Obser vations Financing
Facility (SOFF).
Complementing the observations of the physical and dynamic properties of the atmosphere,
WMO’s Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW)
coordinates atmospheric composition measurements, ensuring that reliable and accurate
data are obtained from measurements made
by WMO Members, research institutions and/
or agencies and other contributing networks.
Ocean observations of ocean physics, biogeochemistry, biology and ecosystems are coordinated through the Global Ocean Observing
System (GOOS). The GOOS Observations
Coordination Group (OCG) monitors the performance of these observationsb and produces
an annual Ocean Observing System Report
Card. Ocean observations are generally made
widely available to international users.
In the terrestrial domain, there is a wider group
of observing networks. Hydrological observations are generally operated by NMHSs

and coordinated through WMO. A number
of specialized Global Terrestrial Networks
(GTNs), for example, on hydrology, permafrost, glaciers, land use, and biomass, also
report to GCOS. Data exchange agreements
are generally less developed for the terrestrial
networks, and many important observations
are not made available to international users.
The Commit tee on Ear th Obser vation
Satellites/Coordination Group for Meteorolo­
gical Satellites (CEOS/CGMS) Joint Working
Group on Climate (WGClimate) bases the
development of satellite observations for
climate on the ECV requirements established
by GCOS. It has produced an ECV Inventory
that includes records for 766 climate data
records for 33 ECVs covering 72 separate
ECV products, with more planned. Satellite
observations have some advantages – they
have near-global coverage – but optical
observations can be interrupted by clouds.
Used with ground-based observations, either
as complementary data sets, or for validation
and calibration, they form an invaluable part
of the global observing system.

Can sub-seasonal-to-seasonal

South-east Asia (SEA) is in a prime location
to benefit from sub-seasonal-to-seasonal
(S2S) climate services, as a region with some
of the highest skill at the S2S timescale. The
Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) Specialised Meteorological Centre
(ASMC) and partners (UN ESCAP,a RIMES,b
the AHA Centrec) are working to develop S2S
products in SEA for disaster risk reduction
under the S2S SEA Pilot Project, which is part
of the S2S Prediction Project real-time pilot initiative undertaken by WMO, the World Weather
Research Programme (WWRP) and the World
Climate Research Programme (WCRP). The
project aims to explore the usefulness of S2S
predictions for disaster risk reduction.
Between 20 and 26 September 2021, more than
50 000 peopled were affected by floods in the
Philippines, and Sulawesi and eastern Borneo
in Indonesia. During the same week, Tropical
Cyclone Dianmu contributed to severe floods
in parts of Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand,
affecting more than 180 000 people.e Based
on the S2S SEA Pilot Project’s predictions,
a small increased chance of extreme rainfall

46

was forecasted for south-eastern Indonesia
three weeks before the case study week. This
evolved by the week before to a moderate
increase in chance for Sulawesi, Maluku
Islands and West Papua and expanded
to small increase in chance over parts of
Thailand, Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
Viet Nam, and southern Philippines, southern
Sumatra, eastern Borneo and Java. This
outlook was reported in the AHA Centre’s
weekly report f to national disaster management organizations and others, supporting the
preparations for Dianmu g and other hazards
along with subsequent weather forecasts,
an example in the region of steps towards a
seamless prediction approach.
These results are typical of the findings of the
pilot project so far, where increased chance
of extreme rainfall for the Maritime Continent
is a good indicator three weeks beforehand
that one or more hazardous events may occur
in the general area. The indicator works less
well for mainland South-east Asia though,
where the outlooks often only predict an
increased chance one week before. Increased
probabilities of hazardous events signal an
increased probability of disaster as well.
While there may not always be an indication of impending hazardous events at the
sub-seasonal timescale, the relatively small
number of false alarms means that action can
be taken at the sub-seasonal timescale, such
as targeted monitoring of the development
of the events and activating institutional
processes earlier so that preparedness and
response are more efficient.

GLOBAL TEMPERATURE DATA
GLOBAL MEAN TEMPERATURE TIME SERIES
The method for calculating global mean temperature anomalies relative to an 1850–1900
baseline has been updated since the State of the Global Climate 2020 report. The method was
updated to take advantage of the assessment made by Working Group I, in its contribution
to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, of long-term change and its uncertainty. The new
method also makes use of a wider range of shorter data sets that are routinely updated to
provide an authoritative assessment of recent temperature changes.
In the 2020 report (and earlier reports), changes relative to the 1850–1900 baseline were
based on the HadCRUT4 data set which was the only data set that extended back to 1850.
Other data sets were offset to match the average of HadCRUT4 over the period 1880–1900
(NASA GISTEMP and NOAA GlobalTemp) or 1981–2010 (ERA5, JRA-55).
In 2021, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report Working Group I assessed change from
1850–1900 to other periods based on an average of four data sets – HadCRUT5, Berkeley
Earth, NOAA–Interim and Kadow et al. (2020) – which all extend back to 1850. They assessed
uncertainty by considering the range from the four estimates, taken from the lower bound
of the uncertainty range of the coolest data set to the upper bound of the uncertainty range
of the warmest. By making use of four data sets that extend back to 1850, Working Group I
was able to make a more comprehensive estimate of uncertainty.
As two of the four IPCC data sets are not regularly updated, in the present report the
estimate made by the IPCC for the temperature change between 1850–1900 and 1981–2010
is combined with estimated changes between 1981–2010 and the current year from six data
sets to calculate anomalies for 2021 relative to 1850–1900.
There is good, though not perfect, agreement between the six data sets on changes from
1981–2010 to the present, as this is a period with good observational coverage. The additional
modest uncertainty from the spread of the six data sets is combined with that of the IPCC’s
estimate of the uncertainty in the change from 1850–1900 to 1981–2010.

47

More precisely, six data sets (cited below) were used in the calculation of global temperature.
Global mean temperature anomalies were calculated relative to an 1850–1900 baseline
using the following steps:
1. The starting point was a time series of global annual mean temperatures for each data
set, as provided by the data providers. The anomalies were presented on different
baselines.
2. For each data set, anomalies were calculated relative to the 1981–2010 average by
subtracting the average for the period 1981–2010.
3. The amount 0.69 °C was added to each series, based on the estimated difference
between 1850–1900 and 1981–2010, calculated using the method from the IPCC
Sixth Assessment Report Working Group I (the number is provided in the caption
for Figure 1.12 in that report).
4. The mean and standard deviation of the six estimates were calculated.
5. The uncertainty in the IPCC estimate was combined with the standard deviation,
assuming the two are independent and assuming the IPCC uncertainty range (0.54 °C
to 0.79 °C) is representative of a 90% confidence range (1.645 standard deviations).
The number quoted in this report for 2021 (1.11 ± 0.13 °C) was calculated in this way with
1.11 °C being the mean of the six estimates.

Annual temperature maps
The method for calculating the map of annual temperature anomalies has also been
updated. In the 2020 report, a map showing anomalies relative to 1981–2010 from a single
data set (ERA5) was used. While the map was based on a single data set, the accompanying
assessment was based on all available data sets.
For the map of temperature anomalies for 2021, a median value of five of the data sets
was used – HadCRUT5, ERA5, NOAAGlobalTemp, Berkeley Earth and GISTEMP – regridded
to the spatial grid of the lowest resolution data sets (NOAAGlobalTemp and HadCRUT5
data sets), which are presented on a 5° latitude by 5° longitude grid. The median is used
in preference to the mean to minimize the effect of potential outliers. The half-range of
the data sets provides an indication of the uncertainty. The spread between the data sets
is largest at high latitudes and in Central Africa, both regions with sparse data coverage.

SEA LEVEL DATA
GMSL from CNES/Aviso+ https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/ocean-indicators-products/mean-sea-level/data-acces.html#c12195

MARINE HEATWAVE AND MARINE COLD SPELL DATA
Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are categorized as moderate when the sea-surface temperature
(SST) is above the 90th percentile of the climatological distribution for five days or longer;
the subsequent categories are defined with respect to the difference between the SST
and the climatological distribution average: strong, severe or extreme, if that difference is,

50

respectively, more than two, three or four times the difference between the 90th percentile
and the climatological distribution average (Hobday et al., 2018). Marine cold spell (MCS)
categories are analogous, but are categorized with reference to sea-surface temperatures
below the 10th percentile.
The baseline used for MHWs and MCSs is 1982–2011, which is shifted by one year from the
standard normal period of 1981–2010 because the first full year of the satellite SST series
on which it is based is 1982.

GLACIER MASS BALANCE DATA
Glacier mass balance data for the global network of reference glaciers are available
from the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS), https://www.wgms.ch. Data for the
2020–2021 mass balance year are preliminary, and are based on a subset of 32 (out of a total
of ~42) WGMS reference glaciers. The glacier mass balance data for western Canada are
based on multi-year, bi-annual (April and September) repeat LiDAR surveys conducted by
Brian Menounos at the University of Northern British Columbia, Canada, as described in
Pelto et al. (2019).

GREENLAND AND ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET DATA
Greenland ice sheet mass balance data are reported from three sources. Modelled changes
in surface mass balance and total mass balance from 1985 to 2021 are based on the average
of three regional climate and mass balance models, described in Mankoff et al. (2021).
An alternative estimate of 2021 mass balance is given in the NOAA Arctic Report Card
(Moon et al., 2021), based on satellite observations of melt area and surface mass balance
models driven by the PROMICE surface weather station network. Satellite gravity data of
total ice sheet mass balance from the GRACE and GRACE-FO missions are available from
Wiese et al. (2019, updated to 2021). These data are available for both the Greenland and
Antarctic ice sheets.

Snow data and monthly anomaly time series charts are available at: https://climate.rutgers.

SEA-ICE DATA
The sea ice section uses data from the EUMETSAT OSI SAF Sea Ice Index v2.1 (OSI-SAF,
based on Lavergne et al., 2019) and the NSIDC v3 Sea Ice Index (Fetterer et al., 2017).
Sea-ice concentrations are estimated from microwave radiances measured from satellites.
Sea-ice extent is calculated as the area of ocean grid cells where the sea-ice concentration
exceeds 15%. Although there are relatively large differences in the absolute extent between
data sets, they agree well on the year-to-year changes and the trends. In this report, NSIDC
data are reported for absolute extents (for example, “18.95 million km2”) for consistency
with earlier reports, while rankings are reported for both data sets.
