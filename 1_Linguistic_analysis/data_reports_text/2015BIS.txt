BIS 85th Annual Report

85th Annual Report

submitted to the Annual General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements
held in Basel on 28 June 2015

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to submit to you the 85th Annual Report of the Bank for
International Settlements for the financial year which ended on 31 March 2015.
The net profit for the year amounted to SDR 542.9 million, compared with
SDR 419.3 million for the preceding year. Details of the results for the financial year
2014/15 may be found on pages 167–8 of this Report under “Financial activities
and results”.
The Board of Directors proposes, in application of Article 51 of the Bank’s
Statutes, that the present General Meeting apply the sum of SDR 125.6 million in
payment of a dividend of SDR 225 per share, payable in any constituent currency of
the SDR, or in Swiss francs.
The Board further recommends that SDR 20.9 million be transferred to the
general reserve fund and the remainder – amounting to SDR 396.4 million – to the
free reserve fund.
If these proposals are approved, the Bank’s dividend for the financial year
2014/15 will be payable to shareholders on 2 July 2015.

Overview of the economic chapters

Chapter I: Is the unthinkable becoming routine?
Globally, interest rates have been extraordinarily low for an exceptionally long time,
in nominal and inflation-adjusted terms, against any benchmark. Such low rates are
the most remarkable symptom of a broader malaise in the global economy: the
economic expansion is unbalanced, debt burdens and financial risks are still too
high, productivity growth too low, and the room for manoeuvre in macroeconomic
policy too limited. The unthinkable risks becoming routine and being perceived as
the new normal.
This malaise has proved exceedingly difficult to understand. The chapter argues
that it reflects to a considerable extent the failure to come to grips with financial
booms and busts that leave deep and enduring economic scars. In the long term,
this runs the risk of entrenching instability and chronic weakness. There is both a
domestic and an international dimension to all this. Domestic policy regimes have
been too narrowly concerned with stabilising short-term output and inflation and
have lost sight of slower-moving but more costly financial booms and busts. And
the international monetary and financial system has spread easy monetary and
financial conditions in the core economies to other economies through exchange
rate and capital flow pressures, furthering the build-up of financial vulnerabilities.
Short-term gain risks being bought at the cost of long-term pain.
Addressing these deficiencies requires a triple rebalancing in national and
international policy frameworks: away from illusory short-term macroeconomic finetuning towards medium-term strategies; away from overwhelming attention to
near-term output and inflation towards a more systematic response to slowermoving financial cycles; and away from a narrow own-house-in-order doctrine to
one that recognises the costly interplay of domestic-focused policies. One essential
element of this rebalancing will be to rely less on demand management policies and
more on structural ones, so as to abandon the debt-fuelled growth model that has
acted as a political and social substitute for productivity-enhancing reforms. The
dividend from lower oil prices provides an opportunity that should not be missed.
Monetary policy has been overburdened for far too long. It must be part of the
answer but cannot be the whole answer. The unthinkable should not be allowed to
become routine.

Chapter II: Global financial markets remain dependent on
central banks
Accommodative monetary policies continued to lift prices in global asset markets in
the past year, while diverging expectations about Federal Reserve and ECB policies
sent the dollar and the euro in opposite directions. As the dollar soared, oil prices
fell sharply, reflecting a mix of expected production and consumption, attitudes to
risk and financing conditions. Bond yields in advanced economies continued to fall
throughout much of the period under review and bond markets entered uncharted
territory as nominal bond yields fell below zero in many markets. This reflected
falling term premia and lower expected policy rates. The fragility of otherwise

buoyant markets was underscored by increasingly frequent bouts of volatility and
signs of reduced market liquidity. Such signs were perhaps clearest in fixed income
markets, where market-makers have scaled back their activities and market-making
has increasingly concentrated in the most liquid bonds. As other types of players,
such as asset managers, have taken their place, the risk of “liquidity illusion” has
increased: market liquidity appears ample in normal times, but vanishes quickly
during market stress.

Chapter III: When the financial becomes real
Plummeting oil prices and a surging US dollar shaped global activity in the year
under review. These large changes in key markets caught economies at different
stages of their business and financial cycles. The business cycle upswing in the
advanced economies continued and growth returned to several of the crisis-hit
economies in the euro area. At the same time, financial downswings are bottoming
out in some of the economies hardest-hit by the Great Financial Crisis. But the
resource misallocations stemming from the pre-crisis financial boom continue to
hold back productivity growth. Other countries, less affected by the crisis, notably
many EMEs, are experiencing different challenges. The shift in global conditions has
coincided with slowing output growth and peaks in domestic financial cycles. There
is the danger that slowing growth in EMEs could expose financial vulnerabilities.
Better macroeconomic management and more robust financial structures, including
longer debt maturities and reduced exposure to currency risk, have increased
resilience. But the overall amount of debt has increased and the shift from banks to
capital market funding could raise new risks.

Chapter IV: Another year of monetary policy accommodation
Monetary policy continued to be exceptionally accommodative, with many
authorities easing or delaying tightening. For some central banks, the ultra-low
policy rate environment was reinforced with large-scale asset purchase programmes.
In the major advanced economies, central banks pursued significantly divergent
policy trajectories, but all remained concerned about the dangers of inflation
running well below inflation objectives. In most other economies, inflation rates
deviated from targets, being surprisingly low for some and high for others. The
deviation of inflation from expected levels and questions surrounding the sources
of price changes underscore an incomplete understanding of the inflation process,
especially regarding its medium- and long-term drivers. At the same time, signs of
growing financial imbalances around the globe highlight the risks of accommodative
monetary policies. The persistence of those policies since the crisis casts doubt on
the suitability of current monetary policy frameworks and suggests that resolving
the tension between price stability and financial stability is the key challenge.
This puts a premium on accounting for financial stability concerns much more
systematically in monetary policy frameworks.

Chapter V: The international monetary and financial system
The suitable design of international monetary and financial arrangements for the
global economy is a long-standing issue. A key shortcoming of the existing system

4

BIS 85th Annual Report

is that it tends to heighten the risk of financial imbalances, leading to booms and
busts in credit and asset prices with serious macroeconomic consequences. These
imbalances often occur simultaneously across countries, deriving strength from
international spillovers of various types. The global use of the dollar and the euro
allows monetary conditions to affect borrowers well beyond the respective issuing
economies. Many countries also import monetary conditions when setting policy
rates to limit interest rate differentials and exchange rate movements against the
major currencies. The global integration of financial markets tends to reinforce
these dynamics, by allowing common factors to drive capital flows and a common
price of risk to move bond and equity prices. Policies to keep one’s own house in
order by managing financial cycles would help to reduce such spillovers. In addition,
central banks need to better internalise spillovers, not least to avoid the effects of
their actions spilling back into their own economies. Moving beyond enlightened
self-interest would require international cooperation on rules constraining domestic
policies.

Chapter VI: Old and new risks in the financial landscape
Risks in the financial system have evolved against the backdrop of persistently low
interest rates in advanced economies. Despite substantial efforts to strengthen their
capital and liquidity positions, advanced economy banks still face market scepticism.
As a result, they have lost some of their traditional funding advantage relative to
potential customers. This adds to the challenges stemming from the gradual
erosion of interest income and banks’ growing exposure to interest rate risk, which
could weaken their resilience in the future. By contrast, EME banks have so far
benefited from market optimism amid buoyant conditions that may be masking the
build-up of financial imbalances. For their part, insurance companies and pension
funds have faced ballooning liabilities and muted asset returns. Asset-liability
mismatches are weakening institutional investors and threaten to spill over into the
real economy. As these investors offload risks onto their customers and banks
retreat from traditional intermediation, asset managers are taking on an increasingly
important role. Regulatory authorities are carefully monitoring the financial stability
implications of the growing asset management sector.

I. Is the unthinkable becoming routine?

Interest rates have never been so low for so long (Graph I.1). They are low in
nominal and real (inflation-adjusted) terms and low against any benchmark.
Between December 2014 and end-May 2015, on average around $2 trillion in global
long-term sovereign debt, much of it issued by euro area sovereigns, was trading at
negative yields. At their trough, French, German and Swiss sovereign yields were
negative out to a respective five, nine and 15 years. Such yields are unprecedented.
Policy rates are even lower than at the peak of the Great Financial Crisis in both
nominal and real terms. And in real terms they have now been negative for even
longer than during the Great Inflation of the 1970s. Yet, exceptional as this situation
may be, many expect it to continue. There is something deeply troubling when the
unthinkable threatens to become routine.
Such low rates are only the most obvious symptom of a broader malaise,
despite the progress made since the crisis. Global economic growth may now be
not far from historical averages but it remains unbalanced. Debt burdens are still
high, and often growing, relative to output and incomes. The economies hit by a
balance sheet recession are still struggling to return to healthy expansion. In several
others, financial imbalances show signs of building up, in the form of strong credit
and asset price increases, despite the absence of inflationary pressures. Monetary
policy has taken on far too much of the burden of boosting output. And in the
meantime, productivity growth has continued to decline.
This malaise has proved exceedingly hard to understand. Debates rage.
Building on last year’s analysis, this Annual Report offers a lens through which to
interpret what is going on. The lens focuses on financial, medium-term and global

domestic factors.
We argue that the current malaise may to a considerable extent reflect a failure
to come to grips with how financial developments interact with output and inflation
in a globalised economy. For some time now, policies have proved ineffective in
preventing the build-up and collapse of hugely damaging financial imbalances,
whether in advanced or in emerging market economies (EMEs). These have left

fine-tuning towards medium-term strategies; away from overwhelming attention to
near-term output and inflation towards a more systematic response to slowermoving financial cycles; and away from a narrow own-house-in-order doctrine to
one that recognises the costly interplay of domestic-focused policies.
In this rebalancing, one essential element will be to rely less on demand
management policies and more on structural ones. The aim is to replace the debtfuelled growth model that has acted as a political and social substitute for
productivity-enhancing reforms. The dividend from lower oil prices provides an
opportunity that should not be missed. Monetary policy, overburdened for far too
long, must be part of the answer, but it cannot be the whole answer.
The rest of the chapter digs further into the problem in a quest to unearth its
possible solution. The first section reviews the global economy’s evolution in the
past year and assesses the prospects and risks ahead. The second provides the
suggested lens through which to understand the forces that have been shaping,
and will continue to shape, that evolution. The third considers the policy implications.

The global economy: where it is and where it may be going
Looking back: recent evolution
Where did we leave the economy at this point in time last year? Output growth was
not far away from historical averages; and advanced economies (AEs) were gaining
momentum even as EMEs had lost some. Except in a few EMEs, inflation was low, in
some notable cases below central bank targets. Subdued risk-taking in the real
economy contrasted with aggressive risk-taking in financial markets: anaemic
investment coexisted with buoyant asset prices and unusually low volatility. Market
performance seemed to hinge on extraordinary monetary accommodation as stock
and bond indices responded to central bankers’ every word and deed. As bank
balance sheets in crisis-hit economies were slowly healing, market-based finance
was surging. The balance sheets of the non-financial private sector were evolving
along a clear divide: in crisis-hit countries the sector was deleveraging at varying
but slow speeds; elsewhere it was leveraging up, sometimes uncomfortably fast.
Fiscal policy was generally under strain, with debt-to-GDP ratios continuing to rise
even as several AEs consolidated their finances. As a result, global private plus
public sector debt-to-GDP ratios were edging up. Monetary policy was testing what,
at the time, appeared to be its outer limits.
Since then, there have been two major developments. First, the oil price has
fallen sharply, with lesser declines for other commodities. The drop of around 60%
from July 2014 to March 2015 was the third largest in the last half-century, after
those following the Lehman default and the OPEC cartel breakdown in 1985. The
price has only partially recovered since then. Second, the US dollar has appreciated
strongly. Over the same period, the dollar’s trade-weighted exchange rate rose by
around 15% – one of the sharpest appreciations on record within a similar window.
The shift has been especially large vis-à-vis the euro.
Much ink has been spilled on the oil price. But, like that of any other asset, the
price of oil is driven by a combination of market expectations about future production
and consumption, risk attitudes and financing conditions (Chapter II). This time, a
key factor was the realisation that OPEC had become more concerned about market
share and would no longer restrict production as in the past – a true game changer.
This explanation better fits the timing and steepness of the price drop than do
worries about weakening global demand. In addition, hedging activity by highly
indebted individual producers may have played a role.

BIS 85th Annual Report

Regardless of its drivers, the oil price drop has already provided, and will
continue to provide, a welcome boost to the global economy (Chapter III). A fall in
the price of a key input in global production is bound to be expansionary. This will
be all the more visible to the extent that it does not reflect a fall in global demand.
Even so, there will be obvious gainers and losers, and the interaction of oil price
trends with financial vulnerabilities bears watching (see below).
The sharp dollar appreciation has multiple causes and uncertain effects. It
started when firming expectations of divergent macroeconomic conditions and
central bank policies made US dollar assets relatively more attractive. It became
entrenched once the ECB surprised markets with its large-scale asset purchase
programme. The impact of the appreciation through trade is mainly redistributional
but welcome to the extent that it has shifted growth momentum from stronger to
weaker economies. But the ultimate impact will depend on its imprint on financial
vulnerabilities and on how policies, not least monetary policies, in turn react to
currency movements. Here, the large stock of dollar debt run up by non-US
residents looms large (see below).
Together, the oil price drop and dollar appreciation help explain, and in part
reflect, the further plunge of short- and long-term interest rates. They help explain
it to the extent that a lower oil price has added to global disinflationary pressures.
They reflect it to the extent that exceptionally easy monetary policy in some
jurisdictions prompts easing elsewhere. Just think of the Swiss National Bank’s or
the Danish central bank’s decision to test the limits of negative interest rates as the
exchange rates came under huge pressure.
Where has this left the world? On the surface, perhaps, not far from where we
left it last year. Global growth is little changed, and the rotation from EMEs to AEs
has continued. Inflation is somewhat lower, due mainly to temporary and positive
supply side factors (Chapter IV). Financial markets have shown mixed signals:
volatility has normalised somewhat and risk-taking in corporate debt markets has
eased, especially in EMEs. Yet equity prices have soared further and markets still
seem to take their cue from central bank policies (Chapter II). US monetary policy
normalisation appears closer, but the timing is still uncertain. Banks have continued
to heal, although doubts remain, and this has further boosted market-based finance
(Chapter VI). Private sector balance sheets have evolved further in the same
direction, with some countries deleveraging and others leveraging up, but little has
changed overall (Chapter III).
Beneath the surface, though, the medium-term risks and tensions have
increased, inherent as they are in a faulty debt-fuelled global growth model. And it
is to these risks and tensions that we now turn.

Looking ahead: risks and tensions
To understand the main medium-term risks, it is useful to divide countries into two
groups: those that were badly hit by the Great Financial Crisis, and those that were
not. For, almost a decade on, the long shadow of the crisis is still with us (Chapter III).
In the least affected countries, the main risk is that of peaking domestic
financial cycles, often coupled with external vulnerabilities. This group includes
some AEs, notably commodity exporters, and many EMEs, notably some of the
largest. In these economies, prolonged domestic credit booms have taken private
sector debt-to-GDP ratios to new heights, often in tandem with strong increases in
property prices. And in a number of them, as in the past, external sources of credit
expansion, especially in foreign currency, have played a role. For example, US dollar
credit to non-banks in EMEs has almost doubled since early 2009, to exceed
$3 trillion. Especially at risk are commodity exporters, buoyed by a commodity

“supercycle” and turbocharged by exceptionally easy global funding conditions.
No wonder that estimates for potential growth rates have already halved in Latin
America. China plays a pivotal role in all this: it is a huge economy and commodity
importer that has slowed considerably under the weight of its pervasive financial
imbalances.
In several respects, EMEs are in better shape than in the 1980s and 1990s, when
tighter monetary conditions in the United States and an appreciating dollar
triggered crises (Graph I.3). Macroeconomic frameworks are stronger and exchange
rates more flexible. The financial system infrastructure is more robust, and
prudential regulation, not least the macroprudential setup, is tighter. For instance,
despite the eye-catching US dollar figures, foreign exchange debt as a percentage
of GDP is not as high as in the past. Indeed, that was the aim of developing local
currency bond markets – to put an end to “original sin”. And foreign exchange
reserves are now much larger.
Even so, caution is called for. A seemingly solid performance in terms of
growth, low inflation and fiscal probity did not insulate Asian economies in the
1990s. Foreign exchange exposures are now concentrated in the corporate sector,
where currency mismatches are harder to measure. There are limits to how far
official reserves can be mobilised to plug private sector funding liquidity shortfalls
or to defend currencies. And it remains to be seen how the shift from banks to asset
managers will influence asset price dynamics: the size asymmetry between suppliers
and recipients of funds has not got any smaller, and markets could react violently if
pressures became one-sided – liquidity will certainly evaporate in the heat of a rush
for the exits. The 2013 “taper tantrum” was only an incomplete test: it reflected
traditional balance of payments and macroeconomic concerns, but did not coincide
with any more damaging unwinding of domestic financial imbalances.
One thing is for sure: gone are the days when what happened in EMEs largely
stayed there. The EMEs’ heft in the global economy has soared since the Asian crisis,
from about one third to almost half of global GDP in purchasing power terms. And
in some cases, their external financial exposures can be quite large from a global
perspective, even if small in relation to the domestic economy. Take, in particular,
China. At end-2014, it was the world’s eighth largest borrower in terms of the
$1 trillion in cross-border bank claims – double the amount outstanding just two

years before – or the 11th largest on the more than $450 billion its nationals had
borrowed in international debt securities markets by end-March 2015.
Different risks attend the countries most affected by the crisis, which are still
deleveraging or starting to releverage. Three are worth highlighting.
The first relates to the medium-term costs of persistent ultra-low interest rates.
These can inflict serious damage on the financial system (Chapters II and VI). Such
rates sap banks’ interest margins and returns from maturity transformation,
potentially weakening balance sheets and the credit supply, and are a source of
major one-way interest rate risk. Ultra-low rates also undermine the profitability and
solvency of insurance companies and pension funds. And they can cause pervasive
mispricing in financial markets: equity and some corporate debt markets, for
instance, seem to be quite stretched. Such rates also raise risks for the real economy.
In the shorter term, the plight of pension funds is just the most visible reminder of
the need to save more for retirement, which can weaken aggregate demand. Over
a longer horizon, negative rates, whether in inflation-adjusted or in nominal terms,
are hardly conducive to rational investment decisions and hence sustained growth.
If the unprecedented journey towards lower negative nominal interest rates continues,
technical, economic, legal and even political boundaries may well be tested.
The second risk relates to the prolonged reliance on debt as a substitute for
productivity-enhancing reforms. It is always tempting to postpone adjustment,
even though the drag that high public debt can exert on growth has been
well documented. Ageing populations compound this challenge in at least two
ways. Economically, they make the debt burden much harder to bear. Politically,
they heighten the temptation to boost output temporarily through demand
management policies: the tyranny of headline growth figures, unadjusted for
demographics, contributes to this. For example, it is not remarked often enough
that, in terms of its working age population, Japan’s growth has outpaced that of
many of its advanced economy peers, not least the United States. On that basis, in
2000–07, Japan grew at a cumulative rate of 15%, almost twice as fast as the United
States (8%) – the reverse of what headline growth rates show (10% and 18%). The
difference is even bigger if the post-crisis years are also considered.
The third risk relates to the Greek crisis and its impact on the euro area. In
some respects, developments in Greece, and in the euro area more generally, are
akin to the broader global challenges but amplified by institutional specificities – a
toxic mix of private and public debt and too little commitment to badly needed
structural adjustments. As a result, monetary policy, seen as a quick fix to buy time,
has borne the brunt of the burden. On strictly economic grounds, the euro area
seems better placed to cope with contagion than when the crisis first broke out. Yet
uncertainty lingers, and the potential for political contagion is even harder to assess.
Not included in this list is the risk of persistently low inflation or outright
deflation. True, the risk depends on country-specific factors. But the current policy
debate tends to overplay it (Chapter IV). First, it is sometimes not stressed enough
that recent price declines largely reflect the fall in oil and other commodity prices.
Their transient impact on inflation should be superseded by the longer-lasting
boost to expenditure and output, especially in energy-importing countries. Second,
there is a tendency to draw general conclusions from the Great Depression – a
unique episode that may have had more to do with the large drop in asset prices
and with banking crises than with deflation per se. In general, the longer historical
record reveals that the link between deflation and growth is a weak one. Finally, the
evidence also suggests that the real economic damage has so far stemmed from
the interplay of debt with property prices, and not so much with goods and services
prices, as the latest recession confirms. At the same time, policy responses should
also take into account our still limited understanding of the inflation process.

12

BIS 85th Annual Report

The resulting picture is that of a world that has been returning to stronger
growth but where medium-term tensions persist. The wounds left by the crisis and
subsequent recession are healing, because balance sheets are being repaired and
some deleveraging has taken place. Recently, the strong and unexpected boost
from energy prices has helped too. In the meantime, monetary policy has done its
utmost to support near-term demand. But the policy mix has relied too much on
measures that, directly or indirectly, have entrenched dependence on the very
debt-fuelled growth model that lay at the root of the crisis. These tensions manifest
themselves most visibly in the failure of global debt burdens to adjust, the
continued decline in productivity growth and, above all, the progressive loss of
policy room for manoeuvre, both fiscal and monetary.

The deeper causes
Why has this happened? One possible answer lies in a blend of politics and ideas.
The natural bias of political systems is to encourage policies that buy short-term
gain at the cost of risking long-term pain. The reasons are well known and need no
elaboration here. But, as ideas influence policy, their effect becomes all the more
insidious because of that bias. Thus, the pressing question is whether prevailing
economic paradigms are sufficiently good guides for policy.

Ideas and perspectives
Once the crisis broke out, there was widespread agreement that the dominant
macroeconomic perspectives had failed to ward off the crisis because they ruled it
out. To simplify somewhat, the presumption was that price stability was sufficient
for macroeconomic stability and that either the financial system was self-stabilising
or that its failure could not be very damaging.
Unfortunately, progress in tackling these shortcomings has been disappointing.
Financial factors still appear to be hovering at the periphery of macroeconomic
thinking. True, huge efforts have been made to bring them closer to the core:
economists have worked hard to develop models that can accommodate them. But
these efforts have not yet permeated deeply enough into the policy debate:
macroeconomic stability and financial stability remain uncomfortable bedfellows.
If one strips the prevailing analytical view of all its nuances and focuses on how
it is shaping the policy debate, its basic logic is simple. There is an excess or shortfall
of final demand for domestic production (an “output gap”) that determines
domestic inflation, not least by underpinning inflation expectations. Aggregate
demand policies are then used to eliminate that gap and so achieve full employment
and stable inflation; fiscal policy affects spending directly, and monetary policy
indirectly, through real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates. The exchange rate, if
allowed to float, permits the authorities to set monetary policy freely in line with
domestic needs and will, over time, also balance the current account. If each
country adjusts its monetary and fiscal levers so as to close the output gap period
by period, everything will be fine, domestically and globally.
Of course, to varying degrees, financial factors do make their appearance. For
instance, in some cases too much debt is seen as widening the demand shortfall. In
others, the possibility of financial instability is fully recognised. But then, at the end
of the day, when all is said and done, the basic conclusions do not change. All
demand shortfalls should be treated equally, ie through standard aggregate
demand policies. And financial instability should best be addressed separately,
through prudential policy, albeit with a stronger systemic (macroprudential)

orientation. Following a tidy separation principle, monetary and fiscal policies are
best left free to address standard macroeconomic concerns, very much as before.
From this perspective, we are back in the familiar pre-crisis world. It feels oddly like
Groundhog Day.
Last year’s Annual Report offered a different analytical lens that brought
different policy conclusions into view. That lens seeks to bring financial factors back
to the core of macroeconomics, and stresses the medium term over the short term
and the global over the domestic. Three basic elements, developed further in this
year’s Report, are essential.
First, the behaviour of inflation may not be a fully reliable guide to sustainable
(or potential) output. This is because financial imbalances often build up when
inflation is low and stable, declining or even negative. The hallmarks of these
imbalances are booming credit and asset prices, particularly property prices, and
signs of aggressive risk-taking in financial markets, such as low credit spreads and
falling volatility. When these financial booms finally collapse, they can cause
devastating and long-lasting economic damage. This was clearly true of the Great
Financial Crisis. But that episode simply replayed a recurrent historical pattern, from
the pre-Great Depression financial boom in the United States – prices actually fell
for part of the roaring 1920s – to the crisis in Japan in the early 1990s and those in
Asia in the mid-1990s.
If financial booms have common characteristics, it should be possible to
identify some of the danger signals in advance. And the evidence does indicate
that proxies for such financial booms can provide useful information about the
risks ahead as events unfold (in “real time”). Such indicators would have helped
establish that output was running above its sustainable, or potential, level ahead
of the most recent crisis in the United States – something that typical estimates
used in policymaking, partly distorted by subdued inflation, have done only ex
post, as they rewrite history based on new information (Box IV.C). This is the reason
why, for the United States, knowledge of the deviations of the debt service ratio
and leverage from their long-term values in the mid-2000s would have helped
project the behaviour of output during the subsequent recession and recovery
(Box III.A). And it explains why the behaviour of credit and property prices during
the boom, or that of the debt service ratio or even that of credit growth alone, has
proved a useful indicator of future banking distress and costly recessions across
countries.
Why is inflation an insufficiently reliable signal of sustainability, contrary to what
the prevailing paradigm suggests? There are at least two possible reasons.
One has to do with the type of credit expansion involved. Instead of financing
the purchase of newly produced goods or services, which lifts expenditures
and output, strong credit growth may simply be paying for existing assets, either
“real” (eg housing or companies) or financial (eg simple assets or more complex
forms of financial engineering). Neither of these impinges directly on inflationary
pressures.
The other has to do with what explains (dis)inflation. Supply-driven disinflations
tend to boost output while providing fertile ground for the build-up of financial
imbalances. Examples include forces such as the globalisation of the real economy
(eg the entry of former communist countries into the world trading system),
technological innovation, greater competition, and falling prices for key production
inputs such as oil. The difference between supply- and demand-driven disinflations
may well explain the historically weak empirical link between deflation and growth.
Second, the busts that follow financial booms do much more damage, and are
less amenable to traditional aggregate demand policies. Growing empirical evidence
indicates that the corresponding recessions are deeper, subsequent recoveries

14

BIS 85th Annual Report

weaker, output potential permanently lost, and post-recession growth rates possibly
lower. Indeed, the post-crisis experience has followed a similar pattern, despite the
unprecedented monetary stimulus and initial fiscal expansion.
The reasons have to do with the strong undercurrents that the boom leaves in
its wake. The financial sector is broken. Households and/or companies face large
debt overhangs and asset quality problems. And, importantly, financial booms
interact perversely with productivity growth. They can mask its secular decline,
eroded by structural deficiencies, behind an illusory feel-good factor (see the 84th
Annual Report). They can also undermine it more directly, by causing long-lasting
resource misallocations, in both capital and labour (Box III.B). Taking cross-country
estimates at face value, the impact can be quite large, up to nearly 1 percentage
point per year during the boom and much larger after a crisis breaks out.
Under these conditions, and once the acute financial crisis phase is over,
aggregate demand policies are pushing on a string. Undercapitalised financial
institutions restrict and misallocate credit. Overindebted borrowers pay back debt.
And misallocated resources cannot respond to an indiscriminate stimulus. In other
words, not all output gaps are born equal, amenable to identical remedies; and
post-crisis their size may not be as large as it appears. Thus, unless the underlying
problems are addressed head-on, short-term gain may be purchased at the price
of long-term pain: debt does not come down sufficiently, the policy room for
manoeuvre shrinks further and the seeds are sown for the next financial bust. None
of this, however, means higher inflation. Paradoxically, an easing bias in the short
term may end up being contractionary longer-term.
Third, when the exchange rate becomes the point of least resistance, problems
can be exacerbated globally. Since after a financial bust monetary policy has only
limited traction on expenditures through domestic channels, the responsiveness of
inflation and output to the exchange rate is stronger. Currency depreciation has a
more immediate, mechanical effect on prices. And to the extent that it diverts
demand away from other countries, it can boost output. But if, as argued below,
exchange rates fail to insulate countries sufficiently from external influences, the
appreciations will be resisted and the end result will be competitive depreciations
and a looser monetary policy stance globally. Thus, if, on balance, policies are
already too loose for lasting financial and macroeconomic stability, because of an
unbalanced policy mix, the outcome will be worse. Once more, short-term gain
may result in long-term pain.

Excess financial elasticity
It is now possible to put these various pieces together and diagnose what may be
wrong with the functioning of the global economy. In this view, policies have been
unable to constrain the build-up and collapse of damaging financial booms, ie the
global economy exhibits “excess financial elasticity” – think of an elastic band that
can be stretched out further and further until, eventually, it snaps back more
painfully. This reflects three shortcomings: in the interplay between financial
markets and the economy; in domestic policy regimes; and in the interaction of
these regimes through the IMFS. Take each in turn.
By now, there is a keen appreciation that self-equilibrating forces in the
financial system are weak, and that this can amplify business fluctuations. There is a
mutually reinforcing feedback between loosely anchored perceptions of risk and
value, on the one hand, and weak financing constraints, on the other. For a (long)
while, asset valuations soar, risk-taking increases and financing becomes easier
until, at some point, the process goes into reverse. Thus, the financial system is said
to be “procyclical”. The crisis revealed this once more, and with a vengeance.

BIS 85th Annual Report

The degree of procyclicality, or the system’s elasticity, hinges on domestic
policy regimes, and their evolution has increased it. First, financial liberalisation back
in the 1980s eased financing constraints and made funding easier and cheaper to
obtain. Meanwhile, prudential safeguards have lagged behind. Second, the
emergence of monetary policy regimes focused on near-term inflation control has
meant that policy would be tightened during financial booms only if inflation
increased but would then be loosened aggressively and persistently during busts.
Third, fiscal policy has failed to recognise the hugely flattering effect that financial
booms have on fiscal accounts and the limited effectiveness of untargeted measures
during busts. Taken together, these developments have resulted in an easing bias
that allows financial booms to grow bigger, last longer and collapse more violently.
Importantly, the current IMFS has further increased this excess elasticity
through the interaction of monetary and financial regimes (Chapter V).
The interaction of monetary regimes has spread the easing bias from the core
economies to the rest of the world. This happens directly, because key international
currencies – above all, the US dollar – are extensively used outside the issuing
country’s borders. Thus, the core countries’ monetary policies directly influence
financial conditions elsewhere. More importantly, an indirect effect works through the
aversion of policymakers to unwelcome exchange rate appreciation. As a result, policy
rates are kept lower and, if countries resort to foreign exchange intervention, yields
are further compressed once the proceeds are invested in reserve currency assets.
The interaction of financial regimes, through the free mobility of capital across
currencies and borders, reinforces and channels these effects. Freely mobile capital
adds a key external source of funding during domestic booms. And it makes
exchange rates subject to “overshooting” for exactly the same reasons as domestic
asset prices are, ie loosely anchored perceptions of values, risk-taking and ample
funding. Think, for instance, of popular strategies such as momentum trading and
carry trades; or of the self-reinforcing feedback between exchange rate appreciation,
lower foreign currency debt burdens and risk-taking. More generally, free capital
mobility generates surges in risk-taking across countries, regardless of their specific
conditions, inducing strong co-movements in long-term yields, asset prices and
financing flows. Again, the stronger and more long-lasting these surges are, the
more violent the subsequent reversal. Global liquidity, or the ease of financing in
international markets, moves in irregular but powerful waves.
The historical evidence is broadly consistent with these observations. The lens
helps explain why the scale and duration of financial booms and busts (financial
cycles) have increased since the early 1980s (Graph I.4) – a development also
supported by the progressive globalisation of the real economy, as trade barriers
have come down and new countries have joined in, boosting global growth
prospects while generating disinflationary pressures. It helps explain why, globally,
inflation-adjusted interest rates have trended down and appear quite low regardless
of benchmarks and why foreign exchange reserves have soared. It helps explain
why, post-crisis, US dollar credit has surged outside the United States, directed
largely towards EMEs. And it helps explain why we have been seeing signs of the
build-up of financial imbalances in EMEs as well as in some advanced economies
less affected by the crisis and highly exposed to international influences.
Note that, in this story, current account imbalances do not figure prominently.
Current account deficits need not coincide with the build-up of financial imbalances.
In fact, some of the most damaging financial imbalances in history have occurred in
surplus countries – most spectacularly in the United States before the Great
Depression and Japan from the late 1980s. And strong financial booms have
recently occurred, or are now taking place, in several surplus countries, including
China, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. The relationship between current

accounts and financial imbalances is more nuanced: a reduction in the surplus or
increase in the deficit tends to reflect the build-up of those imbalances. This has
policy implications to which we will return.

Why are interest rates so low?
All this raises the fundamental question that lies at the heart of the current policy
debate: Why are market interest rates so low? And are they “equilibrium (or natural)
rates”, ie are they where they should be? How are the market and equilibrium rates
determined? The prevailing analytical perspective and the one proposed in this
Report come up with different answers.
Most holders of either view would agree that market interest rates are
determined by the interplay of central banks’ and market participants’ decisions
(Chapter II). Central banks set the short-term policy rate and influence long-term
rates through signals about how they will set short-term rates and, increasingly,
through large-scale purchases along the maturity spectrum. Market participants set
deposit and loan rates and, through their portfolio choices, help determine longerterm market rates. Their decisions will reflect many factors, including risk appetite,
views about profitable investments, regulatory and accounting constraints and, of
course, expectations about what central banks will do (Chapter II). In turn, actual
inflation determines ex post inflation-adjusted rates and expected inflation ex ante
real rates.
But are the interest rates that prevail in the market actually equilibrium rates?
Take first the short-term rate, which central banks set. When we read that central
banks can have only a transitory impact on inflation-adjusted short-term rates, what
is really meant is that, at some point, unless central banks set them at their
“equilibrium” level, or sufficiently close to it, something “bad” will happen. Exactly
what that “bad” outcome is will depend on one’s view of how the economy works.
In the prevailing view – one embedded in the popular “savings glut” and
“secular stagnation” hypotheses – the answer is that inflation will rise or fall, possibly
even turn into deflation. Inflation provides the key signal, and its behaviour depends
on the degree of economic slack. The corresponding equilibrium rate is also known

BIS 85th Annual Report

17

as the “Wicksellian” natural rate: it equates output with its potential, or saving and
investment at full employment. To be sure, in practice policymakers also consider
economic slack independently. But, in the final analysis, since slack is very hard to
measure, they tend to revise its estimate based on what happens to inflation. For
example, if unemployment falls below its presumed “equilibrium” level but inflation
does not increase, they will infer that there is still slack in the economy.
In the view proposed here, inflation need not reliably signal that rates are at
their “equilibrium” level. Rather, the key signal may be the build-up of financial
imbalances. After all, pre-crisis, inflation was stable and traditional estimates of
potential output proved, in retrospect, far too optimistic. If one acknowledges that
low interest rates contributed to the financial boom whose collapse caused the
crisis, and that, as the evidence indicates, both the boom and the subsequent crisis
caused long-lasting damage to output, employment and productivity growth, it is
hard to argue that rates were at their equilibrium level. This also means that interest
rates are low today, at least in part, because they were too low in the past. Low rates
beget still lower rates. In this sense, low rates are self-validating. Given signs of the
build-up of financial imbalances in several parts of the world, there is a troubling
element of déjà vu in all this.
Shifting the focus from short-term to long-term rates does not change the
picture. There is no reason to presume that these long-term rates will be at their
equilibrium level any more than short-term rates are. Central banks and market
participants fumble in the dark, seeking either to push rates towards equilibrium or
to profit from their movement. After all, long-term rates are just another asset price.
And asset prices often do follow unsustainable and erratic paths, as when they are
at the root of financial instability.

Policy implications
What are the policy implications of this analysis? The first is that monetary policy
has been overburdened for too long, especially post-crisis. The second, more
general one, is the need to rebalance policies away from aggregate demand
management to initiatives that are more structural in character. True, this is
politically difficult. But there is no other way to sustainably raise output and
productivity growth and to shake off debt addiction. The specific blend of measures
will naturally be country-specific, but it will generally involve improving the
flexibility of product and labour markets, providing an environment conducive to
entrepreneurship and innovation, and boosting labour force participation. This
would also help relieve the huge pressure that has been placed post-crisis on fiscal
and, above all, monetary policy. The oil dividend provides a tailwind for
implementing such reforms and should not be wasted. The analysis is also a wakeup call for commodity exporters that may be tempted to avoid painful adjustments
as their revenues fall sharply.
Beyond this, there are questions about how best to adjust policy frameworks,
nationally and internationally, in order to take financial factors more systematically
into account and about what to do at the current juncture.

Adjusting frameworks
As noted in last year’s Annual Report, constraining the excess financial elasticity
of individual economies calls for broad-based adjustments in domestic fiscal,
prudential and monetary frameworks. The basic strategy would be to rein in
financial booms more deliberately and to address financial busts more effectively.

18

BIS 85th Annual Report

Compared with current ones, the resulting policies would be less asymmetrical over
financial cycles, less procyclical and less biased towards easing over successive
booms and busts. Take each type of policy in turn.
The priority for fiscal policy is to ensure that it behaves countercyclically and
that it preserves sufficient room for manoeuvre during busts. This means, first and
foremost, ensuring long-term sustainability – a daunting challenge in many
jurisdictions (Chapter III). It also means exercising extra prudence during financial
booms, so as not to overestimate the underlying solidity of fiscal positions:
sustainable output and growth look rosy, fiscal revenues are bloated, and the
contingent liabilities needed to deal with the bust remain hidden. During a bust,
that fiscal space should ideally be used to speed up private sector balance sheet
repair. This applies to banks – but only if private sector backstops prove insufficient
– and non-banks alike. The range of options includes recapitalisation, temporary
nationalisation and, for non-banks, outright debt relief. By tackling the root
problem, this would be a more efficient use of public money than untargeted
expenditures or tax cuts. More fundamentally, there is a strong case for eliminating
the subsidy of debt over equity, so common in tax codes.
The priority for prudential policy is to strengthen its systemic or
“macroprudential” orientation, so as to tackle procyclicality head-on. Basel III indeed
moves in that direction with its countercyclical capital buffer, as does the
implementation of full-fledged macroprudential frameworks in national jurisdictions.
These deploy a range of instruments designed to strengthen the financial system’s
resilience and, ideally, to constrain financial booms (Chapter IV). Examples include
maximum loan-to-value or debt-to-income ratios, proactive adjustments to capital
requirements and provisioning, restrictions on non-core bank funding, and
macroprudential (banking system-wide) stress tests.
At the same time, two big gaps remain (Chapter VI). One is how best to address
the risks raised by the rapid growth of non-bank financial intermediaries. To be sure,
insurance companies have always been regulated, although not so much from a
systemic perspective. And work has been under way for some time on “shadow
banks” – leveraged players active in maturity transformation. But attention has only
recently turned to the asset management industry. Here the concern is not so much
the failure of individual firms, but the impact of their collective behaviour on
systemic stability through asset prices, market liquidity and funding conditions. Even
when unleveraged, these investors are quite capable of generating leverage-like
behaviour. The second gap is how best to address sovereign risk, including for
banks. Several regulatory provisions and supervisory practices favour sovereign
exposures. But sovereigns can be quite risky and, historically, have often been at the
root of bank failures. Moreover, favouring them often comes at the expense of small
and medium-sized enterprises, thereby stifling productive activities and employment.
The right approach needs to be systemic and comprehensive, addressing the various
types of exposure. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has recently taken
up this challenge. That work should be pursued without delay or hesitation.
The priority for monetary policy is to ensure that financial stability concerns
are incorporated more symmetrically during booms and busts (Chapter IV). The
frameworks should allow for scope to tighten during financial booms even if nearterm inflation is low and stable, and to ease less aggressively and persistently
during busts.
While a number of objections have been raised to this proposal, none of them
appears to be a show-stopper. Indeed, similar objections were levelled against
adopting inflation targeting frameworks, which many regarded as a step in the dark.
A first objection is that there are no reliable indicators for the build-up of
financial imbalances. But considerable progress has been made in this area, and

BIS 85th Annual Report

19

macroprudential frameworks already actively rely on such assessments. Moreover,
as noted, standard monetary policy benchmarks are unobservable and measured
with great uncertainty, eg economic slack, potential output and equilibrium real
interest rates. Even measuring the relevant inflation expectations is fraught with
difficulties.
A second objection is that monetary policy has little impact on financial booms,
and hence on credit expansion, asset prices and risk-taking. But these are key
channels through which monetary stimulus influences aggregate demand. Indeed,
this is the strategy that central banks have explicitly followed post-crisis to reanimate
the economy. And, if anything, the evidence suggests that central banks have been
very successful in influencing financial markets and financial risk-taking but less so
in boosting risk-taking in the real economy and hence output.
The deeper question is how to reconcile such a strategy with inflation
objectives. The strategy requires greater tolerance for persistent inflation deviations
from target, especially when disinflation is driven by positive supply side forces. Are
central banks prepared to accept them? And are the frameworks flexible enough?
This will necessarily vary across central banks.
Arguably, some of the current frameworks already provide central banks with
sufficient flexibility. Some arrangements, for instance, explicitly include the option to
allow inflation to return to the long-run target only slowly over time, depending on
the factors that drove it off track. This, of course, requires careful, and possibly quite
challenging, explanation and communication. Two factors could in part explain why
central banks may not have fully used this flexibility. One is their perception of the
trade-offs involved. For example, they may see deflation as a kind of red line that,
once crossed, triggers a self-reinforcing destabilising process. Another is the
possibility of using macroprudential tools instead.
Even so, in a number of cases the frameworks and the mandates underpinning
them may be seen as too restrictive. If so, adjustments could be made. These
might even go as far as revisiting mandates, if necessary, such as by assigning
greater weight to financial stability considerations. But, if chosen, this route would
need to be travelled with great care. The revision process and final outcome could
be unpredictable and might open the door to unwelcome political economy
pressures.
On balance, the priority should be to use the existing room for manoeuvre to
the full, and to encourage analytical perspectives that highlight the costs of failing
to incorporate financial stability considerations into monetary frameworks. Building
sufficient public support is critical. Mandates could then be revisited only as a last
resort.
What about the IMFS? Putting one’s own house in order, along the principles
described, would already be a major step: it would greatly reduce the negative
spillovers to the rest of the global village. But there is a need to go further
(Chapter V).
This has long been recognised for the “financial” dimension of the system. The
need for improvement has been the basis for increasingly tight cooperation in the
development and implementation of commonly agreed prudential standards as well
as in day-to-day supervision of banks. True, the journey has not been smooth, and
momentum inevitably slows as the memories of a crisis fade. But the journey is
continuing, particularly in the various initiatives under way under the aegis of the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board (see
below). Progress requires unflagging commitment: the risk that national priorities
and biases will gain the upper hand always lurks around the next corner.
By contrast, the recognition has been far less common for the “monetary”
dimension of the system, at least since the breakdown of Bretton Woods. Here, it is

20

BIS 85th Annual Report

worth distinguishing between crisis management and crisis prevention. In crisis
management, cooperation has been long-standing, mainly through foreign
exchange swap lines; in crisis prevention, which means in routine monetary policy
settings, it has been much softer.
As regards crisis management, central banks have built on the successful
cooperation during the Great Financial Crisis. Among the central banks of major
currency areas, foreign currency swap lines exist or could be established quickly as
needed. And there may be some room to strengthen these mechanisms further,
even though risk management and governance issues loom large.
But international arrangements for emergency liquidity support cannot, and
should not, substitute for cooperative efforts to prevent financial crises. They
cannot, because the economic and social costs of a crisis are simply too large and
unpredictable. And they should not, because of moral hazard and the tendency to
overburden central banks.
Two factors have severely hindered monetary policy cooperation outside crises.
The first has to do with diagnosis and hence the perceived need to act. As explained
above, the prevailing view is that flexible exchange rates, combined with inflationfocused domestic regimes, can foster the right global outcomes. As a result,
discussions on how to promote global coordination have centred on how to deal
with current account imbalances, which are less amenable to monetary policy
measures. Indeed, the terms “imbalance” and “current account imbalance” have
been treated as synonymous. The second factor has to do with mandates and hence
the incentive to act. National mandates raise the bar: actions must clearly be seen
to promote the interests of one’s own country. In other words, there is no perceived
need and no incentive.
Yet neither factor should halt proceedings. The excess financial elasticity
perspective highlights the need for cooperation: international spillovers and
spillbacks are just too damaging. Moreover, it shifts the focus onto financial
imbalances – the blind spot of present arrangements. Indeed, in this view, the
exclusive focus on current account imbalances has sometimes been counterproductive.
It has, for example, encouraged pressure on current account surplus countries to
expand domestic demand even as financial imbalances were building up, as in the
case of Japan in the 1980s or China post-crisis. As regards incentives, national
mandates have not prevented tight cooperation in the prudential sphere.
How far could cooperation realistically go? At a minimum, enlightened selfinterest, based on a thorough exchange of information, should be feasible. This
would mean taking spillovers and spillbacks more systematically into account when
setting policies. Large jurisdictions that are home to international currencies have a
special responsibility. Cooperation could even extend to occasional joint decisions,
on both interest rates and foreign exchange intervention, beyond those seen during
crises. Unfortunately, a stronger sense of urgency and shared responsibility would
be needed to develop new global rules of the game that would help instil greater
discipline in national policies.

What to do now?
Room for manoeuvre in macroeconomic policy has been narrowing with every
passing year. In some jurisdictions, monetary policy is already testing its outer limits,
to the point of stretching the boundaries of the unthinkable. In others, policy rates
are still coming down. Fiscal policy, after the post-crisis expansion, has been
throttled back, as sustainability concerns have mounted. And fiscal positions are
deteriorating in EMEs where growth is slowing. What, then, should be done now,
besides redoubling reform efforts to strengthen productivity growth?

BIS 85th Annual Report

21

For fiscal policy, the overriding priority is to make sure that sovereign debt is
on a sustainable path, which in many cases it is not (Chapter III). This is the
precondition for lasting monetary, financial and macroeconomic stability. And it is
also what defines the near-term room for manoeuvre. When longer-term growth
prospects are in doubt, it would be highly imprudent to push for more expansionary
fiscal policies – a mistake made often enough in the past. For countries that do have
fiscal space and need to use it, the challenge is how to do so most effectively. This
means, first and foremost, facilitating private sector balance sheet repair, supporting
reforms that boost long-term productivity growth and a greater but judicious
emphasis on investment at the expense of current transfers. The quality of public
spending matters more than its quantity.
For monetary policy, there is a need to fully appreciate the risks to financial and
hence macroeconomic stability associated with current policies. True, there is great
uncertainty about how the economy works. But precisely for this reason it seems
imprudent to push the burden of tackling financial stability risks entirely onto
prudential policies. As always, the correct calibration will be country-specific. But, as
a general rule, a more balanced approach would mean attaching more weight than
hitherto to the risks of normalising too late and too gradually. And, where easing is
called for, the same should apply to the risks of easing too aggressively and
persistently.
Given where we are, normalisation is bound to be bumpy. Risk-taking in
financial markets has gone on for too long. And the illusion that markets will remain
liquid under stress has been too pervasive (Chapter II). But the likelihood of
turbulence will increase further if current extraordinary conditions are spun out.
The more one stretches an elastic band, the more violently it snaps back. Restoring
more normal conditions will also be essential for facing the next recession, which
will no doubt materialise at some point. Of what use is a gun with no bullets left?
Therefore, while having regard for country-specific conditions, monetary policy
normalisation should be pursued with a firm and steady hand.
All this naturally puts a premium on strengthening prudential safeguards
(Chapter VI). Macroprudential tools should be applied with vigour, but without
entertaining unrealistic expectations about what they can do on their own. Where
appropriate, balance sheet repair should be pursued energetically, through loss
recognition and recapitalisations. And the regulatory initiatives under way should be
implemented promptly and comprehensively. In particular, the recalibration of the
banks’ leverage ratio is critical as a means of providing a reliable backstop for the
risk-weighted minimum capital requirements. Likewise, it will be essential to set a
tough standard for interest rate risk in the banking book at a time when nominal
interest rates have been so exceptionally low for so long.

Conclusion
The global economy is growing again at rates not far from the historical average.
Lower oil prices should boost it further in the near term even as they temporarily
put further downward pressure on prices. But not all is well. Debt burdens and
financial risks are still too high, productivity growth too low and room for
manoeuvre in macroeconomic policy too limited. Global economic expansion is
unbalanced. Interest rates that have been extraordinarily low for exceptionally long
are the outward sign of this malaise.
Nothing is inevitable about this. The problems we face are man-made and can
be solved by the wit of man. This chapter has provided one possible diagnosis out
of the many on offer: our view is that the current plight reflects, to a considerable

22

BIS 85th Annual Report

extent, the inability of policy frameworks to come to grips with the global
economy’s “excess financial elasticity” – its propensity to generate hugely damaging
financial booms and busts. These leave enduring and deep wounds in the economic
tissue that, unless properly treated, impede the economy’s return to a healthy and
sustainable expansion – one that does not set it up for the next disruptive cycle. In
the long term, this risks entrenching instability and chronic weakness.
One may disagree with this diagnosis. It is harder, though, to disagree with the
general principle of being prudent whenever diagnoses are uncertain. Prudence
means following a treatment that allows for the possibility of error. From this
perspective, current macroeconomic policy frameworks appear too one-sided.
When all is said and done, they are still based on the presumption that inflation will
suffice as a reliable gauge of sustainability or, if it will not, that financial stability
risks can be adequately addressed through prudential policies alone. This is a
familiar viewpoint: caveats aside, it harks back to the pre-crisis way of doing things.
A more balanced approach would have a number of features. It would seek to
address financial booms and busts through a combination of policies – monetary,
fiscal and prudential – rather than prudential policy alone. It would rebalance the
mix away from demand management policies, especially monetary policy, towards
structural measures. And it would not presume that, if one’s own house is in order,
the global village will be too.
Shifting the focus from the short to the longer term is more important than
ever. Over the past decades, it is as if the emergence of slow-moving financial
booms and busts has slowed down economic time relative to calendar time: the
economic developments that really matter now take much longer to unfold.
Meanwhile, the decision horizons of policymakers and market participants have
shortened. Financial markets have compressed reaction times and policymakers
have chased financial markets more and more closely in what has become an ever
tighter, self-referential, relationship. Ultimately, it is this combination of slowing
economic time and shorter decision horizons that helps explain where we are – and
how, before we know it, the unthinkable can become routine. It should not be
allowed to.

II. Global financial markets remain dependent on
central banks

During the period under review, from mid-2014 to end-May 2015, accommodative
monetary policies continued to lift prices in global asset markets. Investors’ risktaking remained strong as expectations of policy rate increases were pushed out
further and additional asset purchases undertaken. As a result, bond prices
climbed, equity indices repeatedly hit new highs and prices of other risky assets
also rose. Moreover, global investors’ exposure to riskier assets continued to
increase.
As central banks remained in easing mode, bond yields in advanced economies
continued to fall throughout much of the period under review. In a number of
cases, bond markets entered uncharted territory as nominal bond yields fell
below zero for maturities even beyond five years. This was mainly due to
falling term premia, but also reflected downward revisions of expected future policy
rates. Towards the end of the period, bond markets – in particular in Europe – saw
sharp yield reversals as investors became increasingly uneasy about stretched
valuations.
Signs of market fragility were evident more widely too. Bouts of volatility
occurred with increasing frequency across markets, and signs of illiquidity in fixed
income markets began to appear. As market-makers have scaled back their
activities after the Great Financial Crisis, asset managers have become more
important as sources of liquidity. Such shifts, in combination with increased official
demand, may have reduced liquidity and reinforced liquidity illusion in certain bond
markets.
Expectations of increasingly divergent monetary policies in the United States
and the euro area resulted in widening interest rate differentials, and, as a result, the
dollar soared and the euro plummeted. In addition to these outsize exchange rate
swings, foreign exchange markets saw big rate moves more generally. These included
the surge of the Swiss franc following the Swiss National Bank’s discontinuation of
its minimum exchange rate against the euro, and rapid depreciation of currencies
for a number of energy-producing countries.
In parallel with the dollar’s surge, oil prices fell sharply in the second half of
2014 before stabilising and recovering somewhat in the second quarter of 2015.
Although the oil price drop was particularly severe, commodity prices declined
more generally. The rapid price moves in commodity markets reflected a
combination of weak demand, in particular from EMEs, and, in the case of oil,
stronger supply. But they may also have reflected increased activity on the part of
financial investors in commodity markets, as these markets are becoming a more
integral part of global financial markets more broadly, as well as rising indebtedness
in the energy sector.
The first section of this chapter describes the main developments in global
financial markets between mid-2014 and end-May 2015. The second focuses on the
extraordinarily low yields in government bond markets. The third section explores
rising fragilities in financial markets, with emphasis on risks of liquidity illusion in
fixed income markets. The final section discusses the growing linkages between
commodities – in particular oil – and financial markets.

Further monetary accommodation but diverging outlook
Increasing macroeconomic and monetary policy divergence during the past year
set the scene for global financial markets. The United States, in particular, continued
to recover while the euro area, Japan and a number of emerging market economies
(EMEs) faced weakening growth prospects during much of the period under review
(Chapter III). Against this backdrop, actual and expected monetary policy moves
diverged. The US Federal Reserve ended its large-scale asset purchase programme
and continued to take gradual steps to prepare markets for an eventual increase in
the federal funds target rate. Still, as global disinflationary pressures grew, largely
due to falling oil prices, the vast majority of central banks eased policy (Chapter IV).
As a result, US forward interest rates diverged from forward rates elsewhere,
especially vis-à-vis the euro area (Graph II.1, left-hand panel).
The renewed wave of monetary accommodation supported prices across asset
classes. As near zero interest rate expectations were pushed out further and additional
asset purchases undertaken, yields on government bonds fell to record lows in a
number of advanced economies (Graph II.1, centre panel). Moreover, a growing share
of sovereign debt traded at negative yield levels (see discussion below). The fall in
euro area bond yields that had begun in 2014 accelerated in early 2015 as the ECB
launched its expanded asset purchase programme. As a result, 10-year government
bond yields in Germany fell to levels as low as 7.5 basis points in April 2015. Those for
a number of other euro area countries, including France, Italy and Spain, also reached
record lows. Even in Japan, where bond yields have been exceptionally low for many
years, 10-year bond yields reached a new trough of 20 basis points in January 2015.
However, a sharp global yield reversal in late April and May 2015 suggested that
investors had viewed some of the previous declines as excessive.
Much of the decline in yields that took place up to April 2015 reflected falling
term premia (see below). Expectations that near zero policy interest rates would

remain in place for longer than previously anticipated also played a role, especially
at shorter maturities. Central bank purchases of government bonds added to the
downward pressure on premia and yields, as did the move by some central banks
to negative policy rates. Expectations that the Federal Reserve was inching closer to
its first rate hike kept the level of US bond yields somewhat higher than in several
other advanced economies. But US yields nevertheless continued to fall at a
moderate pace throughout the second half of 2014 and into early 2015 before the
decline was halted (Graph II.1, centre panel).
In parallel with the drop in bond yields, investors continued to exhibit a strong
search for yield. As a result, equity prices rose to record highs in many markets
(Graph II.1, right-hand panel), even as the macroeconomic outlook remained
relatively weak (Annex Table A1). Although EME equity markets were generally less
buoyant, there were exceptions: the Shanghai Composite index surged by 125%
during the period under review, despite mounting reports of a slowing Chinese
economy. As valuations became increasingly stretched, equity prices underwent a
few sharp but brief corrections in late April and May 2015.
Signs of stronger risk-taking were evident in market prices as well as in
quantity-based indicators. Global P/E ratios continued on an upward trek that had
started in 2012, which brought them above the median value both for the past
decade and since 1987 (Graph II.2, left-hand panel). In the syndicated loan market,
the share of leveraged loans, which are granted to low-rated and highly leveraged
borrowers, rose to almost 40% of new signings in April and May 2015 (Graph II.2,
centre panel). And the share of those loans featuring creditor protection in the form
of covenants stayed very low (Graph II.2, right-hand panel).
Global investors’ increased exposure to riskier asset classes was also evident in
EME corporate bond markets. Corporations in EMEs have issued growing amounts
of debt in international markets at progressively longer maturities since 2010
(Graph II.3, left-hand panel). At the same time, the debt servicing capacity of EME

corporate bond issuers has deteriorated. In particular, the leverage ratio of EME
corporations has been increasing fast to reach the highest level in a decade,
exceeding that of advanced economy corporations, both for entities issuing
internationally and for those financing themselves in domestic debt markets
(Graph II.3, centre panel). Despite the strong issuance and increased riskiness of
EME corporate bonds, investors have generally not pushed up their required risk
premium (Graph II.3, right-hand panel).
Outsize exchange rate moves during the past year were a key manifestation of
the substantial influence of monetary policy on financial markets. The US dollar
experienced one of the largest and fastest appreciations on record, surging by
around 15% in trade-weighted terms between mid-2014 and the first quarter of
2015 before stabilising (Graph II.4, left-hand panel). At the same time, the euro
dropped by more than 10%. Reflecting divergent monetary policy stances, the
widening interest rate differential between dollar and euro debt securities
increasingly encouraged investors to move into dollar assets, seemingly playing a
bigger role than in the past (Graph II.4, centre panel). This underscores the growing
importance of policy rate expectations for exchange rate developments.
As exchange rates became increasingly sensitive to monetary policy expectations,
equity prices became more responsive to exchange rate movements. This was
particularly so in the euro area, where since 2014 a statistically significant relationship
has emerged between returns on the EURO STOXX index and the euro/US dollar
exchange rate. Specifically, a 1% depreciation of the euro has, on average, coincided
with a rise in equity prices of around 0.8% (Graph II.4, right-hand panel). No such
relationship had been apparent previously, from the introduction of the euro.

a misalignment between conditions in the physical market and in

benchmarks (Graph II.A, left-hand panel).

The parallel between conventional assets and oil extends also to the futures curve. For a conventional asset, the
difference between spot and futures prices (the so-called basis) is determined by the cost of carry (largely a function
of interest rates), and by the stream of dividends and interest payments that the asset yields. Oil generates no cash
stream, but agents attach a premium to holding it physically because of its value for production and consumption
rather than on paper – the so-called convenience yield. The convenience yield is unobservable, and varies over time
according to the conditions of the underlying physical market: at times of tightness, the convenience yield would be
high, as agents attach a high value to holding a scarce resource. By contrast, the convenience yield could even turn
negative when supply is abundant in the physical market and inventories are high: in such a situation, holding
physical oil is not advantageous, as slack in the physical market would ensure easy access to the resource in case of
need. So, while the oil futures curve is normally negatively sloped (backwardation) due to a positive convenience
yield, its slope can turn positive (contango) at times of inventory overhang. It is therefore no surprise that the futures
curve currently slopes upwards (Graph II.A, right-hand panel).
An important consequence of the presence of a convenience yield is that it would be wrong to interpret a
positively (or negatively) sloped supply curve as evidence of bullish (or bearish) expectations. The price of any

30

BIS 85th Annual Report

futures contract will indeed include a component reflecting expectations, but this is likely to be concealed by
changes in the convenience yield. As argued above, when markets are tight, the high convenience yield is likely to
produce a negatively sloped futures curve in spite of expectations of continued tightness, ie high prices. By contrast,
slack in the physical market will produce a positively sloped supply curve which does not signal bullish expectations,
but simply abundant physical supply.
Since futures and physical prices are jointly determined, price movements are driven by changes in current and
expected conditions in the physical markets. Due to the high liquidity of futures markets, such changes will be
quickly processed and incorporated in observed prices. Thus, as for other assets, changes in expectations are the
key driver of price movements. The recent fall in the price of oil is no exception. While prices started to decline in
June 2014, the fall accelerated substantially in mid-November, when OPEC announced that it would not reduce its
output. This is a significant deviation from OPEC’s strategy to achieve stable prices, and is likely to have substantially
changed agents’ expectations of prospective supply conditions.
The overall macroeconomic environment, which largely influences expectations of demand and supply of oil
over time, is therefore a key driver of oil price fluctuations. Furthermore, prices will also reflect risk perceptions
and attitudes, which will in turn depend on financing conditions. As a result, monetary policy is itself an important
driver of oil prices. Loose monetary policy may boost oil prices through expectations of higher growth and inflation.
Moreover, easy financing conditions will reduce the cost of holding inventories and carrying speculative positions.

  In practice, a number of factors prevent instantaneous arbitrage of price misalignments, both real (eg access to storage) and financial
(eg market liquidity or agents’ indebtedness). For a detailed discussion, see M Lombardi and I van Robays, “Do financial investors
destabilize the oil price?”, ECB Working Papers, no 1346, June 2011.      This point is developed in L Kilian, “Not all oil price shocks are
alike: disentangling demand and supply shocks in the crude oil market”, American Economic Review, vol 99, June 2009.      For a detailed
discussion of monetary policy transmission to commodity prices, including alternative channels, see A Anzuini, M Lombardi and
P Pagano, “The impact of monetary policy shocks on commodity prices”, International Journal of Central Banking, vol 9, September 2013.

This was the largest and fastest oil price drop since the one around the time of the
Lehman Brothers collapse. The fact that non-energy commodity prices also declined
– albeit by much less than oil – indicated that at least part of the oil price drop
reflected broader macroeconomic conditions, including weaker growth prospects in
EMEs. However, the sharp decline was also due to market-specific factors (see Box
II.A and the last section in this chapter). Particularly important was the November
2014 OPEC announcement that its members would not reduce their output despite
falling prices.
With oil and other energy commodities hit especially hard, the energyproducing sector came under intense pressure as its profit outlook plunged. As a
result, energy firms’ stock prices fell sharply and corporate bond yields soared
compared with other sectors, before recovering as oil prices stabilised and bounced
back in early 2015 (Graph II.5, centre panel). Given the rapid growth of the energy
sector’s share in corporate bond markets in recent years (see discussion below), the
surge and subsequent fall in energy bond yields strongly influenced corporate
credit spread movements more broadly (Graph II.5, right-hand panel).

Bond yields drop into negative territory
A striking development during the past year was the rapidly rising incidence of
negative-yielding nominal bonds, even at long maturities. This occurred as several
central banks, including the ECB, introduced negative policy rates (Chapter IV). At
their lowest, around mid-April 2015, German and French government bond yields
dropped below zero for maturities up to nine and five years, respectively (Graph II.6,
left-hand panel). In Switzerland, where the National Bank cut its policy rate to
−0.75% after discontinuing the exchange rate floor against the euro, the
government yield curve sank below zero for maturities even beyond 10 years

(Graph II.6, centre panel). In Denmark and Sweden, where policy rates were pushed
below zero, the domestic yield curves became negative out to about five years. With
short-term rates already at record lows in many economies, such yield movements
meant a further massive flattening of yield curves up to early 2015 (Graph II.6, righthand panel).
As the decline in yields gathered pace during late 2014 and early 2015,
investors became increasingly uneasy about stretched valuations. This made bond
markets ripe for a sudden reversal, which materialised at the end of April and in
May 2015 (Graph II.1, centre panel). The surge in yields was particularly strong in the
euro area. German 10-year bond yields, for example, rose from their record lows
below 10 basis points in the second half of April to above 70 basis points in midMay, and other euro area countries saw similar increases. Bond yields outside
Europe also rose, although to a generally smaller extent.
Pronounced declines in term premia played a key role in the fall in yields seen
up to late April 2015. A decomposition of 10-year US and euro area bond yields into
expectations of future interest rates and premia components shows that, between
mid-2014 and April 2015, the estimated term premium fell by 60 basis points in the
United States and by 100 basis points in the euro area (Graph II.7, left-hand panels).
In the case of the United States, this was partly offset by a rise in the expectations
component of about 15 basis points. This increase, in turn, was entirely due to higher
expected real interest rates (plus 40 basis points), consistent with expectations of a
relatively imminent lift-off of US policy rates, whereas expectations of lower inflation
had a counteracting effect (minus 25 basis points; Graph II.7, top right-hand panel).
As fluctuations in the expectations component in the euro area were not statistically
significant, the drop in the term premium accounted for the entire fall in bond
yields there (Graph II.7, bottom panels).
No doubt, central bank asset purchases played a key role in the decline of term
premia and yields, reinforcing the effects of lower expected policy rates. This was
especially the case in the euro area (see discussion below). Moreover, the timing of
the shifts indicates that the effect of these purchases spilled over to the US bond

market, as investors chasing higher yields moved into US Treasuries (see also
Chapter V).
The impact of the ECB’s expanded asset purchase programme on euro area
interest rates was clearly visible. Both the programme’s announcement on
22 January 2015 and the start of the purchases on 9 March 2015 generated large
price swings. The two events shifted the term structure of three-month Euribor
futures downwards by up to 18 basis points, roughly corresponding to a ninemonth postponement of the expected interest rate lift-off (Graph II.8, first panel). In
addition, the two events pushed down 10-year German and French government
bond yields by over 30 basis points.
Lower term premia influenced other long-duration assets, beyond those
directly targeted by the purchases. EONIA overnight index swap (OIS) rates fell by
23 and 28 basis points for 10- and 30-year maturities, respectively (Graph II.8,
second panel). Moreover, even though the ECB’s expanded purchases targeted only
official sector securities, yields on euro area AAA-rated corporate bonds dropped

across the entire maturity spectrum, and more strongly for longer-duration bonds,
as investors intensified their search for yield (Graph II.8, third panel).
The effects of central bank purchases were perhaps most obvious in the price
reaction of euro area inflation-linked bonds. As the Eurosystem was getting closer
to implementing its asset purchases, euro area break-even inflation rates rose
significantly. Much of this increase was a direct consequence of the purchase
programme rather than of higher inflation expectations: inflation swap rates rose
much less, and survey measures of expected inflation remained stable. In fact, the
spread between inflation swap rates and the corresponding break-even inflation
rates can be viewed as an indicator of the liquidity premia in the two markets
relative to nominal bonds. The typically positive spread between the two moved
sharply lower, dropping 40 basis points into negative territory at the five-year
maturity (Graph II.8, last panel). This suggests that in anticipation of the ECB
purchases – which were explicitly announced to include index-linked bonds –
investors sharply reduced their required liquidity premia on these securities, thereby
pushing real yields down much more than nominal yields. This is in line with the US
evidence on the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities (TIPS).
Central bank asset purchases have reinforced the growing weight of official
holdings in government bond markets. Such holdings have increased considerably
post-crisis in major economies’ government debt markets, especially for securities
denominated in reserve currencies (see also Chapter V). Domestic central banks
account for the lion’s share of the increase. Between 2008 and 2014, their share
of the amount outstanding increased from almost 6% to more than 18%, or from
$1.0 trillion to around $5.7 trillion, based on data for the United States, the euro

area, United Kingdom and Japan (Graph II.9, left-hand panel).1 The share of holdings
by the foreign official sector has remained more stable, increasing from just above
20% to almost 22%, but the increase in absolute amounts has been sizeable, from
$3.7 trillion to $6.7 trillion. On top of their holdings of government securities, official
institutions have also purchased significant amounts of other debt securities. The
Federal Reserve’s holdings of US agency debt securities, for example, increased by
over $1.7 trillion between 2008 and 2014, while foreign official holdings declined
somewhat (Graph II.9, right-hand panel).
The downward pressure on bond yields exerted by central banks and other
official institutions has been reinforced by investor behaviour. In part, investors’
actions have reflected a search for yield. As bond yields further out along the
maturity spectrum dropped below zero in a number of economies, investors sought
still-positive yields in longer-dated bonds at the expense of duration risk. In some
cases, their search for safety may also have played a role: benchmark euro area
yields have tended to fall whenever concerns about the situation in Greece have
intensified. And, in the background, financial regulatory reforms as well as greater
demand for collateral in financial transactions have generally favoured holdings of
sovereign bonds.

Part of these increases is due to valuation effects, as in some cases sources report market value and
in others face value.

BIS 85th Annual Report

In addition, investors’ hedging behaviour has been at work. Institutions such as
pension funds and insurance companies have been under pressure to hedge the
longer duration of their liabilities induced by the drop in yields. As they have sought
to match the increased duration of their liabilities through purchases of long-term
swaps, they have put additional downward pressure on yields and further intensified
the demand for long-term fixed rates. Such behaviour highlights that institutional
mandates could help generate self-reinforcing spirals in an environment where
yields have been continuously pushed lower by a combination of central bank
action and investor responses.
As yields dropped further below zero, concerns grew about the impact of
negative rates on financial market functioning. Thus far, where negative policy
rates have been imposed, these have been transmitted to money markets without
major disruptions. Negative yields further out along the term structure in part
reflect expectations that negative rates will prevail for some time. The longer
the negative rate environment persists, the more likely it is that investors may
change their behaviour, possibly in ways that are detrimental to financial market
functioning.
Potential vulnerabilities can arise if institutional arrangements create a
discontinuity at zero interest rates. There are several such examples. For instance,
yields on most European constant net asset value funds turned negative in the first
quarter of 2015, testing the effectiveness of new contractual provisions that prevent
the funds from “breaking the buck”. Moreover, in some market segments, negative
interest rates can complicate hedging. Some instruments, such as certain floating
rate notes, set a zero floor for interest payments, either explicitly or implicitly.
Hedging such instruments, or securities that depend on their cash flows, becomes
problematic as standard interest rate swaps pass through negative interest
payments, thereby creating a cash flow mismatch. A similar discontinuity arises if
banks are unwilling to pass on negative yields to their depositors, effectively
exposing themselves to additional risk if interest rates were to move further into
negative territory. Chapter VI provides a more detailed analysis of the impact of
negative interest rates on financial institutions.

Rising volatility puts the spotlight on market liquidity
In the past year, volatility in global financial markets began to rise from the
unusually low levels that prevailed in mid-2014 (see last year’s Annual Report),
spiking a few times (Graph II.10, left-hand and centre panels). The spikes, which
followed years of generally declining volatility, often reflected concerns about the
diverging global economic outlook, uncertainty about the monetary policy stance
and fluctuations in oil prices. Investors also began to demand higher compensation
for volatility risk. In particular, after narrowing until mid-2014, the gap between
implied volatility and expectations of realised volatility (“volatility risk premium”) in
the US equity market started to widen (Graph II.10, right-hand panel).
As risky assets such as equities and high-yield bonds were hit during these
bouts of volatility, investors flocked to safe government bonds, sending their yields
to new lows. The easing actions of central banks helped to quickly quell such spikes.
Nevertheless, nervousness in financial markets seemed to return with increasing
frequency, underscoring the fragility of otherwise buoyant markets.
A normalisation in volatility from exceptionally low levels is generally welcome.
To some extent, it is a sign that investors’ risk perceptions and attitudes are becoming
more balanced. That said, volatility spikes induced by little new information about
economic developments highlight the impact of changing financial market
characteristics and market liquidity.

There are two aspects to market liquidity. One is structural, as determined by
factors such as investors’ willingness to take two-way positions and the effectiveness
of order-matching mechanisms. This type of liquidity is important in quickly and
efficiently dealing with transitory order imbalances. The other reflects one-sided,
more persistent order imbalances, as when investors suddenly all head in the same
direction. If investors persistently underestimate and underprice this second aspect,
markets may appear liquid and well functioning in normal times, only to become
highly illiquid once orders become one-sided, regardless of structural features.
In the wake of the financial crisis, specialised dealers, also known as marketmakers, have scaled back their market-making activities, contributing to an overall
reduction in the liquidity of fixed income markets. For example, the turnover ratio
of US Treasuries and investment grade corporate bonds, calculated as the ratio of
primary dealers’ trading volume to the amount outstanding of respective securities,
has been on a declining trend since 2011. Some of the drivers for this retrenchment
are related to dealers’ waning risk tolerance and reassessments of business models
(Box VI.A). Others have to do with new regulations, which are aimed at bringing the
costs of market-making and other trading-related activities more into line with the
underlying risks and those they generate for the financial system. Finally, increasing
official sector holdings of government securities may also have contributed to lower
market liquidity.
Changes in market-makers’ behaviour have had varying effects on the liquidity
of different bond market segments. Market-making has concentrated in the most
liquid bonds. For example, market-makers in the United States have trimmed their
net holdings of relatively risky corporate bonds while increasing their net US
Treasury positions (Graph II.11, left-hand panel). At the same time, they have cut

the average size of relatively large trades of US investment grade corporate bonds
(Graph II.11, centre panel). More generally, a number of market-makers have
become more selective in offering services, focusing on core clients and markets.
As a result, there are signs of liquidity bifurcation in bond markets. Market
liquidity has increasingly concentrated in the traditionally most actively traded
securities, such as the government bonds of advanced economies, at the expense of
less liquid ones, such as corporate and EME bonds. For example, the bid-ask spread
of EME government bonds has remained high since 2012, with a large spike during
the taper tantrum (Graph II.11, right-hand panel).
Even seemingly very liquid markets, such as the US Treasury market, are not
immune to extreme price moves. On 15 October 2014, the yield on 10-year US
Treasury bonds fell almost 37 basis points – more than the drop on 15 September
2008 when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy – only to rebound by around
20 basis points within a very short period. These sharp moves were extreme relative
to any economic and policy surprises at the time. Instead, an initial shock was
amplified by deteriorating liquidity when a material share of market participants,
who had positioned themselves for a rise in long-term rates, tried to quickly exit
their crowded positions. Automated trading strategies, especially high-frequency
ones, further boosted the price swings.
Another key change in bond markets is that investors have increasingly relied
on fixed income mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as sources of
market liquidity. Bond funds have received $3 trillion of investor inflows globally
since 2009, while the size of their total net assets reached $7.4 trillion at the end of
April 2015 (Graph II.12, left-hand panel). Among US bond funds, more than 60% of
inflows were into corporate bonds, while inflows to US Treasuries remained small
(Graph II.12, centre panel). Moreover, ETFs have gained importance in both
advanced economy and EME bond funds (Graph II.12, right-hand panel). ETFs

A key question for policymakers is how to dispel liquidity illusion and support
robust market liquidity. Market-makers, asset managers and other investors can
take steps to strengthen their liquidity risk management and improve market
transparency. Policymakers can also provide them with incentives to maintain
robust liquidity during normal times to weather liquidity strains in bad times – for
example, by encouraging regular liquidity stress tests. When designing stress tests,
it is important to take into consideration that seemingly prudent individual actions

may in fact exacerbate one-sided markets, and hence the evaporation of liquidity, if
they imply similar positioning by a large number of market participants. Finally, it is
vital that policymakers improve their understanding of liquidity amplification
mechanisms and investor behaviour, especially in relatively illiquid markets.

What drives co-movements in the oil price and the dollar?

The sharp appreciation of the US dollar and the rapid fall in the oil price are two of the most noteworthy market
developments of the past year. As argued in this chapter, diverging monetary policies played a key role in the
dollar’s strength, whereas a combination of increasing supply, falling demand and market-specific factors were
important in explaining the oil price drop. It is less clear, however, to what extent the two phenomena are linked.
This box discusses some of the possible links.
The relationship between the trade-weighted US dollar exchange rate and the price of crude oil has changed
over time (Graph II.B, left-hand panel). Evidence from before the 1990s points to a positive correlation. The reason is
unclear. One argument is that oil exporters spent a large share of oil revenues on US goods, which had a tendency
to improve the US trade balance, and hence to boost the dollar exchange rate, when oil became more
expensive. Accordingly, as the share of oil producers’ imports from the United States declined relative to the US
share in their oil exports, this channel became less potent. Another possible explanation is that a worsening
economic outlook in the United States would typically result in a weaker currency and a lower demand for oil. This
channel, too, would have become weaker as the US share in global output declined.

Since the early 2000s, a stronger US dollar exchange rate has gone hand in hand with a lower oil price, and
vice versa (Graph II.B, left-hand and centre panels). The prominent role of the US dollar as invoicing currency for
commodities is one possible explanation: oil producers outside the United States may adjust the dollar price of oil in
order to stabilise their purchasing power. At the same time, increasing investment activity in oil futures and options
may also play a role. The monetary policy stance of the Federal Reserve or flight to safety episodes that naturally
influence the US dollar exchange rate may also affect financial investors’ risk-taking, prompting them to move out
of oil as an asset class when the US dollar becomes a safe haven currency and into oil when they are willing to take
on more risk. Consistent with this view, the right-hand panel of Graph II.B illustrates the increasingly strong negative
relationship between oil prices and financial investors’ risk aversion, as measured by the VIX index.
Another financial channel could reflect the attributes of oil as both the main source of income and an asset
backing the liabilities of oil producers. For example, when the oil price stayed high, EME firms borrowed, sometimes
heavily, to invest in oil extraction, with oil stocks acting as implicit or explicit collateral in these debt contracts. As

BIS 85th Annual Report

41

access to credit and collateral prices are closely linked, the fall in oil prices eroded oil producers’ profits and
simultaneously tightened their financing conditions. This would induce firms to hedge or cut their dollar liabilities,
thereby increasing the demand for dollars. The strong negative relationship between oil prices and spreads on highyield debt of oil producers is consistent with this view.

liquidity, reduce price volatility, and more generally improve the price formation
mechanism, at least in normal times. On the other hand, investors’ decisions are
subject to rapidly shifting expectations about price trends and fluctuations in risk
appetite and financing constraints. This may induce them to withdraw from the
market at times of losses and heightened volatility (Graph II.13, right-hand panel).
Bigger and more liquid commodity futures markets mean that commodity
prices tend to react more quickly and strongly to macroeconomic news. Changes
in commodity investor sentiment often seem to be largely driven by the general
macroeconomic outlook, rather than by commodity-specific factors. This could
also explain the recent stronger co-movements in commodity and equity prices.
The extent to and speed with which arbitrage opportunities can be exploited
between the physical and futures markets are critical to price formation. They
influence the degree to which fluctuations in futures prices transmit to the
prices commodity producers charge and, vice versa, the degree to which changes
in the consumption and production of a given commodity are reflected in futures
prices (Box II.A).

Physical and futures prices of oil co-move closely

BIS 85th Annual Report

Oil producers’ easier access to financing has sharply boosted indebtedness in
the sector. The persistently high prices recorded over recent years made it profitable
to exploit alternative sources of oil, such as shale oil and deep-water sources. To
reap hefty expected profits, oil firms boosted investment, in many cases through
debt. The amount outstanding of bonds issued by US and EME energy firms,
including oil and gas companies, has more or less quadrupled since 2005, growing
at a much faster pace than in other sectors (Graph II.14, left-hand and centre panels).
After the recent sharp oil price fall, the oil sector’s high indebtedness has
exacerbated the rise in financing costs. Indeed, energy firms’ bond yields soared
when oil prices plummeted (Graph II.5, left-hand and centre panels). And bond
yields of US energy firms in the high-yield segment, which had normally been lower
than those of other sectors, rose well above them (Graph II.14, right-hand panel).
High indebtedness may, in addition, have amplified the oil price drop. As oil
prices fell, energy firms’ refinancing costs rose and their balance sheets weakened.
Rather than cutting back production, some firms may have tried to preserve cash
flows by boosting output and/or selling futures in an attempt to lock in prices. In
line with this, oil production in the United States, including shale oil extraction,
remained strong as oil prices fell, leading to a rapid build-up in the levels of crude
oil in US storage up to the first quarter of 2015.3

III. When the financial becomes real

Plummeting oil prices and a surging US dollar shaped the global macroeconomic
environment in the year under review. These large changes in conditions in key
markets caught economies at different stages of their business and financial cycles.
Supported by falling energy costs, the business cycle upswing in the advanced
economies continued. The shift in exchange rates dampened US growth while
aiding a return to growth in the euro area. Although financial conditions eased
further in the countries hardest-hit by the crisis, the shadow of the pre-crisis
financial boom lingered on. The resource misallocations linked to the past rapid
credit expansion continued to hold back productivity growth. The legacy of high
public debt limited governments’ fiscal room for manoeuvre, while ageing societies
further complicate the adjustments necessary to make fiscal positions sustainable.
In several respects, conditions were quite different in many emerging market
economies (EMEs) that had been less affected by the crisis. Falling commodity
export revenues and rising costs of servicing dollar debt coincided with slowing
growth and peaks in domestic financial cycles. In the past, the combination of
slowing growth and maturing credit booms in EMEs often ended in serious financial
stress, especially when global financial conditions were tight. Better macroeconomic
management and more robust financial structures, including longer debt maturities
and reduced exposure to currency risk, have increased resilience. But higher overall
private sector debt, both loans from the domestic banking system and capital
market finance from abroad, could offset the gains from a sounder debt structure.
This chapter begins by reviewing the shifting growth patterns over the past
year. It then assesses the long-lasting impact of earlier financial booms on growth
in advanced economies and concludes by examining financial vulnerabilities in EMEs
in the light of recent financial booms and slowing growth.

Shifting growth patterns
Over the past year, the global economy grew at close to its long-term average rate.
World GDP expanded by 3.4% in 2014 (Annex Table A1), roughly in line with the
average since 1980. However, this figure masks significant shifts in growth
momentum across countries.
The upswing in the advanced economies continued (Graph III.1, left-hand
panel). Further expansion in the United States and the United Kingdom contrasted
with a return to modest growth in the euro area and a gradual recovery in Japan. The
US economy grew by 2.4% in 2014, supported by rapidly declining unemployment.
Output contracted in the first quarter of 2015, in part due to weaker exports. Output
in the euro area expanded by 0.9% in 2014, and forecasters expect the recovery to
gain pace in 2015. Growth returned to Spain and Portugal, and the Italian economy
is expected to pick up in 2015. Japanese consumption dropped markedly after the
April 2014 sales tax increase. Other advanced economies grew by an average 2.4%,
albeit with widening differentials across countries.
Economic activity in EMEs lost further momentum. Growth weakened by
around 0.3 percentage points to 4.9% in 2014, with the trend continuing into 2015.
But again, this hides significant cross-country differences. Private demand growth in
China slowed further, in part due to a softer real estate sector. This contrasted with

accelerating activity in India and Korea. Growth in most other Asian EMEs slowed in
2014 but is expected to pick up in 2015. The Brazilian economy contracted in the
second half of 2014, even as most other Latin American economies performed better.
Growth in central and eastern Europe accelerated by 2 percentage points to 3.1%.
Plummeting oil prices and the US dollar appreciation influenced growth around
the world from mid-2014 onwards. In late May 2015, crude oil prices were 40% lower
in dollar terms year on year (Chapter II). Between July 2014 and April 2015, the
US dollar trade-weighted real exchange rate appreciated by around 10%, while the
euro depreciated by a similar magnitude and the yen by 7.5% (Graph III.1, centre panel).
The macroeconomic impact of these large price swings is yet to fully play out.
Lower oil prices due to increased supply should boost economic activity through
lower input costs and higher real incomes. Indeed, the oil price drop boosted
consumer confidence in major advanced economies and contributed to the recent
increase in consumption in the euro area. By contrast, changes in exchange rates
mainly redistribute growth. US export growth decreased from 4% year on year in
the second quarter of 2014 to 3% in the first quarter of 2015 against the backdrop
of a stronger dollar.
Many EMEs have already felt stronger effects. Economic activity in commodityproducing economies has weakened. Between July 2014 and May 2015, downward
revisions to 2015 growth forecasts were larger for countries more dependent on
commodity exports (Graph III.1, right-hand panel). Lower commodity prices have
led to investment cuts, particularly in the oil and gas sector. Moreover, commodity
exporters have lost fiscal revenues.

In addition, commodity exporters experienced some of the largest real
exchange rate depreciations. This supports exports and could eventually boost
investment in export industries and help rebalance activity. The currencies of most
commodity importers also fell against the US dollar, although not necessarily in
trade-weighted terms. In fact, some economies, particularly in emerging Asia, saw
real exchange rate appreciations, which depressed net exports.
The broad US dollar appreciation has also increased the costs of servicing
dollar debt. Dollar credit outside the United States has increased markedly in recent
years, to $9.5 trillion by the end of 2014 (Chapter V). While more than half of this
debt is owed by borrowers resident in advanced economies, residents in EMEs have
borrowed more than $3 trillion. The importance of currency mismatches in EMEs is
explored in more detail in this chapter’s final section.
The shift in growth patterns caught economies at different stages of the
financial cycle.1 In many of the economies that experienced a home-grown bust,

While there is no consensus definition of financial cycles, they are generally measured by the comovement of a broad set of financial variables. The most parsimonious representation is in terms
of credit and property prices, but other measures of risk-taking may add further information. The

financial cycles are turning up again. Both credit and property prices rebounded in
the United States (Graph III.2). In the United Kingdom, credit to the private sector
continued to fall but property prices grew vigorously. Credit also continued to fall
in Greece, Italy and Spain, although the decline in property prices slowed or, in the
case of Spain, reversed.
Unusually accommodative global monetary and financial conditions have
fuelled financial booms in many of the smaller advanced and emerging market
economies that were relatively unscathed by the Great Financial Crisis (Chapter V).
Some of these booms are now showing signs of peaking. Real credit growth slowed
in many EMEs, including many emerging Asian economies as well as Brazil and
Turkey. In addition, property prices are signalling the turning of financial cycles in
several economies. This is particularly evident in China, where residential property
prices declined by nearly 7% over the past year in real terms (Graph III.2, bottom
panel). Residential property prices also declined in Mexico, and their growth rate
has weakened substantially in Brazil – a sign that the financial booms are maturing.
By contrast, weaker commodity prices have not yet dented the financial booms in
Australia, Canada and Norway, which experienced strong credit and property price
growth over the past four quarters.
The current configuration of business and financial cycles poses different
challenges for advanced economies and many EMEs. For the former, in particular the
countries at the centre of the crisis, the issue is how to ensure healthy long-term
growth without a new credit boom-bust cycle. For the latter, the key is how to ensure
financial and economic stability amidst weaker growth and peaking financial booms.

Growth and the financial cycle in the advanced economies
The interaction between the financial cycle, on the one hand, and aggregate
demand and production, on the other, goes some way towards explaining the
lacklustre recovery in many advanced economies in recent years (see also the 84th
Annual Report).
Financial cycles affect spending directly through both debt service burdens
and the impact of leverage (Box III.A). During financial booms, increases in asset
prices boost the value of collateral, making borrowing easier. At the same time,
more debt means higher debt service burdens, especially if interest rates
increase, which constrains spending. As long as asset prices keep rising,
leverage-financed spending may offset this effect, but once the financial boom
runs out of steam, falling asset prices raise leverage and thus make it more
difficult for households and firms to borrow, compounding the drag from higher
debt service burdens. After a financial bust, it takes time for spending to
normalise. Even if interest rates fall quickly, as in 2008–09, high debt keeps debt
service burdens up. And depressed asset prices generate credit constraints that
ease only gradually. In fact, the interaction of leverage and debt service burdens
explains the evolution of US spending in the aftermath of the Great Financial
Crisis fairly well.
Overall, at the current stage of the financial cycle, financing constraints seem
to be of minor importance for corporate investment. Instead, recent BIS research
suggests that the cross-country pattern mostly reflects high uncertainty about the
interactions between these variables can have major macroeconomic consequences. For instance,
banking crises or periods of considerable financial distress often follow financial-cycle peaks, as
confirmed in many countries by the Great Financial Crisis. See BIS, 84th Annual Report, Chapter IV,
for further elaboration.

BIS 85th Annual Report

Box III.A

Financial cycles and the real economy

The financial cycle has shaped the evolution of many economies both before and after the Great Financial Crisis.
Recent work casts further light on some of the underlying dynamics, highlighting two variables: aggregate leverage
(the stock of credit relative to asset prices) and debt service burdens (interest payments plus amortisations relative
to income). While the impact of leverage has been widely explored, the role of the debt service burden has not
received much attention, despite sizeable negative effects on private sector expenditure growth.
Two long-run relationships between credit, GDP, asset prices and interest rates tie down aggregate leverage
and the aggregate debt service burden. First, a relationship between the credit-to-GDP ratio and real asset prices
anchors aggregate leverage. This relationship works through collateral constraints: in the long run higher real asset
prices support a higher credit-to-GDP ratio. A second long-run relationship exists between the credit-to-GDP ratio
and interest rates. For the same amount of income, higher levels of debt can be carried when interest rates are
lower. This relationship defines the sustainable level of the debt service burden.
Deviations from the long-run anchors of leverage and the debt service burden influence output significantly.
Developments in the United States around the Great Financial Crisis are an example. In the early 2000s, asset prices
were high and interest rates were low relative to outstanding debt levels, allowing households and corporates to
borrow more. Asset prices outpaced credit growth, keeping aggregate leverage well below long-run values
(Graph III.A, left-hand panel). This provided ample room for more credit, which also raised expenditure. But this
boost was gradually offset by a growing negative drag on disposable income from increasing debt service burdens.
This explains why output in the mid-2000s grew at around average, despite rapidly expanding credit. When the
financial boom ran out of steam and asset prices began to fall, aggregate leverage increased strongly, constraining
the private sector’s borrowing capacity. This depressed expenditure even further, leading to a severe recession.
Monetary policy responded by lowering interest rates, which gradually fed into lower debt service costs, reducing
the drag on demand.
The dynamics of adjustment to deviations of leverage and the debt service burden from their long-run values
embedded in this simple model do a surprisingly good job of matching the evolution of economic activity in the
United States during the Great Recession and after. Even when the model is estimated only up to the fourth

long-run relationship with real asset prices. Debt service burden: debt service payments to income relative to long-run values, measured by
deviations of the credit-to-GDP ratio from the long-run relationship with nominal lending rates. 2 The simulated path is based on a
cointegrated VAR model estimated on data from Q1 1985 to Q4 2004. This sample also provides the reference point for the long-run

the other variables are initially at their average levels. It then traces out the adjustment path back to equilibrium without any further shocks.

and, in the United States, high levels of share buybacks also point to accommodative
financial conditions for the corporate sector.3 That said, firms in some countries,
most notably smaller firms in the euro area, still find access to bank credit more
restrictive than pre-crisis, although this constraint eased during the period under
review.4

Credit boom-induced resource misallocations stifle productivity
More fundamentally, earlier financial booms may still weigh on long-term growth
prospects through their damaging effect on productivity growth. Financial booms
typically go hand in hand with significant resource misallocations (Box III.B). In
particular, labour is diverted to booming sectors with relatively low future
productivity growth. Preliminary estimates suggest that the misallocation during the
credit boom between 2004 and 2007 reduced annual labour productivity growth
by around 0.2 percentage points in the United States, 0.4 percentage points in Italy,
around 0.7 percentage points in Spain and around 1 percentage point in Ireland
compared with a counterfactual in which credit to GDP grew at its 1994–2004
country-specific average (Graph III.3, left-hand panel).
The impact of these misallocations became even larger in subsequent years,
once the boom turned to bust. Similar estimates suggest that productivity growth in
2008–13 would have been approximately 1.8 percentage points higher in Ireland,
1.2 percentage points higher in Spain, 0.5 percentage points higher in France and
0.4 percentage points higher in the United States, had the pre-crisis credit-to-GDP
ratio grown at its 1994–2004 rate (Graph III.3, right-hand panel). Thus, the fallout
from credit booms may well have exacerbated the trend decline in productivity
growth in advanced economies (see the 84th Annual Report). By the same token,
lower productivity growth in recent years need not be permanent.5

Ageing is not just an issue for advanced economies, however. In an increasing
number of EMEs, ageing populations will weigh on growth and public finances.
Between 1990 and 2014, the rapidly expanding working age population accounted
for around one third of GDP growth in the United States and European Union, and
for significantly more in Latin America (Graph III.4, right-hand panel). By contrast,
between 2014 and 2040 its projected decline will lower GDP growth every year, by
around 1 percentage point in Japan and around 0.5 percentage points in the
European Union, emerging Europe and China.
Sustaining economic growth in the face of population ageing poses formidable
challenges for policymakers. A wide range of measures can mitigate the ageingrelated decline in the workforce. Labour participation, especially in older age
categories and among women, can still increase. Given that jobs now tend to be
less physically demanding, there is room for longer careers. In addition, structural
reforms that directly address the decline in trend productivity growth, ranging from
lighter regulation to better education, could enhance the quality, and hence
productivity, of the labour force (see the 83rd Annual Report, Chapter III).

How strong are EMEs?
On the surface, the current configuration of credit booms, downward growth
revisions and tighter dollar funding conditions looks similar to that which preceded
previous episodes of serious financial stress in EMEs. However, a proper assessment
of potential vulnerabilities should also take into account the important changes that
have taken place in EMEs in recent years, strengthening their resilience.

52

BIS 85th Annual Report

While past EME financial crises were quite diverse, they shared some common
elements.8 First, they followed periods of upbeat investor sentiment that turned
into gloom when a change in external conditions exposed weaknesses in underlying
growth models. Second, a combination of loose financial conditions in advanced
economies and insufficient exchange rate flexibility had contributed to overly
accommodative domestic monetary and financial conditions and real exchange rate
appreciations. This in turn had helped stoke asset price booms and a surge in credit,
much of it short-term and denominated in foreign currency. Third, the interaction
of disappointing growth and fragile debt structures turned what might have been a
cyclical slowdown into a financial crisis, with serious economic and social costs.
Exchange rates came under huge pressure. When countries devalued, high foreign
currency debt magnified the burden on borrowers. At the same time, short debt
maturities forced countries into large and immediate adjustments to meet debt
service obligations. Questions about the private and government sectors’ ability to
honour their debts paralysed capital markets and economic activity. Finally, crises
triggered severe contagion to other EMEs.
How does the current situation compare with that prevailing before previous
episodes of stress? Developments in the real economy and financial vulnerabilities
more specifically are considered in turn.

Disappointment risk
EMEs have experienced one of the longest high-growth spells on record. Since
2002, output has expanded by an average of over 6% per annum (Graph III.5, lefthand panel). The rate was close to 10% for China, around 6% for emerging Asia
excluding China, and 3.5% in Latin America and central and eastern Europe. The
Great Recession interrupted the growth spurt only briefly, with the notable
exception of some central and eastern European countries. Growth fell to 3% in
2009 but bounced back to 9% in 2010. Since then, however, growth has declined
gradually, albeit with significant cross-country variation.
Some moderation from these very high rates is probably unavoidable. But a
slowdown could cast doubt on EMEs’ underlying economic strength for at least
three reasons. First, high commodity prices or strong capital inflows may have led
to overly optimistic estimates of potential output. Second, the resource misallocations
that can arise during financial booms could have weakened productivity. Third,
the heavy debt service burdens from credit booms can weigh on medium-term
growth.
Disappointing growth was key in both the Latin American debt crisis of 1982
and the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98. Both followed a strong growth spell that
came to a halt earlier than many had expected. In Mexico and Chile, as well as in
most other Latin American countries, growth had relied heavily on commodity
production and ran out of steam once the terms of trade dropped and interest rates
rose rapidly in the early 1980s. In Asia, growth had been heavily geared towards
manufactured goods exports and real estate. To some extent, the boom faltered
when deteriorating terms of trade exposed the low profitability of much of the
investment.
Then, as now, rapid growth coincided with financial booms, fuelled by large
capital inflows and accommodative monetary policy both domestically and abroad
(see also Chapter V). The past 10 years have seen the largest gross foreign

investment as a percentage of the recipient economy’s GDP in over a century, higher
than those before the 1982 debt crisis or the Asian financial crisis (Graph III.5, righthand panel). These inflows have fuelled domestic credit and asset price booms
(Graph III.5, left-hand panel). Since 2004, real credit has grown by around 12% per
year and real property prices have increased by around 40% on average.
Rising commodity prices and domestic financial booms have undoubtedly
boosted output, but it would be unwise to treat these effects as permanent. Higher
interest rates in the advanced economies, in particular in the United States, could
quickly feed into higher domestic rates in EMEs and tighter domestic financial
conditions, for example by reducing investors’ incentives to reach for yield (see
Chapter V for a discussion of international policy spillovers). And the oil price
collapse has shown how quickly conditions in commodity markets can change.
Estimates of the difference between actual and potential output (“output
gaps”) that correct for the cyclical effect of higher commodity prices and capital
flows illustrate this point. They indicate that traditional measures could have
overestimated potential output by around 2% on average across Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Mexico and Peru since 2010 (Graph III.6, left-hand panel) Therefore,
reversals in these factors could well result in disappointing growth outcomes.
The financial booms of the last 10–15 years could also weigh on growth in the
medium term. Historically, credit booms and real exchange rate appreciation in
EMEs have coincided with resource shifts from the tradable to non-tradable sectors.
For instance, during the late-1970s boom the non-commodity tradable sector grew
only half as fast as GDP in Mexico and Chile. When the commodity boom ended,
the non-commodity tradable sector was small and hence unable to absorb the
resources shed by the contracting sectors. Such resource misallocations can
substantially weaken productivity growth and require painful adjustment.
Real trade-weighted exchange rates also appreciated visibly during the recent
boom, although with significant variation across countries (Graph III.6, right-hand
panel). Between early 2009 and mid-2013, the median real effective exchange rate
relative to historical averages in EMEs increased to its highest level in three decades.

However, it has since fallen to a level close to its long-term average. Whether this
indicates that a correction has already happened or heralds further exchange rate
shifts is not clear.

Financial vulnerabilities
Without the amplification through financial channels, the underlying weaknesses in
EMEs in Latin America in the early 1980s or Asia in the 1990s would not have
resulted in severe crises. Large debts and fragile financial structures made them
vulnerable to external and internal shocks. When growth slowed and global financial
conditions tightened, it became increasingly difficult to refinance this debt, often
exposing vulnerabilities in domestic banking sectors.
The short maturity and currency denomination of debt magnified these
problems. When the countries eventually devalued, soaring debt burdens in
domestic currency terms challenged the ability of the private and/or government
sectors to honour their debts. The need to repay external lenders in foreign
currency triggered balance of payments crises. In addition, tighter external financing
conditions and a plunging exchange rate generated a domestic credit crunch,
which also affected sectors without any currency mismatches.
Today, high debt has raised the vulnerability of EMEs. The combined debt of
the government and non-financial private sectors is around 50% higher in relation
to GDP than at the time of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 (Graph III.7, left-hand
panel). Government debt has fluctuated around 45% of GDP since the mid-1990s,
whereas credit to the private non-financial sector increased from around 60% of

GDP in 1997 to around 120% in 2014. The role of EME banks’ cross-border funding
in this boom has been limited, declining from around 9% of GDP before the Asian
financial crisis to around 5% in 2014.
Early warning indicators of banking stress point to risks arising from strong
credit growth (Annex Table A4). Credit gaps – the deviation of private sector credit
from its long-term trend – are well above 10% in countries as diverse as Brazil,
China, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. In the past, two thirds of all readings
above this threshold were followed by serious banking strains in the subsequent
three years.9 True, despite rapid credit growth, low interest rates have kept debt
service ratios around their long-term level in most countries, albeit with some
notable exceptions. Households and firms in Brazil, China and Turkey spend
significantly more on servicing their debt than in the past. But, more generally, an
increase in interest rates would push up debt service ratios in other countries as
well, especially in Asia.
By contrast, the risks arising from foreign currency debt appear to be somewhat
lower. On average, the ratio of foreign currency cross-border bank borrowing and
international debt securities to GDP has decreased relative to 1997 (Graph III.7,
centre panel). This has been driven by a decline in the ratio of cross-border bank
loans, from over 10% of GDP to around 6% in 2014. Excluding China, foreign
currency debt is currently around 14% of GDP, compared with nearly 20% in 1997.

much larger effect after a financial crisis hits the economy (solid red line vs dashed red line in Graph III.B.2). In
this case, past misallocations generate a significant and long-lasting drag on aggregate productivity growth (a
10 percentage point cumulative shortfall after five years). In the US case, for instance, our estimates suggest that the
labour reallocations over the period 2004–07, interacting with the following financial crisis, shaved US productivity
growth by 0.45 percentage points every year between 2008 and 2013. Thus, financial booms can lead to stagnant
productivity as a result of the interaction between resource misallocations and financial crises that they induce.

consequences”, mimeo, 2015.

Similarly, government debt structures have become less fragile. Governments
increasingly issue bonds in local markets (Graph III.7, right-hand panel). As a result,
the share of international debt securities has decreased from around 40% of the
total in 1997 to around 8% in 2014.
That said, this does not insulate economies from foreign influences. For one,
local currency long-term interest rates in EMEs tend to co-move closely with
those in the major reserve currencies (Box V.C in Chapter V). In fact, the share of
domestic government debt held by foreign investors has surged from around 9% in
2005 to over 25% on average in EMEs. In Mexico, Indonesia, Poland and Peru, this
share is over 35%. Large portfolio reallocations could lead to large swings in asset
prices.
Moreover, risks from currency mismatch, mainly from corporate borrowing,
remain in some countries despite the overall decline in EME foreign currency debt.
Foreign currency debt in the form of debt securities and cross-border bank lending
is in the region of 30% of GDP in Hungary, Chile and Turkey, with between a third
and a quarter in banks (Graph III.8, left-hand panel), but is also relatively high in
Peru, Mexico, Poland, the Czech Republic and Korea. It is unclear to what extent this

gives rise to currency mismatches, as data on financial hedges are patchy. Much of
the foreign currency debt securities issuance by EME non-financial corporations has
been by firms producing tradable goods (Graph III.8, right-hand panel), which may
have foreign currency revenues that provide a natural hedge for their foreign
currency obligations.
But natural hedges may not be that effective if export revenues drop when the
currency of denomination strengthens, as is often the case for commodity revenues.
And financial hedges may also be vulnerable at times of very large exchange rate
changes. For instance, many EME corporates suffered heavy foreign exchange losses
in the aftermath of the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008, partly because of the popularity
of contracts that left them exposed to big currency moves.10
Finally, the shift of private borrowing from banks to markets has uncertain
consequences. Banks still account for the bulk of domestic lending, but their share
in cross-border lending has fallen significantly since the Great Financial Crisis
(Graph III.9, left-hand panel). In contrast, amounts outstanding of private sector
debt securities from EMEs increased to over 3% by early 2015 (Graph III.9, centre
panel), although with great variation across countries. In addition, non-financial
firms issued debt securities worth 2% of GDP through their offshore affiliates
(Graph III.9, right-hand panel). On the one hand, this shift has reduced rollover risk.
The share of debt securities with a remaining maturity of less than one year is now
around 10%, compared with 60% for cross-border bank debt. The share of shortterm bank debt is particularly high in China. On the other hand, the behaviour of
footloose investors may amplify price dynamics under stress (see below).

Lines of defence
Since the late 1990s, EMEs have worked hard to strengthen various lines of defence
to limit the risk of financial stress and manage it more effectively if it arises.
A first possible line of defence against external crises is larger private sector
asset holdings abroad. Foreign assets held by the private sector in EMEs increased
from around 30% of GDP in the mid-1990s to around 45% by 2014 (Graph III.10,
left-hand panel). However, liquidating private sector external assets in times of
stress may be difficult in practice. First, assets and liabilities are usually held by
different people. Second, assets may be illiquid. Finally, foreign asset holdings may
be adversely affected by the very same market conditions that trigger stress.
Perhaps the most visible line of defence is official foreign exchange reserves,
which have risen massively. Official reserves in EMEs increased from around 10% of
GDP in the mid-1990s to around 30% in 2014, although they have declined slightly
more recently. To be sure, reserve holdings vary greatly across countries. For
example, Saudi Arabia currently has around 100% of GDP in official reserves; China,
Peru, Malaysia, Thailand and Hungary between 30 and 45%; Chile, Mexico, India,
Turkey and South Africa between 10 and 20%; and Argentina around 5%. Still,
reserve holdings generally exceed short-term liabilities. In addition, they have been
complemented on an ad hoc basis by central bank foreign exchange swap lines and
by other facilities, such as the IMF’s Flexible Credit Line.
While such larger war chests no doubt provide considerably more protection
than in the past, there are still questions about how effectively they can be
deployed. In particular, it can be challenging to channel official reserves to the right

places to plug liquidity gaps in the private sector. Moreover, authorities may be
reluctant to intervene for a variety of reasons, including a desire to avoid setting the
wrong incentives or being seen to run out of ammunition too quickly.
More fundamentally, greater macroeconomic flexibility from improvements in
policy frameworks should have increased EMEs’ resilience. On the monetary side,
the shift from policy frameworks centred on fixed exchange rates to inflation
targeting should give additional scope to better manage credit booms and
associated vulnerabilities. More flexible exchange rates also increase a country’s
ability to adjust to changes in the economic environment. Over the past year some
EMEs, especially in Latin America, have experienced very large exchange rate
depreciations without this triggering a crisis.
Even so, these changes have not fully insulated countries from external
developments. As discussed in Chapter V, exchange rate flexibility has only partially
shielded EMEs from monetary policy spillovers in advanced economies. And the
recent experiences of Brazil and Turkey, both of which raised policy rates at a time
of slowing activity, illustrate the constraints on domestic monetary policy in the face
of large capital outflows related to the tightening of monetary policy in advanced
economies.
The capacity of fiscal policy to absorb shocks appears limited. Fiscal deficits are
larger than in 2007 (Graph III.10, right-hand panel). Moreover, the median general
government financial deficit of 1.5% of GDP in 2014 masks significant differences:
Brazil and India have budget deficits of more than 6% of GDP. And financial booms
are likely to have flattered public accounts. As discussed in more detail in last year’s

BIS 85th Annual Report

61

Annual Report, this reflects an overestimation of potential output and growth, the
revenue-rich nature of financial booms and the build-up of contingent liabilities
that may need to be addressed in the bust. The experience of countries such as
Spain and Ireland, whose fiscal positions looked deceptively strong ahead of the
Great Financial Crisis, is a clear case in point.

Financial and real contagion
Today, EMEs are much more integrated into the global economy and financial
system than before. Therefore, any serious financial strains, were they to materialise,
would have larger repercussions globally than in the past.
Past financial crises in EMEs triggered widespread contagion. First, global
investors withdrew from countries that shared some of the characteristics of the
countries at its epicentre. For example, in 1997 the spectre of the crisis spread from
Thailand to Indonesia, and then to Malaysia, the Philippines and Korea. Second,
common lenders transmitted strains. For example, in the Latin American debt crisis
contagion spread through the US banking system, which was heavily exposed to the
region.
It is not yet clear to what extent changes in financial structure have changed
the potential for contagion. The growing presence of regional banking in Asia today
could have increased the likelihood of direct contagion in the region. Between 2007
and 2014, the share of banks in Asia and the Pacific in international claims on
emerging Asia increased from around a third to nearly three fifths, while that of
euro area banks declined to 15%, less than half its 2007 level. By contrast, there is
some evidence from the “taper tantrum” that global investors in emerging markets
have become more discriminating (see the 84th Annual Report, pp 29–30). This
should reduce contagion from perceived – rather than actual – similarities. However,
investors might differentiate less during a broader retrenchment.
One key change is the increased importance of actions by asset managers and
investors in EME bond funds. The shift from bank lending to market finance and the
associated longer maturities, along with the higher share of domestic currency debt,
mean that some risk has moved from debtors to creditors. There is evidence that
both asset managers and the ultimate owners of the assets tend to behave in a
correlated manner, buying when prices go up and selling when they fall, limiting
the benefits of a more diversified investor base (Chapter VI).11 Collective action
problems with diverse investors may also make it harder for policymakers to stem
large withdrawals than in the case of withdrawals by international banks.
More importantly, contagion need not be confined to other EMEs: the 1982
Latin American debt crisis led to significant problems in the US banking system.
Today, borrowers from EMEs account for 20% of the foreign exposures of BIS
reporting banks (on a consolidated, ultimate risk basis) and for 14% of all
outstanding debt securities. Any losses on these exposures are bound to have
important consequences for at least some large creditors. Similarly, EMEs make up
20% of the market capitalisation of the MSCI Global, a broad equity index.
Furthermore, the effects would not be limited to financial channels. EMEs have
been the main drivers of global growth in recent years, quite unlike in previous
periods. They account for approximately half of world GDP in PPP terms, compared
with around one quarter at the time of the Latin American debt crisis, and a third
before the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Their contribution to global growth has

September 2014, pp 19–34.

BIS 85th Annual Report

increased from around 1 percentage point in the 1980s to over 2 points since the
early 2000s. The collapse of global trade between 2008 and 2009 by more than
20% clearly illustrates how financial crises can affect real economic activity.
Taken together, there are a number of reasons to believe that EMEs are more
resilient today than in the 1980s and 1990s: macroeconomic frameworks are
sturdier; exchange rate flexibility has increased; financial system infrastructure is
more robust and prudential regulation more stringent. The lines of defence are
stronger, most visibly in the growth of foreign exchange reserves. And the
development of local currency bond markets has reduced government overreliance
on foreign currency debt.
Yet some other developments call for caution. Credit has grown very rapidly,
often exceeding levels that have been followed by serious banking strains in the
past. And a solid macroeconomic performance may not insulate EMEs from foreign
shocks. Foreign currency debt levels are lower relative to GDP, but concentrated in
the corporate sector, where currency mismatches are harder to measure. Mobilising
reserves effectively to counter liquidity shortages in specific sectors or support
domestic currencies may prove challenging. Finally, the shift from bank finance to
foreign asset managers may have altered market dynamics in ways that are not well
understood.

IV. Another year of monetary policy accommodation

Monetary policy continued to be exceptionally accommodative over the past year.
Many authorities eased further or delayed tightening. Central bank balance sheets
remained at unprecedentedly high levels; and they grew even larger in several
jurisdictions where the ultra-low policy rate environment was reinforced with large
purchases of domestic and foreign assets.
Monetary policies in the major advanced economies diverged, as the US
economy strengthened relative to the euro area and Japan. But sharp declines in
the prices of oil and other commodities and continued weakness in the growth of
wages heightened concerns about the persistence of below-target inflation and at
times even the dangers of deflation.
The differing cyclical positions of the major advanced economies and the
associated exchange rate shifts complicated policy choices for other advanced
economies as well as for emerging market economies. Inflation outturns were quite
diverse: many central banks were combating low inflation while a smaller number
faced the opposite problem. The deviation of inflation from expected levels and
questions surrounding the supposed drivers of price changes underscored
uncertainties about the inflation process. For some economies, the strong
appreciation of their currencies against the euro and the yen reinforced growing
disinflation pressures. The reduction in policy rates, in a few cases to negative levels,
further raised financial vulnerabilities. The lower bound for policy rates, and
financial stability considerations, limited the scope for further easing.
Another year of exceptionally expansionary monetary policy raises the question
of whether existing policy frameworks are fit for their intended purpose. Historically
high debt levels and signs of financial imbalances point to an increasing tension
between price stability and financial stability. Against the backdrop of divergent
monetary policies, the risk of competitive easing should not be underestimated (see
also Chapter V).
This chapter first reviews the past year’s developments in monetary policy. It
then assesses what is known and what is not known about the inflation process and
explores the degree to which monetary policy frameworks could be adjusted to
more systematically incorporate financial stability considerations.

Recent monetary policy developments
Monetary policy remained exceptionally easy in most economies in the period
under review. The sharp drop in oil prices, alongside smaller declines for other
commodity prices, pushed down inflation (Graph IV.1, left-hand panel). Lower
inflation and the slowdown in economic activity led most central banks to cut
policy rates (Graph IV.1, centre panel). Central bank balance sheets in the aggregate
continued to grow in domestic currency terms and were around record highs in
US dollar terms despite the dollar’s appreciation (Graph IV.1, right-hand panel). A
small number of emerging market economies raised rates, some to fight sharp
depreciation pressures on their currencies.
The divergence of policy trajectories in the major advanced economies was
a prominent theme during the year. The Federal Reserve kept its policy rate

inflation in many economies. Forward curves for policy rates indicated that markets
expected this highly unusual environment to persist for quite some time.
Central banks outside of the major advanced economies were left to factor
these very accommodative, but increasingly divergent, monetary policies into
their own policy decisions. The divergence raised the spectre of sharp shifts in
exchange rates. At the same time, the drop in commodity prices lowered inflation
pressures around the globe. Against this backdrop, most central banks eased policy
(Graph IV.3, left-hand panel). As a result, policy rates generally continued to be well
below historical norms and even negative in several economies (Graph IV.3, righthand panel).
The reasons behind the policy decisions varied. Many central banks eased
policy aggressively given concerns about very low inflation or deflation, or exchange
rate developments. In particular, the central banks of Denmark, Sweden and
Switzerland pushed down their policy rates well into negative territory. The negative
rate in Denmark helped ease pressure on its exchange rate peg to the euro. The
Swiss National Bank abandoned its exchange rate floor against the euro when its
balance sheet approached 90% of GDP; the negative policy rate helped mitigate
the impact of the appreciation pressures on the currency.
With inflation and its policy rate around zero, the Czech National Bank
reiterated its commitment to an accommodative stance and to maintaining its
exchange rate floor until the second half of 2016. The central banks in Hungary and
Poland eased policy as they experienced deflation despite strong real economic
activity. The Bank of Thailand reduced its policy rate as inflation turned negative,
and the Bank of Korea cut its policy rate to a historical low as inflation fell towards
zero.
Central banks in a number of commodity exporting economies also cut policy
rates. Among them, the central banks in Australia, Canada and Norway eased as
inflation declined along with commodity prices, even though core inflation
remained close to target. They also faced the prospect of weaker economic activity
as commodity-producing sectors were adversely affected, despite some offset from
currency depreciation. The central banks of New Zealand and South Africa
tightened policy in mid-2014 in response to higher inflation prospects; thereafter,

deleveraging has progressed in some economies, but in others, housing prices
and debt remain very high and in many cases have grown further. Post-crisis
developments in credit and asset prices have featured prominently in central bank
communications, and many central banks have highlighted the risk that low policy
rates might contribute to the build-up of financial imbalances. Overall, however,
short-term macroeconomic factors have been the dominant justification for policy
decisions; financial developments have been far less prominent.

What drives inflation?
In many economies, inflation fell during the past year from already low levels. These
recent changes in headline inflation largely reflected volatile fluctuations in oil and
food prices and exchange rates, factors that are often considered short-term (or
proximate) drivers of inflation. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices,
has been relatively low for some time, which raises important questions about the
effects of other drivers of inflation, namely the medium-term (or cyclical) and longterm (or secular) drivers. Despite decades of research and experience, the inflation
effects of the cyclical and secular drivers remain much less clear than those of the
proximate drivers.

Proximate drivers
The short-term effect of commodity prices and exchange rates on inflation is
generally well understood. Energy is given a large weight in the consumer price
index (CPI) of various countries, so changes in energy prices have a strong and

BIS 85th Annual Report

69

immediate impact on headline inflation. The price of energy can change markedly
over short periods, as it did in the past year. Changes in food prices tend to be
less volatile but can still have a significant effect, especially in emerging market
economies, where food accounts for a larger share of the basket of goods and
services that make up the CPI.
The degree to which changes in commodity prices pass through to other prices
has declined over time. In the 1970s and 1980s, for example, increases in oil prices
led to price increases for other goods, thereby tending to raise core inflation and
inflation expectations. In the past two decades, however, these so-called “secondround” price effects on core inflation have become much more muted (Graph IV.5,
left-hand panel) even as the effect of commodity prices on overall inflation has
grown (Graph IV.5, centre panel).
Changes in exchange rates are also an important proximate driver of headline
and core inflation. Imported items, or those that are subject to international
competition, represent a large share of CPI baskets. Because the price of many of
these items is set in global markets, changes in the exchange rate affect domestic
costs.
Despite the increasing share of tradable items in the CPI over the past couple
of decades, exchange rate pass-through to both headline and core inflation has
declined (Graph IV.5, right-hand panel). Several factors appear to have contributed
to this decline. One is better-anchored inflation expectations. With inflation low and
stable, firms and households are less likely to expect central banks to accommodate
exchange rate movements that would lead to persistent deviations of inflation from
target. Evidence points to some additional factors that may be reducing the pass-

through effect of exchange rate changes: the advent of integrated supply chains,
which give multinational firms a greater ability to absorb exchange rate changes;
easier access to cheaper hedging; and a shift in the composition of imports towards
items, such as manufactured goods, whose prices display a lower pass-through.

Cyclical drivers
The relationship between inflation and the business cycle, captured by measures
of economic slack such as the unemployment gap, rests on strong theoretical
foundations. However, the empirical relationship is generally far weaker and has
been evolving along with changes in the global economy and financial system. For
example, the post-crisis behaviour of inflation highlights the sometimes tenuous
link between inflation and economic slack. Inflation was stronger than expected in
2010–11, given the severity of the crisis and the recession-induced excess capacity.
Later on, even as labour markets strengthened and the global economy continued
recovering, core inflation in many advanced and emerging market economies was
either falling or running below central bank objectives.
The weakness of the empirical link between inflation and the business cycle has
a number of explanations. First, spare capacity may be mismeasured, as it is not
directly observed and must be estimated. For example, in the labour market, the
unemployment rate is observable, but cyclical or structural changes in labour force
participation can alter the unobserved effective amount of underutilised labour.
Second, different methodologies and assumptions for estimating economic slack in
the labour market or in the economy as a whole can produce quite different results.
Third, many measures of spare capacity are subject to real-time errors, and so a clear
picture of slack at a given time may become possible only at a much later date.
At the same time, evidence – often underappreciated – increasingly indicates
that inflation now responds less to domestic cyclical activity and more to global
movements than it has in the past. For example, the global output gap (Graph IV.6,
left-hand panel) appears to have become more important in driving inflation. In
fact, the effect of global spare capacity is now estimated to be larger than that of
domestic spare capacity (see the 84th Annual Report).1 Similarly, the post-crisis
share of cross-country inflation explained by a single common factor has increased,
a development seemingly unforeseen in private sector forecasts (Graph IV.6, centre
panel). In other words, global drivers of inflation are apparently becoming more
important, but they are not particularly well understood.
The higher responsiveness of inflation to global conditions reflects several
factors, including the greater integration of product and factor markets. And since
this greater integration can influence the pricing power of domestic producers and
the bargaining power of workers, the effect of global conditions on inflation goes
well beyond their direct impact through import prices.
The effect of common global trends is also visible in labour markets. Domestic
unit labour costs have become more correlated across economies even outside of
recessionary periods (Graph IV.6, right-hand panel). This development is consistent
with evidence that inflation has become less sensitive to changes in spare domestic
capacity or, in other words, with evidence that domestically oriented Phillips curves
have become flatter.
Uncertainty about the link between inflation and domestic spare capacity
suggests greater risks for monetary policymaking: central banks may miscalibrate

their policy if they place too much weight on past correlations that underestimate
the role of global factors.

Secular drivers
Understanding the effects of the secular (or long-term) drivers of inflation is critical
to assessing inflation trends. The main secular drivers are inflation expectations,
wage trends, globalisation and technology. Arguably, these drivers have generally
had a disinflationary impact, although their strength has been subject to considerable
debate. Each of these drivers has been influenced by a range of policy choices and
structural changes.
Inflation expectations have drifted down as monetary policy regimes have
successfully become more focused on inflation control. Indeed, long-term inflation
expectations are now tightly aligned with central banks’ explicit objectives (Graph IV.7,
left-hand panel). The attainment of low, well-anchored inflation expectations has
been seen as a key achievement, especially because they influence longer-run pricing
decisions and contract setting.
Nonetheless, the understanding of what determines inflation expectations is
still incomplete and continues to evolve. For example, a current concern is that
inflation expectations may have become less well anchored, especially in economies
with a policy rate near the effective lower bound, slow growth, and inflation running
persistently below target. In advanced economies, inflation expectations have
seemingly become more sensitive to short-term inflation (Graph IV.7, right-hand
panel). This behaviour appears to be consistent with the research, which generally

finds that while inflation expectations are influenced by central bank objectives, they
are also affected by past inflation. However, this backward-looking element of longterm inflation expectations has historically tended to respond rather slowly to
changes in inflation.
The measurement of inflation expectations is also subject to considerable
uncertainty. Questions remain about whether financial-market-based measures
accurately reflect changing inflation expectations or whether these measures are
distorted by spurious market-specific factors (Chapter II). Moreover, the inflation
expectations of firms and workers are likely to be more relevant in price
determination than those of professional forecasters. Unfortunately, measures for
firms and workers are not always available, and when they are, they often are of
questionable quality and display significant volatility.
Wage trends have also changed over recent decades. For example, the
indexation of wages to inflation is much less prevalent now than it was in the 1970s,
which accounts for some reduction in inflation persistence. Wage dynamics have
also changed as a result of increased labour competition in advanced economies.
The competition initially came from the greater integration of low-cost emerging
market economies (including formerly state-controlled economies) into the global
trading system. The competition spread and intensified as global integration
strengthened and the range of goods and services that could be traded
internationally widened, in part as a result of new technologies (eg via outsourcing).
This partly explains why, for a number of advanced economies, labour’s share of
national income has declined steadily over the past 25 years. More generally,
technological advances that have allowed the direct substitution of capital for

BIS 85th Annual Report

73

labour have played a similar role. Think, for instance, of computers, software and
robotics automating previously manual processes.
The emergence of cheaper competitors has made labour and product markets
much more contestable. Accordingly, the pricing power of the more expensive
producers and the bargaining power of labour have been reduced – disinflationary
forces whose effects go well beyond those suggested by the increase in global trade
and integration. Thus, globalisation and technological change together have
contributed to persistent, if hard to measure, disinflationary tail winds.
In sum, various inflation drivers have been shaping the inflation process in ways
that at times have been difficult to fully understand. The heightened uncertainty
has naturally carried over to inflation forecasting.2 While the quantitative
importance of the proximate drivers of inflation is relatively well understood, they
can change unpredictably. There is considerable uncertainty about the overall
impact of cyclical and secular factors, even as the relevance of global factors is
rising relative to domestic ones. The uncertainties inevitably complicate policy,
especially in frameworks that are tightly defined around inflation targets over short
horizons.

Integrating financial stability concerns into monetary policy
frameworks
The persistence of exceptionally easy monetary policy some eight years after the
eruption of the financial crisis raises questions about its efficacy and, ultimately,
about the suitability of current monetary policy frameworks. To be sure, price
stability remains the cornerstone of monetary policy. However, the nature of the
risks to price stability has been evolving. Worries over high inflation have been
replaced of late with concerns about very low inflation and possibly deflation even
in the context of high and rising debt and frothy asset prices. In this environment,
resolving the tension between price stability and financial stability is the key
challenge if economies are to avoid the problems that arose before the financial
crisis. That is, can central banks preserve price stability while more systematically
accounting for financial stability considerations?
One lesson from the financial crisis is that ignoring the financial cycle can be
very costly. In the run-up to the crisis, credit and asset prices soared even as
inflation remained low and stable. Since the crisis, similar patterns have again
emerged in some economies (Graph IV.8 and Chapter III). The pre-crisis experience
illustrated that financial vulnerabilities can build up even when inflation is quiescent.
Low inflation can provide a false signal of overall economic stability.
Despite the recent experience, the role of financial stability concerns in
monetary policy is still subject to major disagreements. A common view is that
macroprudential policies should be the first line of defence against financial
imbalances; monetary policy should simply be a backstop, responding to financial
stability concerns only after macroprudential policies have done all they can.
This view is supported by a sort of separation principle. Only macroprudential
tools (eg loan-to-value ratios, countercyclical capital buffers, etc) are to be used against
slow-moving financial booms and busts; monetary policy would then be left to focus
on its traditional countercyclical role of managing inflation and business fluctuations.

Many central banks publish ranges around their inflation forecasts, often derived from their
historical forecast errors. These ranges generally suggest odds of only three-in-four that inflation
will be within a 2 percentage point interval at a one-year horizon. At longer horizons, the
uncertainty tends to be even larger.

that the amplitude and length of financial cycles has considerably increased since
then (see the 84th Annual Report). Moreover, the same analysis finds that, after
explicitly accounting for the effect on credit and property prices, monetary policy
has had a reduced effect on output. Together, these findings suggest that a
monetary policy focused on managing near-term inflation and output may do so at
the cost of higher fluctuations in credit and asset prices than in the past.
A common argument against using monetary policy to address financial
stability concerns is the lack of good metrics with which to track the financial cycle

Monetary policy and macroprudential policy: complements or substitutes?

Macroprudential policies aim to (i) strengthen the resilience of the financial system and (ii) mitigate financial booms
and subsequent busts. How well do macroprudential policies interact with monetary policy in addressing the second
of these two concerns?
Both monetary policy and macroprudential policy influence the financial intermediation process, operating on
the assets, liabilities and leverage of intermediaries (Graph IV.A). For instance, both policies can induce a reallocation
of spending over time by influencing the cost and availability of credit for consumers and firms. These policies,
however, differ in scope and impact. Macroprudential policy often targets specific sectors, regions or practices
(eg through loan-to-value limits and debt-service ratio rules), whereas interest rates have a more pervasive impact
on private sector incentives and on the financial system.
An important policy question is whether monetary and macroprudential policies should in general pull in
the same direction (ie as complements) or in opposite directions (ie as substitutes). Some recent discussions
of macroprudential policies treat the two sets of policies as substitutes: while monetary policy is kept loose,
macroprudential policy is invoked to mitigate the resulting financial stability implications, at least for particular
sectors or types of borrowing. But when these policies are pulling in opposite directions, economic agents are
simultaneously facing incentives to borrow more and to borrow less, suggesting tensions in the policy mix. Initial
theoretical research points to monetary and macroprudential policies being best used mainly as complements, not
substitutes, although results can vary by the nature of the adverse development.

used to pull in the same direction, as indicated by the positive correlations reported in Table IV.A. Furthermore, the

and financial stability risks more generally. The problem is indeed serious, but the
past decade has seen considerable progress in devising and improving such metrics.
One practical approach has been to track credit and asset price trends. More
generally, the challenge is not specific to monetary policy. And the very establishment
of macroprudential policy frameworks, in which central banks often play a key role,
is predicated on the presumption that the need for good metrics can be tackled
successfully.
At the same time, the difficulties with the more familiar yardsticks used in the
pursuit of price stability should not be underestimated. Economic slack and inflation
expectations are not observed directly; they have to be estimated, and the estimates
are subject to considerable uncertainty and bias. In fact, recent evidence suggests
that using information about the financial cycle, such as the behaviour of credit and
property prices, can produce better estimates of potential output and underlying
slack in real time than traditional methodologies, which often draw on the behaviour
of inflation (Box IV.C). Indeed, ahead of the financial crisis, the methodologies
widely used in policymaking generally failed to detect that output was above its
sustainable level. Estimates that take the boom in credit and property prices into
account can help to correct this bias.
By the same token, metrics informed by the state of the financial cycle may also
help calibrate monetary policy, even though this will necessarily be a matter of trial
and error. As outlined in Chapter I, a general strategy would call for more deliberate
and persistent monetary policy tightening during financial booms, even if near-term
inflation is low or declining. All else equal, Taylor rules not adjusted for the state of
the financial cycle could set a sort of lower bound, as they have been calibrated
with inflation, not financial imbalances, in mind (Box IV.C). During financial busts,
the strategy would be to ease less aggressively and persistently. The restraint in
easing would reflect the weaker influence of expansionary monetary policy when (i)
the financial system is impaired, (ii) the private sector has taken on too much debt
and (iii) the misallocation of resources accumulated during the boom weighs on

changes in monetary policy rates. Moreover, the output costs associated with policy tightening have generally
fallen, given monetary policy’s more muted impact on real output. Put differently, the results indicate that smoothing
short-term swings in output and inflation now comes at the cost of greater swings in credit and property prices than
in the past.

potential output (Chapters I and III and the 84th Annual Report). And this approach
would also reflect the understanding that forceful easing with limited effectiveness
produces unintended effects on the financial system and the economy, domestically
and internationally (Chapters III, V and VI). Calibration issues would loom large, but
– as in the pursuit of price stability, and especially until sufficient experience is
accumulated – there is no alternative to gradual experimentation.
A more challenging concern is how best to balance the possible trade-offs
between financial stability and macroeconomic stabilisation, ie price stability and
near-term output stabilisation. To some extent, this is an issue of the relevant policy
horizon. Financial vulnerabilities take considerable time to build up. And as
witnessed in the aftermath of the financial crisis, a financial bust has long-lasting
debilitating effects on the macroeconomy, including possibly for inflation. Hence,
extending the horizon beyond the traditional two to three years helps reconcile
financial stability with traditional objectives. After all, financial instability is a
concern precisely because of the damage it imposes on the real economy. Given
the uncertainties embedded in longer-term forecasts, the extension of the horizon
should not be interpreted as extending point forecasts. Rather, it is intended as a
means to examine more systematically the risks to the outlook posed by financial
factors, given their longer fuse.
Even so, when it comes to tolerating deviations of inflation from objectives, the
issue remains, how long is too long? The post-crisis period has shown that persistent
disinflation, and even deflation, can go hand in hand with worrying booms in asset
prices and credit. To be sure, this constellation is by no means unprecedented and
was rather common during the era of the gold standard. Most famously, it prevailed
during the 1920s, ahead of the Great Depression in the United States. But the
constellation was far less common in the post-World War II, inflation-prone period
and emerged again only after inflation came under tighter control.
Two well founded concerns, one specific and one more general, have
discouraged policymakers from tolerating persistent deviations of inflation from
numerical objectives.
The specific concern is deflation risk. Much of the recent policy debate has
been predicated on the assumption that all deflations are pernicious and cause
great economic damage. The sense is that a drop in aggregate prices will likely
trigger a deflationary spiral. Output will fall and – especially if interest rates are
stuck at the zero lower bound – expectations of continued price declines will
raise inflation-adjusted interest rates, further depressing aggregate demand and
output.
However, the historical record on the output costs of deflation is at odds with
this widespread perception. The asserted link between deflation and subpar
economic activity is actually rather weak and derives largely from the unique
experience of the Great Depression. In fact, the evidence suggests that output is
more closely linked to asset prices, especially property prices. Once asset prices are
taken into account, the link between output and price deflation in goods and
services becomes even weaker. In a review of the international experience since

1870, the link is evident only in the interwar years (Graph IV.9, third panel).
Moreover, further analysis indicates that the really damaging interaction has not
been between deflation and debt – so-called debt deflation – but between debt
and declines in property prices.
This record also suggests that the costs of deflation may depend on its drivers.
Deflation may indeed be a sign of sharp and persistent declines in demand, in which
case it would coincide with economic weakness. But if deflation is driven by supplyside improvements, such as globalisation, greater competition or technological
forces, output would tend to rise alongside real incomes, lifting living standards.
And if deflation results from one-off price adjustments, such as a fall in commodity
prices, it is also likely to be transitory.
This analysis indicates that the central bank’s response to deflation risks needs
to consider not only the sources of price pressures, but also the policy’s
effectiveness. Paradoxically, an aggressive response to avert a supply side-driven or
temporary deflation could prove counterproductive in the longer run. It could be
conducive to financial booms whose bust could seriously damage the economy as
well as induce unwelcome disinflation down the road.
The more general concern about inflation deviating from target has to do with
the loss of credibility and, ultimately, with mandates. Persistent deviations of
inflation from the numerical objective may indeed undermine the central bank’s
credibility. If so, then the policy framework should explicitly provide for tolerance of
such deviations when required to achieve longer-term objectives.
Much less clear, however, is whether allowing greater tolerance would require a
reconsideration of mandates, which often are general enough and subject to
varying interpretations. In particular, sustainable price stability, or macroeconomic
stability more broadly, can be thought of as implicitly encapsulating financial stability,
given the huge economic distortions and output losses associated with financial
crises. But if revisiting mandates becomes necessary in some cases, it would need

Measuring potential output using information about the financial cycle

Box IV.C

The concept of potential output refers to the level of output produced when available resources, including labour
and capital, are fully and sustainably employed. Deviations of actual output from potential – the so-called output
gap – gauge the degree of slack in the economy. Potential output, which cannot be observed directly, is typically
estimated with econometric techniques.
The econometric estimation techniques have traditionally relied heavily on inflation: all else equal, the level
of output is seen as consistent with the full employment of labour when inflation does not have a tendency to
rise or fall. Inflation is a key signal of sustainability. Even the potential output measures based on production
functions, such as those calculated by the OECD or the IMF, partly rely on inflation to gauge imbalances in the
labour market.
But the relationship between economic slack and inflation (the so-called Phillips curve) has weakened over
recent decades (see Chapter III of the 84th Annual Report), thereby compromising the usefulness of inflation as an
indicator of potential output. Accordingly, estimates of the output gap that rely on the Phillips curve may prove to
be unreliable. That is, when the data are allowed to speak freely, the information content of inflation may indeed
be quite low. In addition, traditional methods for estimating potential output are plagued by substantial uncertainty
when used in real time, ie they are typically revised heavily as the future unfolds and more data become available.
For example, in the mid-2000s, neither the Phillips curve approach nor the OECD’s full production-function approach
found that US output was at that time above potential; they reached that finding only later, when models were reestimated with more data (Graph IV.C, first and second panels).
The pre-crisis experience suggests that measures of financial imbalances could be helpful in identifying
potential output. After all, even though inflation remained generally subdued, credit and property prices grew at
unusually strong rates, sowing the seeds of the subsequent crisis and recession. Indeed, BIS research has found that
including information about the financial cycle can yield more reliable measures of economic overheating. Such
“finance-neutral” output gaps would, for instance, have indicated in real time that output was above potential in the

mid-2000s in the United States, and such estimates would have been subject to smaller revisions as new data
became available (Graph IV.C, third panel).
Reliable real-time estimates of the output gap would be useful to monetary policymakers, as economic slack
plays a key role in policy setting. Consistent with its diagnosis of output being above potential, the finance-neutral
output gap points to higher Taylor-implied policy rates during the run-up to the Great Financial Crisis (Graph IV.C,
last panel).

  The point is further developed in C Borio, P Disyatat and M Juselius, “A parsimonious approach to incorporating economic information

in measures of potential output”, BIS Working Papers, no 442, February 2014. The analysis finds that, under various model specifications,
the contribution of inflation to the output gap is low unless strong prior information is included.      C Borio, P Disyatat and M Juselius,

to be done with great care, as the process could lead to political economy pressures
with unwelcome results.
This suggests that the first priority should be (i) to use the existing room for
manoeuvre as much as possible and (ii) to build a constituency for a more
systematic incorporation along the lines described above. In time, further and more
fundamental adjustments to monetary policy frameworks could be considered.
On balance, arguments against incorporating financial stability considerations
more systematically into monetary policy are based on valid concerns but are not
fully convincing. In particular, the arguments tend to overestimate how much is
known about the inflation process and to underestimate how much has been learned
about financial instability. They may also tend to put too much faith in the ability of
monetary policy to influence, and even fine-tune, inflation relative to its ability to
influence financial, and hence macroeconomic, stability over the medium term.
If the ultimate criterion for a successful monetary policy is to promote
sustainable economic growth and, in the process, help avoid major macroeconomic
damage, then a rebalancing of policy priorities towards greater attention to
financial stability would seem justified. The rebalancing would also take monetary
policy closer to its historical origin and function.3 The challenges involved should
not be underestimated. They raise tough questions. But relying exclusively on
macroprudential tools to address financial instability may not be sufficiently prudent.

V. The international monetary and financial system

The suitable design of international monetary and financial arrangements for the
global economy is a long-standing issue in economics. Putting in place mechanisms
that facilitate the achievement of sustained, non-inflationary and balanced growth
has proved elusive. In the wake of the Great Financial Crisis, the issue has again
gained prominence on the international policy agenda.
Just as in the past, however, there is little agreement on what the key
shortcomings of the current international monetary and financial system (IMFS) are,
let alone on what to do about them. A common diagnosis has been that the system
is unable to prevent the build-up of unsustainable current account imbalances and
that this, in turn, has induced a contractionary bias: surplus countries have no
incentive to adjust, while deficit countries are forced to do so. Indeed, current
account imbalances have been a focus of G20 cooperative efforts.
This chapter provides a different perspective, by arguing that the main
shortcoming of existing arrangements is that they tend to compound the weaknesses
of domestic monetary and financial frameworks (“regimes”). In particular, the IMFS
tends to heighten the risk of financial imbalances – that is, unsustainable credit and
asset price booms that overstretch balance sheets and can lead to financial crises
and serious macroeconomic damage. These imbalances occur simultaneously
across countries, deriving strength from global monetary ease and cross-border
financing. Put differently, the system exhibits “excess financial elasticity”: think of an
elastic band that can be stretched out further but that, as a result, eventually snaps
back all the more violently.1
The chapter is structured as follows. After outlining the key features of the
IMFS, the first section explains and documents how the interaction of domestic
monetary and financial regimes increases financial imbalances. It highlights several
factors: (i) the role of monetary areas that for the key international currencies
(notably the US dollar) extend well beyond national borders; (ii) the limited
insulation properties of exchange rates, which induce policy responses designed to
avoid large interest rate differentials vis-à-vis the main international currencies; and
(iii) the powerful waves generated by freely mobile financial capital and global
liquidity, which wash across currencies and borders, carrying financial conditions
across the globe. The second section considers possible solutions. It highlights the
need to adjust domestic policy frameworks and to strengthen international
cooperation, going beyond the own-house-in-order doctrine.

oriented policies in a world of largely free capital flows. Domestic monetary regimes
focus mainly on price stability, while currencies are allowed to float to varying
degrees: free floating among the principal international currencies coexists with
greater or lesser management of other currencies. Financial regimes generally allow
funds to move freely across currencies and borders, although some countries still
impose restrictions. The main restraint on financial transactions takes the form
of prudential regulation and supervision, in part based on internationally agreed
standards.
Current arrangements differ markedly from the previous system, Bretton
Woods (1946–73). At the time, the US dollar’s convertibility into gold served as an
external monetary anchor, and currencies were tied together through fixed but
adjustable exchange rates (Table V.1). Domestic monetary regimes in general gave
less priority to price stability and more to external balance and demand growth.
While the anchor ultimately did not prove that strong, the arrangements contrast
with present ones, in which the aggregation of monetary policies pursued under
domestic mandates acts as the only overall constraint. During the Bretton Woods
era, the leading international currency was the dollar, which now shares this role to
some extent with others, mainly the euro. And international capital mobility was
quite limited, reflecting a myriad of restrictions on “repressed” domestic financial
systems.
The performance of the two systems has differed markedly as well. Bretton
Woods did not see major episodes of financial instability, but eventually proved
unable to ensure lasting global monetary stability. It broke down once the United
States formally abandoned gold convertibility and exchange rates were allowed to
float. Current arrangements have succeeded in promoting price stability more than
financial stability.
Arguably, this is no coincidence. The 84th Annual Report, as further elaborated
in other chapters of this Annual Report, explored why domestic monetary and
financial regimes have so far been unable to ensure lasting financial stability. But
their interaction through the IMFS has also played a role, by compounding rather
than limiting the weaknesses of domestic regimes. Consider, in turn, the interaction
of monetary and financial arrangements.

Interaction of domestic monetary regimes
The interaction of monetary regimes spreads easy monetary conditions from core
economies to the rest of the world. The international use of reserve currencies does
so directly, and the strategic conduct of monetary policy does so indirectly. Take
each in turn.
The reliance on a single global currency has diminished slowly since Bretton
Woods, but the US dollar continues to play a dominant role in international trade
and finance, alongside the euro. As a means of exchange, the dollar is on one side

of no less than 87% of foreign exchange market transactions (Table V.2), with an
even higher share of forward and swap transactions. Its dominance in foreign
exchange markets makes the dollar the sole intervention currency outside Europe
and Japan, which supports its high share in foreign exchange reserves. More than
half of world trade is invoiced and settled in dollars, pointing to the greenback’s
pre-eminent role as a unit of account.
Remarkably, the advent of the euro and the dollar’s trend depreciation since
the 1970s have not materially challenged the dollar’s role as a store of value
(Graph V.1, left-hand panel). At 63%, it maintains almost three times the share of
the euro in foreign exchange reserves. Its share in both official reserves and private
portfolios is sustained by the scale of what can be termed the “dollar zone” of
economies whose currencies move more closely with the dollar than with the euro
(Box V.A). At half or more of world GDP, the dollar zone is far larger than the US
economy, which is less than a quarter.
Monetary policy settings for key international currencies influence financial
conditions outside these currencies’ home jurisdictions directly through their impact
on interest rates and the valuation of assets or liabilities denominated in these
currencies but held or owed by non-residents. In particular, dollar and euro credit to
non-bank borrowers outside the United States and euro area stood at $9.5 trillion
and €2.3 trillion ($2.7 trillion), respectively, at end-2014. The dollar debt represents
a seventh of global GDP outside the United States (Box V.B).
The large stocks of dollar- and euro-denominated credit extended to borrowers
outside the United States and the euro area, respectively, mean that Federal Reserve
and ECB policies are transmitted directly to other economies. The impact depends
on the characteristics of the instrument in question, notably its maturity and the
flexibility of the corresponding interest rate. For instance, in the case of bank loans
priced off of dollar Libor or Euribor, changes in short-term policy rates pass through
within weeks. Over half of dollar and euro credit to borrowers outside the United
States and euro area remains in the form of bank loans.

BIS 85th Annual Report

Box V.A

Mapping the dollar and euro zones
This box uses simple regression methods to place currencies in three zones of influence corresponding to the main
international currencies based on the currencies’ degree of co-movement. The three reference currencies are the
dollar, the euro (before 1999, the Deutsche mark) and the yen, consistent with their status as the three most
transacted currencies in the world in the BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey. Thus defined, the dollar zone accounts
for nearly 60% of world GDP, far more than the US share in world GDP, which is between 20 and 25%.
The dollar share is calculated in two steps. First, each currency is placed in or between zones. Each currency’s
weekly percentage change against the dollar is regressed on the weekly percentage change of the euro/dollar and
yen/dollar rates. The dollar zone weight is calculated as 1 minus the corresponding regression coefficients. For
example, the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, so the coefficients are zero and the dollar zone weight is
1. For the intermediate case of sterling, in 2013 the pound’s estimated coefficient is 0.60 on the euro/dollar rate and
0.09 on the yen/dollar, making the currency’s dollar weight 1 – 0.60 – 0.09, or 0.31. The results in Graph V.A show the
dollar to be more global, the euro to be more regional and the yen to lack much external influence. The dollar
weights can thus be read in reverse as euro weights, eg with the dark blue area representing over 95% euro weight.
Second, the dollar share is calculated across currencies using (PPP) GDP weights. The dollar zone weight for
each of the 40 economies (50 before the euro) is multiplied by the respective GDP, and the product is added to the
US GDP. This sum is then expressed as a share of the total GDP of the 43 major economies analysed, including those
of the United States, the euro area and Japan. Graph V.1 plots these aggregate zone shares of global GDP.
There is strong cross-sectional evidence that a currency’s co-movement with the dollar shapes the currency
composition of its external portfolio, both official and private. For the two dozen economies that disclose the
currency composition of official reserves, the dollar zone weight accounts for about two thirds of the variation in the
dollar share across countries.And in larger samples, the dollar zone weight is also strongly linked with the dollar
share of cross-border bank deposits or loans and international bonds. The underlying motivation is the same for the
official and private sectors: matching the portfolio weights to the co-movements of the domestic currency with
major currencies serves to minimise the volatility of portfolio returns when measured in domestic currency.

Box V.B

Global liquidity as global credit aggregates

Over the past several years, the BIS has developed indicators to track global liquidity conditions. The term
global liquidity is used to mean the ease of financing in global financial markets. Total credit outstanding is one of
its main footprints, as it shows the extent to which bond markets and banks have led to the build-up of exposures.
In covering US dollar and euro credit, this box focuses on the two largest components of global credit through
which the monetary policies of the respective currency areas directly influence financial conditions in the rest of
the world.
Global credit can be extended through bank loans or bonds, and each has a domestic and an international
component. Graph V.B shows dollar- and euro-denominated debt, broken down by the location of the borrower.
Some 80% of global non-financial dollar debt at end-2014 was incurred by US residents (top left-hand panel). Their
liabilities include US public debt, US household debt and US corporate debt. But $9.5 trillion (19%) of dollar credit
was extended to non-bank borrowers located outside the United States, and these entities are as exposed to the

local lending in foreign currencies on the assumption that 80% are denominated in US dollars. For other non-BIS reporting countries, local
US dollar/euro loans to non-banks are proxied by all BIS reporting banks’ gross cross-border US dollar/euro loans to banks in the country,
on the assumption that these funds are then extended to non-banks. See R McCauley, P McGuire and V Sushko, “Global dollar credit: links

US monetary policy stance as US residents are. At 13% of non-US GDP, the stock of offshore dollar credit exceeds its
euro counterpart worth $2.7 trillion (bottom left-hand panel). Compared with borrowing in US dollars, a larger share
of overall borrowing in euros takes place from inside the same currency area (92%).
The international credit component tends to be more procyclical and volatile. International bank lending in
both dollars and euros outpaced domestic credit in the boom that preceded the Great Financial Crisis, and
contracted once the crisis broke out (Graph V.B, right-hand panels). Bond markets partly substituted for impaired
bank lending in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, and increased demand for funding went hand in hand with
higher yield spreads. Since 2010, the search for yield has enabled a surge in issuance at compressed spreads that
has helped to push the share of bonds in international credit to 46%. In this second phase of global liquidity, bond
markets and the asset management industry have taken centre stage in shaping global liquidity conditions.

  See BIS, “Highlights of global financing flows”, BIS Quarterly Review, March 2015, pp 13–29; and www.bis.org/statistics/gli.htm.

the early 2000s, however, actual policy rates drifted persistently below the levels
implied by the Taylor rule, suggesting that monetary policy became systematically
accommodative (Graph V.3). Many advanced economies apparently hesitated to raise
interest rates during the boom, and have maintained them near zero since the crisis.
For their part, EME authorities appear to have set policy rates low out of concern
over capital flows and appreciation (Graph V.3, right-hand panel). The empirical
significance of US interest rates in influencing policy rates elsewhere provides
additional evidence for follow-the-leader behaviour (Box V.C). While this simple
exercise has important limitations, it points to competitive easing as a way of
sustaining external demand. More than 20 central banks have eased monetary policy
since December 2014, some explicitly responding to external conditions (Chapter IV).
Resistance to appreciation has also taken the form of currency intervention,
which itself feeds back into global monetary ease. Many central banks have
intervened directly in the foreign exchange market, typically buying dollars, and
then investing the proceeds in bonds issued by the major governments. Unlike
major central banks’ large-scale domestic bond purchases, reserve managers have
not sought to lower yields in the bond markets in which they invest. Nevertheless,
the secular reserve accumulation and balance sheet policies of major central banks
have combined to push estimated official bond holdings to more than $12 trillion
out of the $31 trillion in US, euro area, Japanese and UK government bonds
(Graph II.9, left-hand panel). Such holdings account for over half of the outstanding
stock of US Treasury securities and more than 40% of the combined stock of
Treasury and agency securities (Graph II.9, right-hand panel).
As a result, monetary policies of advanced and emerging market economies
have reinforced each other. Easy monetary conditions at the centre have led to easy
monetary and financial conditions in the rest of the world: there, firms and
governments have boosted dollar and euro borrowing and authorities have resisted
unwelcome currency appreciation. In turn, their foreign exchange intervention has
raised official investment in major bond markets, further compressing bond yields
there. With central banks and reserve managers bidding for duration shoulder to
shoulder with pension funds and life insurers, bond yields have declined to record
lows and the term premium has turned negative (Chapter II).

Interaction of financial regimes
Financial market integration has allowed common global factors to drive capital
flows and asset prices. The common factors have partly shifted between the two
phases of global liquidity, pre- and post-crisis.

The Taylor rates are calculated as i = r*+π* + 1.5(π–π*) + 0.5y, where π is a measure of inflation, y is a measure of the output gap, π* is the
inflation target and r* is the long-run real interest rate, here proxied by real trend output growth. The graph shows the mean and the range
of the Taylor rates of different inflation/output gap combinations, obtained by combining four measures of inflation (headline, core, GDP
deflator and consensus headline forecasts) with four measures of the output gap (obtained using Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, segmented
linear trend and unobserved components techniques, and IMF estimates). π* is set equal to the official inflation target/objective, and
otherwise to the sample average or trend inflation estimated through a standard HP filter. See B Hofmann and B Bogdanova, “Taylor rules

The bank flows that dominated in the first, pre-crisis, phase of global liquidity
drew on easy leverage, predictable policy rates and low volatility, as proxied by the
VIX.4 These flows enabled domestic credit booms, freeing them from the constraint
of the domestic funding base. In a sample of 31 EMEs between early 2002 and 2008,
a rise in the share of cross-border bank funding, extended both directly to domestic
non-banks and indirectly through banks, helped boost the ratio of bank credit to
GDP (Graph V.4, left-hand panel). Banks found non-core liabilities abroad to fund
booming credit at home.5
Analysis of a broader sample of 62 countries and a more inclusive measure of
international capital flows points to a similar dynamic. Here, the larger the net debt
inflows, including both portfolio and bank flows, the larger the increase in an
economy’s ratio of bank credit to GDP (Graph V.4, right-hand panel). The inclusion
of Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom shows that a domestic credit boom’s
reliance on external financing is not a symptom of financial underdevelopment. In

seems to have changed. In particular, there are signs that the euro area bond
market has been moving its US counterpart. Anticipation of ECB large-scale bond
purchases put downward pressure on French and German bond yields and, through
co-movement of term premia, on US bond yields as well, despite the expected
divergence in policy rates (Graph V.5, right-hand panel). This contrasts with the
experience in early 1994, which epitomises previous patterns. At the time, the
Federal Reserve was raising the policy rate while the Bank of France and the
Deutsche Bundesbank were reducing theirs, but the backup in US bond yields was
transmitted to Europe (Graph V.5, left-hand panel).7

Current concerns
To summarise, the workings of the IMFS post-crisis have spread easy monetary and
financial conditions from the reserve currency areas to the rest of the world, just as
they did pre-crisis. Global financial conditions have consequently loosened to an
extent that may not prove consistent with lasting financial and macroeconomic
stability. Credit booms in EMEs and some advanced economies less affected by
the crisis have built up tell-tale financial imbalances. In the short run, the IMFS has
tilted conditions towards expansion. But in the longer run, financial busts, were they
to materialise, would tilt them towards contraction.

Monetary policy divergence across key currencies and renewed dollar
appreciation pose risks. Ease in the euro area might prolong global ease, if firms
and governments around the world can substitute euro funding for dollar funding.
However, the large stock of dollar debt outstanding means that a tightening of
dollar credit is likely to prove consequential. Thus, renewed dollar strength could
expose vulnerabilities (Chapter III), especially in those firms that have collectively
borrowed trillions of dollars. Admittedly, it is well known that the US economy has a
short position in the dollar that funds a long position in other currencies. And by
the same token, the rest of the world must hold more dollar assets than dollar
liabilities and thus enjoy valuation gains in aggregate when the dollar appreciates.
But even in a country with a long dollar position, the distribution of currency
positions across sectors matters greatly for the outcome. For example, in many
EMEs the official sector has a long dollar position whereas the corporate sector
carries a short one (Box V.D). Absent transfers from the (gaining) official sector to
the (losing) corporate sector, the economy may well be hurt by dollar strength.
Dollar strength, monetary policy divergence and heavy official holdings in the
global bond market could lead to volatility. Were EMEs to draw down reserves
substantially, their selling bonds in the key currencies could create unprecedented
cross-currents in global bond markets. ECB and Bank of Japan bond purchases, EME
selling and, eventually, the Federal Reserve’s not rolling over maturing bonds could
confront the remaining private investors with a difficult and shifting problem of
bond pricing.

Valuation effects of dollar appreciation

This box uses the example of Korea to illustrate that dollar appreciation can deliver wealth gains to non-US residents
as a whole, while still representing a tightening of financial conditions for non-US firms that have funded themselves
in the dollar. The Korean official sector can gain from dollar appreciation but need not adjust its spending, while the
Korean corporate sector can lose net worth and face tighter credit.
It is by now well known that dollar appreciation boosts US net international liabilities. This is because US
residents have dollar-denominated liabilities to the rest of the world that exceed their corresponding assets to the
tune of 39% of GDP. With the appreciation of the dollar in 2014, the US net international investment position
declined from –$5.4 trillion to –$6.9 trillion, as US assets stopped growing in dollar terms despite rising local
currency valuations. This $1.5 trillion difference was more than three times the current account of $410 billion.
Accordingly, the rest of the world’s wealth increased.
Typical of the rest of the world, Korea’s net international investment position as a whole gained from dollar
appreciation. Still, Korean firms that have borrowed dollars can still see their net worth fall. Overall, the country’s
modestly positive ($82 billion in Table V.D) external position shows net foreign currency assets of $719 billion, with
over half held by the official sector (official reserve assets of $364 billion) and substantial holdings by institutional
investors (portfolio assets of $204 billion). A substantial fraction of portfolio and other foreign currency liabilities
($348 billion), and $65 billion of foreign currency loans booked by banks in Korea, are owed by the corporate sector.
Moreover, BIS data show an additional $7 billion of mostly dollar bonds issued by offshore affiliates of Korean nonfinancial firms, and there is also offshore bank credit. Dollar appreciation leads to official gains that are not conveyed
to firms that lose net worth.
Much analysis of international balance sheets, in general, and the insurance afforded by foreign exchange
reserve holdings, in particular, implicitly suffers from a fallacy of division, according to which what is true of the
whole is true of the parts. In the absence of transfers made when the domestic currency depreciates – which would
themselves be fraught with moral hazard – the gains in the public sector do not offset corporate losses. Firms need
to adjust their spending and hiring. And if the authorities eventually deploy international reserves to provide dollar
liquidity to banks and firms, the intervention may follow disruptions that have already exacted a price.

BIS 85th Annual Report

in order suggests policymakers deploy monetary, prudential and fiscal policies to
manage financial cycles to ensure lasting monetary, financial and macroeconomic
stability (Chapters I and IV). The resulting reduction in the frequency and depth of
credit booms and busts would greatly reduce negative cross-country spillovers.
In addition, policymakers could give more weight to international interactions,
including shared exposures, spillovers and feedbacks, with a view to keeping the
global village in order. Policies could either seek to prevent crises, through measures
to restrain the build-up of financial imbalances, or to strengthen crisis management,
including through safety nets. An ounce of crisis prevention is worth a pound of
crisis management: there are clear welfare benefits from reducing the incidence
and severity of crises and clear limits of foresight and moral hazard in designing
effective safety nets.
International policy coordination can occur at various depths. Enlightened selfinterest takes international spillovers into account to the extent that they spill back
on one’s own economy. However, even if countries did their best individually, this
would still fall short of the mark if there were significant international spillovers, as
in today’s era of global liquidity. Moving towards a more efficient outcome would
require greater cooperation, including ad hoc joint action, and possibly even
agreement on rules of the game that constrain domestic policies.
Obstacles present themselves in terms of both analysis and cooperation. There
is the difficulty of agreeing on a diagnosis of what ails the IMFS. And even if a
common understanding of international spillovers and their causes emerged, it
would remain challenging to forge and to maintain a common approach among
multiple actors of varying sizes subject to differing domestic constraints.
Such possibilities and obstacles are evident in the discussion concerning crisis
management. During the Great Financial Crisis, central banks proved able to make
swift joint adjustments to their policy stances and to coordinate closely in extending
foreign exchange swaps to each other. Funding extended under dollar swaps
reached almost $600 billion (and, under euro swaps, €6 billion). The dollar swap
lines supported financial stability by allowing the funding of foreign banks with
limited access to Federal Reserve facilities. In turn, they also restored the monetary
transmission mechanism after banks had been bidding up dollar Libor relative to
the federal funds rate.
Today, proposals to modify and extend safety nets face obstacles. One reason
is deep analytical disagreement. Is reserve accumulation a by-product of exchange
rate management, or a form of self-insurance against domestic and external crises?
Should international liquidity facilities, including currency swap lines between
central banks, be broadened, and what is their best design? Would enhanced safety
nets lead to smaller foreign exchange reserves? And, even if agreement were
reached, many aspects of international risk-sharing would remain problematic.
Despite the room for improvement, the status quo may well persist.
All this reinforces the case for crisis prevention. Here, central banks could seek
to internalise the effects of their own policies. An improved exchange of information
would help authorities to reach a better understanding of international spillovers and
spillbacks. For instance, if the major central banks’ monetary policies have indeed
induced competitive easing among EMEs, the resulting financial imbalances may
ultimately hurt the advanced economies. What is more, such spillbacks may be
stronger than in the past, in line with EMEs’ growing weight in the world economy
(Chapter III). Similarly, the outsize official role in major bond markets points to the
need for policymakers to pay attention to global effects. However, while global
reserve managers might collectively benefit from taking into account the effect of
their investment behaviour on global bond yields, their individual incentive is to
ignore international spillovers.

Box V.E

Consolidating the US external balance sheet

Much of international macroeconomics assumes that national borders delimit currency zones and decision-making
units. Just as the national accounts do, it assumes that those borders define the relevant economic territory: different
currencies do not compete within a given country and firms operate exclusively within national borders. In reality,
neither is the case. Not only does the domain of major currencies extend outside their country of issue (Boxes V.A
and V.B), but multinational firms, be they financial or non-financial, operate across borders. Management focuses on
group-wide profits and risks, and balance sheets span national boundaries. A consolidated perspective better
reflects the reach of multinational firms and the extent of global integration.
This box uses the US example to illustrate how such a consolidated view of foreign assets and liabilities differs
from the official international investment position (IIP) recorded on a residence basis – the defining criterion of the
national accounts and balance of payment statistics. These are denoted “locational” in the first two columns of
Table V.E. The process of consolidation aligns balance sheets with the nationality of ownership rather than with the
location where the assets and liabilities are booked. This amounts to redrawing the US border to include the foreign
balance sheets of US-owned firms, and to exclude the US balance sheets of foreign firms. This consolidation is
performed here for the banking sector and the non-bank business sector (multinational companies).

  US banks’ foreign claims are from the BIS consolidated banking statistics on an ultimate risk basis (Table 9D); their foreign liabilities are
estimated as the sum of US banks’ local liabilities in all currencies booked outside the United States, and their cross-border liabilities to
unaffiliated parties, excluding those to US residents, and excluding liabilities to official monetary institutions booked in the US (which are
already included in “official liabilities”).    2  The local liabilities of foreign-owned banks operating in the United States appear on the asset side,
being owed to US residents. Conversely, their claims on US residents are US liabilities. Thus, consolidated US assets are foreign banks’ local
liabilities in local currency to US residents. And consolidated US liabilities are foreign banks’ local claims in local currency on US residents.    3  Total
assets of US foreign affiliates abroad, all industries excluding banking. Imputed liabilities equal total assets less direct investment
position.    4  Total assets of foreign-owned US affiliates, all industries excluding banking. Imputed liabilities equal total assets less direct
investment position. The affiliates’ assets appear as a US foreign liability, and vice versa.    5  Financial assets and liabilities reported by nonbanks, including trade credit. “Consolidated” columns also contain assets and liabilities banks in the United States hold in custody for domestic
non-bank entities.    6  Excludes financial derivatives.

The first step replaces the banks’ external positions with consolidated BIS data (three rows under “bankreported” in Table V.E). This removes all cross-border claims of, say, BNP Paribas New York on the rest of the world
(these being French assets), and adds JPMorgan’s consolidated foreign claims, yielding a total of $3.330 trillion for
reporting US banks combined. Similarly, on the liabilities side, out goes any cross-border liability of BNP Paribas
New York, and in comes JPMorgan’s global foreign liabilities, to give an estimated $2.958 trillion for US banks.
Moreover, foreign banks’ local operations in the United States, which are not part of the US external position, further
add to US consolidated assets and liabilities, respectively, to the extent that US residents provide funding ($2.465
trillion) to, or receive credit ($3.150 trillion) from, the US offices of foreign banks. Consolidating banks raises the sum
of US foreign assets and liabilities from $40 trillion (IIP) to $45 trillion.
The second step consolidates foreign-owned multinational companies (excluding banks) in an analogous,
though coarser, way (owing to data limitations). The cross-border direct investment positions of non-banks, assets
and liabilities, are replaced by the (larger) total assets of US multinationals outside the United States and by those of
foreign multinationals in the United States, respectively (rows under “direct investment” in Table V.E). Out goes
General Electric’s equity position in its French subsidiary, and in comes that subsidiary’s total assets, resulting in
$20,250 billion for all US-owned multinationals combined. These assets exceed the corresponding ownership claims
(consisting of $5,078 billion worth of equity and equity-like inter-affiliate debt in the IIP) because US multinationals
also borrow abroad; these liabilities (an estimated $15,173 billion) in turn add to US foreign liabilities. As for foreign
multinationals, French firm Total’s stake in its US subsidiary is removed, and its US assets are added – yielding
$9,920 billion for foreign multinationals. Foreign multinationals’ liabilities ($6,863 billion) count as a US foreign
asset. This step sextuples directly held corporate assets and liabilities, but leaves US net assets unchanged.
Together, consolidating banks and multinational companies more than doubles the gross foreign position of
the United States. US external assets and liabilities combined jump from $40 trillion on a residence basis (IIP) to an
estimated $89 trillion when measured on a consolidated basis. The example reveals that the US economy is more
open, and its foreign balance sheet larger, than is apparent from the external position derived from the balance of
payments. The calculation of the US current account, on the other hand, should not be affected by consolidation,
since foreign earnings are included in net investment income whether they are repatriated or not.

It may be difficult to go beyond enlightened self-interest and to revisit rules of
the game more broadly.8 Many reject a global perspective in the realm of monetary
policy. Accordingly, domestic mandates ask major reserve-issuing central banks to
set policy for a smaller economic domain than that occupied by their currencies.
This interpretation of domestic mandates contrasts sharply with successful
international cooperation in the realm of financial regulation and supervision. There,
national mandates have not precluded extensive international cooperation and the
development of global rules.
A better understanding of the shortcomings of the current IMFS would already
be a big step forward. A widely held view is that the main problem is the IMFS’s
apparent inability to prevent large current account imbalances. This view of imbalances
is the prevailing one in international forums and implies specific adjustment
policies, such as those associated with the G20 Mutual Assessment Process.9

The case for change has been put forward by R Rajan, “Competitive monetary easing: is it yesterday
once more?”, remarks at the Brookings Institution, 10 April 2014. For more sceptical views on policy
coordination, see eg S Fischer, “The Federal Reserve and the global economy”, Per Jacobsson
Foundation Lecture at the IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings, 11 October 2014; and B Cœuré,
“Domestic and cross-border spillovers of unconventional monetary policies”, remarks at the Swiss
National Bank-IMF conference “Monetary policy challenges in a changing world”, 12 May 2015. See
also J Caruana, “The international monetary and financial system: eliminating the blind spot”, remarks
at the IMF conference “Rethinking macro policy III: progress or confusion?”, 16 April 2015; and W
Dudley, “US monetary policy and emerging market economies”, remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York roundtable discussion “Three decades of crises: what have we learned?”, 27 March 2014.

The European Commission’s Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure goes further in complementing
its surveillance of external imbalances with indicators on internal financial imbalances.

The focus on current accounts and the corresponding net resource flows,
however, arguably glosses over the IMFS’s fundamental weakness. The aim of
rebalancing global demand reduces the notion of imbalances to net flows in goods
and services between countries, and neglects the greater risk of financial imbalances
building up within and across countries. To be sure, large current account deficits
often point to underlying problems, but financial booms and busts can and do
develop in surplus countries as well. An aggregate surplus position may well
conceal such vulnerabilities. Financial imbalances are more closely linked to
domestic and international gross positions, and need not leave a mark on crossborder net flows – what current accounts represent.10 Indeed, financial imbalances
may not show up in a country’s balance of payments at all if multinationals issue
debt offshore for their use abroad, for instance. This, in turn, raises the question of
the appropriate unit of analysis in international finance, with consequences for how
one should measure the risks (Box V.E). Making progress on the design of the IMFS
thus calls for a new diagnosis that accounts for financial imbalances as a basis for
broad adjustments to domestic policy regimes and their international interaction.

VI. Old and new risks in the financial landscape

Changes to risk perceptions, new regulatory frameworks and persistently low
interest rates in advanced economies have shaped the post-crisis behaviour and
business models of financial institutions. Banks are still adapting to new regulation
and striving to regain market confidence, while institutional investors shed
traditional exposures. In parallel, the growing influence of asset managers is altering
the contours of systemic risk.
Advanced economy banks are still underperforming their emerging market
economy (EME) peers. Banks have ploughed a good part of their profits into
regulatory capital, which bodes well for the future. But, despite these improvements,
markets remain sceptical about firms operating in a difficult environment amid low
interest rates and subdued economic activity. If they persist, these conditions will
erode profits and further increase banks’ exposure to interest rate risk, calling their
resilience into question. By contrast, EME banks still enjoy market confidence, as
buoyant domestic conditions continue to mask growing financial imbalances
(Chapter III).
The prolonged period of low interest rates has been particularly challenging
for institutional investors. In the face of ballooning liability values and muted asset
returns, insurance companies have explored new investment strategies and have
increasingly offloaded risks onto their customers. Even though these measures have
paid off so far, they may not be enough to counter future headwinds stemming
from plateauing equity valuations and the erosion of fixed income returns.
Confronted by similar difficulties, pension funds are posting large and widening
deficits that could take a toll on the real economy.
Market-based intermediation has filled the gap left by strained banks. In
particular, the asset management sector has grown rapidly, supporting economic
activity but also raising new risks. Even when asset managers operate with low
leverage, their investment mandates can give rise to leverage-like behaviour that
amplifies and propagates financial stress. In recent years, asset managers have
catered to the needs of yield-hungry investors by directing funds to emerging
market economies. This has added fuel to financial booms there, possibly
exacerbating vulnerabilities. More generally, the potential impact of asset managers
on financial stability has placed them on regulators’ radar screen.
This chapter is organised as follows. After reviewing banks’ recent performance
and progress in building up their resilience, the first section discusses their mediumterm challenges. The following two sections perform a similar analysis, focusing on
insurance companies and pension funds. The last section outlines new types of risk
raised by the asset management sector and discusses possible policy responses.

Banks: market perceptions drive or mask challenges
Divergent conditions have determined banks’ performance in advanced and
emerging market economies. Even as subdued economic growth, low interest rates
and substantial litigation costs were sapping their profits, advanced economy banks
responded to the regulatory overhaul by strengthening their balance sheets.
However, persistent market scepticism undermined these institutions’ funding cost
advantage – the very basis for their intermediation function. By contrast, EME

BIS 85th Annual Report

101

institutions retained market confidence and benefited from domestic financial
booms, some of which are now in their late stages.

Recent performance and efforts to rebuild financial strength
The banking sector has posted mixed results over the past six years. While the
profits of US banks have been high and robust, those of many European institutions
were much lower in 2014 than immediately after the crisis (Table VI.1). In the
background, net interest income – banks’ main source of revenue – has declined
slightly on both sides of the Atlantic (Graph VI.1, left-hand and centre panels). As
these banks did not counter subdued revenues by cutting operating expenses, costto-income ratios rose steadily between 2009 and 2014 (blue lines). By contrast, EME
banks have posted falling cost-to-income ratios and – with the exception of Russian
institutions – have kept their profits high.
Profits have been the main driver of steady improvements in the regulatory
capital positions of both advanced economy and EME banks. Retained earnings
underpinned the bulk of the 45% increase in large banks’ Core Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
capital between mid-2011 and mid-2014 (Graph VI.2, red line). On the back of
slightly declining risk-weighted assets, the corresponding CET1 regulatory ratios
rose from roughly 7% to 11% over the same period. For this to represent an
unequivocal improvement in banks’ resilience, the decline in average risk weights –
indicated by the widening gap between the blue and yellow lines – should reflect a
conservative approach that favours less risky borrowers.

Challenges and risks ahead
The sustained low interest rate environment in advanced economies clouds
banks’ outlook. Since the cost of deposits and other funding quickly hits a lower
bound in such an environment, declining returns on newly acquired securities,
compressed term premia, and falling lending rates in competitive loan markets
steadily erode net interest income (Box VI.D). The resulting squeeze on profitability

Market-making in retreat: drivers and implications

Recent indications of reduced market liquidity (Chapter II) have drawn policymakers’ and analysts’ attention to
important providers of such liquidity: specialised dealers, also known as market-makers. There are various drivers of
market-makers’ perceived retrenchment. Some relate to dealers reassessing their own risk-taking behaviour and the
viability of their business models post-crisis. Others have to do with new regulations, which aim to bring the costs of
market-making and other trading-related activities more closely in line with the underlying risks and with the risks
that these activities generate for the financial system. Attaining this policy goal would ensure a transition to an
environment with possibly lower, but more robust, market liquidity.
Market-makers are important providers of liquidity services. By committing their own balance sheets, they
stand ready to act as buyers or sellers to complete client-initiated trades in the presence of transitory supplydemand imbalances. It is generally acknowledged that underpriced market-making activities contributed pre-crisis
to “liquidity illusion”, ie the misleading impression that liquidity would always be abundantly available. After the
subsequent bust, market liquidity was eroded by the decline in banks’ inventories of corporate bonds and other
trading securities (Graph VI.A, left-hand panel; see also Graph II.11, left-hand panel). Understanding the drivers of
this recent development is necessary for assessing the robustness of market liquidity going forward.

For one, market-making lost steam post-crisis partly as a result of dealers’ waning tolerance for the valuation
and funding risks of warehoused assets. In many jurisdictions, dealers have raised the risk premia they demand
and have overhauled their risk management to better account for the cost-benefit trade-offs of alternative business
lines. This has increased the price of market-making services – especially in less liquid markets, such as those for

margin and balance sheet-intensive businesses, such as repo-funded trading activities. They also refer to the
increasing cost of warehousing fixed income inventories.
However, the net impact on market liquidity depends on a number of additional factors. One is the capacity of
market-makers to reap the cost-saving benefits of new trading technologies. Another is the ability of other market
participants to fill any gap left by traditional market-makers. This also determines to what extent increased marketmaking costs are passed through to clients and, ultimately, to the broader investor community.
From a policy perspective, a key question is whether the trends under way in market-making will help avert
liquidity crises. For this to be the case, these trends should align the price of market-making services in normal times
with the high costs of evaporating liquidity in bad times. Admittedly, price realignments are unlikely to prevent an
exceptionally large shock from bringing financial markets to a halt. But they should discourage financial behaviour
that takes market liquidity for granted and naively rules out an eventual price collapse, even as excesses are building
up. By reducing market participants’ vulnerability to ordinary liquidity shocks, this would make it less likely that such
shocks could feed on themselves and undermine system-wide liquidity.

would weaken the main source of capital, ie retained earnings, and hence banks’
resilience.
Persistently low interest rates also increase banks’ exposure to the risk of interest
rate increases. Just as falling yields have supported asset valuation gains in recent
years, an eventual normalisation would generate losses. Banks’ equity capital would
shrink, as the value of their short-duration liabilities is largely insensitive to interest
rate changes. This stands in contrast with the benefits of interest rate rises for life
insurers and pension funds, whose assets are typically of much shorter duration than
their liabilities (see below). It also underscores the importance of policy initiatives to
build regulatory safeguards against interest rate risk in the banking book.
Recent loan losses suggest that the challenges of some advanced economy
banks extend beyond profit margins and interest rate risk. In particular, large Italian
and Spanish banks have repeatedly posted loan losses well above those of their
peers (Table VI.1). Industry analysis has attributed the 2014 losses only partly to the
balance sheet clean-up triggered by the ECB’s asset quality review, emphasising
instead that the losses may need to rise further before declining.
Price-based indicators suggest that markets have a less favourable view of
advanced economy banks than of their EME counterparts. Against the background
of general optimism, evident in high price-to-book ratios in the non-financial sector
(Graph VI.4, left-hand panel), equity investors appear lukewarm about US, Swiss and
Nordic banks and rather pessimistic about UK and euro area banks (right-hand
panel). Rating agencies take a similar view: stand-alone ratings – which measure
resilience in the absence of external support – deteriorated markedly during the
subprime and sovereign crises for both European and US banks and have not
rebounded since (Graph VI.5, left-hand panel). By contrast, EME institutions boast
on average high price-to-book ratios and improving stand-alone ratings. It remains
to be seen, however, whether this vote of confidence will persist should local
conditions weaken (Chapter III).
By failing to reassure markets in recent years, advanced economy banks have
lost much of their funding advantage, so crucial for their success. Two self-reinforcing
drivers are responsible for this loss of ground. First, greater uncertainty about
advanced economy banks both during the financial crisis and post-crisis led credit
market participants to charge them substantially more than similarly rated nonfinancial corporates (NFCs) up to 2012 (Graph VI.5, centre panel). This markup

assumption that risks could be estimated with a high degree of precision raised the likelihood that tranches in the
middle of securitisations’ capital structure were severely undercapitalised.

Recent revisions to the securitisation framework take these lessons into account. The new framework includes
“comply or explain” provisions to incentivise banks to reduce their reliance on external ratings. It also limits the
number of available approaches to computing bank regulatory capital and simplifies their hierarchy. Importantly,
the revised framework introduces regulatory safeguards against undercapitalisation while maintaining risk sensitivity,
ie while requiring higher capital for riskier securitisation exposures.
Consistent with the spirit of risk-sensitive regulation, less complex and more transparent securitisations should
be subject to lower capital requirements. Accordingly, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the
International Organization of Securities Commissions have jointly proposed a list of criteria to help develop simple
and transparent asset pools.
That said, risk assessments for such pools will still be surrounded by considerable uncertainty. Ignoring this
would materially raise the likelihood that tranches are severely undercapitalised.
What makes securitisation tranches special is that they can concentrate uncertainty. Focusing on simple and
transparent securitisations, Antoniades and Tarashev show that irreducible uncertainty about the true default
probabilities in the underlying asset pool would surface predominantly in tranches of intermediate seniority, the
so-called mezzanine tranches. Ignoring this, the Basel II framework gave rise to cliff effects, whereby small
estimation errors led to disproportionately large swings in the capital requirements for these tranches. This opened
the door to severe undercapitalisation and mispricing of risks. The introduction of capital safeguards for mezzanine

Loss-absorbing capacity for banks in resolution

Post-crisis regulatory reforms seek to reduce the economy’s exposure to financial system strains. They have two
complementary objectives: ensuring minimum standards of resilience, so that financial firms are less likely to fail,
and diminishing the impact on the system and the economy in case they do fail. The first objective is embedded in
the more stringent Basel III capital and liquidity standards for going-concern banks; the second in measures to
improve the efficiency of resolution when a bank reaches the point of non-viability. In the light of the second
objective, the Financial Stability Board has issued a list of key principles for efficient resolution and has proposed
new standards on the adequacy of the loss-absorbing capacity of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) in
resolution: Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC).
The TLAC requirements would supplement the loss-absorbing capacity of Basel III regulatory capital. In general
terms, a normally functioning bank would have enough capital to meet its regulatory minimum and buffer
requirements and sufficient TLAC liabilities (Graph VI.C, first panel). Capital buffers are the bank’s first line of defence:
they absorb initial losses and allow the institution to provide uninterrupted intermediation services (second panel).
A going-concern bank meets its minimum capital requirements and is judged able to respond to adverse shocks by
replenishing its capital buffers – for instance, through retained earnings. However, large and persistent losses can
cause the bank to breach its minimum requirements, at which point it is likely to be judged unable to recover and
hence non-viable (third panel). A non-viable bank would enter the process of resolution, during which TLAC debt is
“bailed in”, ie converted into equity or written down. This allows authorities to recapitalise the troubled institution –
or a successor entity that assumes its operations – in a manner that commands market confidence and provides key
services (fourth panel). Ultimately, TLAC is a prefunded source of capital, available to facilitate a non-disruptive
resolution process.

The TLAC proposal specifies how banks should build this additional loss-absorbing capacity. While resources
eligible for Tier 1 or Tier 2 regulatory capital would help meet the TLAC requirement for resolution, there is an

of the TLAC proposal is that a failing bank’s resolution does not draw on taxpayer funds and is smooth, whether it
takes the form of a recapitalisation and restructuring or of an orderly wind-down.
The level of TLAC requirements would be determined with reference to existing regulatory metrics. TLAC
securities would need to be at least equal to the greater of (i) 16–20% of the bank’s risk-weighted assets; and
(ii) twice the level of capital that satisfies the bank’s Basel III leverage ratio requirement. The amount would be a
minimum, with national authorities free to impose additional requirements on institutions in their jurisdiction. The
implementation date for TLAC requirements is not yet fixed and will not be before January 2019.
Critically, the effectiveness of TLAC depends on it being complementary to other elements of the prudential
framework and resolution regime. The proposed design is compatible with Basel III rules. It preserves the integrity
of capital and liquidity standards and supports their objective of boosting the resilience of banks as going concerns.
TLAC resources will be used after the firm has crossed the point of non-viability and will help resolution authorities
restore Basel III buffers in a restructured institution. In addition, TLAC will need to work well with existing and
emerging resolution regimes as well as with various organisational structures. As the rules are finalised and target
quantities calibrated, it will be important to maintain sufficient flexibility in the framework to accommodate
resolution regimes and strategies that differ across jurisdictions and firms.

According to these estimates, the negative effect on bank profitability caused by the decrease in the short-term
rate was more than compensated for by the increase in the slope of the yield curve in the first two years after the
outbreak of the Great Financial Crisis (2009–10). Overall, these changes, other things equal, contributed to an
increase in the RoA of 0.3 percentage points on average for the 109 banks in the sample. In the next four years
(2011–14), the further fall in short-term rates and the flattening of the yield curve contributed to a
cumulative reduction in the RoA of 0.6 percentage points. These results hold after controlling for different business

the yield on new investments. In parallel, new accounting rules for the discounting
of future obligations have replaced the higher interest rates of the past – prevailing
when contracts were signed – with the lower current rates, thus boosting the value
of liabilities. Against this backdrop and despite favourable investor sentiment in
equity markets, credit ratings signal concerns about insurers.
Property-and-casualty firms’ subdued performance in 2014 was the outcome of
opposing forces. For instance, strong premium growth supported profitability in a
number of countries (Table VI.2). Between mid-2013 and mid-2014, it contributed to
a slight drop – to 94% – of European non-life insurers’ combined ratio, ie the sum
of underwriting losses, expenses and policyholders’ dividends divided by premium
income. However, elevated expenses and catastrophe losses at US companies wiped
out much of their gains from premium growth, leading to a 99% combined ratio.
Meanwhile, steady and widespread declines in investment returns have depressed
non-life insurers’ profitability in nearly all major centres.
Despite challenges stemming from their heavy reliance on investment income,
life insurers have reported improving performance. Cost-cutting and a greater
contribution from new business lines, notably the sale of asset management
products, have been instrumental. According to industry estimates, the sector’s
return-on-equity has risen, from below 10% in 2012 to roughly 12% in 2014.
Some trends in the life insurance sector have been consistent with more
conservative risk management. For instance, the growing share of asset management

Regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures: towards greater risk sensitivity

Box VI.E

The Basel framework calls for minimum regulatory requirements commensurate with the underlying risks. This is
the basic philosophy of the framework. That said, a number of national jurisdictions implement preferential
treatment of sovereign exposures, notably in relation to non-financial corporate exposures. This weakens the risk
sensitivity of regulatory requirements. As the resulting distortions can undermine financial stability, they have
prompted policy initiatives to reassess the approach to sovereign exposures in bank regulation.
In its clearest form, the preferential treatment applies to exposures that are in the borrowing sovereign’s
domestic currency and are funded by the bank in the same currency. National authorities have the option – but not
the obligation – to allow for much lower risk weights on such exposures than on exposures to private corporations
with similar risk characteristics. Often, and regardless of the sovereign’s rating, the reduced risk weight is zero. This is
currently the case under the standardised approach to credit risk in the banking book, as well as under both the
current and proposed approaches to specific risk in the trading book.
When it comes to the treatment of liquidity risk, sovereigns are and are likely to remain attractive investments.
One example relates to the regulatory approach to zero-risk-weight sovereign exposures: they qualify without
limitations as high-quality liquid assets for banks’ liquidity requirements. Or, take the proposed trading book rules,
which require banks to evaluate the risk of their exposures over specific horizons. While the estimated risk increases
mechanically with the evaluation horizon, this horizon is lower for more liquid securities that are easier to sell at
times of stress. Given the high historical liquidity of sovereign securities, the associated evaluation horizons are
proposed to be two to three times shorter than those required for equally rated corporate securities.
In addition, sovereign exposures have been exempt from concentration limits in regulatory rules on large
exposures. It is thus hardly surprising that they have played an important role in banks’ balance sheets. In a
worldwide sample of 30 large banks, the share of sovereign exposures in the banking book expanded from roughly
12% in 2004 to 20% at end-2013. And in the euro area’s geographical periphery, banks’ holdings of their own
sovereign’s debt have increased steadily as a share of total assets: from 3% in 2008 to above 8% at end-2014.
This has strengthened the interdependence of banks and sovereigns. For decades, banks have relied on implicit
and explicit sovereign support to improve their ratings and lower their funding costs. More recently, the preferential
regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures has allowed banks that were themselves under strain to extend lifelines
to troubled governments. The destabilising effect of the two-way links came to the fore during the 2010–11
sovereign debt crisis, which took financial distress to new heights.
Such experiences have prompted a reassessment of the regulatory treatment of sovereigns. Initial steps in this
direction relate to the treatment of sovereign support for banks in the standardised approach to credit risk.
Proposed changes to this approach would not allow a lending bank to reduce the risk weight on its interbank
exposure by referring to the rating of the borrowing bank’s sovereign. If implemented, these changes would align
the lending bank’s capital charge – and ultimately the lending rate – more closely with the borrowing bank’s
riskiness. In addition, forthcoming leverage ratio requirements will provide, inter alia, a backstop for the size of
sovereign exposures for a given level of bank capital. But further work is needed on the regulatory treatment of
sovereign exposures themselves.
It is important to recognise that sovereigns’ preferential status rests on a misleading argument. The argument
hinges on central banks standing ready to monetise domestic currency sovereign debt in order to prevent defaults
on this debt. As recent events in the euro area show, however, such a solution cannot apply in a currency zone
subject to macroeconomic conditions that do not happen to be aligned with the needs of a particular sovereign
under stress. The argument is also weakened by a number of historical defaults on local currency sovereign debt,
mostly in emerging market economies. And, even when monetisation does prevent a sovereign default, it
undermines central bank independence and market confidence in the domestic currency. This, in turn, could lead to
high inflation and a currency crisis, which would also adversely affect the banking system. All these considerations
underscore the merits of seeking a closer alignment between regulatory requirements for sovereign exposures and
the likelihood of sovereign distress.

products in the liabilities of North American, Swiss and UK life insurers (Graph VI.6,
left-hand panel) indicates offloading of financial risk to customers. On the assets
side, European companies have been increasing the duration of their bond portfolios
(centre panel), thus narrowing duration gap estimates.2 While such estimates suggest
an improvement in balance sheet strength, they should be interpreted with caution
given their sensitivity to assumptions about discount rates and policyholder
behaviour.
At the same time, the risk profile of insurance companies’ assets has
deteriorated in recent years, albeit from a conservative starting point. Pressed by
regulation and institutional mandates to hold predominantly investment grade
securities, insurance companies have seen their asset distribution shift from the
best to the worst ratings in this range (Graph VI.7). The shift could be partly due to
a slide in the credit quality of outstanding securities. But it is also consistent with
active search for yield. And while US firms have operated mainly in the corporate
and mortgage markets, their European peers have searched for yield in sovereign
bonds. National authorities have in fact encouraged this behaviour to the extent
that they have allowed insurance companies – as they have banks – to apply zero
risk weights even to sovereigns with low and deteriorating ratings.
Equity markets and rating agencies point to different perceptions of the
insurance sector. Price-to-book ratios have been on the rise in major advanced
economies since 2011 and have increased from an already high level in EMEs since
mid-2014 (Graph VI.6, right-hand panel). This could reflect improving financial
strength but also general market euphoria (Chapter II). By contrast, insurers’ ratings
deteriorated substantially during the financial crisis and have hardly recovered since.
A likely driver is a concern that the growth of fees and premia – quite important in
supporting insurers’ recent profits – will eventually run its course.

to US accounting standards are expected to narrow the gap.
In the face of ultra-low interest rates, policy measures have offered temporary
relief. For instance, regulators allowed discount rate increases in 2012, partly in
response to industry concerns that the prevailing rates had decoupled reported
funding ratios from pension plans’ intrinsic funding conditions. This measure was
either direct – eg discount rate floors in Sweden and higher long-term discount
rates in Denmark – or indirect – eg the use of longer, 25-year horizons for the
computation of rate corridors in the United States. Likewise, US regulatory

insurance companies and to make lump sum payments to plan participants.
Such shifts in contractual obligations are part of a long-standing risk
management strategy in the sector. In a trend seen in most major markets, defined
contribution (DC) plans, under which members bear the investment risks, have

Funding strains at pension funds could have broader repercussions. In the case
of DB plans, the fund’s liabilities are a contractual obligation of the fund’s sponsor,

translate sooner or later into expenses for the sponsor, they would hurt companies’
profits and possibly undermine their solvency. For their part, DC plans can have

similar effects but through different channels. A drop in the value of a DC plan’s
assets means a decline in the future income stream of its members. If such an
outcome is widespread, it would lead to an increase in the saving rate and hence a
decline in aggregate demand.

Risks morph post-crisis in the financial system
The financial landscape has evolved substantially post-crisis. While banks have lost
ground as intermediaries, asset managers – which run mutual, private equity and
hedge funds, among others – have increasingly catered to the needs of yieldhungry investors. As a result, new types of risk have gained prominence.
The asset management sector has grown considerably over the past decade.
Despite a mid-crisis hiatus, which mirrored mainly valuation losses, global assets
under management (AUM) rose from roughly $35 trillion in 2002 to $75 trillion in
2013 (Graph VI.9). The sector remains highly concentrated, with the top 20 managers
accounting for 40% of total assets.
The sector’s composition has changed over time. By region, North American
asset managers have increased their market share by 11 percentage points over the
last decade. They now account for more than half of total AUM and approximately
two thirds of the assets managed by the top 20 managers. By type, independent
managers have been rapidly displacing bank- and insurer-owned managers at the
top (Graph VI.9, black line).
As risk-taking migrates away from the banking sector, asset managers have
played a pivotal role together with their customers and these customers’ investment
consultants. In their recommendations, investment consultants reportedly attribute
substantial weight to assets’ latest performance. Thus, as the returns on EME assets
were higher than those on advanced economy assets in the crisis aftermath,
investment consultants’ recommendations are likely to have contributed to the
strong flows into EME funds in recent years (Chapter II).
Abundant bond financing has substantially reduced EME companies’ capitalisation
ratio, ie market capitalisation divided by the sum of market capitalisation and the
book value of liabilities. Despite buoyant equity markets, massive borrowing by EME
banks and non-financial corporates between 2010 and 2014 lowered significantly

their capitalisation ratios to levels last seen at end-2008, in the midst of the global
financial turmoil (Graph VI.10, left-hand panel). Even though this trend reversed
partly at the start of 2015, it has undermined firms’ loss-absorbing capacity, leaving
EMEs vulnerable to funding reversals.
This vulnerability has evolved alongside the growing reliance of EMEs on
market-based financing channelled through internationally active asset managers
(Chapter III). In general, asset managers’ business models – eg benchmarking to
market indices and attributing great importance to relative performance – and the
investment structures that they offer – eg collective investment vehicles – incentivise
short-sighted behaviour that can be destabilising in the face of adverse shocks. In
the case of managers investing in EME assets, this issue is all the more pronounced.3
EME funds rely on significantly fewer and more correlated benchmarks than their
advanced economy counterparts. As a result, financial shocks are more likely to
simultaneously affect a wide range of investors in EME funds, leading to concerted
in- and outflows.
Fund flows that amplify price swings would be destabilising. The potential for
such dynamics transpires from the historical relationship between returns on broad
indices and fund flows (Graph VI.10, centre and right-hand panels). In the case of
US and EME funds, inflows follow in the footsteps of high returns (bars to the right
of zero) and are likely to strengthen the rise in contemporaneous returns (bars at
zero). In such a scenario, fund inflows support persistent equity or bond booms.
However, this mechanism would work in the opposite direction as well. In a downturn,
outflows would exacerbate sub-par returns and persistently depress markets.

Looking forward, the fundamental question is whether asset managers can take
over intermediation functions that banks have shed. Financial institutions’ success
in performing such functions depends on their capacity to take temporary losses in
their stride. But this capacity has recently declined in the asset management sector,
where retail investors have been replacing institutional investors as the ultimate risk
bearers. Retail investors have smaller balance sheets, shorter investment horizons
and lower risk tolerance, and hence a smaller loss-absorbing capacity. The
investment behaviour of UK households during the recent financial crisis is consistent
with this.4
These issues become more important as the assets managed by an individual
company grow in size. The decisions taken by a single large asset manager can
potentially trigger fund flows with significant system-wide repercussions. To delve
into this issue, the Financial Stability Board and the International Organization of
Securities Commissions have published a proposal on how to identify non-bank
non-insurer global systemically important financial institutions.5
More recently, the policy debate has considered asset management companies
(AMCs) as a distinctive group that gives rise to new financial risks. AMCs’ incentive
structures have received particular attention, as they can generate concerted
behaviour and thus amplify financial market fluctuations. Restrictions on investment
portfolio shifts could limit incentive-driven swings and, by effectively lengthening
asset managers’ investment horizons, could stabilise their behaviour in the face of
temporary adverse shocks. Similarly, caps on leverage could contain the amplification
of shocks. Furthermore, redemption risk can be addressed by liquidity buffers and
– in the spirit of recent amendments to US money market fund rules – by restrictions
on rapid redemptions from managed funds. This could insulate asset managers from
hasty swings in retail investor sentiment, thus boosting the sector’s loss-absorbing
capacity.
A complementary policy response would aim to restore the vibrancy of
institutions that were successful intermediaries in the past. Banks are the prime
example. Regulatory initiatives under way that aim to increase banks’ resilience and
transparency would improve their intermediation capacity, not least by helping
them regain market confidence. And as resilience depends critically on the ability to
generate sustainable profits, it would be supported by growth-enhancing reforms
and a timely normalisation of monetary policy in advanced economies as well as by
further initiatives to restrain financial imbalances in emerging market economies.

  Thresholds for red cells are chosen by minimising false alarms conditional on capturing at least two thirds of the crises over a cumulative
three-year horizon. A signal is correct if a crisis occurs in any of the three years ahead. The noise is measured by the wrong predictions outside
this horizon. Beige cells for the credit-to-GDP gap are based on guidelines for countercyclical capital buffers under Basel III. Beige cells for the
debt service ratio (DSR) are based on critical thresholds if a two-year forecast horizon is used. For a derivation of critical thresholds for creditto-GDP gaps and property price gaps, see M Drehmann, C Borio and K Tsatsaronis, “Anchoring countercyclical capital buffers: the role of credit
aggregates”, International Journal of Central Banking, vol, 7, no 4, December 2011, pp 189–240. For the DSR methodology, see M Drehmann
and M Juselius, “Do debt service costs affect macroeconomic and financial stability?", BIS Quarterly Review, September 2012, pp 21–35.
Country aggregates are simple averages.    2  Difference of the credit-to-GDP ratio from its long-run, real-time trend calculated with a onesided HP filter using a smoothing factor of 400,000, in percentage points.    3  Deviations of real residential property prices from their long-run
trend calculated with a one-sided HP filter using a smoothing factor of 400,000, in per cent.    4  Difference of DSRs from country-specific longrun averages since 1999 or later depending on data availability and when five-year average inflation fell below 10%, in percentage
points.    5  Assuming that all other components of the DSR stay fixed.    6  Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand; excluding the Philippines and Singapore for the DSR and its forecast.    7  Finland, Norway and Sweden.    8  Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Russia; excluding the Czech Republic and Romania for the real property
price gap; excluding Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania for the DSR and its forecast.

BIS 85th Annual Report

The BIS: mission, activities, governance and
financial results

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) serves central banks in their pursuit of
monetary and financial stability, fosters international cooperation in those areas
and acts as a bank for central banks. In outline, the BIS pursues this mission by:
•
facilitating dialogue and collaboration among central banks and other
authorities that are responsible for promoting financial stability;
•
conducting research on policy issues confronting central banks and financial
supervisory authorities;
•
acting as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions;
and
•
serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international financial
operations.
The BIS has its head office in Basel, Switzerland, and representative offices in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China
(Hong Kong SAR) and in Mexico City.
In the light of the aims outlined above, this chapter reviews the activities of the
BIS, and of the groups it hosts, for the financial year 2014/15; describes the
institutional framework that supports the work of those groups; and presents the
year’s financial results.

The meetings programmes and the Basel Process
The BIS promotes international cooperation among monetary authorities and
financial supervisory officials through its meetings programmes and through the
Basel Process – hosting international groups pursuing global financial stability (such
as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board)
and facilitating their interaction.

Bimonthly meetings and other regular consultations
At bimonthly meetings, normally held in Basel, Governors and other senior officials
of BIS member central banks discuss current developments and the outlook for the
world economy and financial markets. They also exchange views and experiences
on issues of interest to central banks.
The two principal bimonthly meetings are the Global Economy Meeting and
the All Governors’ Meeting.

Global Economy Meeting
The Global Economy Meeting (GEM) comprises the Governors of 30 BIS member
central banks in major advanced and emerging market economies that account
for about four fifths of global GDP. The Governors of another 19 central banks

BIS 85th Annual Report

133

attend the GEM as observers.1 The GEM has two main roles: (i) monitoring and
assessing developments, risks and opportunities in the world economy and the
global financial system; and (ii) providing guidance to three BIS-based central bank
committees – the Committee on the Global Financial System, the Committee on
Payments and Market Infrastructures and the Markets Committee.
The GEM’s economic discussions focus on current macroeconomic and financial
developments in major advanced and emerging market economies. Specific topics
discussed by the GEM over the past year included: the implications of unusually low
financial market volatility; the current role of macroprudential policies; risk-taking
in the real and financial sectors; the impact of lower oil prices; the implications of
negative interest rates; and external adjustments against the backdrop of large
movements in exchange rates.
As the Global Economy Meeting is quite large, it is supported by an informal
group known as the Economic Consultative Committee (ECC). Limited to
18 participants, the ECC includes all Governors participating in the BIS Board
meeting and the BIS General Manager. The ECC assembles proposals for
consideration by the GEM. In addition, the ECC Chairman initiates recommendations
to the GEM on the appointment of Chairs of the three central bank committees
mentioned above and on the composition and organisation of those committees.

All Governors’ Meeting
The All Governors’ Meeting comprises the Governors of the 60 BIS member central
banks and is chaired by the BIS Chairman. It convenes to discuss selected topics of
general interest to its members. In 2014/15, the topics discussed were: Bitcoin and
other virtual currencies – implications for central banks; central bank profitability –
trends and policy relevance; global demographic change – issues for central banks;
financial markets and central banks; the rise of regional banking in Asia and the
Pacific; and inequality and monetary policy.
By agreement with the GEM and the BIS Board, the All Governors’ Meeting is
responsible for overseeing the work of two other groups that have a broader
network or membership than the GEM. These are the Central Bank Governance
Group, which also meets during the bimonthly meetings, and the Irving Fisher
Committee on Central Bank Statistics.

Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision
The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) is a highlevel forum responsible for international collaboration on banking supervision. It
decides on global banking regulations and oversees the work of the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision (see page 136).

The members of the GEM are the central bank Governors of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil,
Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia,
Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States and also the President of
the European Central Bank and the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The
Governors attending as observers are from Algeria, Austria, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, the
Philippines, Portugal, Romania and the United Arab Emirates.

BIS 85th Annual Report

Other meetings of Governors
The central bank Governors of major emerging market economies (EMEs) meet
three times a year – during the January, May and September bimonthly meetings
– to discuss issues of special importance to their economies. The topics discussed
in 2014/15 included: global asset management companies and emerging
market asset classes; international currencies and the international monetary
system; and the implications for EMEs of exchange rate and commodity price
developments.
Regular meetings were also held for the Governors of central banks in small
open economies.

Other consultations
In addition, the Bank regularly organises various meetings that bring together not
only central bank officials but also representatives from other financial authorities,
the private financial sector and the academic community to discuss topics of shared
interest.
These events include:
•
the annual meetings of the working parties on monetary policy, held in Basel
but also hosted at a regional level by a number of central banks in Asia, central
and eastern Europe, and Latin America;
•
the meeting of Deputy Governors of emerging market economies; and
•
the high-level meetings organised by the Financial Stability Institute in various
regions of the world for Governors and Deputy Governors and heads of
supervisory authorities.
Other meetings in the past year included:
•
a roundtable meeting of Governors from African central banks, in June 2014;
and
•
a meeting for central bank Governors on macroprudential policies, jointly
organised by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey and the BIS in
February 2015, following a joint workshop in December 2014.

The Basel Process
The Basel Process refers to the BIS’s role in hosting and supporting the work of
international groups – six committees and three associations – engaged in standard
setting and the pursuit of financial stability.
The hosted committees, whose agendas are guided by various sets of central
banks and supervisory authorities, are as follows:
•
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS): develops global regulatory
standards for banks and seeks to strengthen micro- and macroprudential
supervision;
•
the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS): monitors and analyses
issues relating to financial markets and systems;
•
the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI): analyses and
sets standards for payment, clearing and settlement infrastructures;
•
the Markets Committee: monitors developments in financial markets and their
implications for central bank operations;
•
the Central Bank Governance Group: examines issues related to the design and
operation of central banks; and
•
the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC): addresses statistical
issues relating to economic, monetary and financial stability.

BIS 85th Annual Report

135

The hosted associations are as follows:
•
the Financial Stability Board (FSB): an association including finance ministries,
central banks and other financial authorities in 24 countries; coordinates at the
international level the work of national authorities and international standard
setters and develops policies to enhance financial stability;
•
the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI): sets global standards
for deposit insurance systems and promotes cooperation on deposit insurance
and bank resolution arrangements; and
•
the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS): sets standards for
the insurance sector to promote globally consistent supervision.
The Bank’s own Financial Stability Institute (FSI) facilitates the dissemination of
the standard-setting bodies’ work to central banks and financial sector supervisory
and regulatory agencies through its extensive programme of meetings, seminars
and online tutorials.
The Basel Process is based on three key features: synergies of co-location;
flexibility and openness in the exchange of information; and support from the BIS’s
expertise in economics, banking and regulation.

Synergies
The physical proximity of the nine committees and associations at the BIS creates
synergies that produce a broad and fruitful exchange of ideas. In addition, by
reducing each group’s costs of operation through economies of scale, the Basel
Process supports a more efficient use of public funds.

Flexibility
The limited size of these groups is conducive to flexibility and openness in the
exchange of information, thereby facilitating coordination and preventing overlaps
and gaps in their work programmes. At the same time, their output is much larger
than their limited size would suggest, as they are able to leverage the expertise of
the international community of central bankers, financial regulators and supervisors,
and other international and national public authorities.

Support from the BIS’s economic expertise and banking experience
The work of the Basel-based committees is informed by the BIS’s economic research
and, where appropriate, by the practical experience it gains from the implementation
of regulatory standards and financial controls in its banking activities.

Activities of BIS-hosted committees and the FSI
This section reviews the year’s principal activities of the six committees hosted by
the BIS and of the Financial Stability Institute.

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) seeks to enhance supervisory
cooperation and improve the quality of banking supervision worldwide. Its mandate
is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks for the purpose
of enhancing financial stability. The Committee supports supervisors by providing a
forum for exchanging information on national supervisory arrangements, improving

136

BIS 85th Annual Report

the effectiveness of techniques for supervising international banks, and setting
minimum supervisory and regulatory standards.
The Committee consists of senior representatives of banking supervisory
authorities and central banks responsible for banking supervision or financial
stability issues in the Committee’s member countries. It is chaired by Stefan Ingves,
Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, and generally meets four times a year. The
Committee’s governing body is the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision
(GHOS) from member countries. The Committee seeks the endorsement of GHOS
for its major decisions and its work programme.

Current work programme
At its January 2015 meeting, the GHOS reviewed and endorsed the Committee’s
strategic priorities:
•
Policy development. The Committee continues to pursue its post-crisis reform
agenda, with a focus on improving confidence in capital ratios by, for example,
revising methods for measuring risk-weighted assets (RWA). During the year,
the Committee released for consultation proposed revisions to the standardised
approaches for credit and operational risk (see below). The Committee
introduced an initiative to assess the interaction, coherence and overall
calibration of the reform policies. The Committee has also begun a review of
the regulatory treatment of sovereign risk.
•
Balancing simplicity, comparability and risk sensitivity. For the effectiveness of
the Basel capital standards, the Committee considers it essential to simplify
them where possible and to improve the comparability of their outcomes. To
that end, it is focusing on ways to improve the balance between comparability
and complexity in the Basel capital framework. The Committee is also working to
improve the presentation of its online documents, including the consolidation
of the Basel framework into a single volume.
•
Monitoring and assessing implementation. The Committee regularly evaluates
member jurisdictions’ adoption of its standards by means of the Regulatory
Consistency Assessment Programme (RCAP). The RCAP will be expanded to
cover Basel liquidity standards and the frameworks for global and domestic
systemically important banks.
•
Improving the effectiveness of supervision. Continuing its work on improving
supervisory effectiveness, the Committee will focus on practices related to
stress testing, valuation practices and the role of Pillar 2 in the capital
framework.
During the year, the Committee finalised or published for consultation a range
of standards related to policy reform as well as reports on policy implementation
and supervision.

Policy reform
The Committee developed a number of global standards for banks during the year.
Capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties. In April 2014, the
Committee published a revised standard on the capital treatment of bank exposures
to central counterparties. The standard is the result of a collaborative effort
between the BCBS, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI)
and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) to improve
the interim capital requirements published in July 2012. The BCBS, CPMI and IOSCO
sought to simplify the interim policy framework and support broader policy efforts,

BIS 85th Annual Report

137

particularly those relating to central clearing of standardised over-the-counter
(OTC) derivative contracts. The revised standard will take effect on 1 January 2017.
Supervisory framework for measuring and controlling large exposures. In April 2014,
the Committee finalised a supervisory framework for measuring and controlling
large credit exposures to contain the maximum loss a bank could face in the event
of a sudden counterparty failure. The standard includes limits on large exposures.
The large exposure limit is 25% of a bank’s Tier 1 capital; exposures between global
systemically important banks (G-SIBs) are limited to 15% of Tier 1 capital. The
standard will take effect from 1 January 2019.
Operational risk – revisions to the simpler approaches. In October 2014, the
Committee published for consultation its proposed revisions to the standardised
approach for measuring operational risk capital. Aiming to address weaknesses
identified in the existing standardised approaches (ie the non-model-based
approaches), a revised standardised approach will replace the three current
standardised approaches. The Committee expects to finalise the new approach
around the end of 2015.
Pillar 3 disclosure requirements. In January 2015, the Committee published its
revisions to the Pillar 3 disclosure standard. This followed the release of a
consultative paper in June 2014. The revised standard promotes greater consistency
in the way banks disclose information about risks as well as their risk measurement
and management. The revisions aim to enable market participants to compare
banks’ disclosures of the capital ratio’s denominator (ie RWA) and to assess more
effectively a bank’s overall capital adequacy. The disclosures also respond to
concerns about the opacity of internal model-based approaches to determining
RWA. The revised requirements will take effect from end-2016.
Net Stable Funding Ratio and disclosure standards. In October 2014, after extensive
consultation, the Committee finalised the standard for the Net Stable Funding Ratio
(NSFR). A key element of the Basel III liquidity framework, the NSFR will limit
overreliance on short-term wholesale funding, encourage better assessment of
funding risk across on- and off-balance sheet items, and promote funding stability.
In addition, in December 2014 the Committee published for consultation disclosure
requirements for the NSFR to improve the transparency of regulatory funding
requirements, reinforce its principles for sound liquidity risk management and
supervision, strengthen market discipline, and reduce uncertainty in the markets as
the NSFR is implemented. The NSFR will become a minimum standard by 1 January
2018.
Fundamental review of the trading book. In December 2014, the Committee
conducted a third round of consultation on outstanding issues relating to the
fundamental review of the trading book. The goal of the review is to improve
trading book capital requirements and promote consistent implementation of the
standard. The latest consultation focused on certain implementation aspects of the
proposed framework, including a simpler method for incorporating liquidity
horizons into the internal models approach and a revised standardised approach
that uses as inputs changes in the value of a trading position based on sensitivity to
underlying risk factors.
Revisions to the standardised approach for credit risk. In December 2014, the
Committee proposed revisions to the standardised approach for credit risk. These

138

BIS 85th Annual Report

seek to strengthen the existing regulatory capital standard by reducing reliance on
external credit ratings; enhancing granularity and risk sensitivity; improving
comparability with the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach with respect to the
definition and treatment of similar exposures; and clarifying the application of the
standard.
One specific aspect of the proposed revisions is to replace references to external
ratings with a limited number of risk drivers. Given the challenges associated with
identifying risk drivers that can be applied globally but which also reflect the local
nature of some exposures – such as retail credit and mortgages – the Committee
recognised that the proposals are still at an early stage of development.
Introduction of a capital floor based on the standardised approaches. In December
2014, the Committee released for consultation a proposal for a capital floor based
on standardised, non-internally modelled approaches. The proposed floor, which
would replace the existing transitional capital floor from the Basel I framework, will
be based on the standardised approaches for credit, market and operational risk,
revisions of which are currently under consideration. The floor is meant to mitigate
model risk and measurement error stemming from internally modelled approaches,
enhance the comparability of capital outcomes across banks, and also ensure that
capital across the banking system does not fall below a certain level. The Committee
will consider the calibration of the floor alongside its work on finalising the revised
standardised approaches.
Revisions to the securitisation framework. In December 2014, the Committee
published its revisions to the securitisation framework after two rounds of
consultation and quantitative impact assessment. In revising the framework, the
Committee aims to strike an appropriate balance between risk sensitivity, simplicity
and comparability, and to address a number of shortcomings in the existing
framework, including mechanistic reliance on external ratings, lack of risk sensitivity,
cliff effects and insufficient capital for certain exposures. The revised framework will
come into effect in January 2018.
Criteria for identifying simple, transparent and comparable securitisations. In
December 2014, the Committee and IOSCO released for consultation criteria for
identifying – and assisting the financial industry’s development of – simple,
transparent and comparable securitisation structures. The criteria will also help
parties involved in a securitisation transaction evaluate the risks of a particular
securitisation as part of their due diligence. The criteria may be supplemented or
expanded based on specific needs and applications, such as investor mandates,
regulatory applications or central bank collateral frameworks.

Policy implementation
Implementation of the Basel III framework is a key priority for the Committee. As
noted above, the Basel Committee has adopted a Regulatory Consistency Assessment
Programme (RCAP) to monitor its member jurisdictions’ progress on implementation
and assess the consistency and completeness of the adopted standards. The RCAP
also facilitates dialogue among Committee members and aids the Committee in
developing standards.
During the year, the RCAP conducted jurisdictional assessments for Canada,
the European Union, Hong Kong SAR, Mexico and the United States. The Committee
has now completed assessments for all countries that are home to G-SIBs. By
end-2015, it will have completed or initiated detailed peer reviews of the capital

139

regulations of all 27 member jurisdictions of the Basel Committee, which together
account for more than 90% of global banking assets.
In addition, the Committee published several other reports relating to the
implementation of the Basel framework.
Progress reports. In April and October 2014, the Committee issued reports providing
a high-level view of Committee members’ progress in adopting the Basel framework
(including reforms made after the financial crisis). The reports focus on the status of
domestic rule-making processes to ensure that the Committee’s standards are
transformed into national law or regulation according to the internationally agreed
time frames. The Committee believes that disclosure will provide an additional
incentive for members to fully comply with the international agreements.
Reports to the G20. In November 2014, the Committee reported to the G20 Leaders
on BCBS members’ progress in adopting the Basel III standards and banks’ progress
in bolstering their capital and liquidity positions. The report also highlighted
specific implementation-related challenges.
In November 2014, the Committee also reported to the G20 Leaders on the
steps it is taking to improve consistency and comparability in bank capital ratios
and to strengthen confidence in RWA. These measures include proposals to revise
the standardised approaches for calculating regulatory capital ratios – which will
also provide the basis for a capital floor – and to constrain modelling choices when
using models to determine capital. The report also discusses the role of disclosure,
implementation monitoring and additional analytical and policy work in progress.
Basel III monitoring reports. Published twice a year, the Committee’s Basel III monitoring
report covers the implications of Basel III for financial markets. The results of the
monitoring exercise assume that the final Basel III package has been fully implemented.
Thus, they do not take account of the transitional arrangements set out in the Basel
III framework, such as the gradual phase-in of deductions from regulatory capital.
The latest report was released in March 2015 and summarises data as of
30 June 2014. The report shows that all large internationally active banks now meet
the Basel III risk-based capital minimum requirements. As for the liquidity
requirements, 80% of the banks in the sample reported a Liquidity Coverage Ratio
(LCR) that met or exceeded 100% (the standard for 2019), while 96% reported an
LCR at or above 60% (the initial standard set when the LCR came into effect on
1 January 2015). A longer-term structural liquidity standard, the Net Stable Funding
Ratio (NSFR), was finalised in October 2014. Based on the January 2014 consultative
document, a sample collected at end-June 2014, and thus obtained prior to the
release of the revised standard, reported that 80% of the banks met or exceeded
100%, while 92% of the banks reported an NSFR at or above 90%.
The G-SIB assessment methodology – score calculation. In November 2014, the
Committee published technical information related to the Financial Stability Board’s
publication of an updated list of G-SIBs. The list is based on the assessment
methodology for G-SIBs published by the Committee in July 2013, which uses an
indicator-based approach comprising five categories: size; interconnectedness; lack
of readily available substitutes or financial institution infrastructure; global (crossjurisdictional) activity; and complexity. The information published by the Committee
included a technical summary, which further explains the methodology and the
denominators used to calculate the scores for banks as well as the cutoff score that
was used to identify the updated list of G-SIBs. Also provided were the thresholds
used to allocate G-SIBs to buckets for the purposes of calculating the specific

capital surcharge for each institution as well as links to the disclosures of the G-SIBs
designated in 2014.
National discretions. The Basel framework includes a number of national discretions
that allow countries to adapt the international standards to reflect differences in
the structure and development of financial systems. Use of national discretions can
impair comparability across jurisdictions and has been found to be a driver of RWA
variability. In November 2014, the Committee published information about each
member’s use of national discretions allowed within the Basel capital framework.
Publishing this information serves to provide greater transparency to market
participants to help improve comparability across jurisdictions. As national
discretions have been found to be a driver of RWA variability, the Committee is
reviewing their use with a view to removing a number of them.
Principles for the sound management of operational risk. The Committee published
in October 2014 a review of banks’ implementation of the 2011 Principles for the
sound management of operational risk, which embody the lessons from the financial
crisis and set out the Committee’s expectations for the management of operational
risk. The review covered 60 systemically important banks (SIBs) in 20 jurisdictions
by means of a questionnaire against which banks self-assessed the extent and
quality of their implementation. Progress in implementing the principles varies
significantly across banks and, overall, more work is needed to achieve full
implementation. The principles that were identified as among the least thoroughly
implemented were: (i) operational risk identification and assessment; (ii) change
management; (iii) operational risk appetite and tolerance; and (iv) disclosure.

Supervision
Rigorous supervision is crucial for the functioning of the policy framework. During
the year, the Committee published several documents to aid supervisors in
undertaking effective supervision of regulated banks.
Supervisory colleges. In June 2014, the Committee issued final principles for effective
supervisory colleges. The principles update the original document published in
October 2010 and are intended to promote and strengthen the operation of colleges,
which play a crucial role in the effective supervision of international banking
groups. The revisions underscore the importance of continuous collaboration and
information-sharing outside the formal college meetings and the development of a
shared agenda for addressing risks and vulnerabilities. They also incorporate recent
developments, such as the formation of crisis management groups and greater
focus on macroprudential considerations.
Supervisory guidelines for identifying and dealing with weak banks. In mid-2015, the
Committee expects to publish final guidelines for supervisors to help identify and
deal with weak banks. The guidelines, which replace the original guidance first
published in 2002, will provide a toolkit for supervisors and international financial
institutions advising supervisors. They will offer practical information relating to
problem identification, corrective action, resolution techniques and exit strategies
and highlight, in particular, the importance of early identification and preparation,
and close international cooperation.
Corporate governance principles. In October 2014, the Committee released
proposals for further enhancing its principles on corporate governance at banks.

BIS 85th Annual Report

141

Effective corporate governance is critical to the proper functioning of the banking
sector and the economy as a whole. The Committee’s revised principles provide a
framework for robust and transparent risk management and decision-making at
banks. The revised principles strengthen the guidance on risk governance and the
importance of a sound risk culture; expand the guidance on the role of the board
of directors; and provide guidance for supervisors in evaluating the processes used
by banks to select board members and senior management. The Committee
expects to finalise the principles in mid-2015.
Guidance on accounting for expected credit losses. This consultative document,
published in February 2015, outlines supervisory expectations for implementing
and applying an expected credit loss (ECL) accounting framework at banks. This
guidance will replace the Committee’s June 2006 supervisory guidance on Sound
credit risk assessment and valuation for loans, which was based on the incurred-loss
model of accounting. The proposed guidance is consistent with the applicable
accounting standards established by the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB) and other standard setters.

Committee on the Global Financial System
The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) monitors financial market
developments for the Governors of the BIS Global Economy Meeting and analyses
the implications of these developments for financial stability and central bank
policy. The CGFS is chaired by William C Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. The Committee’s members are Deputy Governors and other
senior officials from 23 central banks of major advanced and emerging market
economies as well as the BIS’s Head of Monetary and Economic Department and
its Economic Adviser.
Among the topics discussed by the Committee during the past year were the
challenges posed by the increasing divergence of macroeconomic conditions
among the major advanced economies, which implies that different countries will
need to adjust their monetary policy to different degrees and at different times.
The Committee paid particular attention to the possible financial market effects
that this process of asynchronous monetary policy normalisation might have in
both advanced and emerging market economies. The Committee also reviewed the
macroprudential measures taken by various country authorities to address
vulnerabilities arising from the current macro-financial environment and found that
the effectiveness of these policies remained uncertain. Another key topic was the
existence of “pockets of risk” in particular sectors, including among emerging
market corporates such as property developers, given their rising leverage and
foreign currency exposures. Also discussed were the possible implications of market
disturbances (such as mid-October’s “flash rally” in US Treasury securities), lessons
from the ECB’s asset quality review and stress test, and the financial stability
implications of falling commodity prices.
In addition, a number of in-depth analyses were commissioned from groups
of central bank experts. Two of these groups produced public reports during the
year.
Market-making and proprietary trading in fixed income markets. This report, issued
in November 2014, identified signs of increased fragility in fixed income markets,
together with liquidity bifurcation as market-making activity was concentrated in

142

BIS 85th Annual Report

the most liquid instruments and weakened in the less liquid ones. The underlying
causes were seen as both conjunctural and structural, and it was difficult to provide
a definitive overall assessment of their impact on market liquidity. Given signs that
liquidity risks were broadly underpriced in the run-up to the financial crisis, it
seemed desirable that the compressed pricing of market-making services seen in
the past would give way to liquidity premia that are more consistent with actual
market-making capacity and costs. On this basis, the report outlined a number of
policy options that, if pursued, would make this outcome more likely.
Central bank operating frameworks and collateral markets. Produced jointly with
the Markets Committee for publication in March 2015, the report examined how
far central bank operational frameworks influence private collateral markets,
including collateral availability, pricing, related market practices, and market
performance under stress. After reviewing the evidence for the effects of different
central bank choices on collateral markets and their scope, the report suggested a
number of metrics and other tools that could aid central banks in their assessments
of how their operational choices may affect these markets.

Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures
The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures2 (CPMI) promotes the safety
and efficiency of payment, clearing, settlement and reporting systems and
arrangements, thereby supporting financial stability and the wider economy.
Comprising senior officials from 25 central banks, the CPMI is a global standard
setter that aims to strengthen regulation, policy and practices in this field worldwide.
It also serves as a forum for central banks to monitor and analyse developments
concerning payment, clearing, settlement and reporting within and across
jurisdictions and to cooperate in related oversight, policy and operational matters,
including the provision of central bank services. The Committee Chair is Benoît
Cœuré, a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank.

Monitoring implementation of standards for financial market infrastructures
The CPMI-IOSCO Principles for financial market infrastructures (PFMI), published in
April 2012, set out international standards for systemically important FMIs and
specify the responsibilities for the authorities that oversee or regulate them.
Monitoring the implementation of the PFMI is a high priority for the CPMI and
involves three phases: Level 1, on the PFMI’s adoption in domestic regulatory
frameworks; Level 2, on the completeness and consistency of these regulatory
frameworks; and Level 3, on the consistency in the outcomes of the PFMI’s
implementation across jurisdictions.
In May 2014, the CPMI and IOSCO published a progress update on Level 1 of
the implementation monitoring, which showed that the 28 participating jurisdictions
are making significant progress, even if that progress continues to vary depending
on the type of FMI. In 2014, the CPMI and IOSCO initiated Level 2 assessments for
central counterparties (CCPs) and trade repositories in the European Union, Japan
and the United States. The associated reports were published in February 2015 and
showed an overall high level of consistency for these jurisdictions, especially for
CCPs. Further Level 2 assessments will be conducted in subsequent rounds. In

The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) changed its name to the Committee
on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) on 1 September 2014.

BIS 85th Annual Report

143

addition, in late 2014 the CPMI and IOSCO started an assessment of the observance
of responsibilities by authorities.
The following additional guidance is related to the PFMI:
•
Recovery of financial market infrastructures. In October 2014, the CPMI and
IOSCO published the final report on Recovery of financial market infrastructures.
The report gives guidance to financial market infrastructures such as CCPs on
developing plans to enable them to recover from threats to their viability and
financial strength that might prevent them from continuing to provide critical
services.
•
Critical service providers. The CPMI published in December 2014 the final
version of the Assessment methodology for the oversight expectations applicable
to critical service providers. The document provides guidance that will help
competent authorities assess FMIs’ critical service providers against the
oversight expectations included in Annex F of the PFMI.
•
Quantitative disclosure. In February 2015, the CPMI and IOSCO published
guidance on the quantitative data that should be regularly disclosed by CCPs.
The PFMI state that an FMI should make relevant information publicly available
so that the risks related to the CCPs can be properly understood. This new
guidance complements the Disclosure framework issued in December 2012,
which primarily covers qualitative data.

Collateral management services
The report on Developments in collateral management services, published by the
CPMI in September 2014, describes how such services are changing to address
increased collateral demand. It shows how service providers are aiming to give their
customers improved tools for monitoring their securities holdings and deploying
those securities more efficiently. The report highlights the benefits of these
innovations as well as the associated increases in complexity and operational risk.

Harmonisation of OTC derivatives data
In November 2014, the CPMI and IOSCO set up a working group to develop
guidance on the harmonisation of key OTC derivatives data, including uniform
transaction and product identifiers. Initial consultations will be held in 2015.

Retail payments
The CPMI’s report on Non-banks in retail payments, published in September 2014,
analyses the growing importance of non-banks in retail payments, the possible risks
and the differing regulatory approaches of CPMI jurisdictions. The Committee
continues to study the impact of a variety of retail payment developments such as
faster payment services and the interplay of these services with mobile and internet
payments. It is also monitoring developments in decentralised virtual currency
schemes.

Cyber resilience in FMIs
The CPMI’s report on Cyber resilience in financial market infrastructures, published
in November 2014, notes the importance of an integrated and comprehensive
approach to the cyber resilience of FMIs and the need for international cooperation
in this area. The publication aims to raise awareness of the systemic implications of
cyber attacks on FMIs. Building on this work, the CPMI and IOSCO have started

144

BIS 85th Annual Report

jointly investigating whether FMIs would benefit from further guidance on cyber
resilience.

Red Book statistics
The CPMI published in December 2014 its annual update of the Statistics on
payment, clearing and settlement systems in the CPMI countries.

Markets Committee
The Markets Committee is a forum where senior central bank officials jointly
monitor developments in financial markets and assess their implications for market
functioning and central bank operations. With a membership comprising 21 central
banks, the Committee is chaired by Guy Debelle, Assistant Governor of the Reserve
Bank of Australia.
The Committee’s discussions during the year were shaped by the divergent
monetary policy prospects of the major central banks as well as by falling
commodity prices. Among the topics discussed were the drivers of asset price
volatility, central bank purchase programmes for private and public sector assets,
changes to monetary policy implementation in China, liquidity issues in the
Japanese government bond markets, market expectations of prospective policy rate
normalisation in the United States, and the aftermath of the discontinuation of the
minimum exchange rate of the euro against the Swiss franc in mid-January,
including the fallout in the retail FX sector. The impact of these developments on
emerging market economies was closely studied.
In addition to monitoring near-term market developments, the Committee also
considered longer-term structural market issues such as the international efforts to
make reform recommendations for benchmarks in FX markets, the UK Fair and
Effective Markets Review, and money market functioning in a negative rate
environment. In January 2015, the Committee held a workshop with private sector
participants on electronic trading in fixed income markets.
Jointly with the CGFS, the Committee produced a report on Central bank
operating frameworks and collateral markets (see CGFS section above for details)
and reviewed the design of the BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign
Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity in preparation for the next version in
2016.
Markets Committee: www.bis.org/markets

Central Bank Governance Group
The Central Bank Governance Group comprises nine central bank Governors and is
chaired by Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia. It serves as a
venue for information exchange on the design and operation of central banks as
public policy institutions. The Group also suggests priorities for BIS work carried out
on these topics through the almost 50 central banks that make up the Central Bank
Governance Network. Central bank officials have access to the results of numerous
surveys on governance topics conducted among Network central banks as well as
other governance research, and selected material is published.
The Governance Group convened during several BIS bimonthly meetings to
study the evolving circumstances of central banks. The Group discussed the auditing

BIS 85th Annual Report

145

and review arrangements for central banks and their reporting obligations, and the
governance arrangements for decisions on emergency lending by central banks.
The information and insights provided help central banks assess the effectiveness
of their own arrangements as well as the alternatives available.

Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics
The Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC) is a forum for central
bank economists and statisticians to address statistical topics related to monetary
and financial stability. Governed by the international central banking community, it
is hosted by the BIS and associated with the International Statistical Institute (ISI).
The IFC has 83 institutional members, including almost all BIS shareholder central
banks, and is currently chaired by Turalay Kenç, Deputy Governor of the Central
Bank of the Republic of Turkey.
The IFC organised several activities in 2014 with the support of its member
central banks and a number of international organisations. One notable project was
the production of a report on data-sharing between statistical and supervisory
authorities, which outlines a range of good practice and guidance to foster
cooperation in this area. In addition, the Committee set up a Global Network of
Balance of Payments (BoP) Compilers, which will facilitate the stocktaking of central
banks’ practices and the sharing of experience in BoP issues. The IFC also supported
international initiatives on the development of sectoral financial accounts,
potentially a key component of financial stability analyses. Lastly, it furthered its
work on the measurement of financial inclusion and related challenges, in close
liaison with financial standard-setting bodies.
In terms of meetings, a key event was the seventh biennial IFC conference held
in September 2014 to review the statistical implications of the evolving functions
and objectives of modern central banks. The IFC also participated in the 2014 Asian
Regional Statistics Conference organised by the ISI, which reviewed the challenges
posed by increasing household debt in Asia. Finally, it organised with the ECB a
virtual seminar on big data, which represent a new source of financial and economic
information that could be mobilised by central banks to take timely policy measures
and assess the impact of their actions.

Financial Stability Institute
Jointly created by the BIS and the BCBS, the Financial Stability Institute (FSI) assists
supervisory authorities and central banks worldwide in strengthening their financial
systems. The FSI pursues this mandate by fostering a solid understanding of
international financial standards through a range of activities, including high-level
meetings; seminars and conferences; FSI Connect, the BIS’s online information and
learning tool; and monitoring of the implementation of Basel standards in nonBCBS member jurisdictions.

High-level meetings
Aimed at the Deputy Governors of central banks and heads of supervisory
authorities, high-level meetings are a key part of the FSI programme of activities.
Jointly organised with the BCBS, they have taken place annually for more than a

146

BIS 85th Annual Report

decade in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East and, occasionally, in
central and eastern Europe. They focus on policy discussions relating to global
banking standards, emerging financial developments and regional implementation
issues.
In 2014, the key themes discussed at these meetings included the impact of
Basel III on banks’ business models; the trade-offs between risk sensitivity, simplicity
and comparability in the international banking standards; the coexistence of the
risk-based capital standards for banks with the leverage ratio; and requirements
for global and domestic systemically important banks and their cross-border
implications.

Seminars and conferences
The 2014 FSI programme comprised 50 events that were attended by about 1,800
central bankers and financial sector supervisors. They included 38 banking events,
of which 10 took place in Switzerland and 28 in other jurisdictions. The events in
other jurisdictions were organised in cooperation with 15 regional supervisory
groups.3 The main topics covered included the Basel III requirements for liquidity
risk; the regulation and supervision of systemically important banks; and the
implementation of macroprudential policies and stress-testing methodologies.
Also during 2014, the FSI held nine insurance seminars in collaboration with
the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and its regional
network. One of these events was a virtual seminar for 119 insurance supervisors
from 36 jurisdictions, using a series of five webinars and selected FSI Connect
tutorials. This was the first time that the FSI had delivered a virtual seminar.
The remaining three FSI events were directed at supervisory authorities across
financial sectors. One was a conference sponsored by the G20’s Global Partnership
for Financial Inclusion and focused on recent financial standards and their impact
on technology-driven approaches to financial inclusion. The other two events were
co-organised with the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) and the
International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) dealing with the
latest work of these standard setters.

FSI Connect
With more than 10,000 subscribers from over 300 central banks and banking or
insurance authorities, FSI Connect offers more than 250 tutorials covering a wide
range of regulatory policy and supervisory topics. The 16 tutorials released during
2014 covered key supervisory topics, including the international response to
the too-big-to-fail problem; reforms to the over-the-counter derivatives market;
policy measures for global systemically important insurers; and the supervisory
implications of the recognition, classification and measurement of financial
instruments under IFRS 9.

Monitoring implementation of Basel standards in non-BCBS members
The FSI annually surveys non-BCBS members on their implementation of the Basel III
framework. The results of this survey are part of the annual BCBS report to the
G20 Leaders. In 2014, 116 countries worldwide, including BCBS member
jurisdictions, had implemented or were in the process of implementing Basel III.

Activities of BIS-hosted associations
This section reviews the year’s principal activities of the three associations hosted
by the BIS in Basel.

Financial Stability Board
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) coordinates at the international level the financial
stability work of national authorities and international standard-setting bodies, and
develops and promotes financial sector policies to enhance global financial stability.
Its constitution, membership and framework of committees and management are
set out in the FSB’s Annual Report. The FSB is chaired by Mark Carney, Governor of
the Bank of England.
The FSB was active in a wide range of areas during the year, and several of its
policy initiatives were endorsed at the November 2014 Brisbane Summit of the G20
Leaders.

Reducing the moral hazard posed by systemically important financial
institutions
The FSB’s framework to address the systemic risks and moral hazard associated with
systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) contains three key elements:
•
a resolution framework to ensure that all financial institutions can be quickly
resolved without destabilising the financial system and exposing the taxpayer
to risk of loss;
•
higher loss absorbency to reflect the greater risks; and
•
more intense supervisory oversight.
Resolution of SIFIs. The FSB in October 2014 reissued the Key attributes of effective
resolution regimes for financial institutions (“the Key Attributes”) to incorporate
guidance on their application to non-bank financial institutions and on arrangements
for information-sharing that support the effective resolution of cross-border
financial institutions. The FSB also published consultative documents on:
•
cross-border recognition of resolution action (September 2014);
•
recovery and resolution planning for systemically important insurers and
identification of critical functions and critical shared services (October 2014);
and
•
cooperation and information-sharing with host authorities of jurisdictions
not represented in crisis management groups where a G-SIFI has a systemic
presence (October 2014).
In November 2014, the FSB published a report to the G20 on progress in the
reform of resolution regimes and resolution planning for G-SIFIs. This sets out

148

BIS 85th Annual Report

further actions to implement the Key Attributes fully in substance and in scope. It
also describes the initial results of the Resolvability Assessment Process, which
assesses the resolvability of G-SIFIs at the level of senior officials of the firm’s home
and key host authorities. The FSB will continue monitoring implementation of the
Key Attributes to support implementation across all financial sectors.
The FSB also published proposals on the loss-absorbing and recapitalisation
capacity of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). These were developed in
consultation with the BCBS and are intended to form a new minimum standard for
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). These proposals should demonstrate that
G-SIBs have sufficient capacity to absorb losses as part of a resolution strategy that
minimises the impact on financial stability and ensures the continuity of critical
economic functions. The FSB is working with the BCBS and the BIS to undertake
comprehensive impact assessment studies to inform the calibration of the Pillar 1
element of the TLAC requirement for all G-SIBs.
Higher loss absorbency. In November 2014, the FSB published the updated list of 30
G-SIBs using end-2013 data and the updated assessment methodology published
by the BCBS in July 2013. In addition, the FSB, following consultation with the IAIS
and national authorities, identified for 2014 the nine global systemically important
insurers (G-SIIs) identified in 2013 and postponed a decision on the G-SII status of
reinsurers, pending the IAIS’s work to develop the methodology.
More intense supervisory oversight. In April 2014, the FSB published a progress
report on enhanced supervision, which describes the changes in supervisory
practices since the financial crisis and identifies areas where more work is needed,
and Guidance on supervisory interaction with financial institutions on risk culture,
which sets out a framework to assist supervisors in their assessment of risk culture
at firms.
Extending the framework. The FSB and standard-setting bodies are extending the
SIFI framework to additional types of financial institutions, and work continues
on the Assessment methodologies for identifying non-bank non-insurer global
systemically important financial institutions that was published for consultation in
January 2014.

Improving the OTC derivatives markets
The FSB published further progress reports on implementation of OTC derivatives
market reforms in April and November, and in October a report on member
jurisdictions’ ability to defer to others’ regulatory regimes. The FSB in September
2014 published a feasibility study on the aggregation of OTC derivatives trade
repository data and has also launched a peer review of trade reporting, with a final
report expected around mid-2015.

Transforming shadow banking into resilient market-based finance
In November 2014, the FSB released its fourth annual monitoring report on the
global trends and risks of the shadow banking system (credit intermediation
involving entities and activities outside the regulated banking system), including
innovations and changes that could lead to growing systemic risks and regulatory
arbitrage. This presents data as of end-2013 from 25 jurisdictions and the euro area
as a whole, covering about 80% of global GDP and 90% of global financial system
assets.

BIS 85th Annual Report

149

In October 2014, the FSB published the Regulatory framework for haircuts on
non-centrally cleared securities financing transactions, including proposals on
numerical haircut floors for non-bank-to-non-bank transactions to ensure that
shadow banking activities are fully covered, reduce the risk of regulatory arbitrage
and maintain a level playing field. This work should be completed by end-June
2015, with implementation by the end of 2017.
In cooperation with market participants, the FSB also developed for public
consultation Standards and processes for global securities financing data collection
and aggregation, which aim to enhance reporting and transparency of data relevant
for financial stability monitoring and policy responses.

Reducing reliance on credit rating agency ratings
The FSB published in May 2014 the final peer review report on national authorities’
implementation of the FSB Principles for reducing reliance on CRA ratings. This
showed uneven progress towards the removal of references to credit rating agency
(CRA) ratings from standards, laws and regulations across jurisdictions and
the financial sector. The key challenge is to develop alternative standards of
creditworthiness and processes so that CRA ratings are not the sole input to credit
risk assessment.

Financial benchmarks
An Official Sector Steering Group (OSSG) of regulators and central banks published
a report in July 2014 which set out proposals, plans and timelines for the reform
and strengthening of existing major interest rate benchmarks and for additional
work on the development and introduction of alternative benchmarks. The OSSG
will continue to monitor and oversee the implementation of the reforms set out in
the report.
In September 2014, the FSB published a report on foreign exchange rate
benchmarks, setting out recommendations for reform in the FX markets and in the
benchmark rates that have been identified as the most important by market
participants.

Addressing data gaps
The FSB has developed a common data template for G-SIBs to analyse their
exposures and funding dependencies by counterparty, and concentration by
country, sector, currency, maturity and instrument. An initial set of these data has
been collected since 2013 by an international data hub hosted by the BIS, with the
initiative planned for completion in 2016. In September 2014, the FSB and IMF
published their Fifth progress report on the implementation of the G-20 data gaps
initiative, reporting enhancements on data available for policy work, surveillance,
financial stability and debt analysis.

Advancing transparency through the legal entity identifier
The objective of the global legal entity identifier (LEI) system is to provide unique
identification of parties to financial transactions across the globe. The Global LEI
Foundation was officially established by the FSB in June 2014 as a not-for-profit
foundation under Swiss law to act as the operational arm of the LEI system under
the oversight of the LEI Regulatory Oversight Committee.

150

BIS 85th Annual Report

Strengthening accounting standards
The G20 and FSB support the development of a single set of high-quality global
accounting standards. The International Accounting Standards Board and the
Financial Accounting Standards Board are developing new standards that introduce
forward-looking expected loss provisions for loan losses, and the FSB has
encouraged them to monitor consistent implementation of their standards and
continue to seek opportunities for further convergence. The FSB held a roundtable
of key stakeholders to discuss these issues in April 2015.

Enhanced Disclosure Task Force
The Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) is a private sector initiative to enhance
the risk disclosure practices of major banks. It issued principles and recommendations
for such disclosures in October 2012, and published two surveys (in 2013 and 2014)
of the level and quality of implementation in the major banks’ annual reports. The
FSB has asked the EDTF to undertake another survey in 2015.

Monitoring implementation and strengthening adherence to international
standards
The FSB’s Coordination Framework for Implementation Monitoring mandates that
implementation of reforms in priority areas (those deemed by the FSB to be
particularly important for global financial stability) should be subject to more
intensive monitoring and detailed reporting. The current list of priority areas
comprises the Basel III framework; OTC derivatives market reforms; compensation
practices; policy measures for G-SIFIs; resolution frameworks; and shadow banking.
Detailed reporting of implementation progress in all of these areas, conducted in
cooperation with relevant standard-setting bodies, is continuing.
The FSB’s most intensive monitoring mechanism is the peer review programme,
which evaluates member jurisdictions’ adoption of international financial standards
and FSB policies. In addition to thematic peer reviews, the FSB completed in 2014
the country peer reviews of Indonesia, Germany and the Netherlands.
In December 2014, the FSB published its fourth annual update on global
adherence to regulatory and supervisory standards on international cooperation
and information exchange. This provides information on all jurisdictions evaluated
under the initiative.

Impact of regulatory reforms on emerging market and developing
economies
As requested by the G20, the FSB reports on the significant unintended consequences
in emerging market and developing economies of internationally agreed reforms
and on measures taken to address them. In November 2014, the FSB published an
update of monitoring developments, drawing upon discussions in FSB workstreams
and Regional Consultative Groups as well as input by standard-setting bodies and
international financial institutions from their own monitoring and assessment processes.

Financial regulatory factors affecting the availability of long-term finance
and other reforms
In August 2013, the FSB updated the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank
Governors on financial regulatory factors affecting the supply of long-term

BIS 85th Annual Report

151

investment finance. The FSB’s monitoring of this issue will continue as part of a
broader study of long-term finance being undertaken for the G20 by international
organisations.
In October 2014, the FSB, working with the IMF and OECD and in response to a
request from the G20, published a report on potential cross-border financial
stability implications related to national structural banking reforms. The FSB will
monitor developments related to these reforms and has undertaken to report again
to the G20 in 2016.

International Association of Deposit Insurers
The International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) is the global standardsetting body for deposit insurance systems. It contributes to the stability of financial
systems by advancing standards and guidance for effective deposit insurance and
promoting international cooperation among deposit insurers, bank resolution
authorities and other safety net organisations.
The number of organisations affiliated with IADI stands at 99, comprising 79
deposit insurers as members, seven central banks and bank supervisors as associates,
and 13 institutional partners. The membership has grown by one fifth in the past two
years, thanks to the outreach within the IADI regions. Almost 70% of all jurisdictions
with explicit deposit insurance systems are represented within IADI’s membership.
Jerzy Pruski, President of the Management Board of Poland’s Bank Guarantee
Fund, serves as the President of IADI and the Chair of its Executive Council.
During the year, IADI continued to focus on the strategic priorities established

Core principles for effective deposit insurance systems
IADI guidance on establishing and enhancing deposit insurance schemes is outlined
in the Core principles for effective deposit insurance systems. In October 2014, IADI
and its international partners completed their update of the Core Principles,
drawing on lessons learned from the financial crisis of 2007–09, which demonstrated
the importance of maintaining depositor confidence in the financial system and the
key role that depositor protection plays in preserving that confidence.
The revised Core Principles strengthen the current standards in several areas,
including speed of reimbursement, deposit insurance coverage, funding and
governance, adding more guidance on the roles deposit insurers should play in
crisis preparedness, crisis management and resolution regimes. The revised Core
Principles seek to strike an appropriate balance between improving the effectiveness
of deposit insurance systems and maintaining the flexibility required for an
internationally applicable standard.
As a component of the FSB Compendium of 12 Key Standards for Sound
Financial Systems, the IADI Core Principles are used by the IMF and World Bank in
the context of the Financial Sector Assessment Program reviews as well as by
individual jurisdictions to assess the effectiveness of their deposit insurance systems
and practices.

IADI’s International Conference and events
The Revised Core Principles were the focus of IADI’s 14th Annual General Meeting
and International Conference, held in October 2014 in Port of Spain, Trinidad and

152

BIS 85th Annual Report

Tobago. The conference outlined the challenges in advancing the understanding of
and compliance with the revised Core Principles as well as their applicability to a
diverse range of deposit insurance mandates, settings and structures.
In September 2014, IADI and the FSI held their fourth annual joint seminar on
bank resolution, crisis management and deposit insurance issues. Since 2008, IADI,
in cooperation with the FSI, has produced eight online tutorials on deposit
insurance systems.
IADI also hosted global and regional seminars on various topics, including:
deposit insurance funding; bail-in and deposit insurance; cross-border cooperation
and implementation of effective recovery resolution planning; cross-border
cooperation for capacity-building; effective delivery of deposit insurance services;
and global trends and effective practices on deposit insurance and bank resolution.
These topics inform IADI’s research agenda to better reflect the role of deposit
insurance in financial stability.

Enhancement of IADI’s research framework
IADI made further progress with research projects on enhanced guidance for ex ante
funding and multiple deposit insurance systems, the role of deposit insurers in bail-in
mechanisms, and the evolution of integrated protection schemes, and it released two
research papers on Islamic deposit insurance systems. IADI has also begun research
initiatives on trends and guidance for establishing a deposit insurance fund target
ratio, a bank resolution tool for purchasing assets and assuming deposit liabilities,
and the unique characteristics of a resolution strategy for failing credit unions.
Furthermore, the IADI Secretariat has been enhanced by the establishment of a
small research unit. The unit supports IADI’s membership in the FSB Resolution
Steering Group, including IADI’s contribution to the workstream on funding
resolution conducted under the FSB’s cross-border crisis management committee.
IADI has enhanced its database of global deposit insurance systems through
updates from research surveys, including its own annual online survey on deposit
insurance, the latest of which received a record number of respondents.

International Association of Insurance Supervisors
The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is the global standardsetting body for the insurance sector. Its purpose is to promote effective and
globally consistent supervision and contribute to global financial stability so that
policyholders benefit from fair, safe and stable insurance markets. Felix Hufeld,
President of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), chairs the
IAIS Executive Committee.

New five-year strategic plan, organisational reforms
In October 2014, the general meeting approved the last phase of a comprehensive
multi-year strategic, structural and procedural reform initiative. The Strategic plan
and financial outlook 2015–19 stresses the IAIS’s role as the thought leader for
global insurance. The IAIS also improved its governance structure by discontinuing
the right to private sector observership, and it adopted new policies and procedures
to increase transparency and promote efficiency in its engagement with stakeholders.

Macroprudential surveillance
In December 2014, the IAIS released an internet-based toolkit to assist its members
in designing and conducting macroprudential surveillance. The toolkit includes
basic and advanced macroprudential indicators and allows a member to input data
from its own jurisdiction for benchmarking against regional and worldwide data.
The IAIS will continue to refine and supplement the toolkit.

Supporting material
In October 2014, the IAIS adopted issues papers on combating bribery and
corruption and on approaches to group corporate governance, focused on the
impact for control functions. It also adopted application papers on approaches to
conduct of business supervision and on supervisory colleges.

ComFrame
In order to address the complexity and operational scope of internationally active
insurance groups (IAIGs), the IAIS has since 2011 been designing ComFrame – a
Common Framework for the Supervision of IAIGs. ComFrame is a set of international
supervisory requirements focusing on the effective group-wide supervision of IAIGs
(qualitative, quantitative and supervisory processes), building upon and expanding
the high-level requirements currently set out in the IAIS Insurance Core Principles
(ICPs). ComFrame is designed to assist supervisors in collectively addressing groupwide activities and risks, identifying and avoiding regulatory gaps, and coordinating
supervisory actions under the remit of a group-wide supervisor. Field testing of
ComFrame began in 2014 in conjunction with more than 30 large international
firms. This phase will continue until 2018, when ComFrame is scheduled for formal
adoption. Members are to begin implementation of ComFrame in 2019.

Global insurance capital standards
In October 2014, the IAIS finalised the first ever global insurance capital standard,
the Basic Capital Requirements (BCR) for global systemically important insurers
(G‑SIIs). The BCR represents the first step of a long-term project to develop riskbased, group-wide global insurance capital standards. The second step is the
development of higher loss absorbency requirements for G-SIIs, due to be
completed by end-2015. The final step will be a risk-based group-wide global
insurance capital standard (ICS) within ComFrame, applying to IAIGs and due to be
developed by the end of 2016. It will be further refined and tested before being
applied to IAIGs from 2019.

Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding
Insurance supervisors that are signatories to the IAIS Multilateral Memorandum of
Understanding (MMoU) participate in a global framework for cooperation and
information exchange. The memorandum sets minimum standards to which
signatories must adhere, and all applicants are subject to review and approval by
an independent team of IAIS members. By participating in the MMoU, supervisors
are better able to promote the financial stability of cross-border insurance
operations for the benefit of consumers. Six new signatories joined the MMoU
during the year, bringing the total number of signatory authorities to 45 jurisdictions
representing more than 62% of worldwide premium volume.

154

BIS 85th Annual Report

Coordinated Implementation Framework
The Coordinated Implementation Framework (CIF), adopted in October 2013,
brings together the IAIS approach to implementing its supervisory material. The CIF
sets forth key principles that provide guidance to the work programme, which
encompasses various initiatives to assess and identify its members’ observance of
IAIS ICPs. This information is then used to inform the programme of supervisory
development, which is executed through regional outreach and the development
of regional implementation plans.
Central to the CIF is leveraging the work of partners such as the Financial
Stability Institute, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Another key
partner is the Access to Insurance Initiative (A2ii), which advances capacity-building
in inclusive insurance markets, a key focus for standard-setting bodies under the
G20’s Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion.

Self-assessment and peer reviews
As part of a comprehensive programme covering all the ICPs, in October the IAIS
released its aggregate report containing the findings from a self-assessment and
peer review conducted on ICP 4 (Licensing), ICP 5 (Suitability of Persons), ICP 7
(Corporate Governance) and ICP 8 (Risk Management and Internal Controls). The
IAIS aims to review all ICPs by the end of 2016. The outcome of these assessments
will help identify areas in which the ICPs may need to be revised; the results also
feed into IAIS education activities.

Economic analysis, research and statistics
The BIS’s in-depth economic analysis and research on monetary and financial
stability policy issues is conducted by its Monetary and Economic Department
(MED). Researchers are located at the head office in Basel and at the BIS
Representative Offices in Hong Kong SAR and Mexico City. The BIS also compiles
and disseminates international statistics on financial institutions and markets.
Through its economic analysis, research and statistics, the BIS helps to meet the
needs of monetary and supervisory authorities for policy insight and data.

Analysis and research in the Basel Process
Analysis and research at the BIS are the cornerstone of its background notes for
meetings, analytical support for the Basel-based Committees, and the Bank’s own
publications. Research seeks to strike a balance between responsiveness to shortterm issues and proactiveness in identifying what will become key themes in future.
Collaborative efforts with central bank and academic researchers stimulate
broad dialogue on the policy questions that merit deeper study. To promote such
engagements, the BIS set up in 2014 a Central Bank Research Fellowship (CBRF)
Programme, which complements the visiting fellows programme for academic
researchers. And, as a broader forum for interactions between researchers from
academia and central banks, a BIS Research Network (BISRN) was launched at a
conference in September 2014. The BISRN is intended as an informal grouping of
active researchers from academia and central banks who meet at regular
conferences to share research findings on monetary and financial stability.

BIS 85th Annual Report

155

The BIS also organises conferences and workshops to bring together
participants from policy, research and business. The flagship event for central bank
Governors is the BIS Annual Conference. In June 2014, the 13th BIS Annual
Conference focused on rising debt in the financial system, the economics of credit
booms, and the resulting policy challenges.
Most BIS analysis and research is published on the Bank’s website, and in the
Annual Report, the BIS Quarterly Review, BIS Papers and BIS Working Papers. BIS
economists also publish in professional journals and other external publications.
BIS research: www.bis.org/forum/research.htm

Research topics
Reflecting the Bank’s mission, BIS research centres on monetary and financial
stability. Special attention is given to changes in financial intermediation;
new frameworks for monetary and financial stability policy; and the global
economy and spillovers. Under these headings, the specific topics taken up in
the year included financial risk-taking versus risk-taking in the real economy;
the interaction of monetary policy and macroprudential policies; pre- and postboom resource misallocations; macroeconomic and financial implications of
falling oil prices; and channels of cross-border monetary spillovers and sovereign
credit risk.
The research on financial intermediation aims at understanding the interaction
between institutions and financial markets. Analysing the way different
intermediaries operate and markets function is an important foundation for this
work. The perspectives gained help policymakers evaluate changes in the
regulatory environment for financial stability and monetary policies, nationally
and internationally. They underpin the monitoring of financial vulnerabilities and
cross-border spillovers, and they inform the design of regulation and supervision,
crisis management tools and resolution techniques as well as various aspects
of monetary policy frameworks, including strategy, tactics and day-to-day
implementation.
Over the past year, work in this area has included research on the risks
associated with increased market-based intermediation, rapidly rising debt issuance
by emerging market corporates, post-crisis changes in bank business models, and
banks’ adjustments to new capital regulation.
Research on post-crisis monetary and financial stability policy frameworks aims
to strengthen the analytical foundations of central bank policy. The gap between
the theory and practice of central bank policy has widened as central banks have
adopted increasingly unconventional measures, and the lines between policies
targeting financial, macroeconomic and price stability have become increasingly
blurred.
Specific projects in this area have studied the cost of deflations during the past
140 years; the effectiveness of unconventional central bank policies and the
associated exit challenges; and the links between liquidity regulation and central
banks’ role as lender of last resort.
Research on the global economy and spillovers focuses on how monetary and
financial stability is affected by the tight real and financial integration of the global
economy. The importance of such spillovers is reflected in the increasingly popular
notion of “global liquidity”, in both academic and policy circles.
Research in this area during the year took up the strengths and weaknesses in
the international monetary and financial system; the global role of the dollar; the
mechanisms that drive global credit growth; the spillovers from unconventional

156

BIS 85th Annual Report

monetary policies; and drivers for lending and borrowing decisions at internationally
active banks. The BIS international banking statistics provide key information for
these studies.

International statistical initiatives
The BIS’s unique set of international banking and financial statistics underpins
the Basel Process by supporting the analysis of global financial stability. This
involves close cooperation with other financial international organisations,
especially through the BIS’s participation in the Inter-Agency Group on Economic
and Financial Statistics (IAG). This is the body tasked with closing the data gaps
revealed by the financial crisis, in accord with the FSB and IMF recommendations to
the G20.4
To close such gaps, the CGFS approved in 2011–12 enhancements to a key set
of BIS data, the international banking statistics reported by central banks under the
guidance of the CGFS. Completed in early 2015, these enhancements extend the
coverage of the locational and consolidated banking statistics from banks’
international activities to their domestic positions, and provide more information
on banks’ counterparties, specifically on their location and sector.
The BIS also publishes a variety of other statistics on its website, including
indicators on derivatives, debt securities, effective exchange rates, foreign exchange
markets, payment systems, property prices, credit to the private sector and global
liquidity. This statistical work focuses on long-term financial stability indicators to
support the BIS’s own research agenda as well as the initiatives of the Basel Process
and the G20. It relies extensively on the Data Bank, which contains, in particular, key
economic indicators shared among BIS member central banks. These data are being
expanded, and new tables and charts introduced, as part of further revisions to the
BIS’s statistical publications that will be implemented in September 2015.
Finally, the BIS hosts the International Data Hub, where information about
systemically important financial institutions is stored and analysed on behalf of a
limited number of participating supervisory authorities. The analysis is meant to
help participating supervisors engage with G-SIBs and to enrich the dialogue
between supervisors across jurisdictions. The first phase of this initiative, covering
firms’ credit exposures, was completed in 2013. The second phase, now under way,
will assemble data covering these firms’ funding dependencies.

Cooperation with other central bank initiatives
The BIS contributes to the activities of central banks and regional central bank
organisations. During the past year, it cooperated with these groups on the topics
outlined below:
•
CEMLA (Center for Latin American Monetary Studies) – foreign exchange
intervention, payment and settlement systems, and regional banking
integration;
•
FLAR (Latin American Reserve Fund) – reserves management;
4

The IAG comprises the BIS, the ECB, Eurostat, the IMF, the OECD, the United Nations and the World
Bank (www.principalglobalindicators.org). These organisations also sponsor the Statistical Data and
Metadata Exchange (SDMX), whose standards the BIS uses for its collection, processing and
dissemination of statistics (www.sdmx.org).

World Bank – governance and oversight of central bank reserves management.

Financial services
Through its Banking Department, the BIS offers a wide range of financial services
designed to support the reserves management activities of central banks and other
official monetary authorities, and to foster international cooperation in this area.
Some 140 institutions, as well as a number of international organisations, make use
of these services.
Safety and liquidity are the key features of BIS credit intermediation, which is
supported by rigorous internal risk management. Independent control units
reporting directly to the BIS Deputy General Manager monitor and control the
related risks. A compliance and operational risk unit monitors operational risk, while
financial risks – ie credit, liquidity and market risks – are overseen by a risk control
unit that is also responsible for ensuring an integrated approach to risk management.
BIS financial services are provided from two linked trading rooms: one in Basel,
at the Bank’s head office; and one in Hong Kong SAR, at its Representative Office
for Asia and the Pacific.

Scope of services
As an institution owned and governed by central banks, the BIS is well placed to
understand the needs of reserves managers – their primary focus on safety and
liquidity as well as their evolving need to diversify the exposures arising from
growing foreign exchange reserves. To meet those needs, the BIS offers investments
that vary by currency, maturity and liquidity. In addition, the Bank provides shortterm liquidity facilities and extends credit to central banks, usually on a collateralised

basis. Moreover, the Bank can act as trustee and collateral agent in connection with
international financial operations.
Tradable instruments are available, in maturities ranging from one week to five
years, in the form of Fixed-Rate Investments at the BIS (FIXBIS), Medium-Term
Instruments (MTIs) and products with embedded optionality (Callable MTIs). These
instruments can be bought or sold throughout the Bank’s dealing hours. Also offered
are money market placements, such as sight/notice accounts and fixed-term deposits.
On 31 March 2015, total deposits stood at SDR 186.7 billion; about 95% of
those deposits are denominated in currencies and the remainder in gold (see graph).
The Bank transacts foreign exchange and gold on behalf of its customers,
thereby providing access to a large liquidity base in the context of the rebalancing
of central banks’ reserve portfolios. The Bank’s foreign exchange services encompass
spot transactions in major currencies and Special Drawing Rights (SDR) as well as
swaps, outright forwards, options and dual currency deposits (DCDs). In addition,
the Bank provides gold services that include buying and selling, sight accounts,
fixed-term deposits, earmarked accounts, quality upgrading, refining and location
exchanges.
The BIS provides asset management products. The products, which consist
predominantly of sovereign securities and high-grade fixed income instruments in
major reserve currencies, are available as (i) dedicated portfolio mandates tailored
to each customer’s preferences; or (ii) BIS Investment Pools (BISIPs), which are
open-end fund structures that allow customers to invest in a common pool of
assets. The BISIP structure is also used for the Asian Bond Fund (ABF) initiative
sponsored by EMEAP (the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks) to
foster the development of local currency bond markets. Further initiatives
developed with a group of advising central banks have also been based on the
BISIP structure. These include the BISIP ILF1 (a US inflation-protected government
securities fund) and the BISIP CNY (a domestic Chinese sovereign fixed income fund).
The BIS Banking Department hosts global and regional meetings, as well as
seminars and workshops on reserves management issues. These gatherings
facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience among reserves managers
and promote the development of investment and risk management capabilities in
central banks and international organisations. The Department also supports
central banks in reviewing and assessing their reserves management practices.

Representative Offices
The BIS has a Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific (the Asian Office),
located in Hong Kong SAR, and a Representative Office for the Americas (the
Americas Office), located in Mexico City. The Representative Offices promote
cooperation and foster the exchange of information and data within each region
by organising meetings, supporting regional institutions and Basel-based
committees, and conducting research. The Asian Office also provides banking
services to the region’s monetary authorities. It is also through the office in Hong
Kong that the Financial Stability Institute delivers a programme of meetings and
seminars in the region that are closely tailored to local priorities.
As part of the overall BIS research programme, economists in the Representative
Offices work with academics from around the world. In addition, both offices have
recently developed secondment programmes to deepen research collaboration with
member central banks in their respective regions. Papers based on research carried
out in the Representative Offices, and published in BIS reports or external journals,
have been used to inform policy discussions in various central bank meetings.

BIS 85th Annual Report

159

The Asian Office
The Asian Office’s research activities are guided by the Asian Consultative Council
(ACC), comprising the Governors of the 12 BIS member central banks in the AsiaPacific region.5 In April 2014, Governor Amando Tetangco of Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas succeeded Governor Choongsoo Kim of the Bank of Korea as Chair of the
Council.
Economists in the Asian Office carried out research on two themes endorsed
by the ACC. On the monetary policy side, the theme was the expanding boundaries
of monetary policy in Asia and the Pacific. The related policy issues were discussed
at a research workshop held in Hong Kong in July 2014. On the financial stability
side, the theme was cross-border financial linkages, which were the subject of a
research conference hosted by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in October 2014
in Wellington.
In the Asian Consultative Council’s meeting in February 2015 in Manila, the
Governors endorsed a new theme, “Financial systems and the real economy”, to
guide policy research in the Asian Office over the next two years.
The Asian Office organised 10 high-level BIS policy meetings, most held jointly
with a central bank or with either the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific
Central Banks (EMEAP) or the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN).
The ACC Governors meet with others from around the world in a Special
Governors’ Meeting, which in February 2015 was held in Manila with Bangko Sentral
ng Pilipinas as host. For the fifth consecutive year, the event included a roundtable
with the chief executive officers of large financial institutions in the region. The
discussions covered issues related to financial market volatility and liquidity.
Other policy discussions organised by the Asian Office were the 17th meeting
of the Working Party on Monetary Policy in Asia, hosted by the Central Bank of
Malaysia in May in Kuala Lumpur; the BIS-SEACEN Exco Seminar, hosted by the
Central Bank of Nepal in September in Kathmandu; and the 11th Asia-Pacific HighLevel Meeting on Banking Supervision, co-organised with the EMEAP Working
Group on Banking Supervision and the Basel Committee and hosted by Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas in February in Manila.

The Americas Office
The Americas Office develops its activities under the guidance of the Consultative
Council for the Americas (CCA). Comprising the Governors of eight BIS member
central banks in the region, the CCA is chaired by José Darío Uribe, Governor of the
Bank of the Republic, Colombia.6 The work of the Americas Office centres on three
main areas: research, central bank operations and financial stability.
Research is organised mainly through networks, under the direction of a
Scientific Committee. The research network on “The introduction of financial
stability considerations into central bank policy models” presented its findings in
January 2015 at a conference hosted by the Americas Office. A newly established
research network focuses on the commodity cycle and its macroeconomic and
financial stability implications. In May 2014, the Bank of the Republic, Colombia,

BIS 85th Annual Report

hosted the Fifth Annual CCA research conference in Bogotá on the “Challenges
from changing international financial conditions”.
Work relating to central bank operations is led by the Consultative Group of
Directors of Operations (CGDO), a forum for central bank officials who typically
oversee open market and foreign exchange operations as well as reserves
management. Group members held regular teleconferences to monitor and
exchange views on financial market developments and central bank operations.
Their study group’s report on “Currency carry trades in Latin America” was published
as BIS Papers, no 81.
A second annual meeting of the Consultative Group of Directors of Financial
Stability (CGDFS) was held in November 2014 in Panama. Group members reviewed
the main topics analysed by their home institutions’ financial stability departments
and discussed their implications. A working group was set up to study the
effectiveness of macroprudential policies based on detailed data obtained from
credit registries.
Another notable event was the first roundtable of the CCA Governors and the
chief executive officers of large financial institutions active in the region held in
April 2014 in São Paulo. The topics discussed included the regional impact of tighter
global monetary conditions; the region’s financial infrastructure; bank regulation
and supervision; and regional banking integration.
In August 2014, the Americas Office also co-organised with CEMLA a roundtable
in Montevideo on monetary policy spillovers. Furthermore, it contributed to FSB
regional consultative group meetings and regional conferences, and supported the
18th BIS Working Party for Monetary Policy in Latin America, hosted by the Bank of
Mexico in September 2014.

Governance and management of the BIS
The governance and management of the Bank are conducted at three principal
levels: the General Meeting of BIS member central banks; the BIS Board of Directors;
and BIS Management.

It was with deep regret that the Bank learned of the death of Baron Alexandre
Lamfalussy on 9 May 2015 at the age of 86. Mr Lamfalussy was General Manager of
the BIS between May 1985 and December 1993. He joined the Bank in 1976 as
Economic Adviser and Head of the Monetary and Economic Department and
became Deputy General Manager in 1981. Many significant events in the Bank’s
history occurred under Mr Lamfalussy’s leadership, reflecting his desire for the BIS
to make a tangible contribution to international monetary and financial stability.
These included the signing of the Basel Capital Accord, the establishment of the
Group of Payment System Experts (now the Committee on Payments and Market
Infrastructures), and the expansion of the BIS international banking statistics, now a
major reference source for economists and other researchers.

BIS budget policy
Management begins preparing the annual BIS expenditure budget by establishing
an overall business plan and financial framework. Within that context, business
areas specify their detailed plans and resource requirements. The process
of reconciling detailed business plans, objectives and overall resources culminates
in a draft budget, which must be approved by the Board before the start of the
financial year.
The budget distinguishes between administrative and capital expenditures. In
2014/15, these expenditures collectively amounted to CHF 296.8 million. The Bank’s
overall administrative expense amounted to CHF 277.9 million.8 Management
and staff expense – including remuneration, pensions, and health and accident
insurance – amounts to around 70% of administrative expenditure, comparable to
the ratio seen in organisations similar to the BIS. New staff positions were added
during the year in accordance with the Bank’s business plan, which emphasised
economic research, the Basel regulatory process and BIS banking activities.

8

The financial statements report a total administrative expense of CHF 356.2 million. That figure
consists of the CHF 277.9 million actual administrative expense reported here plus CHF 78.3 million
of financial accounting adjustments for post-employment benefit obligations. This additional
expense is not included in the budget for the coming financial year because it depends on actuarial
valuations as at 31 March, which in turn are not finalised until April, after the budget has been set
by the Board.

BIS 85th Annual Report

165

The other major categories of administrative spending are information
technology (IT), buildings and equipment, and general operational costs, each
accounting for about 10%.
Capital spending, relating mainly to buildings and IT investment, can vary
significantly from year to year depending on projects in progress. For 2014/15,
capital expenditure amounted to CHF 18.9 million.

BIS remuneration policy
At the end of the 2014/15 financial year, the BIS employed 623 staff members9 from
57 countries. The jobs performed by BIS staff members are classified into job grades
associated with a structure of salary ranges. The salaries of individual staff members
move within the ranges of the salary structure on the basis of performance.
Every three years, a comprehensive survey benchmarks BIS salaries against
compensation in comparable institutions and market segments, with adjustments
taking place as of 1 July in the following year. In benchmarking, the Bank focuses
on the upper half of market compensation in order to attract highly qualified staff.
The analysis takes into account the differing rates of taxation on compensation at
the surveyed institutions.
In years between comprehensive salary surveys, the salary structure is adjusted
as of 1 July on the basis of Switzerland’s inflation rate and the weighted average
real wage development in industrial countries. As of 1 July 2014, this adjustment
produced a decrease of 0.3% in the salary structure.
The salaries of senior officials are also regularly benchmarked against
compensation in comparable institutions and market segments. As of 1 July 2014,
the annual remuneration of senior officials, before expatriation allowances, is based
on the salary structure of CHF 754,730 for the General Manager;10 CHF 638,620 for
the Deputy General Manager; and CHF 580,560 for Heads of Department.
BIS staff members have access to a contributory health insurance plan and a
contributory defined benefit pension plan. At the Bank’s headquarters, non-Swiss
staff members recruited from abroad, including senior officials, are entitled to an
expatriation allowance. The allowance currently amounts to 14% of annual salary
for unmarried staff members and 18% for married staff members, subject to a
ceiling. Expatriate staff members are also entitled to receive an education allowance
for their children, subject to certain conditions.
The Annual General Meeting approves the remuneration of members of the
Board of Directors, with adjustments taking place at regular intervals. The total
fixed annual remuneration paid to the Board of Directors was CHF 1,111,068 as of
1 April 2015. In addition, Board members receive an attendance fee for each Board
meeting in which they participate. Assuming the full Board is represented in all Board
meetings, the annual total of these attendance fees amounts to CHF 1,058,160.

9

This corresponds to 600.1 full-time equivalent positions. At the end of the 2013/14 financial year,
the Bank employed 617 staff members, corresponding to 595.8 full-time equivalent positions.
Including positions related to hosted organisations and not funded by the Bank, the number of
staff was 656 last financial year and 668 this financial year.

10

In addition to the basic salary, the General Manager receives an annual representation allowance
and enhanced pension rights.

BIS 85th Annual Report

Financial activities and results
The Bank’s balance sheet
The Bank’s balance sheet decreased by SDR 5.7 billion over the year, following an
increase of SDR 10.6 billion in 2013/14. The balance sheet total on 31 March 2015
was SDR 216.8 billion.
Deposits, primarily from central banks, constitute the largest share of the Bank’s
liabilities. About 95% of the deposits are denominated in currencies, with the
remainder in gold. On 31 March 2015, total deposits amounted to SDR 186.7 billion,
compared with SDR 191.8 billion at the end of March 2014.
Currency deposits at 31 March 2015 stood at SDR 176 billion, which was
SDR 4 billion less than at the previous year-end. Notwithstanding this decline,
average deposits held during 2014/15 were SDR 14 billion higher than in the
previous year. The currency composition of deposits remained stable, with deposits
in US dollars at 74%, in euros at 13% and in sterling at 6%. Gold deposits stood at
SDR 9.9 billion on 31 March 2015, a decline of SDR 1.4 billion over the financial year.
Funds received from deposit liabilities are invested in assets that are managed
in a conservative manner. At 31 March 2015, 53% of total assets comprised
government and other securities or treasury bills. Reverse repurchase agreements
(primarily with commercial banks and with sovereign bonds as collateral) made up
a further 23%, with unsecured commercial bank assets and gold accounting for 8%
and 7%, respectively. The gold balances include 108 tonnes in the Bank’s own
investment portfolio.

Financial performance
Operating profit
The BIS’s financial results for 2014/15 were shaped by continuing low interest rates
together with relative stability in most financial markets. This environment led to
lower interest income on the Bank’s own fund investment assets. Net income on
the customer banking business improved, reflecting both a higher intermediation
margin and the higher average level of deposits. As a result, overall net interest and
valuation movements increased by 11% to SDR 655.3 million.
The Bank recorded a foreign exchange gain of SDR 38.8 million, compared with
a loss in the previous financial year of SDR 33.3 million. The gain arose mostly from
the appreciation of non-SDR currency assets held in the investment portfolio. The
Bank’s administrative expense, which is denominated mainly in Swiss francs,
amounted to CHF 356.2 million, 1.3% less than in the previous year. In SDR terms,
however, the expenditure was the same as in the previous year, at SDR 258.6 million,
owing to the Swiss franc’s appreciation. Depreciation was SDR 16.2 million, bringing
the total operating expense to SDR 274.6 million.
As a result of these developments, the operating profit, at SDR 425.3 million,
was 48% higher than last year.

Net profit and total comprehensive income
Net profit comprises operating profit plus the realised gains, or losses, from sales of
gold and securities held in the Bank’s own fund portfolios. During the year, the
Bank sold 3 tonnes of its own gold, realising a gain of SDR 65.6 million. In addition,

BIS 85th Annual Report

167

the Bank’s own funds securities portfolio produced realised gains of SDR 52.0 million
when securities were sold as part of the regular rebalancing to benchmarks. As a
result, net profit for 2014/15 was SDR 542.9 million (2013/14: SDR 419.3 million),
representing a return of 3.0% on average equity (2013/14: 2.4%).
Other comprehensive income includes unrealised valuation movements on the
Bank’s own gold and investment securities as well as re-measurements of the
actuarial liabilities for post-employment benefit obligations. The valuation of the
Bank’s own gold increased by SDR 29.9 million on a 3.3% increase in the SDR gold
price. In addition, the Bank recorded a revaluation gain of SDR 102.5 million on its
investment securities, in part reflecting marginally lower interest rates. These effects
were partly offset by a loss on the re-measurement of defined benefit obligations
of SDR 10.1 million. As a result, other comprehensive income for the year was
SDR 122.3 million. Total comprehensive income, which combines net profit and
other comprehensive income, was SDR 665.2 million. Total return on equity was 3.6%.

Allocation and distribution of profit
Proposed dividend
Consistent with the BIS’s dividend policy, it is proposed to declare a dividend of
SDR 225 per share for the financial year 2014/15. The dividend is payable on
558,125 shares, and will result in a total payment of SDR 125.6 million. After
payment of the dividend, SDR 417.3 million would be available for allocation to
reserves.

Proposed allocation of net profit for 2014/15
In accordance with Article 51 of the BIS Statutes, the Board of Directors recommends
that the General Meeting allocate the 2014/15 net profit of SDR 542.9 million in the
following manner:
(a) SDR 125.6 million to be paid as a dividend of SDR 225 per share;
(b) SDR 20.9 million to be transferred to the general reserve fund; and
(c) SDR 396.4 million, representing the remainder of the available profit, to be
transferred to the free reserve fund.

BIS 85th Annual Report

Accounting policies

The accounting policies set out below have been applied to
both of the financial years presented unless otherwise stated.

1. Scope of the financial statements
These financial statements recognise all assets and liabilities that
are controlled by the Bank and in respect of which the economic
benefits, as well as the rights and obligations, lie with the Bank.
To provide services to central bank customers, the Bank operates
investment entities which do not have separate legal personality
from the Bank. The Bank also manages investment mandates
from customers. The Bank undertakes transactions in its own
name with commercial counterparties for the benefit of these
investment entities and mandates. Where these are derivative
transactions, they are recognised in these financial statements
along with an offsetting amount owed to, or from, the investment
entity or mandate. Non-derivative assets and liabilities held in
the Bank’s name, but for the economic benefit of investment
entities or mandates, are not recognised in these financial
statements. Further information on off-balance sheet assets and
liabilities is provided in note 30.
The Bank also operates a pension fund in respect of staff pension
arrangements. The pension fund does not have a separate legal
personality from the Bank. Derivatives undertaken in the Bank’s
name with commercial counterparties but for the benefit of the
pension fund are recognised in these financial statements along
with the offsetting amount owed to, or from, the pension fund.
The pension fund’s net assets are included in these financial
statements in accordance with the accounting policy for postemployment benefit obligations. Note 18 provides information
on these obligations and associated arrangements.

3. Currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into SDR at the
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Other assets
and liabilities are recorded in SDR at the exchange rates ruling
at the date of the transaction. Profits and losses are translated
into SDR at an average rate. Exchange differences arising from
the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities and from the
settlement of transactions are included as net foreign exchange
gains or losses in the profit and loss account.

4. Accounting designation of financial instruments
Upon initial recognition the Bank designates each financial
instrument under one of the following accounting categories:

•
•

Loans and receivables

•
•

Available for sale financial assets

Financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value
through profit and loss
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

The designation under these categories is dependent on the
nature of the financial instrument and the purpose for which it
was entered into, as described in Section 5 below.
The resulting designation of each financial instrument determines
the accounting methodology that is applied, as described in
the accounting policies below. Where the financial instrument
is designated as held at fair value through profit and loss, the
Bank does not subsequently change this designation.

5. Asset and liability structure
2. Functional and presentation currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Bank is the
Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
The SDR is calculated from a basket of major trading currencies
according to Rule O–1 as adopted by the Executive Board of
the IMF on 30 December 2010 and effective 1 January 2011. As
currently calculated, one SDR is equivalent to the sum of
USD 0.660, EUR 0.423, JPY 12.1 and GBP 0.111. The composition
of the SDR currency basket is subject to review every five
years by the IMF; the next review is due to be undertaken in
December 2015.

Assets and liabilities are organised into two sets of portfolios:

A. Banking portfolios
These comprise currency and gold deposit liabilities and related
banking assets and derivatives.
The Bank operates a banking business in currency and gold on
behalf of its customers. In this business the Bank is exposed to
credit and market risks. The extent of these exposures is limited
by the Bank’s risk management approach.

All figures in these financial statements are presented in SDR
millions unless otherwise stated.

BIS 85th Annual Report

179

The Bank designates all currency financial instruments in its
banking portfolios (other than cash and sight and notice
accounts with banks, and sight and notice deposit account
liabilities) as held at fair value through profit and loss. The use
of fair values in the currency banking portfolios is described in
Section 9 below.

8. Sight and notice deposit account liabilities

All gold financial assets in these portfolios are designated as
loans and receivables and all gold financial liabilities are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
They are included in the balance sheet at their principal value
plus accrued interest. Interest is included in interest expense on
an accruals basis.

Sight and notice deposit accounts are short-term monetary
liabilities. They typically have notice periods of three days or
less and are included under the balance sheet heading
“Currency deposits”.

B. Investment portfolios
These comprise assets, liabilities and derivatives relating
principally to the investment of the Bank’s equity.
The Bank holds most of its equity in financial instruments
denominated in the constituent currencies of the SDR, which
are managed by comparison to a fixed duration benchmark of
bonds.
Currency assets in investment portfolios, with the exception of
cash and notice accounts (Sections 6 and 7 below) and those in
more actively traded portfolios, are designated as available for
sale.
The currency investment assets maintained in more actively
traded portfolios are trading assets and as such are designated
as held at fair value through profit and loss.
The remainder of the Bank’s equity is held in gold. The Bank’s
own gold holdings are designated as available for sale.

6. Cash and sight accounts with banks
Cash and sight accounts with banks are included in the balance
sheet at their principal value plus accrued interest where
applicable.

9. Use of fair values in the currency banking
portfolios
In operating its currency banking business, the Bank acts as a
market-maker in certain of its currency deposit liabilities. As a
result of this activity the Bank incurs realised profits and losses
on these liabilities.
In accordance with the Bank’s risk management policies, the
market risk inherent in this activity is managed on an overall
fair value basis, combining all the relevant assets, liabilities and
derivatives in its currency banking portfolios. The realised and
unrealised profits or losses on currency deposit liabilities are
thus largely offset by realised and unrealised losses or profits
on the related currency banking assets and derivatives, or on
other currency deposit liabilities.
To reduce the accounting inconsistency that would otherwise
arise from recognising realised and unrealised gains and losses
on different bases, the Bank designates the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios as
held at fair value through profit and loss.

10. Securities purchased under resale
agreements
7. Notice accounts
Notice accounts are short-term monetary assets, including
balances at futures clearing brokers. These typically have notice
periods of three days or less and are included under the
balance sheet heading “Loans and advances”. They are
considered to be cash equivalents for the purposes of the
statement of cash flows.
Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments are
designated as loans and receivables. They are included in the
balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued interest.
Interest is included in interest income on an accruals basis.

Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse
repurchase agreements”) are recognised as collateralised loan
transactions by which the Bank lends cash and receives an
irrevocable commitment from the counterparty to return the
cash, plus interest, at a specified date in the future. As part of
these agreements, the Bank receives collateral in the form of
securities to which it has full legal title, but must return
equivalent securities to the counterparty at the end of the
agreement, subject to the counterparty’s repayment of the
cash. Because the Bank does not acquire the risks or rewards
associated with ownership of these collateral securities, they are
not recognised as assets in the Bank’s balance sheet.
The collateralised loans relating to securities purchased under
resale agreements are currency assets. The accounting
treatment is determined by whether the transaction involves
currency assets held at fair value through profit and loss
(Section 11 below) or currency investment assets available for
sale (Section 13 below).

180

BIS 85th Annual Report

11. Currency assets held at fair value through
profit and loss
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and government
and other securities.
As described in Section 9 above, the Bank designates all of the
relevant assets in its currency banking portfolios as held at fair
value through profit and loss. These currency assets are initially
included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual
of interest and amortisation of premiums paid and discounts
received are included in the profit and loss account under
“Interest income” on an effective interest rate basis. After initial
measurement, the currency assets are revalued to fair value,
with all realised and unrealised movements in fair value
included under “Net valuation movement”.

After trade date, the currency investment assets are revalued to
fair value, with unrealised gains or losses included in the securities
revaluation account, which is reported under the balance sheet
heading “Other equity accounts”. The movement in fair value is
included in the statement of comprehensive income under the
heading “Net movement on revaluation of available for sale
securities”. Realised profits on disposal are included in the profit
and loss account under “Net gain on sales of securities available
for sale”.

14. Short positions in currency assets
Short positions in currency assets are included in the balance
sheet under the heading “Other liabilities” at fair value on a
trade date basis.

12. Currency deposit liabilities held at fair value
through profit and loss
All currency deposit liabilities, with the exception of sight and
notice deposit account liabilities, are designated as held at fair
value through profit and loss.
These currency deposit liabilities are initially included in the
balance sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest to
be paid and amortisation of premiums received and discounts
paid are included under the profit and loss account heading
“Interest expense” on an effective interest rate basis.
After initial measurement, the currency deposit liabilities are
revalued to fair value, with all realised and unrealised movements
in fair value included under “Net valuation movement”.

13. Currency investment assets available for sale
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and government
and other securities.
As described in Section 12 above, the Bank designates as
available for sale all of the relevant assets in its currency
investment portfolios.
Available for sale investment assets are initially included in the
balance sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest and
amortisation of premiums paid and discounts received are
included in the profit and loss account under “Interest income”
on an effective interest rate basis.

15. Gold
Gold comprises gold bar assets held in custody at central banks
and sight accounts denominated in gold. Gold is considered by
the Bank to be a financial instrument.
Gold is included in the balance sheet at its weight in gold
(translated at the gold market price and USD exchange rate
into SDR). Purchases and sales of gold are accounted for on a
settlement date basis. Forward purchases or sales of gold are
treated as derivatives prior to the settlement date.
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold is described in Section 18 below.

16. Gold loans
Gold loans comprise fixed-term gold loans. Gold loans are
included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis at their
weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and USD
exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest.
Accrued interest on gold loans is included in the profit and loss
account under “Interest income” on an effective interest rate
basis.

17. Gold deposits
Gold deposits comprise unallocated sight and fixed-term
deposits of gold from central banks.

BIS 85th Annual Report

181

Unallocated gold deposits provide customers with a general
claim on the Bank for delivery of gold of the same weight and
quality as that delivered by the customer to the Bank, but do
not provide the right to specific gold bars. Unallocated gold
deposits are included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis
at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and
USD exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest. Accrued
interest on gold deposits is included in the profit and loss account
under “Interest expense” on an effective interest rate basis.
Allocated (or “earmarked”) gold deposits provide depositors
with a claim for delivery of the specific gold bars deposited by
the customer with the Bank on a custody basis. Beneficial
ownership and risk remain with the customer. As such, allocated
gold deposit liabilities and the related gold bar assets are not
included on the Bank’s balance sheet. They are disclosed as offbalance sheet items (see note 30).

18. Realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold depends on the designation as described below:

A. Banking portfolios, comprising gold deposits and
related gold banking assets
The Bank designates gold loans in its banking portfolios as
loans and receivables and gold deposits as financial liabilities
measured at amortised cost. The gold derivatives included in
the portfolios are designated as held at fair value through profit
and loss.
Gains or losses on derivative transactions in gold are included
in the profit and loss account under “Net foreign exchange
gain / (loss)” as net transaction gains or losses.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the net position in gold
in the banking portfolios are included under “Net foreign
exchange gain / (loss)” as net translation gains or losses.

B. Investment portfolios, comprising gold investment
assets
The Bank’s own holdings of gold are designated and accounted
for as available for sale assets.
Unrealised gains or losses on the Bank’s gold investment assets
over their deemed cost are taken to the gold revaluation
account in equity, which is reported under the balance sheet
heading “Other equity accounts”. The movement in fair value is
included in the statement of comprehensive income under the
heading “Net movement on revaluation of gold investment
assets”.

For gold investment assets held on 31 March 2003 (when the
Bank changed its functional and presentation currency from
the gold franc to the SDR) the deemed cost is approximately
SDR 151 per ounce, based on the value of USD 208 that was
applied from 1979 to 2003 following a decision by the Bank’s
Board of Directors, translated at the 31 March 2003 exchange rate.
Realised gains or losses on disposal of gold investment assets
are included in the profit and loss account as “Net gain on sales
of gold investment assets”.

19. Securities sold under repurchase agreements
Securities sold under repurchase agreements (“repurchase
agreements”) are recognised as collateralised deposit transactions
by which the Bank receives cash and provides an irrevocable
commitment to return the cash, plus interest, at a specified
date in the future. As part of these agreements, the Bank
transfers legal title of collateral securities to the counterparty.
At the end of the contract the counterparty must return
equivalent securities to the Bank, subject to the Bank’s repayment
of the cash. Because the Bank retains the risks and rewards
associated with ownership of these securities, they continue to
be recognised as assets in the Bank’s balance sheet.
Where the repurchase agreement is associated with currency
assets available for sale, the collateralised deposit transaction is
designated as a financial liability measured at amortised cost.
Where the repurchase agreement is associated with the
management of currency assets held at fair value through profit
and loss, the collateralised deposit transaction is designated as
a financial instrument held at fair value through profit and loss.
The collateralised deposits relating to securities sold under
repurchase agreements are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest is included
in the profit and loss account under “Interest expense” on an
effective interest rate basis. After initial measurement, the
transactions designated as held at fair value through profit and
loss are revalued to fair value with all unrealised movements in
fair value included under “Net valuation movement”.

20. Derivatives
Derivatives are used either to manage the Bank’s market
risk or for trading purposes. They are designated as financial
instruments held at fair value through profit and loss.
Derivatives are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis. Where applicable, the accrual of interest and
amortisation of premiums and discounts are included in the
profit and loss account under “Interest income” on an effective
interest rate basis.
After trade date, derivatives are revalued to fair value, with all
realised and unrealised movements in value included under
“Net valuation movement”.
Derivatives are included as either assets or liabilities, depending
on whether the contract has a positive or a negative fair value
for the Bank.

182

BIS 85th Annual Report

Where a derivative contract is embedded within a host contract
which is not accounted for as held at fair value through profit
and loss, it is separated from the host contract for accounting
purposes and treated as though it were a standalone derivative
as described above.

21. Valuation policy
The Bank’s valuation policy defines how financial instruments
are designated, which determines their valuation basis and
accounting treatment. This policy is supplemented with detailed
valuation procedures.
The majority of the financial instruments on the balance sheet
are included at fair value. The Bank defines fair value as the exit
price of an orderly transaction between market participants on
the measurement date.
The use of fair values ensures that the financial reporting to the
Board and shareholders reflects the way in which the banking
business is managed and is consistent with the risk management
and economic performance figures reported to Management.
The Bank considers published price quotations in active markets
as the best evidence of fair value. Where no published price
quotations exist, the Bank determines fair values using a
valuation technique appropriate to the particular financial
instrument. Such valuation techniques may involve using
market prices of recent arm’s length market transactions in
similar instruments or may make use of financial models. Where
financial models are used, the Bank aims at making maximum
use of observable market inputs as appropriate, and relies as
little as possible on its own estimates. Such valuation models
comprise discounted cash flow analyses and option pricing
models.
Where valuation techniques are used to determine fair values,
the valuation models are subject to initial approval and periodic
review in line with the requirements of the Bank’s model
validation policy.
The Bank has an independent valuation control function which
periodically reviews the value of its financial instruments, taking
into account both the accuracy of the valuations and the
valuation methodologies used. Other valuation controls include
the review and analysis of daily profit and loss.
The Bank values its positions at their exit price, so that assets
are valued at the bid price and liabilities at the offer price.
Derivative financial instruments are valued on a bid-offer basis,
with valuation reserves, where necessary, included in derivative
financial liabilities. Financial assets and liabilities that are not
valued at fair value are included in the balance sheet at
amortised cost.

impairment at each balance sheet date. A financial asset is
impaired when there is objective evidence that the estimated
future cash flows of the asset have been reduced as a result of
one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of
the asset. Evidence of impairment could include significant
financial difficulty, default, or probable bankruptcy / financial
reorganisation of the counterparty or issuer.
Impairment losses are recognised to the extent that a decline in
fair value below amortised cost is considered significant or
prolonged. Impairment of currency assets is included in the
profit and loss account under “Net valuation movement”, with
impairment of gold loans included under “Interest income”. If
the amount of the impairment loss decreases in a subsequent
period, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed
through profit and loss to the extent that the carrying amount
of the investment does not exceed that which it would have
been had the impairment not been recognised.

23. Accounts receivable and accounts payable
Accounts receivable and accounts payable are principally very
short-term amounts relating to the settlement of financial
transactions. They are initially recognised at fair value and
subsequently included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.

24. Land, buildings and equipment
The cost of the Bank’s buildings and equipment is capitalised
and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets concerned, as follows:

•
•
•
•

Buildings – 50 years
Building installations and machinery – 15 years
Information technology equipment – up to 4 years
Other equipment – 4 to 10 years

The Bank’s land is not depreciated. The Bank undertakes an
annual review of impairment of land, buildings and equipment.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its
estimated recoverable amount, the asset is written down to a
lower value.

25. Provisions

22. Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those designated as held at fair
value through profit and loss, are assessed for indications of

BIS 85th Annual Report

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of events arising before the
balance sheet date and it is probable that economic resources
will be required to settle the obligation, provided that a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Best
estimates and assumptions are used when determining the
amount to be recognised as a provision.

183

26. Taxation

B. Directors’ pensions

The Bank’s special legal status in Switzerland is set out principally
in its Headquarters Agreement with the Swiss Federal Council.
Under the terms of this document the Bank is exempted from
virtually all direct and indirect taxes at both federal and local
government level in Switzerland.

The Bank provides an unfunded defined benefit arrangement
for Directors’ pensions. The liability, defined benefit obligation
and amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect
of the Directors’ pension arrangement are calculated on a
similar basis to that used for the staff pension fund.

Similar agreements exist with the government of the People’s
Republic of China for the Asian Office in Hong Kong SAR and
with the Mexican government for the Americas Office in Mexico
City.
However, some income and gains received by the Bank are
subject to tax in certain jurisdictions. In such cases, income and
gains are recognised on a gross basis with the corresponding
tax recognised as an expense.

C. Post-employment health and accident benefits
The Bank provides an unfunded post-employment health and
accident benefit arrangement for its staff. The liability, benefit
obligation and amount charged to the profit and loss account
in respect of the health and accident benefit arrangement are
calculated on a similar basis to that used for the staff pension
fund.

27. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment benefit arrangements,
respectively, for staff pensions, Directors’ pensions, and health
and accident insurance for current and former staff members.
An independent actuarial valuation is performed annually for
each arrangement.

A. Staff pensions

28. Statement of cash flows
The Bank’s statement of cash flows is prepared using an indirect
method. It is based on the movements in the Bank’s balance
sheet, adjusted for changes in financial transactions awaiting
settlement.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and sight and notice
accounts with banks, which are very short-term financial assets
that typically have notice periods of three days or less.

The Bank provides a final salary defined benefit pension
arrangement for its staff, based on a fund without a separate
legal personality from the BIS, out of which benefits are paid.
The fund assets are administered by the Bank for the sole
benefit of current and former members of staff who participate
in the arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all
benefits due under the arrangement.
The liability in respect of the staff pension fund is based on the
present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair
value of the fund assets, both at the balance sheet date. The
defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit
obligation is determined from the estimated future cash
outflows. The rate used to discount the cash flows is determined
by the Bank based on the market yield of highly rated corporate
debt securities in Swiss francs which have terms to maturity
approximating the terms of the related liability.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents
the sum of the current service cost of the benefits accruing for
the year under the scheme, and interest at the discount rate on
the net of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of
the fund assets. Past service costs from plan amendments are
immediately recognised through profit or loss. Gains and losses
arising from re-measurement of the obligations, such as
experience adjustments (where the actual outcome is different
from the actuarial assumptions previously made) and changes
in actuarial assumptions are charged to other comprehensive
income in the year in which the re-measurement is applied.
They are not subsequently included in profit and loss in future
years.

BIS 85th Annual Report

Notes to the financial statements

1. Introduction
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS, “the Bank”) is an international financial institution which was established pursuant to the Hague
Agreements of 20 January 1930, the Bank’s Constituent Charter and its Statutes. The headquarters of the Bank are at Centralbahnplatz 2,
4002 Basel, Switzerland. The Bank maintains representative offices in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of
China (for Asia and the Pacific), and in Mexico City, Mexico (for the Americas).
The objectives of the BIS, as laid down in Article 3 of its Statutes, are to promote cooperation among central banks, to provide additional
facilities for international financial operations and to act as trustee or agent for international financial settlements. Sixty central banks are
currently members of the Bank. The governance and management of the BIS are discussed in “The BIS: mission, activities, governance and
financial results” in this Annual Report.

2. Use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the Bank’s Management to make assumptions and estimates in arriving at the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income and expenses during the financial year. To arrive at reasonable estimates, Management exercises judgment based on
the latest reliable information.
The main estimates used relate to the valuation of assets and liabilities, the assessment of post-employment benefit obligations and the
assessment of provisions and contingent liabilities. Subsequent actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
Key judgments include the selection and application of the Bank’s accounting policies, in particular for the valuation and accounting
designation of financial instruments.

A. The valuation of financial assets and liabilities
Certain of the Bank’s financial assets and financial liabilities are valued using valuation techniques which require estimation of appropriate
valuation parameters. Changes in estimates of these parameters could significantly affect the reported fair values. The valuation impact of
a 1 basis point change in spread assumptions of key financial instruments is shown in the table below:

B. Impairment provision on financial assets
The Bank conducts an annual review for impairment at the date of each balance sheet. The Bank did not have any financial assets that were
considered to be impaired at 31 March 2015 (2014: nil).

C. Actuarial assumptions
The valuation of the Bank’s post-employment benefit obligations relies on actuarial assumptions which include, among others, expectations
of inflation, interest rates, medical cost inflation, and retirement age and life expectancy of participants. Any changes to actuarial assumptions
would have an impact on the valuation of these obligations and the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

3. Cash and sight accounts with banks
Cash and sight accounts with banks consist of cash balances with central banks and commercial banks that are available to the Bank on
demand.

Included in “Gold” is SDR 1,295.7 million (47 tonnes) of gold (2014: SDR 6,311.2 million; 236 tonnes) that the Bank holds in connection with
its gold swap contracts. Under such contracts the Bank receives physical gold in exchange for currencies, and has an obligation to return
the gold at the end of the contract. See note 6 for more details on gold swap transactions.

B. Gold investment assets
The Bank’s gold investment assets are included in the balance sheet at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and USD
exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest. The excess of this value over the deemed cost value is included in the gold revaluation
account, which is reported under the balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”; the movement in this value is included in the
statement of comprehensive income under the heading “Net movement on revaluation of gold investment assets”. Realised gains or losses
on the disposal of gold investment assets are recognised in the profit and loss account under the heading “Net gain on sales of gold
investment assets”.
Note 17B provides further analysis of the gold revaluation account. Note 26 provides further analysis of the net gain on sales of gold
investment assets.

5. Currency assets
A. Total holdings
Currency assets comprise treasury bills, securities purchased under resale agreements, fixed-term loans and advances, and government and
other securities.
Treasury bills are short-term debt securities issued by governments on a discount basis.
Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse repurchase agreements”) are recognised as collateralised loan transactions. Interest
receivable on the transaction is fixed at the start of the agreement. During the term of the agreement the Bank monitors the fair value of
the loan and related collateral securities, and may call for additional collateral (or be required to return collateral) based on movements in
market value.
Loans and advances comprise fixed-term loans to commercial banks, advances and notice accounts. Advances relate to committed and
uncommitted standby facilities which the Bank provides for its customers. Notice accounts are very short-term financial assets, typically
having a notice period of three days or less. Fixed-term loans and advances are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
Notice accounts are designated as loans and receivables and are included in the balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued interest.
Government and other securities are debt securities issued by governments, international institutions, other public sector institutions,
commercial banks and corporates. They include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, fixed and floating rate bonds, covered bonds and
asset-backed securities.

6. Derivative financial instruments
The main types of derivative instruments used by the Bank for economic hedging and trading purposes are:
Interest rate and bond futures are contractual agreements to receive or pay a net amount based on changes in interest rates or bond prices
at a future date. Futures contracts are settled daily with the exchange. Associated margin payments are settled by cash or marketable
securities.
Currency and gold options are contractual agreements under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to either
buy (call option) or sell (put option), by or on a set date, a specific amount of a currency or gold at a predetermined price. In consideration,
the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.
Currency and gold swaps, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps are bilateral contractual agreements to exchange cash flows related
to currencies, gold or interest rates (for example, fixed rate for floating rate). Cross-currency interest rate swaps involve the exchange of
cash flows related to a combination of interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Except for certain currency and gold swaps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps, no exchange of principal takes place.
Currency and gold forwards are bilateral contractual agreements involving the exchange of foreign currencies or gold at a future date. This
includes undelivered spot transactions.
Forward rate agreements are bilateral interest rate forward contracts that result in cash settlement at a future date for the difference
between a contracted rate of interest and the prevailing market rate.
Swaptions are bilateral options under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a currency or
interest rate swap at a predetermined price by or on a set date. In consideration, the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.
In addition, the Bank sells products to its customers which contain embedded derivatives (see note 9). The gold currency options embedded
in gold dual currency deposits are included within derivatives as currency and gold options.

(2014: SDR 0.1 million). During the financial year ended 31 March 2015 the Bank adopted the practice of retiring assets when their age
reaches twice their estimated useful life. As a result, SDR 39.6 million has been removed from the historical cost and accumulated depreciation
in the above table.

Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs) are fixed rate investments at the Bank issued with initial quarterly maturities of between one and 10 years.
Callable MTIs are MTIs that are callable at the option of the Bank at an exercise price of par. At 31 March 2015 all options on outstanding
callable MTIs had expired (in 2014 the callable MTIs had call dates between June and December 2014). The balance sheet total for callable
MTIs includes the fair value of the embedded interest rate option.
FIXBIS are fixed rate investments at the Bank for any maturities between one week and one year.
FRIBIS are floating rate investments at the Bank with maturities of one year or longer for which the interest rate is reset in line with prevailing
market conditions.
Fixed-term deposits are fixed rate investments at the Bank, typically with an initial maturity of less than one year.
Dual Currency Deposits (DCDs) are fixed-term deposits that are repayable on the maturity date either in the original currency or at a fixed
amount in a different currency at the option of the Bank. The balance sheet total for DCDs includes the fair value of the embedded foreign
exchange option. These deposits all mature between April 2015 and June 2015 (2014: in April and May 2014).
Sight and notice deposit accounts are very short-term financial liabilities, typically having a notice period of three days or less.
The Bank acts as the sole market-maker in certain of its currency deposit liabilities and has undertaken to repay some of these financial
instruments at fair value, in whole or in part, at one to two business days’ notice.

A. Valuation of currency deposits
Currency deposits (other than sight and notice deposit accounts) are included in the balance sheet at fair value. The amount the Bank
is contractually obliged to pay at maturity in respect of its total currency deposits including interest accrued to 31 March 2015 is
SDR 176,649.4 million (2014: SDR 180,373.0 million).
The Bank uses valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of its currency deposits. These valuation techniques comprise discounted cash
flow models and option pricing models. The discounted cash flow models value the expected cash flows of financial instruments using
discount factors that are partly derived from quoted interest rates (eg Libor and swap rates) and partly based on assumptions about spreads
at which each product is offered to and repurchased from customers.
The option pricing models include estimates of volatilities that are derived from market quotes.

192

BIS 85th Annual Report

B. Impact of changes in the Bank’s creditworthiness
The fair value of the Bank’s liabilities should be affected by any change in its creditworthiness. If the Bank’s creditworthiness deteriorated,
the value of its liabilities should decrease, and the change in value would be reflected as a valuation movement in the profit and loss
account. The Bank regularly assesses its creditworthiness as part of its risk management processes. The Bank’s assessment of its creditworthiness
did not indicate a change which could have had an impact on the fair value of the Bank’s liabilities during the period under review.

10. Gold deposits
Gold deposit liabilities placed with the Bank originate entirely from central banks. They are all designated as financial liabilities measured
at amortised cost.

15. Statutory reserves
The Bank’s Statutes provide for application of the Bank’s annual net profit by the Annual General Meeting on the proposal of the Board of
Directors to three specific reserve funds: the legal reserve fund, the general reserve fund and the special dividend reserve fund; the
remainder of the net profit after payment of any dividend is generally allocated to the free reserve fund.
Legal reserve fund. This fund is currently fully funded at 10% of the Bank’s paid-up capital.
General reserve fund. After payment of any dividend, 5% of the remainder of the Bank’s annual net profit currently must be allocated to the
general reserve fund.
Special dividend reserve fund. A portion of the remainder of the annual net profit may be allocated to the special dividend reserve fund,
which shall be available, in case of need, for paying the whole or any part of a declared dividend. Dividends are normally paid out of the
Bank’s net profit.
Free reserve fund. After the above allocations have been made, any remaining unallocated net profit is generally transferred to the free
reserve fund.
Receipts from the subscription of the Bank’s shares are allocated to the legal reserve fund as necessary to keep it fully funded, with the
remainder being credited to the general reserve fund.
The free reserve fund, general reserve fund and legal reserve fund are available, in that order, to meet any losses incurred by the Bank. In
the event of liquidation of the Bank, the balances of the reserve funds (after the discharge of the liabilities of the Bank and the costs of
liquidation) would be divided among the Bank’s shareholders.

18. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment arrangements:
1. A defined benefit pension arrangement for its staff in the event of retirement, disability or death. Benefits accrue under this arrangement
according to years of participation and pensionable remuneration. Benefits are paid out of a fund without separate legal personality. The
fund assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of current and former members of staff, and their dependents, who participate
in the arrangement. Contributions are made to this fund by the Bank and by staff. The fund also receives the return on the assets the Bank
holds in the fund. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all benefits due under the arrangement.
2. An unfunded defined benefit arrangement for its Directors, whose entitlement is based on a minimum service period of four years.
3. An unfunded post-employment health and accident benefit arrangement for its staff and their dependents. Employees who leave the
Bank after becoming eligible for early retirement benefits from the pension arrangement are eligible for post-employment health and
accident benefits.
All three arrangements operate in Swiss francs and are valued annually by an independent actuary. During 2015/16, the Bank expects to
make contributions of SDR 33.3 million to its post-employment arrangements.
In January 2014, the Board endorsed a number of changes to the staff pension arrangement. Changes included the discontinuation of the
right to purchase additional pension benefits, an increase in the compulsory retirement age, a reduction in early retirement benefits and an
amendment to the pensionable remuneration basis from final salary to average salary of the last three years of service. Some of these
changes became effective immediately; others became effective on 1 October 2014 when new pension fund regulations came into force.

The table below analyses the assets of the pension fund and the extent to which the fair values of those assets have been calculated using
quoted prices in active markets. A price is considered to be quoted if it is both readily available from an exchange, dealer or similar source
and indicates the price at which transactions can be executed. A market is considered to be active if willing buyers and sellers can normally
be found. The pension fund does not invest in financial instruments issued by the Bank.

I. Sensitivity analysis of significant actuarial assumptions
The Bank is exposed to risks from these obligations and arrangements including investment risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk,
longevity risk and salary risk.
Investment risk is the risk that plan assets will not generate returns at the expected level.
Interest rate risk is the exposure of the post-employment benefit obligations to adverse movements in interest rates including credit spreads.
A decrease in interest rates will increase the present value of these obligations. However, in the case of the staff pension arrangement this
may be offset, either fully or partly, by an increase in value of the interest bearing securities held by the fund.
Foreign exchange risk is the exposure of the post-employment benefit obligations to adverse movements in exchange rates between the
Swiss franc, which is the operating currency of the post-employment benefit arrangements, and the SDR, which is the functional currency
of the Bank.
Longevity risk is the risk that actual outcomes differ from actuarial estimates of life expectancy.
Salary risk is the risk that higher than expected salary rises increase the cost of providing a salary-related pension.
The table below shows the estimated impact on the defined benefit obligation resulting from a change in key actuarial assumptions (see
tables 18G and 18H):

Gold bars held under earmark comprise specific gold bars which have been deposited with the Bank on a custody basis. They are included
at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and the USD exchange rate into SDR). At 31 March 2015 gold bars held under
earmark amounted to 443 tonnes of gold (2014: 389 tonnes).
Portfolio management mandates include BIS Investment Pools (BISIPs) and dedicated mandates.
The BISIPs are a range of open-ended investment funds created by the Bank and managed using entities that do not have a separate legal
personality from the Bank. The Bank has an agency relationship with the BISIPs, such that the assets of the BISIPs are held in the name of
the BIS, but the economic benefit lies with central bank customers. The Bank does not invest for its own account in the BISIPs.
Dedicated mandates are portfolios which are managed by the Bank in accordance with investment guidelines set by the customer. They are
held for the financial benefit of the central bank customer.
For both the BISIPs and the dedicated mandates, the Bank is remunerated by a management fee which is included within net fee and
commission income in the profit and loss account.

31. Commitments
The Bank provides a number of committed standby facilities for its customers on a collateralised or uncollateralised basis. At
31 March 2015 all of the outstanding commitments were collateralised and amounted to SDR 3,096.5 million. At 31 March 2014
the outstanding commitments to extend credit under these committed standby facilities amounted to SDR 2,922.9 million, of
which SDR 194.1 million was uncollateralised.
The Bank is committed to supporting the operations of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the International Association of Deposit
Insurers (IADI) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and in each case has a separate agreement
specifying the terms of support and commitment. The Bank is the legal employer of IADI and IAIS staff, with the regular ongoing
staff costs borne by each association. The commitment by the BIS to IADI and the IAIS is subject to an annual budgetary decision
of the Board.
On 28 January 2013 the BIS and the FSB entered into an agreement which governs the Bank’s support of the FSB. The agreement
is for an initial term of five years. Under the terms of the agreement, the BIS is the legal employer of FSB staff. The Bank provides
a contribution to cover FSB staff costs, and also provides premises, administrative infrastructure and equipment.

BIS 85th Annual Report

32. Fair value hierarchy
The Bank categorises its financial instrument fair value measurements using a hierarchy that reflects the observability of inputs used in
measuring that value. A valuation level is assigned according to the least observable input that is significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. The fair value hierarchy used by the Bank comprises the following levels:
Level 1 – Instruments valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
Level 2 – Instruments valued with valuation techniques using inputs which are observable for the financial instrument either directly (ie as
a price) or indirectly (ie derived from prices for similar financial instruments). This includes observable interest rates, spreads and volatilities.
Level 3 – Instruments valued using valuation techniques where the inputs are not observable in financial markets.
At 31 March 2015 the Bank had no financial instruments categorised as level 3 (2014: nil).

A. Transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy
Of the assets categorised as level 1 at 31 March 2015, SDR 1,778.5 million related to assets that had been held at 31 March 2014 and valued
as level 2 at that date. Of the assets categorised as level 2 at 31 March 2015, SDR 687.4 million related to assets that had been held at
31 March 2014 and categorised as level 1 as at that date. The transfer of assets between levels 1 and 2 reflected specific market conditions
existing at the reporting dates that affected the observability of the market prices as defined above. No liability valuations were transferred
between fair value hierarchy levels.
No assets were transferred to or from the level 3 category during the year.

B. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value level 3
During the financial years ended 31 March 2015 and 2014 the Bank did not classify any assets or liabilities as level 3 in the fair value
hierarchy.

C. Financial instruments not measured at fair value
The Bank accounts for certain financial instruments at amortised cost. These comprise financial assets of “Cash and sight accounts”, “Gold
and gold loans” and “Notice accounts”. Financial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise “Gold deposits”, “Sight and notice deposit
accounts”’ and those “Securities sold under repurchase agreements” that are associated with currency assets available for sale. If these
instruments were included in the fair value hierarchy, the valuation of “Gold loans” and “Securities sold under repurchase agreements” would
be considered level 2. All other amortised cost financial instruments would be considered level 1.
Using the same valuation techniques for amortised cost financial instruments as are applied to fair valued financial instruments, the Bank
estimates that their fair values would be materially the same as the carrying values shown in these financial statements for both 31 March 2015
and 31 March 2014.

Capital adequacy

1. Capital adequacy frameworks
As an international financial institution that is overseen by a Board composed of Governors of major central banks and that has no national
supervisor, the Bank is committed to maintaining its superior credit quality and financial strength, in particular in situations of financial
stress.
The Bank continuously assesses its capital adequacy based on an annual capital planning process that focuses on two elements: an economic
capital framework and a financial leverage framework. The disclosures in this section related to credit, market, operational and liquidity risk
are based on the Bank’s own assessment of capital adequacy derived in accordance with these two BIS frameworks.
Regulatory capital ratios are not used as indicators of BIS capital adequacy because key aspects of the business model for the BIS banking
activities are not adequately captured. In the main, these relate to the high level of solvency targeted by the Bank as well as the way
regulatory capital ratios reflect portfolio concentrations and interest rate risk in the banking book.
To facilitate comparability, the Bank has implemented a framework that is consistent with the revised International Convergence of Capital
Measurement and Capital Standards (Basel II framework) issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in June 2006. Following
that framework, the Bank discloses a Tier 1 capital ratio (Pillar 1), risk-weighted assets and more detailed related information. In addition,
the Bank calculates for reference a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio as defined in Basel III.
The Bank maintains a capital position substantially in excess of the regulatory minimum requirement in order to ensure its superior credit
quality.

2. Economic capital
The Bank’s economic capital methodology relates its risk-taking capacity to the amount of economic capital needed to absorb potential
losses arising from its exposures. The risk-taking capacity is defined as allocatable economic capital that is derived following a prudent
assessment of the components of the Bank’s equity, which are set out in the table below:

Allocatable economic capital is determined following a prudent evaluation of the Bank’s equity components for their loss absorption
capacity and sustainability. The components of capital with long-term risk-bearing capacity are the Bank’s Tier 1 capital and the sustainable
portion of the securities and gold revaluation reserves (“sustainable supplementary capital”). Only this “allocatable capital” is available for
allocation to the various categories of risk. The portion of revaluation reserves that is considered more transitory in nature is assigned to
the “capital filter” together with the profit accrued during the financial year.

As part of the annual capital planning process, Management allocates economic capital to risk categories within the amount of allocatable
capital. As a first step, capital is assigned to an “economic capital cushion” that provides an additional margin of safety and is sufficient to
sustain a potential material loss without the need to reduce the capital allocation to individual risk categories or to liquidate any holdings
of assets. The level of the economic capital cushion is determined based on stress tests that explore extreme but still plausible default events.
Allocations are then made to each category of financial risk (ie credit, market and “other risks”) as well as operational risk. “Other risks” are
risks that have been identified but that are not taken into account in the economic capital utilisation calculations, and include model risk
and residual basis risk. Reflecting the high level of solvency targeted by the Bank, the economic capital framework measures economic
capital to a 99.995% confidence level assuming a one-year horizon, except for settlement risk (included in the utilisation for credit risk) and
other risks. The amount of economic capital set aside for settlement risk and other risks is based on an assessment by Management. The
Bank’s economic capital framework is subject to regular review and calibration.
With effect from 1 July 2014, the Bank calculates the economic capital utilisation for market risk on the basis of a stressed market data set.
The reported economic capital utilisation figures for market risk for the prior reporting period have been restated for comparative purposes.
The restatement resulted in an increase in the economic capital for market risk of SDR 931.9 million as at 31 March 2014. The following
table summarises the Bank’s economic capital allocation and utilisation for credit risk, market risk, operational risk and other risks:

3. Financial leverage
The Bank complements its capital adequacy assessment with a prudent financial leverage framework. As from 1 July 2014, the Bank
monitors its financial leverage using a ratio that takes account of regulatory guidance issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
related to the leverage ratio. The Bank thereby uses a leverage ratio that compares the Bank’s adjusted common equity with its total
exposure. However, to reflect the scope and nature of its banking activities, the Bank’s definition of adjusted common equity limits the
recognition of revaluation reserves to the proportion of the gold and securities revaluation reserves that is considered sustainable
(“sustainable supplementary capital”). Further, the exposure measure is supplemented by the inclusion of committed and uncommitted
facilities, and pension fund assets.
The table below shows the calculation of the Bank’s financial leverage ratio under the methodology in effect since 1 July 2014. This table
does not include comparative data as at 31 March 2014 because the methodology was not in use on that date.

The Basel III leverage ratio differs from the above in using Common Equity Tier 1 as its capital measure instead of adjusted common equity
(item A in the table above). The Basel III leverage ratio was 8.0% as at 31 March 2015.
Before 1 July 2014, the Bank monitored its financial leverage using a leverage ratio that compared the Bank’s Tier 1 capital with its total
balance sheet assets. Total balance sheet assets include derivative assets and securities purchased under repurchase agreements (“reverse
repurchase agreements”) on a gross basis in accordance with the Bank’s accounting policies. The table below shows the calculation of the

4. Capital ratios
The economic capital framework and the financial leverage framework described above are the main tools used for assessing the Bank’s
capital adequacy. Risk-weighted assets, minimum capital requirements and capital ratios are disclosed to facilitate comparability. Guidance
issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision includes several approaches for calculating risk-weighted assets and the corresponding
minimum capital requirements. In principle, the minimum capital requirements are determined by taking 8% of the risk-weighted assets.
For credit risk, the Bank has adopted the advanced internal ratings-based approach for the majority of its exposures. Under this approach,
the risk weighting for a transaction is determined by the relevant risk weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs. For
securitisation exposures and relevant other assets, the Bank has adopted the standardised approach. Under this approach, risk weightings
are mapped to exposure types.
Risk-weighted assets for market risk are derived following an internal models approach. For operational risk, the advanced measurement
approach is used. Both these approaches rely on value-at-risk (VaR) methodologies.
More details on the assumptions underlying the calculations are provided in notes 3, 4 and 5 of the “Risk management” section.

A. Tier 1 capital ratio

Expected loss is calculated for credit risk exposures subject to the advanced internal ratings-based approach. The expected loss is calculated
at the balance sheet date taking into account any impairment provision which is reflected in the Bank’s financial statements. The Bank had
no impaired financial assets at 31 March 2015 (2014: nil). In accordance with the requirements of the Basel II framework, any expected loss
is compared with the impairment provision and any shortfall is deducted from the Bank’s Tier 1 capital.

B. Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio
To facilitate comparability, information on risk-weighted assets and related minimum capital requirements calculated under the Basel III
framework is provided in the following table. Relating to market risk, Basel III risk-weighted assets are calculated as the sum of risk-weighted
assets based on a stressed VaR and the Basel II market risk-weighted assets (presented in the previous section). Credit risk-weighted assets
also differ, mainly due to the asset value correlation multiplier for large financial institutions.

Risk management

1. Risks faced by the Bank
The Bank supports its customers, predominantly central banks, monetary authorities and international financial institutions, in the
management of their reserves and related financial activities.
Banking activities form an essential element of meeting the Bank’s objectives and ensure its financial strength and independence. The BIS
engages in banking activities that are customer-related as well as activities that are related to the investment of its equity, each of which
may give rise to financial risk comprising credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The Bank is also exposed to operational risk.
Within the risk frameworks defined by the Board of Directors, the Management of the Bank has established risk management policies
designed to ensure that risks are identified, appropriately measured and controlled as well as monitored and reported.

2. Risk management approach and organisation
The Bank maintains superior credit quality and adopts a prudent approach to financial risk-taking, by:

•
•
•
•

maintaining an exceptionally strong capital position;

•

maintaining a high level of liquidity.

investing its assets predominantly in high credit quality financial instruments;
seeking to diversify its assets across a range of sectors;
adopting a conservative approach to its tactical market risk-taking and carefully managing market risk associated with the Bank’s
strategic positions, which include its gold holdings; and

A. Organisation
Under Article 39 of the Bank’s Statutes, the General Manager is responsible to the Board for the management of the Bank, and is assisted
by the Deputy General Manager. The Deputy General Manager is responsible for the Bank’s independent risk control and compliance
functions. The General Manager and the Deputy General Manager are supported by senior management advisory committees.
The key advisory committees are the Executive Committee, the Finance Committee and the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee.
The first two committees are chaired by the General Manager and the third by the Deputy General Manager, and all include other senior
members of the Bank’s Management. The Executive Committee advises the General Manager primarily on the Bank’s strategic planning and
the allocation of resources, as well as on decisions related to the broad financial objectives for the banking activities and operational risk
management. The Finance Committee advises the General Manager on the financial management and policy issues related to the banking
business, including the allocation of economic capital to risk categories. The Compliance and Operational Risk Committee acts as an
advisory committee to the Deputy General Manager and ensures the coordination of compliance matters and operational risk management
throughout the Bank.
The independent risk control function for financial risks is performed by the Risk Control unit. The independent operational risk control
function is shared between Risk Control, which maintains the operational risk quantification, and the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit.
Both units report directly to the Deputy General Manager.
The Bank’s compliance function is performed by the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit. The objective of this function is to provide
reasonable assurance that the activities of the Bank and its staff conform to applicable laws and regulations, the BIS Statutes, the Bank’s
Code of Conduct and other internal rules, policies and relevant standards of sound practice.
The Compliance and Operational Risk Unit identifies and assesses compliance risks and guides and educates staff on compliance issues. The
Head of the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit also has a direct reporting line to the Audit Committee, which is an advisory committee
to the Board of Directors.

222

BIS 85th Annual Report

The Finance unit and the Legal Service complement the Bank’s risk management. The Finance unit operates an independent valuation
control function, produces the Bank’s financial statements and controls the Bank’s expenditure by setting and monitoring the annual budget.
The objective of the independent valuation control function is to ensure that the Bank’s valuations comply with its valuation policy and
procedures, and that the processes and procedures which influence the Bank’s valuations conform to best practice guidelines. The Finance
unit reports to the Deputy General Manager and the Secretary General.
The Legal Service provides legal advice and support covering a wide range of issues relating to the Bank’s activities. The Legal Service has
a direct reporting line to the General Manager.
The Internal Audit function reviews internal control procedures and reports on how they comply with internal standards and industry best
practices. The scope of internal audit work includes the review of risk management procedures, internal control systems, information systems
and governance processes. Internal Audit has reporting lines to the General Manager and the Deputy General Manager, and to the Audit
Committee.

B. Risk monitoring and reporting
The Bank’s financial and operational risk profile, position and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis by the relevant units.
Financial risk and compliance reports aimed at various management levels are provided regularly to enable Management to adequately
assess the Bank’s risk profile and financial condition.
Management reports financial and risk information to the Board of Directors on a monthly and a quarterly basis. Furthermore, the Audit
Committee receives regular reports from Internal Audit, the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit and the Finance unit. The Banking and
Risk Management Committee, another advisory committee to the Board, receives regular reports from the Risk Control unit. The preparation
of reports is subject to comprehensive policies and procedures, thus ensuring strong controls.

C. Risk methodologies
The Bank revalues virtually all of its financial instruments to fair value on a daily basis and reviews its valuations monthly, taking into account
necessary adjustments for impairment. It uses a comprehensive range of quantitative methodologies for valuing financial instruments and
for measuring risk to its net profit and equity. The Bank reassesses its quantitative methodologies in the light of its changing risk environment
and evolving best practice.
The Bank’s model validation policy defines the roles and responsibilities and processes related to the implementation of new or materially
changed risk models.
A key methodology used by the Bank to measure and manage risk is the calculation of economic capital based on value-at-risk (VaR)
techniques. VaR expresses the statistical estimate of the maximum potential loss on the current positions of the Bank measured to a
specified level of confidence and a specified time horizon. VaR models depend on statistical assumptions and the quality of available market
data and, while forward-looking, they extrapolate from past events. VaR models may underestimate potential losses if changes in risk factors
fail to align with the distribution assumptions. VaR figures do not provide any information on losses that may occur beyond the assumed
confidence level.
The Bank’s economic capital framework covers credit risk, market risk, operational risk and other risks. As part of the annual capital planning
process, the Bank allocates economic capital to the above risk categories commensurate with principles set by the Board and taking account
of the business strategy. Reflecting the high solvency level targeted by the Bank, the economic capital framework measures economic capital
to a 99.995% confidence level assuming a one-year holding period. An additional amount of economic capital is set aside for “other risks”
based on Management’s assessment of risks which are not reflected in the economic capital calculations. Moreover, capital is also allocated
to an “economic capital cushion” that is based on stress tests that explore extreme but still plausible default events. The economic capital
cushion provides an additional margin of safety to sustain a potential material loss without the need to reduce the capital allocated to
individual risk categories or to liquidate any holdings of assets.
The management of the Bank’s capital adequacy is complemented by a comprehensive stress testing framework, and a prudent financial
leverage framework. The stress testing framework supplements the Bank’s risk assessment including its VaR and economic capital calculations
for financial risk. The Bank’s key market risk factors and credit exposures are stress-tested. The stress testing includes the analysis of severe
historical and adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, as well as sensitivity tests of extreme but still plausible movements of the key
risk factors identified. The Bank also performs stress tests related to liquidity risk. The financial leverage framework focuses on a ratio that
sets the Bank’s adjusted common equity in relation to its total balance sheet exposure.

3. Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to meet its obligations in accordance with the agreed contractual terms and conditions.
A financial asset is considered past due when a counterparty fails to make a payment on the contractual due date.
The Bank manages credit risk within a framework and policies set by the Board of Directors and Management. These are complemented by
more detailed guidelines and procedures at the level of the independent risk control function.

A. Credit risk assessment
Credit risk is continuously controlled at both a counterparty and an aggregated level. As part of the independent risk control function,
individual counterparty credit assessments are performed subject to a well defined internal rating process, involving 18 rating grades. As
part of this process, counterparty financial statements and market information are analysed. The rating methodologies depend on the
nature of the counterparty. Based on the internal rating and specific counterparty features, the Bank sets a series of credit limits covering
individual counterparties and countries. Internal ratings are assigned to all counterparties. In principle, the ratings and related limits are
reviewed at least annually. The main assessment criterion in these reviews is the ability of the counterparties to meet interest and principal
repayment obligations in a timely manner.
Credit risk limits at the counterparty level are approved by the Bank’s Management and fit within a framework set by the Board of Directors.
On an aggregated level, credit risk, including default and country transfer risk, is measured, monitored and controlled based on the Bank’s
economic capital calculation for credit risk. To calculate economic capital for credit risk, the Bank uses a portfolio VaR model. Management
limits the Bank’s overall exposure to credit risk by allocating an amount of economic capital to credit risk.

B. Default risk
The following tables show the exposure of the Bank to default risk, without taking into account any collateral held or other credit
enhancements available to the Bank. Credit risk is mitigated through the use of collateral and legally enforceable netting or setoff
agreements. The corresponding assets and liabilities are not offset on the balance sheet.
The exposures set out in the tables below are based on the carrying value of the assets on the balance sheet as categorised by sector,
geographical region and credit quality. The carrying value is the fair value of the financial instruments, including derivatives, except in the
case of very short-term financial instruments (sight and notice accounts) and gold, which are shown at amortised cost net of any impairment
charge. Commitments are reported at their notional amounts. Gold and gold loans exclude gold bar assets held in custody, and accounts
receivable do not include unsettled liability issues, because these items do not represent credit exposures of the Bank.
The vast majority of the Bank’s assets are invested in securities issued by governments and financial institutions rated A– or above by at
least one of the major external credit assessment institutions. Limitations on the number of high-quality counterparties in these sectors
mean that the Bank is exposed to single-name concentration risk.
The Bank conducts an annual review for impairment at the date of each balance sheet. At 31 March 2015 the Bank did not have any financial
assets that were considered to be impaired (2014: nil). At 31 March 2015 no financial assets were considered past due (2014: nil). No credit
loss was recognised in the current period.

C. Credit risk mitigation

Netting
Netting agreements give the Bank a legally enforceable right to net transactions with counterparties under potential future conditions,
notably an event of default. Such master netting or similar agreements apply to counterparties with whom the Bank conducts most of its
derivative transactions, as well as to counterparties for repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. Where required, netting is applied
when determining the amount of collateral to be requested or provided, but the Bank does not settle assets and liabilities on a net basis
during the normal course of business. As such, the amounts shown on the Bank’s balance sheet are the gross amounts.

Collateral
The Bank also mitigates the credit risks it is exposed to by requiring counterparties to provide collateral. The Bank receives collateral in
respect of most derivative contracts, reverse repurchase agreements and for advances made under collateralised facility agreements. During
the term of these transactions, further collateral may be called or collateral may be released based on the movements in value of both
the underlying instrument and the collateral that has been received. The Bank is required to provide collateral in respect of repurchase
agreements.
For derivative contracts and reverse repurchase agreements, the Bank accepts as collateral high-quality sovereign, state agency and supranational
securities and, in a limited number of cases, cash. For advances made under collateralised facility agreements, eligible collateral accepted
includes currency deposits with the Bank as well as units in the BIS Investment Pools.
Under the terms of its collateral arrangements, the Bank is permitted to sell (”re-hypothecate”) collateral received on derivative contracts
and reverse repurchase agreements, but upon expiry of the transaction must return equivalent financial instruments to the counterparty. At
31 March 2015 the Bank had not sold any of the collateral it held (2014: nil).
The fair value of collateral held which the Bank had the right to sell was:

Financial assets and liabilities subject to netting or collateralisation
The tables below show the categories of assets and liabilities which are either subject to collateralisation, or for which netting agreements
would apply under potential future conditions such as the event of default of a counterparty.
The amount of collateral required is usually based on valuations performed on the previous business day, whereas the Bank’s balance sheet
reflects the valuations of the reporting date. Due to this timing difference, the valuation of collateral can be higher than the valuation of
the underlying contract in the Bank’s balance sheet. The amount of the collateral obtained is also impacted by thresholds, minimum transfer
amounts and valuation adjustments (“haircuts”) specified in the contracts. In these tables, the mitigating effect of collateral has been limited
to the balance sheet value of the underlying net asset.

D. Economic capital for credit risk
The Bank determines economic capital for credit risk (except for settlement risk, which is included in the utilisation for credit risk) using a
VaR methodology on the basis of a portfolio VaR model, assuming a one-year time horizon and a 99.995% confidence level. The amount
of economic capital set aside for settlement risk reflected in the Bank’s economic capital calculations is based on an assessment by
Management.

E. Minimum capital requirements for credit risk
Exposure to sovereigns, banks and corporates
For the calculation of risk-weighted assets for exposures to banks, sovereigns and corporates, the Bank has adopted an approach that is
consistent with the advanced internal ratings-based approach.
As a general rule, under this approach risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying the credit risk exposures with risk weights derived
from the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs. These estimates for key inputs are also relevant
to the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit risk.
The credit risk exposure for a transaction or position is referred to as the exposure at default (EAD). The Bank determines the EAD as the
notional amount of all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures, except for derivative contracts and certain collateralised exposures. The EAD
for derivatives is calculated using an approach consistent with the internal models method proposed under the Basel II framework. In line
with this methodology, the Bank calculates effective expected positive exposures that are then multiplied by a factor alpha as set out in the
framework.
Key inputs to the risk weight function are a counterparty’s estimated one-year probability of default (PD) as well as the estimated loss-givendefault (LGD) and maturity for each transaction.
Due to the high credit quality of the Bank’s investments and the conservative credit risk management process at the BIS, the Bank is not in
a position to estimate PDs and LGDs based on its own default experience. The Bank calibrates each counterparty PD estimate through a mapping
of internal rating grades to external credit assessments taking external default data into account. Similarly, LGD estimates are derived from
external data. Where appropriate, these estimates are adjusted to reflect the risk-reducing effects of collateral obtained giving consideration
to market price volatility, re-margining and revaluation frequency. The recognition of the risk-reducing effects of collateral obtained for
derivative contracts, reverse repurchase agreements and collateralised advances is accounted for in calculating the EAD.
The table below details the calculation of risk-weighted assets. The exposures are measured taking netting and collateral benefits into
account. The total amount of exposures reported in the table as at 31 March 2015 includes SDR 184.5 million for interest rate contracts
(2014: SDR 208.5 million) and SDR 1,229.5 million for FX and gold contracts (2014: SDR 229.4 million). In line with the Basel II framework, the
minimum capital requirement is determined as 8% of risk-weighted assets.

Securitisation exposures
The Bank invests in highly rated securitisation exposures based on traditional, ie non-synthetic, securitisation structures. Given the scope of
the Bank’s activities, risk-weighted assets under the Basel II framework are determined according to the standardised approach for
securitisation. Under this approach, external credit assessments of the securities are used to determine the relevant risk weights. External
credit assessment institutions used for this purpose are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Risk-weighted assets
are then derived as the product of the market values of the exposures and the associated risk weights. In line with the Basel II framework,
the minimum capital requirement is determined as 8% of risk-weighted assets.

4. Market risk
The Bank is exposed to market risk through adverse movements in market prices. The main components of the Bank’s market risk are gold
price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The Bank measures market risk and calculates economic capital based on a VaR
methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Risk factor volatilities and correlations are estimated, subject to an exponential
weighting scheme, over a four-year observation period. Furthermore, the Bank computes sensitivities to certain market risk factors.
In line with the Bank’s objective of maintaining its superior credit quality, economic capital is measured at the 99.995% confidence level
assuming a one-year holding period. As from 1 July 2014, the Bank calculates the economic capital utilisation for market risk on the basis
of a stressed market data set. The Bank’s Management manages market risk economic capital usage within a framework set by the Board
of Directors. VaR limits are supplemented by operating limits.
To ensure that models provide a reliable measure of potential losses over the one-year time horizon, the Bank has established a comprehensive
regular back-testing framework, comparing daily performance with corresponding VaR estimates. The results are analysed and reported to
Management.
The Bank also supplements its market risk measurement based on VaR modelling and related economic capital calculations with a series of
stress tests. These include severe historical scenarios, adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios and sensitivity tests of gold price,
interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements.

232

BIS 85th Annual Report

A. Gold price risk
Gold price risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in the price of gold.
The Bank is exposed to gold price risk principally through its holdings of gold investment assets, which amount to 108 tonnes
(2014: 111 tonnes). These gold investment assets are held in custody or placed on deposit with commercial banks. At 31 March 2015 the
Bank’s net gold investment assets amounted to SDR 2,998.3 million (2014: SDR 2,981.8 million), approximately 16% of its equity (2014: 17%).
The Bank sometimes also has small exposures to gold price risk arising from its banking activities with central and commercial banks. Gold
price risk is measured within the Bank’s VaR methodology, including its economic capital framework and stress tests.

B. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates including credit spreads. The Bank
is exposed to interest rate risk through the interest bearing assets relating to the management of its equity held in its investment portfolios
and investments relating to its banking portfolios. The investment portfolios are managed using a fixed-duration benchmark of bonds.
The Bank measures and monitors interest rate risk using a VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses taking into account movements in
relevant money market rates, government bond yields, swap rates and credit spreads.
The tables below show the impact on the Bank’s equity of a 1% upward shift in the relevant yield curve per time band:

C. Foreign exchange risk
The Bank’s functional currency, the SDR, is a composite currency comprising fixed amounts of USD, EUR, JPY and GBP. Currency risk is the
exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in exchange rates. The Bank is exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily
through the assets relating to the management of its equity. The Bank is also exposed to foreign exchange risk through managing its
customer deposits and through acting as an intermediary in foreign exchange transactions. The Bank reduces its foreign exchange exposures
by matching the relevant assets to the constituent currencies of the SDR on a regular basis, and by limiting currency exposures arising from
customer deposits and foreign exchange transaction intermediation.
The following tables show the Bank’s assets and liabilities by currency and gold exposure. The net foreign exchange and gold position in
these tables therefore includes the Bank’s gold investments. To determine the Bank’s net foreign exchange exposure, the gold amounts need
to be removed. The SDR-neutral position is then deducted from the net foreign exchange position excluding gold to arrive at the net
currency exposure of the Bank on an SDR-neutral basis.

D. Economic capital for market risk
The Bank measures market risk based on a VaR methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique taking correlations between risk
factors into account. Economic capital for market risk is also calculated following this methodology measured to the 99.995% confidence
level and assuming a one-year holding period. With effect from 1 July 2014, the Bank calculates the economic capital utilisation for market
risk on the basis of a stressed market data set. The reported economic capital utilisation figures for market risk for the prior reporting period
have been restated for comparative purposes. The stressed data set is subject to regular review and calibrated to take account of the Bank’s
key market risk exposures and market risk drivers.
The Bank measures its gold price risk relative to changes in the USD value of gold. The foreign exchange risk component, resulting from
changes in the USD exchange rate versus the SDR, is included in the measurement of foreign exchange risk. The table below shows the key
figures of the Bank’s exposure to market risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years:

E. Minimum capital requirements for market risk
For the calculation of minimum capital requirements for market risk under the Basel II framework, the Bank has adopted a banking book
approach consistent with the scope and nature of its business activities. Consequently, market risk-weighted assets are determined for gold
price risk and foreign exchange risk, but not interest rate risk. The related minimum capital requirement is derived using the VaR-based
internal models method. Under this method, VaR calculations are performed using the Bank’s VaR methodology, assuming a 99% confidence
level and a 10-day holding period.
The actual minimum capital requirement is derived as the higher of the VaR on the calculation date and the average of the daily VaR
measures on each of the preceding 60 business days (including the calculation date) subject to a multiplication factor of three plus a
potential add-on depending on backtesting results. For the period under consideration, the number of backtesting outliers observed

5. Operational risk
Operational risk is defined by the Bank as the risk of financial loss, or damage to the Bank’s reputation, or both, resulting from one or more
risk causes, as outlined below:

•

Human factors: insufficient personnel, lack of requisite knowledge, skills or experience, inadequate training and development, inadequate
supervision, loss of key personnel, inadequate succession planning, or lack of integrity or ethical standards.

•

Failed or inadequate processes: a process is poorly designed or unsuitable, or is not properly documented, understood, implemented,
followed or enforced.

•
•

Failed or inadequate systems: a system is poorly designed, unsuitable or unavailable, or does not operate as intended.
External events: the occurrence of an event having an adverse impact on the Bank but outside its control.

Operational risk includes legal risk, but excludes strategic risk.
The Bank’s operational risk management framework, policies and procedures comprise the management and measurement of operational
risk, including the determination of the relevant key parameters and inputs, business continuity planning and the monitoring of key risk
indicators.
The Bank has established a procedure of immediate reporting for operational risk-related incidents. The Compliance and Operational Risk
Unit develops action plans with the respective units and follows up on their implementation on a regular basis.
For the measurement of operational risk economic capital and operational risk-weighted assets, the Bank has adopted a VaR approach using
a Monte Carlo simulation technique that is consistent with the advanced measurement approach proposed under the Basel II framework.
In line with the assumptions of the Basel II framework, the quantification of operational risk does not take reputational risk into account.
Internal and external loss data, scenario estimates and control self-assessments to reflect changes in the business and control environment
of the Bank are key inputs in the calculations. In quantifying its operational risk, the Bank does not take potential protection it may obtain
from insurance into account.

A. Economic capital for operational risk
Consistent with the parameters used in the calculation of economic capital for financial risk, the Bank measures economic capital for
operational risk to the 99.995% confidence level assuming a one-year holding period. The table below shows the key figures of the Bank’s
exposure to operational risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years.

6. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises when the Bank may not be able to meet expected or unexpected current or future cash flows and collateral needs
without affecting its daily operations or its financial condition.
The Bank’s currency and gold deposits, principally from central banks and international institutions, comprise 94% (2014: 94%) of its total
liabilities. At 31 March 2015 currency and gold deposits originated from 166 depositors (2014: 175). Within these deposits, there are
significant individual customer concentrations, with four customers each contributing in excess of 5% of the total on a settlement date basis
(2014: five customers).
Outstanding balances in the currency and gold deposits from central banks, international organisations and other public institutions are the
key drivers of the size of the Bank’s balance sheet. The Bank is exposed to funding liquidity risk mainly because of the short-term nature of
its deposits and because it undertakes to repurchase at fair value certain of its currency deposit instruments at one or two business days’
notice. In line with the Bank’s objective to maintain a high level of liquidity, it has developed a liquidity management framework, including
a ratio, based on conservative assumptions for estimating the liquidity available and the liquidity required.

A. Maturity profile of cash flows
The following tables show the maturity profile of cash flows for assets and liabilities. The amounts disclosed are the undiscounted cash flows
to which the Bank is committed. Options are included in the table at fair value and are shown in the ”Up to 1 month” category.

B. Liquidity ratio
The Bank has adopted a liquidity risk framework taking into account regulatory guidance issued by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision related to the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The framework is based on a liquidity ratio that compares the Bank’s available
liquidity with a liquidity requirement over a one-month time horizon assuming a stress scenario. In line with the Basel III liquidity framework,
the underlying stress scenario combines an idiosyncratic and a market crisis. However, the liquidity ratio differs in construction from the LCR
to reflect the nature and scope of the BIS banking activities − in particular, the short-term nature of the Bank’s balance sheet. Within the
Bank’s liquidity framework, the Board of Directors has set a limit for the Bank’s liquidity ratio which requires the liquidity available to be at
least 100% of the potential liquidity requirement.
The table below provides information on the development of the Bank’s liquidity ratio for the last two years. For reference, the LCR as
defined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is also included.

Further information on the liquidity ratio is provided in the sections below.

Liquidity available
The liquidity available is determined as the cash inflow from financial instruments over a one-month horizon, along with potential additional
liquidity which could be generated from the disposal of highly liquid securities, or by entering into sale and repurchase agreements for a
part of the Bank’s remaining unencumbered high-quality liquid securities. The assessment of this potential additional liquidity involves two
steps. First, there is an assessment of the credit quality and market liquidity of the securities. Second, the process of converting the identified
securities into cash is modelled by projecting the amount that could be reasonably collected.

Liquidity required
Consistent with the stress scenario, the Bank determines the liquidity required as the sum of the cash outflow from financial instruments
over a one-month horizon, the estimated early withdrawal of currency deposits, and the estimated drawings of undrawn facilities. As regards
the calculation of the liquidity needs related to currency deposits, it is assumed that all deposits that mature within the time horizon
are not rolled-over and that a proportion of non-maturing currency deposits is withdrawn from the Bank prior to contractual maturity. At
31 March 2015, the estimated outflow of currency deposits in response to the stress scenario amounted to 41.3% (2014: 42.9%) of the total
stock of currency deposits. Moreover, it is assumed that undrawn facilities committed by the Bank would be fully drawn by customers, along
with a proportion of undrawn uncommitted facilities.

Independent auditor’s report
To the Board of Directors and to the General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements, Basel
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Bank for International Settlements (pages
173–243), which comprise of the balance sheet as at 31 March 2015, the related profit and loss account,
statement of comprehensive income, statement of cash flows and movements in the Bank’s equity for
the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Management’s responsibility
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
accordance with the accounting principles described in the financial statements and the Statutes of the
Bank. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system
relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error. Management is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting
policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is the express an option on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply
with ethical responsibilities and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurances whether the
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the
entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s
internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015 give a true and fair view of
the financial position of the Bank for International Settlements and of its financial performance and its
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the accounting principles described in the financial
statements and the Statutes of the Bank.
