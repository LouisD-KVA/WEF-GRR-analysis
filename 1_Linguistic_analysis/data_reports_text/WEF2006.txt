1. Executive Summary: Towards a more
sophisticated understanding of global risks
This document summarizes the output of a
collaboration between the World Economic Forum,
MMC (Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.), Merrill
Lynch and Swiss Re, in association with the Risk
Management and Decision Processes Center of the
Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, on
the topic of Global Risks. A longer document
containing more information on the genesis of the
World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Programme, on
the methodologies employed and detailing the
scenarios constructed is available at
www.weforum.org.
The purpose of this collaboration, building on work
undertaken in 2004, was to:
• identify and assess current and emerging global
risks in the 2006 and 2015 time horizons;
• study the links between them and to assess their
likely effect on different markets and industries; and
• advance the thinking around more effective
mitigation of global risks.
The global risk landscape
The 2006 risk landscape is dominated by high impact
headline risks, such as terrorism and an influenza
pandemic, which top the global risk mitigation agenda
and are increasingly well understood. Other risks, like
climate change, whose cumulative impact will only be
felt over the longer term, have begun to move to the
centre of the policy debate and may offer the greatest
challenges for global risk mitigation in the future.
Finally, we consider a number of potential risks whose
outcomes are as yet very unclear, such as those
associated with new technologies. These risks are
thought about by few, but have the potential to be
highly disruptive in the future. In many ways 2005 was
a wake-up call. What is needed now are positive
responses, innovation and an understanding of
potential business opportunities implicit in a rapidly
changing environment.
Impacts can be greater than the sum of
their parts
Identification of individual global risks, however, is only
one part of the story. In reality, global risks rarely
manifest themselves in isolation. The combination of
speed (the effects of global risks travel fast), the
interconnectivity of the global system as well as its

deepening complexity can lead to rapid and
unexpected contagion of global risks across
industries and geographical areas. The interplay of
multiple global risks and their combined ripple effects
can create potentially disastrous “perfect storms” –
cumulative events which cause damage far in excess
of the sum of each individual risk event. In 2005,
Hurricane Katrina provided a powerful example of
conflation that will have long-term impacts. Avian flu
may present similar global challenges, should
widespread human-to-human transmission occur.
Global solutions to global risks
Internationally collaborative approaches like those
coordinated by the World Health Organization and
public-private cooperation on global risk mitigation
can help to improve the way the world deals with risk.
Similarly, there is scope for more widespread and
effective initiative by the private sector. Incentives
need to be properly aligned to make risk mitigation
as much about proactive prevention as about reactive
recovery.
In some cases, as in the increasing contribution of
business to disaster relief and the growth of
innovative financial instruments to price risk, more
sophisticated mitigation approaches are developing.
However, our collective ability to mitigate global risks
is still seriously hampered by divergent perceptions of
the nature and importance of such risks; differing
agendas; and the inability of any government,
business or international institution to address these
risks independently.
Looking to a better future
The World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Programme
has identified three core areas where these problems
can be addressed and risk mitigation improved:
• enhancement of the quality of information on risk
and its flow amongst stakeholders;
• reassessment of risk priorities and reallocation of
resources and incentives accordingly; and
• strengthening the capacity and resilience of
business and political and administrative institutions
at all levels.
No one can succeed alone in dealing effectively with
global risks. An integrated multistakeholder approach
offers the best hope of increasing our capacity to
pre-empt, manage and mitigate global risks.

2. Today’s global risk landscape
Over the past 13 months the world has suffered a
spate of major risk events, from the Indian Ocean
tsunami, through a string of hurricanes in the Gulf of
Mexico, to the suicide bomb attacks in London
during the G-8 Summit and the earthquake in
Pakistan. At the beginning of 2006, the global risk
most preoccupying global business and political
leaders is the H5N1 avian flu virus.
But these were only the most prominent features of
the changing risk landscape. Since the 2005 World
Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, the
participants in the Global Risk Programme have
worked to refine their understanding of global risks

through expert workshops, with the aim of identifying
and assessing truly global risks and moving forward
the global discussion on risk mitigation. A summary
of 25 global risk scenarios generated by the Global
Risks Programme can be found in the appendix to
this document. The scenarios are available on-line at
www.weforum.org.
Some of the risks identified are those that generally
top the list of risk concerns of states and businesses
because they are considered to be highly likely or
highly damaging, or both. These include terrorism,
oil-price spikes, fiscal crises, pandemics and
earthquakes. These risks were rarely out of the
headlines in 2005.

Many of the headline risks of 2005 will continue to dominate headlines in 2006…
The geopolitical risk landscape is still dominated by the risk (real and perceived) of terrorism. The capacity
of terrorist organizations to act globally in a coordinated way has diminished, but the risks of localized
terror remain high. Should an attack incorporate chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, or target critical
infrastructure (such as transport networks, critical information infrastructure (CII) or water and electricity
supplies), the human and economic costs will bring new pressures to bear on public policy. The world
suffered an oil-price spike above US$ 70 in 2005. The spike was lower (in real terms) than those of the
1970s, but the world’s reliance on hydrocarbons and growing concerns about the geopolitics of supply
mean that oil prices will inevitably be an issue of concern in 2006 and beyond. Some parts of the world
have been living with fiscal crises for a number of years, but, in the year in which the “baby boomer”
generation starts reaching retirement age, the risks to global prosperity are apparent. The long-term
economic health of developed countries, as well as the medium-term values of their currencies, may
depend on how fiscal reforms are undertaken. The fear of an avian flu virus mutating to enable human-tohuman transmission and sparking an influenza pandemic has caused acute concern both in the
developed and developing world; the long-term human, societal and economic effects of diseases such as
HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria continue to debilitate large parts of the developing world. Finally, the Pakistan
earthquake provided a lesson as to our current incapacity to respond sufficiently to major humanitarian
crises and a warning that many parts of the world remain highly vulnerable to natural disaster.

Other risks, such as those stemming from climate
change, are still emerging. Consensus on the nature
of this risk and its consequences for global society
and for the global economy has not yet been
reached, though a growing body of scientific
evidence points to the seriousness of the long-term
challenge. The spread of liability regimes is already

2

causing concern. Still other potential risks – like
those deriving from Electro-Magnetic Fields (EMF) or
counterfeiting, to take two examples – are on the
radar screen of only a small section of the
international business and political community.
They may yet develop into the headline risks of
tomorrow.

Global Risks 2006

…while a range of other risks may move
up the global agenda
Climate change has long been viewed as a
source of risk, and may become irreversible over
the next 10 to 20 years. There is growing
consensus that the phenomenon is real, even if
there are wide differences of opinion over its
effects. As research improves and as the global
community reaches a better understanding of
the relationship – or lack of it – between extreme
weather events and climate change, the issue
will move up the risk mitigation agenda. The
spread of liability regimes from the United
States, representing a growing societal aversion
to risk and placing an increasing cost on
business through large and unpredictable claims,
will attract increasing attention. The manufacture
and spread of counterfeit (pirated) goods is
already a political issue between states with
knowledge-based economies and certain
countries growing their manufacturing sectors.
Companies in the entertainment, software and
pharmaceutical industries are taking steps to
prevent the erosion of the value of their
investments, but the risk with many counterfeit
products is defects and damage to reputation
rather than just the loss of profit. The
phenomenon of illicit trade remains only partly
understood – and its increasingly widespread
nature poses risks which go well beyond the
industries that are presently affected. Riskrelated expectations need to be clarified and
better managed in the realm of ElectroMagnetic Fields (EMF), generated by a large
(and increasing) number of 21st century
electronic devices, including mobile phones. If it
were to transpire that EMF had widespread
harmful health effects at relatively low exposure
levels, this would have huge societal and
economic impacts.

Outliers: potentially significant risks
that did not make it onto the watch list
for 2006 and beyond
There are some potential risks that have not yet
penetrated public consciousness, but which
might have severe consequences. Space
weather is one example: unseen and unknown
to most people. The sun is the main source; its
output varies normally over a period of 11 years
and the recent high of solar activity occurred in
2000. Solar flares produce radiation bursts
across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio
waves to x-rays and gamma-rays, while solar
winds buffet the earth's magnetic field and can
produce storms in the magnetosphere. Space
weather constantly has low-level effects on
technology, interspersed with occasional
dramatic events. Given ever-present solar activity
and an increasingly technology-dependent
society on earth, space weather disturbances
are likely to grow in importance. They can affect
power supplies, radio communications,
navigation equipment and geophysical
exploration, impacting public safety, information
services, defence, industrial processes and
transport networks. To give one example:
radiation doses received by passengers and
crew of airplanes at cruising altitudes are 20 to
30 times higher than they are on the ground,
and major solar particle events can significantly
increase this dose, especially over the polar
regions. The loss of biodiversity is another
example: the rapid loss of species may reduce
our ability to use nature as a template for
pharmaceutical remedies and could have
profound negative effects on environmental
sustainability.

Global Risks 2006

Four key risk scenarios
These four risk scenarios, drawn from the extensive
list available on-line at www.weforum.org, illustrate
different manifestations of global risk in the decade
ahead. They include risks whose probability is high
in the short term, such as an oil price spike and

localized terrorist incidents, for which companies
and governments are relatively well-prepared. They
also include risks whose impact is potentially very
severe, such as an influenza pandemic – if mutation
of an avian virus enables human-to human
transmission – and, over the longer-term, climate
change.

Oil Price Shock – price spike above
US$ 80-100/bl
Hydrocarbons drive the world economy. As demand grows, with economic growth in India and China in
particular, there are fears that prices will rise and geopolitical competition to secure resources for future
supply will sharpen. There is certainty that higher emissions will cause further environmental damage. The
scenario is that of an oil price spike above US$ 80/bl in the short term, which has both a very high
probability and a very severe impact. An oil price spike results principally in the transfer of funds from oilconsuming countries to oil-producing countries, as happened in 2005. However, the ancillary effects
include damage to business confidence and higher inflation which may contribute to a global economic
slowdown. In the relatively unlikely event that oil prices remained above US$ 100/bl for an extended period
over the next decade, the costs would be on a par with the oil price shocks of the 1970s, which led to
geopolitical shifts and caused economic disruption and social unrest in oil-consuming countries.

Influenza pandemic
The risk of a pandemic flu, particularly one caused by human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 or
another avian flu virus, is now a dominant theme in the global conversation on risk. While the spread of a
pandemic can be modelled, we do not know when, where (or whether) the H5N1 virus will mutate so as to
allow it to spread easily from one person to another. Humans have little or no immunity to H5N1 and no
vaccine to protect against it currently exists. Present supplies of antiviral drugs are insufficient to deal with
a major pandemic outbreak. If person-to-person infection were to become commonplace, the
vulnerabilities of our interconnected global systems would intensify the human and economic impact. A
lethal flu, its spread facilitated by global travel patterns and uncontained by insufficient warning
mechanisms, would present an acute threat. Short-term economic impacts would include severe
impairment of travel, tourism and other service industries, as well as manufacturing and retail supply
chains. Global trade, investor risk appetites and consumption demand could suffer for more extended
periods. Deep shifts in social, economic and political relations are possible. A flu pandemic further presents
complex mitigation challenges, including difficult trade-offs (for example, mass vaccination now may
protect against the spread of a pandemic now, but mass vaccination also carries a heightened risk of
mutation of the virus into more resistant strains later), and posits an obvious need for multistakeholder
coordination of both prevention and response. The longer it takes for a pandemic to emerge – as long as
we maintain awareness of the risk – the better prepared we are likely to be.

Global Risks 2006

Terrorism
Terrorist attacks involving aircraft and high explosives have already had a massive global impact politically,
socially and on several business sectors including financial services – especially insurance – and the airline
and travel and tourism industries. Beyond more “conventional” attacks, experts fear the detonation of a
radiological bomb (a “dirty bomb”), a small nuclear device, or the use of chemical or biological agents by
terrorist groups in a major city, reinforcing an era of asymmetrical warfare, where small and relatively
uncoordinated groups can strike at the heart of otherwise well-defended states and societies. The
phenomenon of terrorism will not be eradicated soon and locally-based terrorism, including that variant
which claims credibility from religion, is likely to continue along current trends. The world will suffer from a
number of small-scale terrorist attacks in 2006. The major threat from terrorism stems from the risk of one
or more major attacks on fragile nodes in the international system with large conflation effects. Over the
longer term, there is a moderate risk of such an event – with very high human, political and economic
consequences.

Climate Change
As the December 2005 UN Montreal climate
change conference demonstrated, many, but not
all of the human-induced risk factors are now
identified, carefully tracked and modelled. Climate
change has moved, over the course of the last
century, from the realm of the unknowable (U) to
the unknown (u) (See KuU box on next page).
There is still uncertainty as to how the risks will
manifest: rises in sea levels, gradual temperature
shifts and intensifying weather patterns have the
potential to impact heavily on both society and the
global economy, and are increasingly well
understood as risks to business. The effects will
become more evident on a longer time horizon
(chiefly beyond 10 years) so the severity of the risk
is not fully captured in either the 2006 or 2015
horizons, but the accumulative nature of
greenhouse gases and the feedback delays in the
climate demand a response to the putative causes

Several conceptual frameworks can be applied when
considering global risks – a discussion of these can
be found in the broader Global Risks document at

today. The risks presented by climate change are
fundamentally intertwined with other key risks,
from storms and ecosystem degradation to
regulation and long-term energy prices.

www.weforum.org. A practical framework, relevant
for mitigation, considers the “knowability” of the risk
and its effects.

5

Global Risks 2006

Knowability and risk – the KuU framework
This simple typology, developed by Professor Diebold and others at The Wharton School, suggests a
continuum of risk from known (K) through unknown (u) to unknowable (U) risks.
Some risks, particularly natural disasters, can be said to be “known”. Their causes, probability of
occurrence and likely impacts are understood and well defined, although there is still some uncertainty
surrounding these estimates. Known risks can be measured and managed.
Other risks are “unknown”. The risk events are well-defined, but it is not possible to assign probabilities of
specific events occurring. Terrorism and systemic financial risk are good examples of this. Another way of
looking at “unknown” risks is to think of them as risks where there are several competing plausible models
of how reality might unfold, but no accepted paradigm. Unknown risks require governments or businesses
to build resilience into their risk models – through continuity-planning, stockpiling, slack in the system or
diversification of sources of vital goods.
The last class of risks are those which are “unknowable”. Unknowable risks have not yet emerged, and our
understanding the systemic linkages of unknowable risks is speculative. Unknowability is a key
consideration in the context of risk conflation, where a large number of possible combinations of risks and
vulnerabilities can lead to a vast array of possible outcomes, some of which are “perfect storms”.

3. Impacts can be greater than the sum
of their parts
Most major risk events occur initially in one part of
the global system: an earthquake in Iran or Pakistan,
a Class 4 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, a war in
Iraq, or terrorist incidents in Manhattan and
Washington DC. Most can be categorized within one
of the five risk areas defined in the Global Risk
Programme: economic, environmental, geopolitical,
societal and technological. However, some do not fit
easily into any of these categories. The degradation
of critical infrastructures is a geographically
widespread risk, with potential economic, societal
and political impacts. The pace of technological
advance, the availability of finance and social and
political priorities at local government level are key
issues in determining the rate at which infrastructure
is degraded and the speed at which it is repaired or
replaced. Terrorist attacks on power, water, transport
or communication networks could have widespread
impact on business activities, particularly if focused
on weak links in the system, causing major ripple
effects. There are often multiple factors at work in
the way in which a risk plays out.

6

When certain risk events occur, their impacts are not
constrained by geographical or systemic boundaries.
The level of interconnectivity in the world system
increasingly lends itself to risk contagion across
both, spreading the effects of a risk well beyond
those initially expected. While interconnectivity helps
to drive global prosperity, it can bring with it
increased vulnerability to risk. It facilitates the flow of
goods and information, and the distribution of aid
delivered in response to humanitarian crises. But the
efficiency of these systems often depends on a
limited number of vulnerable links, and
understanding what these are is vital.
In today’s world, more than ever before, risks travel.
To take a simple example, the volume of shipped
goods through the Malacca Straits has increased
hugely over the last 10 years as globalization has led
to an increase in trade and reconfigured
manufacturing supply chains. A successful terrorist
attack blocking the Malacca Straits would not only
cause substantial disruption of oil supplies to East
Asia, but could also result in severe dislocation of the
supply chains of manufacturers around the world

Global Risks 2006

whose plants depend on the raw materials and
semi-finished goods transiting the Straits every day.
The primary challenge arising from this insight is risk
conflation: ripple effects and the possibility of
contemporaneous risk events interacting with one
another to amplify their individual effects, thereby
generating dangerous unforeseen consequences,
exposing pre-existent weaknesses in systems and
degrading our ability to respond effectively. The less
resilient a system, the more likely it is that an
inadequate response to a risk event will amplify the
initial impacts.
Taken together, these factors make possible socalled “perfect storms”, causing damage far
exceeding that which would have been caused by
the sum of each individual event.
Meanwhile, a lack of information or misinformation
leading to a breakdown in public trust in the ability of
governments, international institutions or business to
manage risk can lead to the spread of fear in ways
that greatly amplify the consequences of a particular
threat. Fear is a potent risk amplifier. So-called
“infodemics” may have impacts as grave as risk
events themselves.

Hurricane Katrina
Hurricane Katrina provides an excellent example of
the way in which conflation of multiple risk factors
can produce varied and sometimes unanticipated
outcomes. The damage that might be wrought on
the Gulf Coast by a category 5 hurricane had been
identified a decade earlier as the most severe
potential risk faced by the US. Taking the tropical
storm as the core risk in this series of events, we
can see how it conflated with longer-term
environmental risks to produce damage unseen in
the United States since the Great Depression.
Tropical cyclones are influenced by natural climate
variability such as hurricane cycles. High sea surface
temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico may have further
intensified Katrina (and a number of other tropical
storms) to category 4-5 levels. In the future, humaninduced climate change may intensify tropical
cyclones. Degradation of marshlands and silt
deposits along the coast worsened the flooding.
Meanwhile, tight markets for oil and gas, driven by

Victims of Hurricane Katrina given shelter in the Houston Astrodome,
9th September 2005

Asian demand, boosted by US indebtedness and a
low-valued dollar, as well as instability in other oilproducing countries, caused price spikes
disproportionate to the supply constraints actually
inflicted when Katrina slammed into the oil and gas
terminals and refineries on the Gulf Coast.

Impact of Katrina
The effects of Hurricane Katrina have been
economic, societal and (potentially) geopolitical
as well as environmental. These impacts have
been concentrated in the US, but are also borne
by other parts of the world.
Impacts beyond the environmental system
• Economic: US$ 200 billion in local economic
damage, and increased short-term
vulnerability to other risk events.
• Societal: Loss of faith in crisis management
ability of government.
• Geopolitical: Potential increase of US
dependence on non-US refining capacity,
decline in positive US image, and loss of faith
in federal government in other policy areas.
Example of impacts beyond the US
• Higher global oil price.
• Re-focusing of US expenditures on domestic
reconstruction projects.
• The portion of insurance costs borne by nonUS insurers.

7

Global Risks 2006

The socio-political outcomes were even less well
anticipated. To that point, US fiscal imbalances and
the diversion of resources to address the war on
terrorism both domestically and in Iraq had not been
identified as short-term risks that had degraded
Federal, state and local disaster response capability;
it took Katrina to expose this. The response
infrastructure was further weakened by the impact of
the storm, in turn opening up the frightening
possibility that another risk event (e.g. an outbreak of
avian flu or a major terrorist incident) could deliver a
devastating blow. Finally, the image of the US was
harmed around the world by the apparent ineptness
of the government response, with implications not
yet fully understood.

Katrina on the oil and gas industry, please see

Pandemics
Over the past year, the risk of an H5N1 or other
avian flu pandemic has generated increasing
anxiety in much of the world. If the avian flu H5N1
virus mutates to enable human-to-human
transmission, it may disrupt our global society and
economy in an unprecedented way and claim
human life at levels close to the 1918-1919
Spanish Flu pandemic. The 1918 flu infected half
the world and between 40 and 50 million people
died. The other two flu pandemics of the last
century – in 1957 and 1968 – were less severe.
The World Health Organization has disclosed
estimates of potential deaths in a full-fledged avian
flu pandemic of between 2 and 7.4 million, up to
a worst-case of between 20 and 40 million deaths.
But this is dependent on the mutation of the
virus allowing it to be spread rapidly from human
to human.

Global Risks 2006

A conflation scenario for H5N1
New pandemics such as SARS (before its emergence) and human variants of avian flu lie on the
continuum between unknown (u) and unknowable (U) risks. Unlike human flu or animal foot and mouth
disease – where it is known that outbreaks will reoccur and past experience provides a reasonably
accurate guide as to their impact – new viral diseases evolve and cause death and secondary economic
damage in unpredictable ways. Global interconnectivity has vastly increased the opportunities for the
emergence and rapid transmission of disease and the myriad linkages in the global economy enable
systemic economic, social and political contagion as well.
The following is a brief sketch of the possible conflationary impacts of a major human outbreak.
Several cities in East Asia suffer major outbreaks of human-to-human transmission. International travel
is severely affected, pandemic-specific vaccine supplies are secured and security authorities prepare for
external contingencies and domestic insurgency. Emergency supply chain management is instituted,
based on the possibility that 50% of those infected die. Commodities and services needed to survive
for one to three years are identified. Non-critical industries reduce output or close. Even with full-scale
vaccine production in nine countries with 12% of the global population, fewer than 500 million people
(14% of the world’s population) can be vaccinated in a year.
An outbreak of H5N1 human-to-human transmission could have devastating impacts globally across all
social and economic sectors, disrupting efficient processes, severely degrading response capabilities
and exacerbating the effects of known weaknesses in different systems. These impacts might include:
the disruption of supply chains and trade flows; an exacerbation of financial imbalances and the
transformation of intellectual property regimes for pharmaceutical products; rioting to gain access to
scarce supplies of antivirals and vaccines; a collapse of public order; partial de-urbanization as people
flee population centres; the extinction of trust in governments; decimation of specific human skill sets;
and forced, large-scale migration, associated with the further collapse of already weak states.
In such a scenario, the impact on society might be as profound as that which followed the Black Death
in Europe in 1348. That plague caused a fundamental transformation of socio-economic relations in
Europe. The deaths of an estimated one third of the European population of the time created a
shortage of labour, undermining an economy based on serfdom, and effecting a shift in the relative
values of capital and labour. Scarcity of labour resources brought about a wage-based economy in
which the value of skills was efficiently priced.

4. Global responses to global risks
Different risk events can have radically different
impacts on industries and on geographical areas. At
the time of writing (January 2006) the US stockmarket average had recovered fully from Hurricane
Katrina, though this hid a wide disparity in outcomes
in different industries.

However, the mitigation of global risks is inherently a
collective endeavour, in which different parts of the
private sector, governments, intergovernmental
organizations and parts of civil society have different
and complementary roles to play.
Mitigation covers a range of actions, from prevention
– where possible – and preparation for risk events,

9

Global Risks 2006

to response and recovery from them if they occur.
The current international architecture of global risk
mitigation is built around insurance, financial
instruments, business continuity planning, private
sector enterprise risk management and government
action. All are necessary; none is sufficient.
• The financial services industry provides a wide
range of instruments to mitigate the economic
consequences of global risks. Insurance and
financial instruments can put a price on risk,
providing information, stimulating incentives for
action and enabling decisions on prevention
measures, the development of new technologies
or on business location.
Recent events have demonstrated the critical role
of the financial industry in mitigating the economic
consequences of risk events, from the collapse of
LTCM to the fallout from the 11 September
terrorist attacks. Insurance capacities have been
expanded recently by securitizing peak insurance
risks, such as tropical storms and earthquakes.
Government actions, however, may reduce
insurance capacity when, for example, premium
rates are capped artificially low, or when juries
hand out unpredictable compensatory and
punitive awards. In some countries, the protection
of national financial institutions, or the lack of
internal financial systems, presents further barriers
to the extension of the insurance role.
• Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) – the ongoing
attempts by individual businesses to identify,
research and manage their risks – is about
moving risks down the “knowability” scale, from
unknowable risks to unknown risks, which require
strategic decision-making, and finally to known
risks which can be managed through insurance,
financial derivatives, diversification and internal
controls.
• Governments are often the insurers of last resort,
as we saw in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of
2002 (TRIA) passed by the US Congress after the
September 11 attacks, to protect consumers by
maintaining the “availability and affordability of
insurance for terrorism risk” and to allow private
markets time to adjust to the new risk
environment. Deeper discussion between public

10

and private sectors of the sort now underway will
enhance the effectiveness of their cooperation.
Local governments, while often in the front-line of
risk mitigation and risk response and recovery, are
often too frail to cope alone.
• International organizations, while vital for proper
public coordination of some risk mitigation
strategies, are often constrained by political
disputes, as well as inadequate resources.
Global risks require all the potential risk mitigating
groups – individuals, companies, the financial
services industry (notably the insurers), governments
and international organizations – to act
collaboratively. A long-standing problem in dealing
with risk has been matching up those who bear the
costs of mitigation with the potential beneficiaries.
With global risks, the number of those ultimately
affected is much greater than commonly perceived.
Divergent perceptions and different political agendas
have to be overcome in the interests of more
effective mitigation.
On a practical level, the private sector, with its
experience of risk identification, assessment and
Enterprise Risk Management, has much to offer to
governments in helping to integrate risk
management into government procedures and to
advance collaborative mitigation. Governments have
much to contribute as well, principally by providing
the framework and conditions to increase the
marketization of risk and extend the limits of
insurability.

5. Looking to a better future
The World Economic Forum and its partners in the
Global Risk Programme have identified three core
areas where risk mitigation may be improved through
collaboration between the private and public sectors.
As the Global Risk Programme unfolds in 2006 and
beyond, exploring the characteristics of current and
emerging risks to build common understanding,
improving the allocation of resources and incentives
to address them and building institutional and
societal capacity and resilience, offer a challenging
programme of work and a promising agenda of
action.

Global Risks 2006

1/ Information: deepening insight and building the risk community
The role of information in mitigating risk and in prompting swift recovery is crucial. There are essentially two
elements: deepening insight into the characteristics of the risks and improving the flow of information
between the different stakeholders. The first may deepen understanding, the second is crucial to improving
responsiveness.
Companies, individuals and governments often perceive risk events – and their interconnectedness – as
creating negative externalities. Improving insight should allow for greater internalization of risks and help to
improve the risk communities on which risk mitigation depends for its legitimacy and support. In particular,
companies and governments need to invest in deepening insight into “unknown” and “unknowable” risks –
to help shift them to the “known” and “unknown” categories respectively.
Better understanding of the vulnerable interconnections in the global system which can act as amplifiers of
risk events is critically important in addressing the problem of conflation. Companies, governments and
academic institutions need to improve identification of the points in complex causal chains where
intervention can either reduce the probability of a risk materializing or reduce its impact severity if it does.
Enhancing the flow of information between stakeholders is a key. There are several elements to this:
• Top-down surveillance of threats at the global level (such as satellite monitoring of the environment);
• Effective dissemination of information from the bottom-up (such that transparency allows for the quick
responses needed to contain, for example, SARS or avian flu);
• Early-warning mechanisms (for example, to provide early warning of future earthquake-induced tsunamis
in the Indian Ocean);
• Appropriate mechanisms to inform the public about risk (such as the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention – http://www.cdc.gov – of the US Department of Health and Human Services) to prevent
“infodemics” and create appropriate expectations of risk;
• Exchanges on global best practice (including through trade associations), and advice that can be shared
between governments and businesses on their risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
In general, innovative and flexible organizations are better able to manage the flow of knowledge effectively
in their environments and to produce better and simpler metrics for cost-benefit analyses. In some cases,
the private sector is ahead of the public sector in its mitigation of risks; harnessing private sector expertise
in risk mitigation is a key to improving the discussion on mitigating global risk.

Example: As an example of potential private sector input into improving insight into the global risk
landscape, in 2005 Swiss Re collaborated with the UN Development Program and the Harvard Medical
School to produce Climate Change Futures: Health, Ecological and Economic Dimensions, a report,
available at: www.swissre.com. The World Economic Forum, as the prime international multistakeholder
platform, was closely involved in preparing a briefing for the Gleneagles G-8 Summit’s on climate change
issues, providing a number of opportunities for the interaction of governments and business leaders.

Global Risks 2006

2/ Resources: reordering priorities, improving allocation and providing private sector incentives
Resources are scarce – in business as in government. Insight into global risks can help reallocate
resources to those areas where risk mitigation is likely to be most effective. But managing resources,
providing economic incentives and releasing resources for risk management will often depend upon
cooperation between the private and public sectors.
The private sector can play a much stronger role in risk mitigation if the framework is set correctly. Where
governments offer to cap insurance losses (as with the US Terrorism Risk Insurance Act), the ability of
insurers to take on a part of global risk is increased. Where certain types of insurance are made
compulsory, risk costs can be spread effectively throughout society and free-riding can be prevented.
Where elements of risk can be marketized – such as carbon trading in conjunction with government limits
on carbon emissions – the private sector can offer flexible responses to risk issues. In many developing
countries, financial services companies and the private sector are relatively weak – improving their ability to
take on risk will broaden risk mitigation capacity. The development of microfinance solutions may offer
another promising way to mitigate the financial consequences of major risk events more efficiently.
Many businesses are already taking a lead in providing the resources for risk mitigation to reduce future
risk. These range from Google’s commitment to developing a duplicate internet backbone and Toyota’s
investment in the Prius, to responses by a number of pharmaceutical companies to HIV/AIDS, and joint
governmental, business, NGO and community efforts to offer disaster relief and recovery aid, following the
December 2004 tsunami and the 2005 Pakistan earthquake.
New financial instruments such as the securitization of insurance risks or extreme weather derivatives for
extreme events (such as unusually cold winters or hot summers) may point to another expanding class of
risk mitigation measures where the private sector can take on a considerably stronger role.
Governments may seek to avoid the “moral hazard” associated with the impression that they will always
provide a back-stop in disaster situations, thereby discouraging sensible risk mitigation strategies through
a combination of regulatory and insurance-based measures.

Example: The World Economic Forum’s private-public partnership and associated Initiatives – including
the Global Risk Network, the Global Health Initiative and the Disaster Response Network – see Forum
members and partners investing time and resources into developing improved understanding and
delivering tangible mitigation measures.

12

Global Risks 2006

3/ Institutions: building business and societal resilience
Key public elements of the international governmental architecture of risk mitigation already exist (the UN
institutions, the World Bank, international financial services corporations and others). These elements need
to be reinforced and built on, with a greater involvement of the international business community in helping
to understand and mitigate global risk.
At the national and local level, governments may be able to learn from business ERM models in improving
the management of risk portfolios and integrating private sector risk management techniques into national
administration. In many emerging markets, the key requirement is to build good governance structures
which will reduce financial volatility, improve the consistency of risk expectations and build confidence in
the ability of the state to respond to risk events – and also help economic development. In many
developed countries, the interplay between building business resilience and state resilience may require a
more permanent dialogue between business and governments in order to understand perceptions of risk
and to help build best practice from both sectors.

Improving information flows and understanding
about global risks and increasing the global capacity
for pre-emption, management and mitigation depend
upon an effective multistakeholder approach, which
the World Economic Forum is uniquely placed to
facilitate and will pursue in 2006 through the Global
Risk Programme.

A Global Risk Network will be established to take
this forward. The collaborative recasting of the
institutional global risk mitigation landscape will only
take place within an approach that recognizes the
systemic nature of many global risks and the need
for a holistic response to the challenge of mitigation.

2. Assessment

Likelihood Key

The Global Risk Programme adopted a futureoriented, scenario-based approach in two time
horizons: the short-term to the end of 2006, and
the long-term to 2015. Two brief scenarios were
developed for each risk in each horizon. The basecase describes the likely evolution of the risk along
its current trend lines, while the worst-case
represents the most pernicious plausible outcome.

The risk defined by each scenario was assessed in
terms of the likelihood of the scenario occurring
and the severity of the impact if it does. In
addressing likelihood, actuarial principles were
applied where sufficient data existed, though in
many cases only qualitative assessments based on
expert opinion were possible.
In assessing severity, three indices were considered:
asset damage, human impact and impact on
aggregate global GDP growth. The highest of the
potential impacts was used in each case.
