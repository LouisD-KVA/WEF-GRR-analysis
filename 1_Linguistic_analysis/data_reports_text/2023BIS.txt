BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

A tale of three journeys

Introduction
The global economy has reached a critical and perilous juncture. Policymakers are
facing a unique constellation of challenges. Each of them, taken in isolation, is not
new; but their combination on a global scale is. On the one hand, central banks have
been tightening to bring inflation back under control: prices are rising far too fast.
On the other hand, financial vulnerabilities are widespread: debt levels – private and
public – are historically high; asset prices, especially those of real estate, are elevated;
and risk-taking in financial markets was rife during the phase in which interest rates
stayed historically low for unusually long. Indeed, financial stress has already
emerged. Each of the two challenges, by itself, would be difficult to tackle; their
combination is daunting.
This year’s Annual Economic Report explores the global economy’s journey and the
policy challenges involved. It is, in fact, an exploration of not one but three interwoven
journeys: the journey that has taken the global economy to the current juncture; the
journey that may lie ahead; and, in the background, the journey that the financial
system could make as digitalisation opens up new vistas. Much is at stake. Policymakers
will need to work in concert, drawing the right lessons from the past to chart a new
path for the future. Along the way, the perennial but elusive search for consistency
between fiscal and monetary policy will again take centre stage. Prudential policy will
continue to play an essential supporting role. And structural policies will be critical.
What follows considers, in turn, each of the three journeys.

The macroeconomic journey: looking back
How did the global economy fare in the year under review? Even more importantly,
what forces shaped its journey?

The year under review
High inflation, surprising resilience in economic activity and the first signs of serious
stress in the financial system – this is, in a nutshell, what the year under review had in
store.
Inflation continued to hover well above central bank targets across much of the
world. Fortunately, there were clear indications that headline inflation was peaking
or had started to decline. But core inflation proved more stubborn. The reversal of
commodity prices and a marked slowdown in manufacturing prices provided
welcome relief even as stickier services prices gathered steam. Several forces were
playing out, including easing global supply chain bottlenecks, the post-pandemic
rotation of global demand back from manufacturing to services, and the effects of
repeated generous fiscal support packages. Labour markets remained very tight,
with unemployment rates generally at historical lows.
Global growth did slow, but proved remarkably resilient. The widely feared
recession in Europe did not materialise, thanks partly to a mild winter, and China
rebounded strongly once Covid restrictions were suddenly lifted. Consumption held

up surprisingly well globally, as households continued to draw on savings
accumulated during the pandemic and employment remained buoyant. As the year
progressed, professional forecasters revised their growth projections upwards,
although they still saw slower global growth in the year ahead.
Even as growth held up, signs of serious strains emerged in the financial system.
Some milder ones appeared among non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs). In
October, following the announcement of fiscal measures that undermined policy
credibility, the UK government bond market saw a sharp increase in yields and a
sudden evaporation of liquidity: leveraged investment vehicles through which pension
funds were matching the duration of their liabilities were forced to sell to meet margin
calls. Other signs of strain, perhaps more serious and surprising, appeared in the
banking sector. A number of regional banks in the United States failed as a result of a
combination of losses accumulated on long-maturity, mostly government, securities
and lightning runs. And in an environment of fragile confidence, Credit Suisse – a
global systemically important bank – went under, as it abruptly lost market access
following long-standing concerns about its business model and risk management.
Once again, the strains prompted large-scale official intervention on both sides
of the Atlantic to prevent contagion – worryingly, an increasingly familiar picture.
Central banks activated or extended liquidity facilities or asset purchases. Where
necessary, governments supplied solvency backing, implicitly or explicitly, in the form
of guarantees and ultimate support for enlarged deposit insurance schemes. The
response restored market calm.
In the meantime, the highly synchronous and forceful monetary policy tightening
continued. Central banks across the globe hiked policy rates further. What’s more,
those that had engaged in large-scale asset purchases began to unwind them: albeit
gradually, quantitative easing turned into quantitative tightening. At the same time,
policy rates often remained below inflation rates, ie negative in real terms.
In response to the tightening and the economic outlook, financial conditions
reacted unevenly. In general, banks tightened credit standards. But financial markets
were less responsive. To be sure, on balance, conditions there did tighten compared
with those prevailing at the time of the first hike. But in the second half of the year,
they loosened somewhat, as bond yields declined and risky asset prices rose. Central
banks contended with a disconnect between their communication, which pointed to
a more persistent tightening, and financial market participants’ views, which saw an
easier stance ahead.

The longer-term backdrop
The rather unique combination of high inflation and widespread financial
vulnerabilities is not simply a bolt from the blue. To be sure, the pandemic and, to a
lesser extent, the war in Ukraine have played an important role in the recent inflation
flare-up. But the root causes of the current problems run much deeper. After all, debt
and financial fragilities do not appear overnight; they grow slowly over time.
As explored in detail in Chapter II, the combination of high inflation and financial
vulnerabilities is probably best seen as reflecting the confluence of two
interdependent factors. First, the changing shape of the business cycle. Second,
monetary and fiscal policies testing, once again, the boundaries of what might be
termed the “region of stability” – the region that maps the constellations of the two
policies that foster sustainable macroeconomic and financial stability, keeping the
inevitable tensions between the policies manageable. The changing shape of the
business cycle determines what kind of symptom signals that the boundaries are
being tested – inflation, financial instability or both. The conduct of policy, interacting
with structural forces, determines the shape of the business cycle itself.

x

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

The mid-1980s represented a watershed in the evolution of the business cycle,
at least in advanced economies. Until then, recessions tended to follow a tightening
of monetary policy designed to bring inflation under control, while financial stress
was absent or largely contained. Thereafter, all the way to the sui generis Covid crisis,
recessions were ushered in by financial booms that turned into busts, sometimes
triggering widespread financial instability, while inflation remained generally low and
stable. Emerging market economies, in turn, were buffeted by the global waves
unleashed in advanced economies, most notably in the form of capital flows.
Accordingly, regional and country differences aside, exchange rate tensions typically
played a bigger role there than in advanced economies.
Two fundamental structural changes contributed to the shift from inflationinduced to financial cycle-induced recessions. Broad-ranging financial liberalisation,
both domestically and internationally, provided scope for much larger financial
expansions and contractions, no longer suppressed by the tight web of regulations
that had greatly constrained the financial system. And the globalisation of the real
economy helped central banks hardwire low inflation, by eroding the pricing power
of labour and firms. In the process, inflation stopped acting as a reliable barometer
of the sustainability of economic expansions: the build-up of financial imbalances
took over that role.
Hence an acute policy dilemma. A painful lesson policymakers had drawn from
the high-inflation era was that policies which turned out to be overambitious could
generate price instability. In the low-inflation era, however, the constraints on
economic expansions had seemingly disappeared. The boundaries of the region of
stability had become fuzzier, hardly visible in fact. And the fragility of the financial
system, not buttressed by a sufficiently incisive effort to strengthen prudential
regulation, clouded the picture further. The economy appeared stable until, suddenly,
it no longer was. The post-Great Financial Crisis (GFC) experience blurred the
boundaries of the region even further. Inflation hovered stubbornly below inflation
targets: having helped central banks’ efforts, globalisation was now hindering them.
And fiscal policy was asked to step up to the plate to ensure that central banks would
no longer be the “only game in town”, which it did.
By the time the Covid crisis struck, monetary and fiscal policy were testing the
boundaries of the region of stability once again. Interest rates had never been so low
and in some cases were now negative even in nominal terms. Central bank balance
sheets had never been so large except during wars. Government debt in relation to
GDP, joining private sector debt, was flirting with previous historical peaks reached
around World War II. And yet, because of the exceptionally low interest rates, the
debt burden had never felt so light. Low rates as far as the eye could see encouraged
further debt expansion, public and private. The forceful and concerted monetary and
fiscal response to the Covid crisis took policies one step further towards the boundary.
The remarkable post-pandemic surge in global demand against the backdrop of
the supply disruptions did the rest. Against all expectations, inflation had come back
with a vengeance. Monetary policy had to tighten, straining public finances and
private sector balance sheets. The financial system came under stress. While
understandable as the Covid crisis broke out, with the benefit of hindsight, it is now
clear that the fiscal and monetary policy support was too large, too broad-based
and too long-lasting.

The macroeconomic journey: looking ahead
Given where we are, what does the journey ahead look like? In the near term, it is
indeed possible that the global economy will smoothly overcome the obstacles it is

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

xi

facing. This seems to be what financial market participants and professional
forecasters are anticipating. Moreover, peering further into the future, the journey
could continue without major incidents. That said, both near- and long-term hazards
are lurking along the way. And policies will be the deciding factor.

Near- and longer-term hazards
In the near term, two challenges stand out: restoring price stability and managing
any financial risks that may materialise.
Inflation could well turn out to be more stubborn than currently anticipated.
True, it has been declining, and most forecasters see it moving within target ranges
over the next couple of years. Moreover, inflation expectations, albeit hard to
measure reliably, have not rung alarm bells. Even so, the last mile could prove harder
to travel. The surprising inflation surge has substantially eroded the purchasing
power of wages. It would be unreasonable to expect that wage earners would not
try to catch up, not least since labour markets remain very tight. In a number of
countries, wage demands have been rising, indexation clauses have been gaining
ground and signs of more forceful bargaining, including strikes, have emerged. If
wages do catch up, the key question will be whether firms absorb the higher costs or
pass them on. With firms having rediscovered pricing power, this second possibility
should not be underestimated. Our illustrative simulations indicate that, in this
scenario, inflation could remain uncomfortably high. As last year’s Annual Economic
Report documented, transitions from low- to high-inflation regimes tend to be
self‑reinforcing. And once an inflation psychology sets in, it is hard to dislodge.
At a macroeconomic level, historically high private indebtedness and elevated
asset valuations cloud the outlook. They can greatly heighten the sensitivity of private
expenditures to higher interest rates, although the lengthening of maturities during
the period of low inflation has muted, or at least delayed, the pass-through to debt
service burdens, and the savings cushions built during the pandemic have softened
the blow. Stylised simulations suggest that the impact could be substantial. In a
higher-for-longer scenario, with policy rates reaching a peak 200 basis points above
the market-implied one and staying there through 2027, debt service burdens would
rise substantially, asset prices would drop markedly and output in a representative
sample of economies could be some 2% lower at the end of a simulation horizon.
Moreover, one should not rule out outsize responses should debt service burdens
reach critical thresholds.
Higher interest rates, a turn in the financial cycle and an economic slowdown
would eventually raise credit losses. These, in turn, could generate further strains in
the financial system. It is quite common for banking stress to emerge following a
monetary policy tightening – in as many as a fifth of cases within three years after
the first hike. The incidence rises considerably when initial debt levels are high, real
estate prices are elevated or the increase in inflation is stronger. The current episode
ticks all the boxes. The stress we have seen so far has reflected exclusively interest
rate risk, revealing the fragility of strategies predicated on the view that interest rates
would remain low far into the future. The credit leg is still to come. The lag between
the two legs can be quite long.
Once the credit leg materialises, the resilience of the financial system will be
tested again. Simple simulations indicate that, in the market-implied interest rate
scenario, in a representative sample of advanced economies credit losses would be
in line with historical averages. But they would be of a similar order of magnitude as
during the GFC in the higher-for-longer scenario.
The impact of those losses will depend, critically, on the loss-absorbing capacity
of the banking system. Since the GFC, thanks in no small measure to the financial

xii

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

reforms, banks have bolstered their capital. That said, pockets of vulnerability remain.
Recent events have shown how the failure of even comparatively small institutions
can shake confidence in the overall system. Moreover, the price-to-book ratios of
many banks, including large ones, have been languishing far below one. This reflects
market scepticism about the underlying valuations and long-term profitability of
those institutions. Admittedly, this is not new. But, in an environment of more fragile
confidence, it could turn out to be a significant vulnerability.
Before stress emerged among banks, all the attention was focused on the NBFI
sector. And with reason. The sector has grown in leaps and bounds since the GFC,
and now accounts for over half of all financial assets globally. While, on balance, less
leveraged than its banking counterpart, the sector is rife with hidden leverage and
liquidity mismatches, especially in the asset management industry. It has been a
source of large losses for banks, such as in the Archegos case – which, incidentally,
hit Credit Suisse especially hard. And it was at the heart of the March 2020 turmoil,
which prompted large-scale central bank interventions. The latest tremors in the UK
gilt market are a reminder that attention is still justified.
While it is hard to tell where strains might emerge next, several vulnerabilities
stand out. In the corporate sector, private credit markets remain very opaque against
the backdrop of a long-term deterioration in credit ratings. In the leveraged loan
market, securitised products have grown rapidly. Exposures to commercial real estate
are bound to see losses, as the sector is buffeted by powerful cyclical and structural
headwinds – losses that could also be a source of stress for banks, as they have been
throughout history. In addition, structural weaknesses linger in some government
bond markets.
Looking further out, a key source of concern is the sustainability of public
debt – an issue analysed in depth in Chapter II. A vulnerable sovereign means a
vulnerable financial system. This is because the sovereign can generate financial
instability or fail to act as an effective backstop of the financial sector. Central banks
can provide liquidity, but only the sovereign can back up solvency. Moreover, the
sovereign’s creditworthiness depends on the health of the financial sector. Indeed,
banking crises have typically caused surges in public debt, in teens of GDP – directly,
because of the government support, and indirectly, because of the damage to
economic activity. Long-term projections of public debt trajectories are worrisome,
even under favourable interest rate and growth configurations (see below).

Near- and longer-term policy challenges
The sheer size of the challenges ahead calls for a holistic policy response, involving
monetary, fiscal, prudential and, last but not least, structural policies. Consider, in
turn, the near-term and longer-term challenges, although the dividing line between
the two is quite fuzzy.

The near term
The priority for monetary policy is to bring inflation back to target. The insidious
damage that a high-inflation regime does to the economic and social fabric is well
known. The longer inflation is allowed to persist, the greater the likelihood that it
becomes entrenched and the bigger the costs of quenching it.
In bringing inflation back to target, central banks face at least three challenges.
First, historical statistical relationships provide limited guidance when a transition to
a high-inflation regime threatens. Both judgment and more formal models are tested
hard. Second, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is clouded by the
exceptional post-pandemic conditions, which add to the well known lags. Hence the

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

pause many central banks have taken to better assess the impact of the tightening
so far. Finally, further financial system stress could well emerge. In that case, if the
stress is acute enough, addressing it without compromising the fight against inflation
will require the active support of other policies, not least prudential and fiscal, to
complement central banks’ deployment of the range of tools at their disposal. This
would contain the damage while allowing monetary policy to keep a restrictive stance
for as long as necessary.
The priority for fiscal policy is to consolidate. To be sure, deficits have narrowed
somewhat, especially in cyclically adjusted terms. But some of the improvement
reflects the temporary impact of the inflation burst, and cyclical adjustments have
proved quite misleading in the past, especially before slowdowns. Moreover, from a
long-term perspective, deficits remain too high. Consolidation would provide critical
support in the inflation fight. It would also reduce the need for monetary policy to
keep interest rates higher for longer, thereby reducing the risk of financial instability.
By bolstering the financial system’s resilience, prudential policy can also support
the inflation fight, as it would increase monetary policy headroom. Macroprudential
measures need to be kept tight for as long as possible, or even tightened further
where appropriate. Similarly, (microprudential) supervision needs to be stiffened to
remedy some of the deficiencies that came to light in recent bank failures. While
changes in regulatory standards take longer, a reflection on the recent experience
should start without delay; and indeed it has. Examples of issues to be examined are
the treatment of interest rate risk, the appropriateness of historical cost accounting,
not least for assets used for liquidity management purposes (eg government
securities) and assumptions about the stickiness of various deposit categories. But
beyond banking, we should not lose sight of the urgent need to strengthen the
regulation of NBFIs from a systemic perspective.

The longer term
In the longer term, the challenge is to put in place policies and frameworks that
foster a stable financial and macroeconomic environment while strengthening the
potential for robust and sustainable growth. As argued in detail in Chapter II, a key
element of this multi-pronged strategy is to ensure that monetary and fiscal policies
operate firmly within the region of stability. This means not being a source of
instability and keeping sufficient safety margins or buffers to deal with the inevitable
future recessions as well as with unexpected damaging shocks.
For monetary policy, two aspects stand out. As regards operational frameworks,
it is essential to combine price stability objectives with the appropriate degree of
flexibility. As explored in depth in last year’s Annual Economic Report, low-inflation
regimes, in contrast to high-inflation ones, have self-stabilising properties. No doubt
this reflects, in part, the fact that, when inflation is mild, it ceases to be a significant
factor influencing people’s behaviour. This suggests that, under those conditions,
there is room for greater tolerance for moderate, even if persistent, shortfalls of
inflation from narrowly defined targets. The approach would also reduce the side
effects of keeping interest rates very low for extended periods, such as the build-up
of financial vulnerabilities and possible misallocation of resources. As regards
institutional frameworks, to buttress the credibility of policy, safeguards for central
bank independence, underpinned by appropriate mandates, remain essential. They
should become especially valuable in the future, should fiscal positions continue to
follow their deteriorating trend.
For fiscal policy, the priority is to ensure fiscal sustainability. Fiscal sustainability is
the cornerstone of economic stability and is critical for monetary policy to do its job.
Unfortunately, the long-term outlook is grim. Even under favourable assumptions,

xiv

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

without sustained and firm consolidation efforts, debt-to-GDP ratios are set to rise
relentlessly, threatening safety margins. The looming additional burdens linked to
ageing populations, the green transition and geopolitical tensions complicate the
picture further. And so does the apparent change in public attitudes following the
generous support granted in the wake of the GFC and Covid crises, which has raised
expectations regarding government transfers. From an operational perspective, the
prominence of financial factors in economic fluctuations merits greater attention
when assessing cyclical fiscal positions and fiscal space more generally. From an
institutional perspective, there is a need to give more bite to properly designed fiscal
rules and fiscal councils, including possibly through constitutional safeguards.
For prudential policy, there is a need for continuous adjustments. The dialectic
between financial markets and regulation makes it impossible to stand still. The
recent episodes of stress have provided just the latest example. As regards the
financial stability risks raised more specifically by fiscal policy, an area that merits
particular attention is the favourable treatment of sovereign debt. Adjustments to
account effectively for market and credit risk in government securities would also
need to give due consideration to the special role that government debt plays in the
functioning of the financial system and in central bank operations. Institutionally, just
as for monetary policy, it is important to secure the independence of supervisory
authorities and to endow them with sufficient resources, both financial and human.
In addition, there is a need to further reflect on crisis management and the
financial system’s safety net more generally. Policy actions have, de facto, been
extending the safety net with each crisis. And now there are proposals to reduce the
scope for runs by extending deposit guarantee schemes further. Once confidence is
lost, however, deterring runs and preventing institutions from losing market access
would require nothing short of insuring 100% of demandable and short-term claims.
This would weaken market discipline far too much and, ultimately, increase solvency
risks to unacceptable levels. Moreover, while resolution schemes have been improved
and should be improved further, when confidence crumbles, the pressure to extend
support becomes insurmountable.
This suggests that expectations should be realistic and that a premium should
be put on crisis prevention. It indicates that, refinements aside, there is no substitute
for a holistic macroeconomic policy framework that promotes financial and
macroeconomic stability, bolstered by a regulatory and supervisory apparatus that
boosts the financial system’s loss-absorption capacity. As described in previous
Annual Economic Reports, such a comprehensive macro-financial stability framework,
in which all policies play their part, is the way to go. Crises cannot be avoided
altogether, but their likelihood and destructive force can be contained.
Accordingly, the ambition needed to build such a framework should be combined
with realism about what it can deliver and humility in the way it is run. The challenges
the global economy is now facing reflect, in no small measure, a certain “growth illusion”,
born out of an unrealistic view of what macroeconomic stabilisation policies can achieve.
We should avoid falling into the same trap again. Its unintended result has been reliance
on a de facto debt-fuelled growth model that has made the economic system more
fragile and unable to generate robust and sustainable growth. Overcoming this reliance
requires growth-oriented structural reforms (Chapters I and II). Unfortunately, such
reforms have been flagging for too long. They should be revived with urgency.

Digitalisation and the financial system: the journey ahead
This takes us to the third and final journey. An important aspect of growth-oriented
structural reform is digital innovation in the monetary and financial system.

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

xv

Historically, key innovations in monetary arrangements have enabled new types of
economic activity that have led to major advances in the economy. For example,
money as ledger entries overseen by trusted intermediaries paved the way for new
financial instruments such as bills of exchange that boosted trade by bridging the
geographical distance and the timing gap between incurring costs and receiving
payment. The gains became even bigger once electronic record-keeping replaced
paper ledgers.
Central banks have a duty to lead advances in the monetary system in their role
as guardians. The central bank issues the economy’s unit of account and ensures the
finality of payments through settlement on its balance sheet. Building on the trust in
central bank money, the private sector uses its creativity and ingenuity to serve
customers. When viewed through this lens, the fight against inflation is just another
aspect of the central bank’s broader duty to defend the value of money. In the same
vein, the central bank’s role in innovation serves to defend the value of money by
providing it in a form that keeps pace with technology and the needs of society.
Chapter III charts the course for the future of the monetary and financial system.
It argues that the system could be on the cusp of a major technological leap.
Following the dematerialisation of money from coins to book entries and the digital
representation of those ledger entries, the next key development could be
tokenisation – the digital representation of money and assets on a programmable
platform. Unlike conventional ledgers, which rely on account managers to update
records, tokens can incorporate the rules and logic governing transfers. Money and
asset claims become executable objects that the user can transfer directly.
Tokenisation could enhance the capabilities of the monetary and financial system,
not just by improving current processes but also by enabling entirely new economic
arrangements that are impossible in today’s system. In short, tokenisation could
improve the old, and enable the new.
Tokenisation overcomes a key limitation of today’s arrangements. Currently, the
digital representation of money and other claims resides in siloed proprietary
databases, located at the edges of communication networks. These databases must
be connected through third-party messaging systems that exchange messages back
and forth. As a result, transactions need to be reconciled separately before eventually
being settled with finality. Meanwhile, participants have an incomplete picture of
actions and circumstances. This incomplete information, and the associated
misaligned incentives, preclude some transactions that have a clear economic
rationale. While workarounds, such as collateral or escrow, exist, they do have
limitations and create their own inefficiencies. Tokenisation addresses the problems
more fundamentally. Resolving FX settlement risk and unlocking supply chain finance
are two examples discussed in the chapter. Both are thorny problems in the
conventional financial system that are amenable to solution in a tokenised
environment.
New demands are also emerging from end users themselves, as advances in
digital services in everyday life raise their expectations. Users now demand that the
monetary and financial system operate just as seamlessly as the apps on their
smartphones. These demands are beginning to outgrow the siloed domains that are
holding innovation back.
Chapter III presents a blueprint for a future monetary system. The blueprint
envisages a new type of financial market infrastructure (FMI) – a “unified ledger”. The
key elements of the blueprint are central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), private
tokenised money in the form of tokenised deposits and tokenised versions of other
financial or real assets, depending on the particular use case. The success of this
endeavour rests on the foundation of trust provided by central bank money and its
capacity to knit together key elements of the financial system. To be sure, in crypto,

xvi

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

stablecoins that reside on the same platform as other crypto assets also perform a
means of payment role. However, for reasons explored at length in last year’s Annual
Economic Report, crypto is a flawed system, with only a tenuous connection to the
real world. Central bank money is a much firmer foundation. The full potential of
tokenisation is best harnessed by having central bank money reside in the same
venue as other tokenised claims.
As a new type of FMI, a unified ledger will come with attendant setup costs. While
some of the envisaged benefits could also be reaped through more incremental
changes to existing systems, history shows that such fixes have their limits, especially
as they accumulate on top of legacy systems. Each new layer is constrained by the
need to ensure compatibility with the legacy components. These constraints become
more binding as more layers are added, holding back innovative developments.
In the near term, a unified ledger could unlock arrangements that have clear
economic rationale but which have not been feasible to date due to the limitations
of the current system. Over the longer term, the eventual transformation of the
financial system will be far more significant. The benefits will be limited only by the
imagination and ingenuity of developers, much as the ecosystem of smartphone
apps has defied the initial imagination of the platform-builders themselves.

Conclusion
The journey ahead for the global economy and its financial system is hazardous.
However, it also offers great opportunities. Steering in the right direction will be far
from easy. It calls for a rare mix of judgment, ambition, realism and the political will
and capacity to implement the necessary policies. Those policies tend to involve
short-term costs as the price to pay for bigger long-term benefits. Fortunately, the
journey ahead is not predetermined.

I. Navigating the disinflation journey

Key takeaways
•

Inflation peaked in most jurisdictions, but remains well above target. The global economy slowed,
although it proved more resilient than many had expected. Clear signs of stress appeared in the
financial system.

•

There are two key risks to the outlook. First, the next phase of disinflation may become more difficult.
Second, macro-financial vulnerabilities loom large amid historically high debt levels at the end of the
low-for-long interest rate era.

Returning inflation to target remains a priority. Fiscal policy should play a key supporting role for
monetary policy. In addition, prudential policy should strengthen the financial system further.
Weaning growth away from excessive reliance on macro-stabilisation policies is crucial to achieving
price and financial stability as a basis for robust, sustainable growth.

The global economy withstood strong headwinds better than expected over the past
year. Inflation edged down, as disruptions in global supply chains and in commodity
markets waned. Growth slowed, although it proved resilient.
At the same time, signs of strain started to emerge. In particular, financial stress
rattled the financial system, engulfing both banks and non-bank financial
intermediaries (NBFIs) and prompting a forceful policy response to limit contagion.
The strains share a common cause: the system is under stress following the era of
low-for-long interest rates. Several strategies adopted to take advantage of that era
are now proving ill-suited to the new environment. The strains are also a reminder of
the tight monetary-fiscal-financial nexus, as the increase in government bond yields
played a key role here.
Even stronger headwinds may lie ahead. Despite the most synchronised and
intense monetary policy tightening in recent memory, inflation remains far too high.
And there is a material risk of further financial stress.
The next phase of disinflation is likely to be more difficult. Mechanically, base
effects are fading away. Substantively, inflation is increasingly driven by the more
inertial components, particularly services. The longer inflation lasts, the more likely it
is that households and firms will adjust their behaviour and reinforce it.
There are widespread macro-financial vulnerabilities in the system. Private and
public debt levels are historically high. Asset prices, notably those of real estate, have
started softening on the back of rich valuations. Interest rates may need to stay
higher and for longer than financial markets are pricing in. The strains that have
emerged so far reflect interest rate risk, but credit losses are still to come. This will
further test the resilience of the financial system.
Four major policy challenges stand out. First, monetary policy needs to travel
the last mile, bringing inflation back to target. Second, fiscal policy needs to support
short-term stabilisation and ensure sustainability. Third, prudential and supervisory
policies need to safeguard financial stability, thereby supporting the macroeconomic
adjustment. Last but not least, policymakers need to wean growth away from
excessive reliance on macro-stabilisation policies and bring monetary and fiscal

policies firmly back into a “region of stability” (Chapter II takes a closer look at this
challenge).
This chapter first describes the key economic and financial developments over
the past year. It then discusses the main macroeconomic and financial risks. Finally, it
elaborates on the policy challenges.

The year in retrospect
Inflation moderates, but too early to declare victory
After making a remarkable comeback, inflation continued to be a major policy
concern in the year under review (Graph 1). Its persistence was systematically
underestimated by public and private sector institutions alike. To be sure, headline
inflation came down from the peaks reached in 2022, falling quite notably in most
cases. But core inflation proved stickier, either stabilising or continuing to rise. Almost
everywhere, inflation remained well above inflation targets. And, importantly, its
drivers shifted as the year progressed, with the more inertial components gaining
ground.
Lower headline inflation reflected, to some extent, both one-off factors and what,
in principle, are temporary measures. Strong base effects kicked in, dragging down
year-on-year readings. Commodity prices retreated from the highs induced by the war
in Ukraine (Graph 2.A). As a result, contributions to inflation from energy and food
shrank (yellow bars in Graph 1). In addition, the direct impact of some fiscal measures
designed to curb increases in these prices mechanically helped to keep inflation down
in the near term.1 The size of the support reached 3% of GDP in some cases. That said,
this impact could be reversed should the measures be phased out as planned and, in
the case of cap-based measures, if the price of the subsidised commodities were to

rise again. And, in the meantime, the support prevented aggregate demand from
falling, thereby contributing to tight product and labour markets.
A longer-lasting amelioration came from easing global supply chain pressures,
which largely normalised, allowing backlogs to be cleared (Graph 2.B). This affected
primarily the prices of goods, which are much more heavily traded than services.
These prices tended to rise more slowly and, in some cases, actually fell (blue bars in
Graph 1). The pressure on goods prices was also eased by the ongoing reversion of
the pandemic-related shift in consumption patterns away from services to goods
(Graph 2.C).
That same rotation, however, boosted services price growth, which continued to
rise (red bars in Graph 1). In the United States, the services component once again
became the main factor behind inflation. Its contribution also slowly rose in other
advanced economies (AEs) and in Latin America.
This shift in drivers of inflation towards services is likely to increase its persistence.
The rate of change in services prices has historically been much less volatile than
that for goods (dotted lines in Graph 3.A). Part of the explanation is that the share of
labour in total costs in services is about twice as large as in manufacturing
(Graph 3.B). This tightens the link between prices and wages. Not only are wage
increases in general more inertial than other cost components, but they also tend to
be more domestically driven in services, as the sector is less exposed to international
competition. Indeed, the fraction of the variance of price changes explained by a
global common factor has generally been lower for services, although it has risen
recently owing to the widespread nature of the inflation surge (Graph 3.C).

Synchronised monetary tightening ends low-for-long
The inflation surge has led to the most synchronised and intense monetary policy
tightening in decades.2 Almost 95% of central banks hiked their policy rates between
early 2021 and mid-2023 (Graph 4.A). Historically, this share has rarely exceeded

(Graph 4.B and 4.C). At the same time, major AE central banks started to gradually
shrink their balance sheets, with Japan as the exception. Quantitative easing turned
into quantitative tightening.
The transmission of monetary tightening to lending rates was mostly swift and
began to weigh on aggregate demand. Borrowing costs rose for corporates and
households alike (Graph 5.A). Bank lending standards tightened and bank credit
contracted, especially in AEs (Graph 5.B). Consequently, spending weakened. The
deceleration was led by the most interest rate-sensitive components of expenditure,
such as consumer durables, and the housing market cooled in many economies
(Graph 5.C).

The economy slows, but manages to avoid recession so far
Overall, global growth slowed from 6.3% in 2021 to 3.4% in 2022, weakening further
in the first quarter of 2023 (Graph 6.A). The slowdown was most pronounced in AEs,
from 5.7 to 2.8%. EMEs fared better, still growing at 4% in 2022 as a whole compared
with 7.3% in the previous year. This was despite China recording a growth rate of
only 3%, reflecting setbacks from large Covid-19 outbreaks and the drag from the
real estate sector.
Still, activity held up better than expected in a number of key jurisdictions, and
the much feared global recession did not materialise. Relative to the forecasts made
early in the review year, growth outcomes in 2022 surprised on the upside in the
United States, the euro area and most EMEs, with China an exception to the pattern.
As high-frequency indicators remained robust in many jurisdictions, growth forecasts
for 2023 were revised upwards as the new year started, although the consensus still
saw a considerable slowdown for the year as a whole, to 2.6%.
The relative strength of economic activity and the upgrade of expectations for
2023 reflected three main factors.

First, consumption remained robust. Excess savings accumulated during the
pandemic, not least thanks to higher saving rates and fiscal support (red and yellow
bars, respectively, in Graphs 6.B and 6.C). Once Covid-related restrictions were lifted,
households drastically cut their saving rates, to pre-Covid levels in most AEs and to
even lower ones in the United States. Further, buoyant labour markets bolstered
income (purple bars in Graphs 6.B and 6.C). Unemployment rates fell to multidecade
lows, especially in AEs (Graph 7.A). Job creation was strong in both AEs and EMEs
while job vacancy rates remained high, around record levels in the United States and
Europe.
Second, the energy crisis proved far less consequential than expected. A
relatively mild winter and the rapid build-up of gas storage helped prevent the
deep and widely forecast recession in Europe (Graph 7.B).5 And, in many jurisdictions,
fiscal support insulated households and firms from the impact of higher energy
prices.
Third, the rapid reopening of the Chinese economy in January, after the country
abandoned its zero-Covid strategy in December 2022, boosted domestic activity
(Graph 7.C). This also lifted activity abroad, although to a lesser extent than in the
past, given the services-driven nature of the rebound (Box A).

Financial system shaken by bank failures
Financial markets and the financial system more generally started to adapt to the
abrupt end of low-for-long interest rates but the process was far from smooth. A
broad disconnect emerged between financial market pricing and central banks’
announced policy path. And rising signs of stress appeared in the financial system.

Spillovers from China’s reopening

China abandoned its dynamic zero-Covid policy in late 2022, starting to relax pandemic restrictions in
November and reopening its borders in early January 2023. The timing and pace of reopening surprised the
market, whose consensus as of early November 2022 was for a gradual reopening from March 2023.
After the reopening, the Chinese economy rebounded strongly, driven mainly by services. The Q1 2023
GDP advanced 4.5% year on year (Graph A1.A), topping the market consensus. Growth forecasts for 2023 were
revised up from 4.5% in November 2022 to 5.8% in May 2023. The services sector (eg catering and tourism)
benefited most from improved mobility, and the non-manufacturing PMI in March 2023 reached its highest
level in more than a decade. The manufacturing sector started to recover from June 2022, after supply chain
pressures eased, but faces headwinds in 2023, as external demand flags. Recovery in the construction sector is
also likely to be modest, given weak sentiment in the real estate market.
Growth spillovers to the rest of the world from a services-driven recovery should be limited, because
services are less tradable and more oriented towards domestic demand. This contrasts with construction and
manufacturing, which require imports of raw materials and intermediate goods from other countries. Growth
in construction and manufacturing in China had significant positive effects on other emerging market
economy (EME) exports between 2004 and 2019 (Graph A1.B).1 For example, a 1% quarterly growth in
construction activity increased exports to China from Asian manufacturing exporters by 0.7%, and those from
Latin American metal exporters by 0.5% on average for the first four quarters, while a 1% growth in
manufacturing output increased Asian exports to China by 0.6%. In contrast, services had no significantConfidential
impact.2
The spillover to global inflation could be small as well. One important channel through which China’s
growth can affect global inflation is commodity prices. In particular, a pickup in manufacturing and
construction activity in China would increase demand for commodities (metals in particular for construction),

boosting their prices. Indeed, in 2004–19, a 1% increase in manufacturing production raised broad commodity
prices by 2.2% after two quarters, while a 1% increase in construction activity raised metal prices by 0.9%.
Again, services had no impact.
Consistent with a smaller spillover from China’s recovery this time around, financial assets in EMEs showed
weaker co-movement with those in China in 2023 than in previous years. For example, the currencies of Asian
and Latin American EMEs used to show strong co-movements with the Chinese yuan (Graph A1.C, red and
blue dots). However, the co-movement weakened in 2022 when China diverged from some other parts of the
world in terms of pandemic policy, the growth path and the monetary policy stance (yellow dots). The
correlation remained at low levels for Latin America until May 2023, consistent with the expectation of limited
spillover (purple dots). The co-movements of equity market returns and those of portfolio capital flows also
diminished.3
The eight Asian manufacturing exporters are India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand. The four Latin American metal exporters are Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru.    2 Consistent with the dependence
of spillovers on growth drivers, China’s spillover to the rest of world has varied over time. In particular, a 1% increase in
China’s GDP was associated with 0.4% GDP growth in the rest of world in 2004–08 (when China actively participated in
global trade after its entry into WTO in 2001), with 0.6% growth in 2009–14 (when China introduced large-scale investment
projects after the 2007–09 Great Financial Crisis), and with 0.1% growth in 2015–19 (when China reduced reliance on
investment for growth but focused more on consumption).    3 The correlation between China’s equity market returns and
those in Asian and Latin American EMEs was relatively high at 0.34 in 2016–19 and 0.36 in 2020–21 but fell to 0.17 in 2022
and Q1 2023. In contrast, the correlation of bond market returns stayed around zero throughout these periods. Similarly,
after controlling for economic fundamentals, a one standard deviation increase in daily portfolio capital flows to China was
associated with an increase in portfolio capital flows to six Asian EMEs and one Latin American country by 0.11 and 0.13
standard deviations in 2016–19 and in 2020–21, respectively, but its impact declined to 0.09 standard deviations in 2022
and Q1 2023.

of inflation staying high and the economy entering a recession, participants
continuously re-evaluated how central bank actions would evolve. Expectations of
future rates remained lower than central banks’ projections, with investors
anticipating rate cuts already in 2023 (Graph 8.A). After considerable tightening in
2022, by some measures, financial conditions tightened marginally during the period
under review (Graph 8.B). They remained tighter than historical averages.
Foreign exchange movements largely followed those of financial conditions,
taking their cue from the relative strength of the economies and the corresponding
monetary policy outlooks. The US dollar generally appreciated through the third
quarter of 2022, before weakening moderately against most currencies. By and large,
the depreciation against the dollar was larger for the currencies of countries where
the policy rate increased less than in the United States. The Japanese yen and the
euro touched multidecade lows. Countries where monetary tightening had started
earlier and interest rates had reached higher levels, such as Mexico and Brazil,
actually saw appreciations (Graph 8.C). In general, EMEs absorbed the sharp
tightening of global monetary conditions in an orderly way.
The disconnect between financial market expectations and central bank
communications was also evident from the dynamics of risky assets. Equity markets
finished the review period marginally higher (Graph 9.A), despite weak earnings
forecasts, especially in the United States (Graph 9.B). Measures of implied equity
volatility hovered below historical averages for most of 2023. In credit markets,
spreads marginally tightened, remaining in line with historical norms in the United
States and somewhat above in Europe (Graph 9.C).
Against this backdrop, increasing signs of stress emerged in the financial system
in late 2022 and early 2023, in large part due to higher interest rates.
First, leveraged strategies to hedge against drops in interest rates came under
pressure. As the UK “mini-budget” announcement in September 2022 sent gilt rates
soaring, such strategies generated losses for the so-called liability-driven investment
(LDI) funds in which UK pension funds had invested. To meet the ensuing collateral

calls, LDI funds needed cash infusions, which pension funds failed to provide
promptly enough. As their solvency positions worsened, LDI funds had to deleverage
by selling gilts, putting further upward pressure on yields and setting off a full-fledged
spiral. The Bank of England intervened forcefully and swiftly through temporary
asset purchases to calm the market.
The sharp increase in interest rates also put the spotlight on banks. To the extent
that they could reprice their assets, banks benefited from the impact of rising
interest rates on net interest margins (Box B). However, during the low-for-long era,
many had accumulated fixed rate mortgages and long-term government bonds
(Graph 10.A), which declined steeply in market value when interest rates rose. Banks
are generally required to assess and manage their exposure to changes in interest
rates, including under scenarios of upward shifts in the yield curve (Graph 10.B). In
addition to hedging with derivatives, banks often base their interest rate risk
management on deposit stickiness. This feature has traditionally allowed banks to
keep their funding costs in check by passing only a fraction of policy rate rises to
deposit rates. As the share of short-term – and thus potentially flighty – deposits has
risen (Graph 10.C),6 an increase in their interest rate sensitivity undermined the risk
management strategies of some banks.
Mismanagement of interest rate risk, among other factors, drove the first major
bank failures since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). Already by late 2022, many US
banks had sizeable market value losses on their debt securities holdings (Graph 11.A).
More than half of the losses were not reflected on balance sheets, on the accounting
assumption that banks would hold the attendant assets to maturity.7 However, as a
loss of confidence in some of the smaller and thus more lightly regulated banks
triggered a deposit flight, these banks had to liquidate some of their “held‑to‑maturity”
assets and recognise immediate capital losses (Graph 11.B). These intertwined
interest rate and run risks materialised forcefully for Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a
regional bank that collapsed in early March (Box C).

Rising policy rates and the outlook for banks’ net interest margins

While monetary tightening has exposed banks’ interest rate risk, the end of the low-for-long era is also
expected to ease pressures on their income. In assessing banks’ performance, valuation losses on fixed rate
assets will need to be set against higher interest income on variable rate assets and new lending. Drawing on
evidence from past tightening episodes, this box assesses the effect of the recent rises in policy rates on net
interest margins (NIMs), ie the difference between the yield on banks’ interest-earning assets and the cost of
funding their debt.1
During the current cycle, there was a general increase in NIMs (Graph B1.A). Since the start of the current
cycle, NIMs have increased by more than 10 basis points in EMEs and nearly 5 basis points in AEs for every
100 basis point increase in the respective policy rate.
The recent rise in NIMs was driven more by the muted response in banks’ cost of debt than by the return
on interest-bearing assets. In EMEs where the current cycle is more advanced, yields on interest-earning assets
increased in line with past cycles, whereas the adjustment in debt funding costs is still lagging behind. The
pickup in yields in AEs, by comparison, has yet to fully unfold if compared with the endpoint in previous cycles
(Graph B1.B). This is consistent with banks’ shift to long-duration assets during the low-for-long era, which
reduced the responsiveness of interest income to changes in policy rates. The increase in banks’ cost of debt,
by contrast, has remained far behind historical endpoints (Graph B1.C). This probably stemmed from theConfidential
higher proportion of non-interest-bearing deposits in many AE banking sectors.
The outlook for NIMs depends on how yields and costs will adjust to the policy path. Historically, NIMs
often returned to their initial level, or even fell slightly in AEs, over the course of a rising rate cycle (Graph B1.A).
At the current juncture, banks are expected to benefit from additional increases in yields when low-yielding
fixed rate loans and mortgages expire, and borrowers refinance at higher rates. However, the availability of
higher-yielding investments could also put upward pressure on bank funding costs. Relative to past episodes,
this effect could unfold more rapidly due to the larger share of overnight deposits that can be withdrawn
quickly. The threat of such withdrawals would require banks to pass on the increase in policy rates more swiftly
to creditors in order to secure funding.

Recent bank failures

Market tremors in March 2023 highlighted how risk management deficiencies at individual banks can
undermine the confidence of depositors and other investors, leading to a funding crisis that can reverberate
through the financial system. This box reviews recent bank failures and attendant market responses.
Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which was the 16th largest US bank as measured by total domestic assets at
end‑2022, went into receivership on 10 March 2023. SVB had accumulated significant, albeit unrealised, valuation
losses on its unhedged securities portfolio due to rising rates over the course of 2022. In early March, confronted
with persistent deposit outflows, the bank had to sell securities and recognise a large loss and the attendant
impact on its capital position. Unable to raise new equity to rebuild this position, the bank collapsed within just
a few days on the back of a concerted, unprecedentedly fast run by its mostly uninsured corporate depositors.
Following the failure, concerns spread immediately about similar vulnerabilities at other banks, leading to
significant falls in the valuations of small and mid-sized banks amid large deposit outflows (Graph C1.A). After
suffering a run by uninsured depositors, Signature Bank was closed two days after SVB’s failure. First Republic,
also struggling with a combination of losses on long-duration assets and large deposit outflows, initially
managed to secure alternative funding, including from major US banks. However, the bank ultimately failed
given the persistence and scale of deposit outflows and, after entering receivership, was sold to JPMorgan Chase.
Concerns also spilled over to banks outside the United States. In particular, Credit Suisse entered the eye
of the storm. This bank’s profitability and reputation had already suffered due to risk management deficiencies
and significant performance setbacks in recent years. Market scepticism about the bank worsened through
2022 amid large deposit withdrawals, rising credit spreads and outflows of assets under management. The
switch to a risk-off environment in March 2023 was the tipping point, with the bank’s CDS spreads jumping to
levels indicating imminent default (Graph C1.B). To alleviate systemic risk concerns, Swiss authorities facilitated
and enforced a takeover by UBS.
The Credit Suisse takeover shook the market for Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital – instruments that can be
written down or converted to equity when a bank becomes unviable. As the takeover entailed the writedownConfidential
of Credit Suisse’s entire AT1 capital, this led to broader uncertainty about when and how these instruments
would absorb losses at failing banks. The immediate upshot was significant price declines in the AT1 market,
notably for instruments issued by European banks (Graph C1.C). New issuance on this market has been
subdued, even if prices have since partially recovered after European authorities provided additional clarity on
the hierarchy of AT1 investors relative to equity holders in the event of bank failure.

The realisation of interest rate risk reverberated through the US banking sector
in the first half of 2023. Small and mid-sized banks suffered significant deposit
outflows, forcing the closure of first Signature Bank and then First Republic Bank. At
the same time, US global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) saw significant
inflows from depositors searching for safe havens.
Investors’ concerns spread to banking sectors in several other AEs. Banks that had
already faced persistent market scepticism, as indicated by a low price-to-book ratio
(PBR), were hit particularly hard. Credit Suisse – a G-SIB which had been struggling
with large fund outflows and a series of setbacks (see Box C) – failed to rebuild market
trust and – after writing down its contingent convertible bonds to absorb losses – was
taken over by a competitor. Relative to global equity markets, other AE banks with low
PBRs also registered deeply negative stock returns (Graph 11.C). This stood in contrast
to the more modest decline for high-PBR banks in AEs and banks in EMEs.
Again, authorities responded forcefully to contain contagion and deployed a
number of crisis management tools to curb systemic risks. In the United States,
authorities invoked the so-called systemic risk exception – previously used in the
GFC – to stem more widespread runs by guaranteeing the uninsured deposits of
SVB and Signature Bank. In addition, the Federal Reserve established the Bank Term
Funding Program (BTFP), offering loans to banks that pledged qualifying government
securities, valued at par and thus above market value. The BTFP complemented
lending through the Federal Reserve’s discount window, which soared in the
immediate aftermath of SVB’s failure but has come down since then (Graph 11.A). In
Switzerland, the public sector backed the emergency takeover of Credit Suisse, with
the central bank pledging significant liquidity support and the government
extending guarantees to shield the central bank from potential losses. Furthermore,
to facilitate the takeover, the government guaranteed to cover part of future losses
in relation to the disposal of the failed bank’s legacy assets.

Key risks on a turbulent path
Against this broad macroeconomic and financial backdrop, what is the outlook for
the global economy?
Consensus forecasts are rather benign. While forecasters do see lower growth
and inflation still above target, the slowdown is rather mild and the fall in inflation
substantial. Banking woes are expected to be contained.
Two risks loom large, however – quite apart from those of a more political
nature, such as an intensification of geopolitical tensions. First, disinflation could well
turn out to be harder than expected – the “last mile” challenge. Second, the end of
low-for-long could further test the global financial system, with the crystallisation of
macro-financial risks to threaten growth.
This combination of risks is rather unique by post-World War II standards. It is
the first time that, across much of the world, a surge in inflation has coexisted with
widespread financial vulnerabilities. The longer the inflation persists, the stronger and
longer the required policy tightening, and hence the bigger the financial stability risks.

The “last mile” may pose the biggest challenge
Getting back to target is likely to be harder than the first phase of the disinflation
journey. There are several reasons why. Beyond fading base effects and the increasing
role of inertial components of inflation, households and firms may adjust to persistently
higher inflation by trying to recoup previous losses and then seeking to avoid future
expected ones through their wage- and price-setting decisions.8 Moreover, as time

14

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

goes by and higher policy rates propagate through the system, the economy will
weaken and further financial stress may arise. This means less pressure on prices but,
at the same time, tougher trade-offs involving activity. In some cases, there may be
political pressure on central banks to keep interest rates low, requiring them to
reiterate the commitment to deliver price stability through both communication and
action. Such dynamics may be especially relevant among those EMEs where
institutional safeguards are weaker, inflation expectations are less anchored and
indexation is more prevalent.
Admittedly, in previous disinflation episodes, headline inflation typically returned
to the pre-peak levels (or even lower) in the space of one to two years (Graph 12.A).
Core inflation tended to follow a similar path.
However, a number of features set the current episode apart from previous ones
and indicate that disinflation may prove difficult. First, services prices have risen
much faster and their rate of change has not yet peaked (Chart 12.B). This could
mean a potentially longer disinflation journey. Second, rather than the median
episode, the current surge more closely resembles the 1970s – when a “first mile” of
disinflation was achieved in the space of about one year but inflation thereafter
declined only gradually: after two years, it was still generally above its pre-surge level
(Graph 12.C). In fact, the pace of disinflation so far has been even slower than in the
1970s – although the tightening has proceeded at a faster pace (Graph 12.D).
Crucially, then, what is the likelihood of a transition to a high-inflation regime,
such as the one in the 1970s?
Several indicators point to possible obstacles along the disinflation journey and
suggest that the low-inflation regime will continue to be tested. First, after a steep
rise, the share of items in the consumer price index whose prices increased at a fastConfidential
rate has not come down (Graph 13.A). Second, price spillovers across consumption
categories are slightly larger than they were in the recent past when inflation was
low (Graph 13.B). This means that increases in the price level due to price shocks in

one category will propagate to others, raising the likelihood that they will lead to
sustained inflation rather than die out. Third, price changes across categories are
becoming increasingly similar (Graph 13.C), implying that differences in consumption
patterns across consumers and input costs across firms matter relatively less, so that
the general price level becomes more relevant for individual decisions. This tends to
be a useful indicator of inflation persistence, ie when the similarity index is high, so is
the probability that inflation in the next period will be at least as high as in the
current one.9 These signals, taken together, suggest that households and firms are
responding more strongly to the higher inflation rates.
Looking ahead, two closely related factors could signal a shift in inflation norms
and tip the disinflation process off course: self-sustaining wage-price dynamics and a
de-anchoring of inflation expectations.
While nominal wage growth has not been exceptionally strong so far, this should
not provide too much comfort. Wage adjustments are still influenced by the lingering
effects of the norms prevalent in the low-inflation regime, but this could change
quickly. The inflation surge has severely eroded the purchasing power of households
(Graph 14.A), even more than in past disinflation episodes (Graph 14.B). Some catch‑up
is on the cards, particularly given the strength of labour markets. While labour’s
bargaining power declined significantly over the years of low inflation,10 recent
strikes and calls for unionisation suggest that the environment is evolving. In the
euro area, for instance, negotiated wage growth has been on the rise and is now at
its highest level since the inception of the common currency. And while multi-year
wage contracts generally make the adjustment lags for wages considerably longer
than for prices, contract length may shorten in response to higher and more
persistent inflation.11 What’s more, the pass-through from prices to wages has been
somewhat higher when labour markets have been tight.

In parallel, there are signs that price-setting behaviour is changing. Firms are
adjusting prices more frequently than when inflation was low and stable.12 In
addition, corporate profits, which were already on the rise before the inflation surge,
have held up remarkably well so far (Graph 14.C). This is a departure from the
historical pattern: in past episodes, profit growth tended to fluctuate within a
comparatively narrow range around zero. One concern is that, having been able to
raise prices more easily than in the low-inflation regime, firms are now more reluctant
to accept profit squeezes and will pass on cost pressures to prices more readily.13
In the end, a shift to a high-inflation regime would require self-sustaining
wage‑price increases – a “wage-price spiral” – as workers and firms try to recoup their
losses. The feedback between wages and prices has been quite low in the last two
decades, below 10%. However, moving to a high-inflation regime would strengthen it.14
A stylised exercise based on a decomposition of changes in the GDP deflator
during disinflations shows that some catch-up in wages would be compatible with
inflation returning to target, but only as long as firms accept a reduction in
profits.15, 16 Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, for inflation to go back to
a target of 2%, profits on average would need to decline by about 2.5% per year in
2023–24, should real wages rise fast enough to make up for the loss in purchasing
power and return to the pre-inflation surge level by end-2025. For comparison, the
cross-country pre-pandemic median for profit growth has been slightly more than
1.5% between 2014 and 2019.17
An alternative exercise based on the historical price-wage relationship reinforces
the message that the room for adjustment in real wages without jeopardising the
inflation target is limited. The exercise is guided by the cointegration between core
CPI and hourly compensation and considers the path inflation could take under two

17

different scenarios of purchasing power recovery (Graph 15.A).18 In the first scenario,
wages gradually recover, growing at an annual rate of 3.5%, which is consistent with
an inflation target of 2% and historical labour productivity growth rate of 1.5%
(“gradual catch-up”). Real wages would then largely make up for the losses incurred so
far by end-2025. In the second one, the pace of nominal wage growth is faster in
2023 and 2024 at 6%, and settles at 4% by 2025 (“fast catch‑up”). In that case, the
erosion in real wages is remedied by mid-2024. The gradual catch-up scenario seems
conducive to bringing inflation down to or below target (solid red line in Graph 15.A),
based on the historical relationship between wages and prices that prevailed in a
low‑inflation environment – here proxied by post-1995. By contrast, inflation would
remain well above target up to the end of 2025 in the fast catch-up scenario (solid blue
line in Graph 15.A). Further, if the relationship between wages and prices reverts to
the pattern that prevailed before 1995 – capturing a high‑inflation environment – the
implied inflation trajectory would remain above target also in the gradual catch-up
scenario (dashed red line in Graph 15.A). This is because wage-price spillovers were
stronger when inflation was higher.
A wage-price spiral would be even more likely should workers and firms seek not
just to recoup past losses, but also to be compensated for future ones, ie if expectations
became “de-anchored”. While a de-anchoring is not yet evident, inflation expectations
have edged up visibly in some cases and are generally above target. True, long-term
ones – over a five-year horizon – have remained stable. That said, they are higher than
before the inflation surge began. This is especially so for German and Japanese
households, who had seen inflation being persistently below target before the
pandemic (Graph 15.B). Further, short-term inflation expectations – at the one-year
horizon – rose much more than their long-term counterparts (Graph 15.C). The longer

Macro-financial vulnerabilities could complicate the inflation fight
Given the economic background, the risk of further financial stress is material.
Historically, about 15% of monetary policy tightening episodes are associated with
severe banking stress. The frequency of such stress is higher during tightening
episodes that start in an environment of high debt, an abrupt inflation surge or rapid
house price growth. If the private debt-to-GDP ratio is in the top quartile of the
historical distribution at the time of the first interest rate hike, 40% of the episodes
are followed by a banking crisis within three years (Graph 16.A). The odds of a
banking crisis are 25% for an inflation surge (Graph 16.B) and about 35% for rapid
house price growth (Graph 16.C). Very high debt levels, a remarkable global inflation
surge, and the strong pandemic-era increase in house prices19 check all these boxes.
Vulnerabilities in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector – historically a common
source of stress in the banking sector – raise concerns, too (Box D).
If inflation proves to be more persistent than expected and central banks have
to tighten monetary policy by more or for longer, financial stability risks will rise. A
key channel is the impact of asset prices and debt burdens on the macroeconomy.
Sharply higher mortgage financing costs, coupled with high household debt
(Graph 17.A) and falling house prices, translate into lower consumption (see Box D).
Evidence shows that, generally speaking, high debt amplifies the impact of monetary
tightening20 and that house prices are much more sensitive to a rate hike when debt
levels are high.21 Countries with higher household debt have already seen a sharper
rise in debt service ratios (DSRs) (Graph 17.B). Economies that rely on adjustable-rate
mortgages (ARMs) are especially vulnerable (Graph 17.C).

Commercial and residential real estate markets

This box first describes the trends in commercial real estate (CRE) markets, then discusses residential real estate
(RRE) developments and concludes with an analysis of risks.
CRE dynamics
Commercial property markets weakened in emerging market economies (EMEs) during the review period
(Graph D1.A). Following a brief period of robust gains, CRE prices in advanced economies (AEs) reached a
plateau and dipped slightly. EMEs generally saw the trend of weak CRE prices continue, with sharp price
declines in some cases (eg Singapore).
The weakness in commercial property markets reflects a combination of cyclical and structural factors.
Higher interest rates played an important role. In addition, office real estate saw sustained pressure as
pandemic-era work-from-home activity evolved into permanent remote and hybrid work practices (eg office
vacancy rates in the United States stood at almost 20% in the first quarter of 2023, about 6 percentage points
higher than in the last quarter of 2019). Retail real estate continued to face headwinds due to greater
e-commerce activity.
RRE dynamics
Residential property prices in many economies softened considerably as interest rates climbed. During 2022,
many AEs saw house price growth stall or even reverse direction. This weakness persisted into 2023 with only
a few exceptions. Markets that had seen particularly strong price increases during the pandemic experienced
some of the steepest drops (eg Australia and Canada). House prices also softened in many EMEs, althoughConfidential
usually by less than in AEs (Graph D1.A). The gentler softening among EMEs mirrored the generally slower
pace of price gains seen during the pandemic.
Valuations are still expensive by historical standards. Price-to-rent ratios have remained at very high levels
in most AEs and EMEs (Graph D1.B). This points to further potential price drops.

Risks
The combination of falling house prices, high debt and rapidly rising debt service ratios is likely to increase
the number of borrowers facing repayment difficulties for residential mortgages. While delinquency rates on
residential mortgages are still low, they are expected to rise in some jurisdictions. For example, in January
2023, the UK Financial Conduct Authority warned that about 9% of UK mortgages are at risk of defaulting in
2023–24.
The downturn in RRE markets has already weighed on activity and a further, disorderly fall in house prices
poses a major risk to economic growth. A fall in house prices could weigh on consumption growth due to
negative household wealth effects, a reduction of pledgeable collateral and reduced consumer confidence. By
some estimates, a 10% decline in house prices reduces (median) consumption growth in the following year by
about 1.8% (Graph D1.C). The effect is strongest in countries with high home ownership rates, such as the
United Kingdom and New Zealand, and is most pronounced where high home ownership is combined with a
heavy reliance on adjustable rate mortgages.
Although smaller than RRE markets, CRE markets also raise a prominent risk to financial stability. Spreads
on US commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) rose substantially throughout much of 2022, reflecting
a growing difficulty in refinancing maturing debt. In Sweden, where CRE firms rely heavily on bank funding
and floating rate loans, a number of large property groups suffered from rating downgrades and stock
sell‑offs. CRE delinquencies started to pick up in some markets and global distressed CRE debt was close to
$175 billion in early 2023, vastly more than in other sectors. CRE prices tend to be more sensitive to the
business cycle than RRE prices and to react more strongly to a downturn. Moreover, the performance of banks
has historically been sensitive to CRE price developments, raising the risk of a credit crunch. In addition to
direct exposures to CRE, particularly in regional banks, some banks have large indirect exposures through
other channels, eg via construction lending. Troubles with CRE lending can thus have an outsize impact on
overall bank lending. Non-bank financial institutions and foreign investors are also important and growing
providers of credit to the CRE sector. Their retrenchment could lead to sizeable asset fire sales, which could in
turn destabilise financial markets, as seen during the recent episode of regional bank failures.

market-implied peak plus 200 basis points until the end of 2027 (Graph 18.A).
Average AE private sector DSRs could increase by about 1.5 percentage points and
reach their pre-GFC peaks by 2027 if central bank policy rates evolve as financial
markets currently expect (Graph 18.B). In the “higher-for-longer” scenario, average
DSRs could increase by more than 4 percentage points. The decline in house prices
in this adverse scenario could be as large as 30%, relative to the 15% drop in the
market-implied path (Graph 18.C). The level of GDP in the adverse scenario could be
about 2% lower by end-2027 relative to what would be expected were policy rates
to follow the market path (comparing the blue to the yellow bar in Graph 18.D).

Bank vulnerabilities
Further illustrative simulations explore the possible implications for banks. Credit
losses on the back of rising debt service ratios could undermine the support that
banks receive from higher interest income. If macro-financial conditions follow the
“market path” scenario, banks’ expected credit losses in 2025–27 would be close to the
average level in AEs over the past three decades (Graph 19.A). In the “higher‑for‑longer”
scenario, those losses could approach the levels seen during the GFC, subject to a
large degree of uncertainty (Graph 19.B).
Losses in banks with large exposures to interest rate-sensitive sectors could be
heavier. A prime example is the CRE sector, which faces additional risks from the
post-pandemic reduction in demand due to hybrid work arrangements. Smaller and
more regionally focused banks in many AEs tend to have a greater concentration of
loans in this sector.
Low valuations and weak profitability go hand in hand, heightening banks’
vulnerability to losses. A number of GSIBs had persistently low PBRs throughout the

than be reinvested at a lower return. When adjustments are necessary at short notice,
however, banks may have to seek external capital. This can trigger adverse market
responses, especially when investor confidence is fragile.
Post-GFC, financial reforms have greatly bolstered the capitalisation of the
banking sector (Graph 19.C) and have encouraged more forward-looking loan loss
provisioning. Ultimately, the impact on the banking sector will depend on the extent
to which its loss-absorbing capacity helps preserve investor confidence.

Vulnerabilities among NBFIs
The long period of unusually low interest rates provided fertile ground for the build‑up
of widespread vulnerabilities in the NBFI sector. Moreover, post-GFC, this sector has
grown in leaps and bounds relative to the banking sector.22 In the process, risks there
have increased and some vulnerabilities have attained systemic importance. Not all
of these vulnerabilities have been properly identified because large parts of the NBFI
sector are quite opaque.
The NBFI sector can be a source or amplifier of systemic stress through several
mechanisms. First, among NBFIs, hidden leverage and liquidity mismatches are rife.
In addition, duration management by NBFIs – such as life insurance companies – could
have adverse spillovers when a sharp rise in interest rates shortens liability duration
and prompts sales of long-duration assets in a falling market. Stress could also stem
from the interlinkages between NBFIs and banks via funding or hedging activities.
Vulnerabilities in two specific market segments deserve mention.
First, liquidity mismatches at investment funds can exacerbate existing fragilities
in the real estate sector and corporate bond markets. An intensified downturn in real
estate markets could, in particular, trigger large withdrawals by investors in REITs. In
turn, this would require REITs to sell into inherently illiquid markets, setting in motion
a downward price spiral. Similar liquidity mismatches could also affect corporate
credit – a market segment that has seen a secular deterioration in credit quality, as

Structural challenges among global banks: hints from market valuations

The price-to-book ratio (PBR) reflects investor perceptions of a bank’s capacity to generate value. A number of
global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) have PBRs considerably below unity – ie the market value of their
equity has been persistently below the accounting, or book, value. Such low PBRs show that investors doubt
the viability of these banks’ business models. This box reviews the drivers and policy implications of low PBRs.1
Expectations of banks’ future profitability are a key driver of banks’ valuations. There is a tight relationship
between a bank’s forecast return-on-equity (RoE) and its PBR (Graph E1.A). Over the past decade, three groups
of G-SIBs have emerged: high-PBR banks that have convinced investors of their capacity to deliver strong
profits, resulting in a PBR above 1; mid-PBR banks with market valuations close to, but below their book value;
and low-PBR banks with persistent profitability challenges and hence low valuations.
Profitability differences notwithstanding, all banks need to generate sustainable returns for their
shareholders. High- and mid-PBR banks have been able to satisfy shareholders by disbursing only a fraction of
their profits in the form of dividends or share buybacks. By contrast, many low-PBR banks have had to pay out
their entire profits, not least because reinvesting in an underperforming balance sheet does not appeal to
shareholders. Indeed, this seems to have been necessary for low-PBR banks in order to put a floor under their
share prices, given the tendency of valuations to adjust such that they deliver comparable dividend yields
(Graph E1.B).
As low-valuation banks face challenging market conditions, they have become increasingly owned by
public entities. Raising capital externally is particularly dilutive for the incumbent shareholders of such banks.
This helps explain why equity investors most strongly punish these banks in the face of adverse results thatConfidential
may force these banks to tap markets for funds (Graph E1.C). In turn, such challenges are consistent with
domestic and foreign governments purchasing more than 40% of the new equity issued by low-PBR G-SIBs
from 2014 to 2022.
With profits distributed to meet shareholder expectations, low-valuation banks have had to reduce the
riskiness of their assets in order to meet stringent capital requirements. This has surfaced, for instance, as

retrenchment from trading or cross-border activities.2 In the near term, a retrenchment could temporarily
impair financial conditions in specific segments. But, over the medium term, it should enhance the efficiency
of financial intermediation by shifting the provision of financial services from less to more profitable business
models.
Public authorities could facilitate the transition of low-valuation banks to more sustainable business models.
For one, they could support banks in addressing legacy issues, removing impediments to cross-jurisdictional
mergers and acquisitions, and providing incentives to raise investment in restructuring efforts. Banks with
profitable business models play a vital role in underpinning market confidence and in providing reliable
funding for the real economy.
For a more comprehensive review, also covering how banks’ response to stricter capital regulation has depended on their
valuation, see Caparusso et al (2023).    2 See, for example, the analysis in Goel et al (2021) or in Caparusso et al (2019).

reflected in the trend decline in ratings. In this case, large redemptions from bond
mutual funds and ETFs could trigger fire sales.23
Second, even though private equity and private credit funds take on minimal
liquidity risk, their contribution to corporate indebtedness is a cause of concern.
Private market deals grew more than fivefold after the GFC and reached a
multidecade high of almost $500 billion globally at the end of 2021.24 The funds’
highly procyclical risk-taking contributed to the build-up of leverage during the
low‑for-long era,25 thus sowing the seeds for stress when interest rates rose.26 As
borrowing costs increase, the highly leveraged companies that private funds have
invested in could face difficulties in refinancing and repaying their debt, a large share
of which is estimated to mature in the next three years. A deterioration of these
borrowers’ ratings would amplify these difficulties. Debt restructuring for distressed
companies could buy time but, in the case of flawed business models, default would
be inevitable. Banks could then incur losses directly, since some of them reportedly
still warehouse significant amounts of the leveraged loans provided during the 2021
boom in private market deals.

Additional considerations in EMEs
While EMEs have so far been spared from significant spillovers from the financial
stress in AEs, this could change. EMEs’ resilience reflects a range of factors, such as
early monetary policy tightening (notably in Latin America), implementation of
structural reforms, less foreign currency borrowing and reduced foreign investor
participation in local currency bond markets. Nevertheless, beyond the home-grown
vulnerabilities in some EMEs, such as in real estate and corporate markets, financial
stress in AEs could at some point spill over through several channels. The exchange
rate continues to play a particularly important role in this context. Furthermore,
while the lengthening of debt duration reduces EME borrowers’ rollover risk, it also
increases investors’ market risk. It can thus be thought of as the duration equivalent
of “original sin redux”, ie the shift of exchange rate exposures from borrowers to
lenders.

Navigating from turbulence to safety
Policymakers are facing tough challenges in the near and longer term. In the near
term, the overriding challenge is to bring inflation back to target in the context of
heightened financial stability risks. This challenge contrasts with those faced from
the 1970s up to the mid-1980s, when inflation generally rose against the backdrop
of limited financial strains. Thereafter, financial stress broke out during generally

quiescent inflation (Chapter II). The combination makes calibration much harder and
requires all policies – monetary, fiscal and prudential – to play their part. With the
benefit of hindsight, the extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus deployed during
the pandemic, while justified at the time as an insurance policy, appears too large,
too broad and too long-lasting. It contributed to the inflation surge (Graph 20) and
to the current financial vulnerabilities. In the longer term, the challenge is to wean
growth away from excessive reliance on macroeconomic policies to set the basis for
a robust and sustainable expansion.

Monetary policy
While the central bank response to the inflation surge has been forceful and has
clearly started to bear fruit, the job is not yet done. To be sure, tighter financial
conditions have begun to weigh on expenditures, with economic activity slowing
down most in interest rate-sensitive sectors. Labour markets have started to cool.
And inflation expectations appear to have remained generally well behaved so far.
That said, inflation is receding only slowly and the repeated forecast errors counsel
caution in drawing firm inferences. Further, monetary policy is well known to operate
with long and variable lags, making it difficult to pin down how large the impact has
been so far. There is no room for complacency; perseverance is the name of the game.
Any assessment of the strength of policy transmission needs to consider the
influence of factors that pull in different directions. On the one hand, higher debt
levels, elevated asset prices and bursts of financial stress raise the sensitivity of the
economy to tighter monetary conditions. Moreover, for the first time central banks
are tightening not just through higher rates, but also by trimming their balance
sheets. On the other hand, inflation-adjusted interest rates remain low or even
negative and households and firms have been able to draw on the extraordinary
support provided during the pandemic and on borrowing at longer maturities than
in the past.
More fundamentally, the risk of shifting to a high-inflation regime greatly
complicates the calibration of policy. Historical relationships no longer constitute
reliable signposts.27 This makes the task of central banks much more difficult and can
put their credibility on the line.

On balance, the biggest risk is to declare victory too soon. From a risk
management perspective, policy rates may need to remain higher for longer to
ensure that inflation continues to decline and stays low. Transitions to high-inflation
regimes tend to be self-reinforcing and the trade-offs involved in restoring price
stability worsen once inflation becomes entrenched. What’s more, history highlights
the cost of stop-and-go actions, which can introduce unnecessary fluctuations in the
economy. The costs of a high-inflation regime are simply too high to take any
chances.
Support from other policies will be important for central banks to win the
inflation fight, especially against the backdrop of elevated financial stability risks.
Central banks can and should address financial stability risks without compromising
the price stability objective. In the longer term, the two objectives do not pose a
trade-off. But in the near term, the need to bring inflation back to target and the
need to stabilise the financial system could pull in different directions. There will be a
premium on differentiating central bank actions designed to achieve price stability
from those aimed at financial stability – a task complicated by the extensive use of
balance sheet policies to set the policy stance in several jurisdictions. If the stress is
minor, central banks could address the near-term trade-off on their own, as the gilts
market turmoil in the United Kingdom has shown.28 But if the stress is more acute,
central banks will need the support of fiscal, prudential and supervisory policies to
manage it effectively while retaining sufficient room for manoeuvre.29

Fiscal policy
The role of fiscal policy will be critical. To do its part, fiscal policy needs to consolidate.
Consolidation would help tackle both the near-term and the longer-term challenges.
In the near term, consolidation would calm inflation by reducing pressure on
productive capacity. And it would contain financial instability risks in several ways. It
would reduce the need for monetary policy to tighten further. It would mitigate the
risk that the sovereign itself becomes a source of financial instability, such as through
the sovereign-bank nexus (Chapter II). And it would create more headroom should
public resources be called upon for crisis management in concert with central banks.
In the longer term, consolidation would help rebuild the space necessary to put
public sector debt on a firmly sustainable path. This is all the more important given
the likelihood of greater demands on public spending, arising from ageing
populations, the impact of geopolitical tensions on defence spending, and the green
transition (Chapter II).
The recent policy record, however, highlights the risk of a drift in the fiscal
stance. The design of the measures deployed to shield households and firms from
the fallout of the war in Ukraine on energy and food prices leaves room for
improvement. In general, it has not followed the “3T principle”, often for practical
and political reasons. Support should be targeted to the most vulnerable groups so
that the overall size is in line with the fiscal constraints and the needs of society. It
should be tailored to ensure that it does not weaken incentives for needed
medium‑term adjustments. It should be temporary so as not to unduly add to
demand after the shocks have passed.30 Moreover, any support boosts aggregate
demand unless offset by higher taxes, regardless of how it is designed, thereby
complicating the fight against inflation through that channel.
The recent improvement in fiscal positions reflects, to a considerable extent,
only temporary factors. Even though fiscal expenditures exceeded original plans,
primary deficits in G7 countries declined from 5.7% of GDP in 2021 to 3.4% in 2022.
This largely reflected the inflation surge, which boosted both tax revenues and
nominal GDP (Graph 21.A). These benign effects tend to be short-lived: they are

one-off level adjustments. Further, it can prove politically difficult to withdraw
support measures and the perception of a stronger fiscal position can tempt the
authorities to spend rather than save the revenue windfalls.
The ephemeral positive impact of inflation on debt ratios should not be
exploited to avoid much-needed, credible consolidation plans. These plans should
also aim to rationalise expenditures, improve the quality of spending and create
space for supply side reforms (see Chapter II). Public-private partnerships should be
part of the formula where possible. Absent consolidation, deficits remain too large to
put public debt on a sustainable path. Debt levels in some major economies are at
historical peaks or near them (Graph 21.B), and rising interest rates have increased
the prospective debt service burden.
The challenge is daunting. To give a sense of the magnitudes involved, in 2019 a
primary deficit of 2.1% of GDP would have been sufficient to stabilise debt, on
average for G7 countries. In 2023, despite the one-off inflation-induced improvements
in fiscal positions, higher interest rates mean that the corresponding figure has fallen
to 1.6%. Among major EMEs, the debt-stabilising primary deficit has fallen from 1.1%
of GDP in 2019 to 0.1%.31 While further shrinking of fiscal deficits is envisaged for
most countries in 2023 and 2024 (Graph 21.C), these plans typically fall short of
stabilising public debt even if they were meticulously followed. What is more, these
figures assume that real long-term interest rates remain lower than real GDP growth
rates, which cannot be relied upon. To reduce debt from its historically high levels,
primary surpluses must clearly exceed the debt-stabilising ratios. Only this will restore
fiscal space.

Prudential policy
Prudential policy, too, has an important role to play, in both the near and the longer
term. By focusing on improving the resilience of the financial system, it can provide
critical support to monetary and fiscal policies. Actions should address both banks
and NBFIs.32 And they will need to be complemented by improvements in elements
of the safety net as well as recovery and resolution schemes.

In the near term, the focus should be on actions that can quickly strengthen the
loss-absorbing capacity of the financial system. This should be at both the macro‑ and
the microprudential levels.
A premature easing of macroprudential measures should be avoided.
Implemented before or during monetary policy tightening, such measures tend to
reduce the likelihood of subsequent financial stress.33 It would be imprudent to ease
them in anticipation of a slowdown in economic activity. In accordance with their
design, they need to be kept in place and, where appropriate, tightened further and
released only when clear risks of a disruptive credit crunch emerge.
At the microprudential level, a priority is tighter supervisory oversight. A culture
of supervisory scrutiny should go beyond regulatory metrics and enforce timely
remedial actions. Enforcement of stronger risk management practices, underpinned
by sound governance, will be key. Given the build-up of indebtedness during the
low‑for-long era and the subsequent exceptional monetary policy tightening, losses
could surpass forecasts based on historical data. This calls for conservatism in loan loss
provisioning and in stress tests of exposures to interest rate, credit and liquidity risks.
Other adjustments will take more time.
In the banking sector, beyond the consistent and timely implementation of the
post-GFC reforms, there is a need to learn from recent strains. In particular, lessons
related to interest rate risk call for a reassessment of accounting rules and regulatory
requirements. Historical cost accounting contributes to the accumulation of latent
vulnerabilities when applied to assets that also serve liquidity management purposes
(eg government securities). An overhaul of this practice would make reported capital
more accurately reflect banks’ loss-absorbing resources. Furthermore, assumptions
about the stickiness of various funding sources, most notably uninsured demand
deposits, should be reassessed to improve banks’ liquidity requirements.
Beyond banking, there is an urgent need to strengthen the regulation of NBFIs
from a systemic perspective. Deleveraging spirals and liquidity mismatches have
exposed vulnerabilities that, if left unaddressed, could lead to broader systemic
repercussions. A system-wide approach to strengthening NBFI resilience would need
to build on a balanced mix of activity-based and entity-based regulatory
requirements.34 Progress in this area has been disappointingly slow.
Turning to safety nets, an issue that has risen to prominence once again is the
design of deposit insurance schemes. These schemes seek to safeguard the savings
of retail depositors, who are unable to monitor financial intermediaries, and to
facilitate the restructuring of failed banks. Together with central banks’ lender of last
resort function, they also enhance the stability of banks’ funding, thereby supporting
their ability to provide liquidity and manage maturity transformation.
Concerns about the rising structural instability of uninsured deposits has
prompted calls for an expansion of the insurance coverage. Historically, it has proved
very difficult to strike the appropriate balance. Arguably, however, experience
indicates that, once confidence in an institution evaporates, deterring runs and
preventing the institution from losing market access would require nothing short of
insuring 100% of demandable and short-term claims, whether collateralised or not.
This would encompass all forms of wholesale funding, including liquidity needs
arising from margining practices. The upshot would be much weaker market
discipline and, ultimately, a rise in solvency risks to unacceptable levels.
Hence, there is a premium on mechanisms to resolve institutions in an orderly
way. Much progress has been made since the GFC in implementing the ambitious
agenda concerning recovery and resolution frameworks. That said, further work is
needed to equip authorities to manage bank failures more effectively. This entails
closing the gap between available tools and the resolution requirements arising from
banks’ scale, complexity or cross-border footprint. Key focus areas include facilitating

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

29

the application of bail-in measures on all debt instruments with loss-absorbing
features and establishing clear responsibilities and processes for the swift resolution
of internationally active banks, especially G-SIBs. In addition, authorities should be in
a position to address issues pre-emptively by steering banks towards sustainable
business models.

Structural policies to enhance sustainable growth
Looking beyond the immediate challenges of inflation and financial stress,
pre‑pandemic sluggish growth could well set back in. Indeed, potential output
growth estimates are at multidecade lows.35 There will then again be calls for
monetary and fiscal policies to boost the economy’s prospects.
Experience offers valuable lessons, however, and indicates how misguided such
calls can be. Policymakers should resist these calls. In the decades prior to the
pandemic and the war in Ukraine, policymakers came to view the economy mainly
through the lens of aggregate demand and assumed that aggregate supply adjusted
smoothly in the background. The pandemic and the war were a rude awakening:
supply side constraints do matter and macroeconomic policies stimulating aggregate
demand to smooth the business cycle had largely run out of space.36 One lesson is
that, to prevent unintended consequences, it is essential for monetary and fiscal
policy to retain sufficient policy space and remain firmly within a region of stability
(Chapter II).37 A second lesson is the need to reboot the supply side of the economy
as the only possible source of robust, durable growth.
With a renewed focus on the supply side, policymakers need to identify the
opportunities that longer-term trends can offer. The green transition, investments in
state-of-the-art efficient facilities during the re-configuration of GVCs, digitalisation
and the advancement of artificial intelligence could provide a much-needed push to
productivity in many countries – provided that the right policies are in place.
A comprehensive approach to reap the potential benefits involves an array of
structural policies. First and foremost, targeted investments in education should aim
at continuous upskilling and re-skilling of the workforce. Adequate resources will
need to be in place to ensure that workers can adapt and make effective use of the
new technologies, so that the skills of a large part of the labour force do not become
obsolete. In addition to education and training, policymakers should invest in
healthcare, not only to mitigate any scarring effects from the pandemic and be
prepared for other public health emergencies but also to maximise the productive
potential of the workforce. Investments in human capital could be complemented by
investments in physical capital. Infrastructure projects to improve connectivity and
access to markets and services, when chosen carefully and implemented efficiently,
could prop up productivity growth and enhance economies’ resilience. These
investments may require not only better but also more public spending, further
underscoring the need for fiscal consolidation through broadening of the tax base
and entitlement reforms.
The other area of focus is maintaining competitive and open markets, both
domestically and internationally. Economic structures are evolving rapidly, in response
to the pandemic-induced shifts in preferences, geopolitical tensions, technological
advances and climate change. Lowering barriers to entry would bring in new,
innovative firms and help improve the outcomes of these transformations. Promoting
free trade and resisting real and financial fragmentation would deliver better
outcomes, given the important role trade has played in underpinning global
productivity and growth.

These averages mask some variation, especially among EMEs: the tightening
cycle of Latin American central banks pre-dated that of the Federal Reserve,
while Asian economies typically embarked on tightening later, in part because
the rise in inflation there was much more modest. Importantly, in China the
official interest rate did not follow the global upward trend.

US banks seem to hedge little of their interest rate risk with derivatives, such as

In contrast to trading assets, changes to the market value of available-for-sale
(AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) assets do not immediately have to be
recognised in earnings. AFS and HTM assets, in turn, differ in how they affect
banks’ reported equity, as this adjusts only in response to valuation changes on
AFS holdings. In the United States, only the largest banks have to reflect such
valuation changes in their regulatory capital. Following a change in legislation in
2018, banks with total assets of less than $250 billion, such as SVB before its
failure, no longer have to reflect such losses.

This interpretation comes with caveats. First, tight policy and weakened
aggregate demand put a limit on profits. Second, a steady rise in profits and
prices does not necessarily mean a steady rise in market power (captured by
markups). Other factors, such as stronger demand or a temporary pause in new
capital investment, could be behind the rising profits. Third, and related, margins

and markups are notoriously difficult to measure accurately in real time and
vary greatly among sectors. Last but not least, the link between market power
and pass-through of costs to consumer prices is ambiguous. On the one hand,
more power could allow firms to pass rising costs to consumers. On the other
hand, higher markups could give firms headroom to absorb rising costs and
compete on market share.
14

See Graph 9 in Borio et al (2023), which shows the sensitivity of inflation to past
wage growth for different time periods. In addition, in Box 2 the authors use a
cointegrating model for prices and wages to show that, in a high-inflation
regime, changes in prices react in a significant way to changes in wages, and
vice versa.

15

See Mojon et al (2023) for more details of the decomposition exercise and for a
discussion of burden-sharing under projected disinflation paths in the euro area
and the United States. In this simple accounting-based approach, profits are
proxied by the ratio of GDP deflator to unit labour costs. Productivity growth is
assumed to be in line with historical norms.

16

Of course, another margin of adjustment available to firms is the quantity rather
than the price of labour. Typically, during disinflation episodes, unemployment
increased about six months before peak headline inflation was reached and was
almost 1.5 percentage points higher two years later. This time around, by
contrast, unemployment actually fell as inflation rose and, to date, it has not
risen much from the historically low levels it reached.

17

The sample covers Canada, Chile, Denmark, the euro area, India, Korea,
New Zealand, Peru, Switzerland, Thailand and the United States.

18

The methodology and the underlying assumptions are explained in the technical
annex. Notably, there is no explicit treatment of monetary policy. Its impact
comes only indirectly: the exercise implicitly captures a successful monetary
policy tightening by assuming that the unemployment gap returns to zero by
the end of 2023 in all scenarios. Also, the results largely depend on the strength
of the wage-price link estimated over a historical sample, and hence need to be
taken with a pinch of salt: by considering the average strength of the relationship
over a given sample, they may underestimate that, when inflation runs
particularly high, the feedback effect may be even stronger.

27

For a discussion of how inflation indicators can become less useful during a
regime switch, see De Fiore et al (2022). More generally, similar pitfalls plague
the assessment of the current tightening. In a low-inflation regime, it may appear
that monetary policy plays a minor role: as measured by standard models, the
impact of monetary policy shocks – deviations from a policy rule – on inflation
declines (eg Borio et al (2023)). This adds to the calibration challenge. But
concluding that monetary policy as such does not matter would be a mistake:
policy shocks do not capture the broader rule and the broader rule itself is what
secures and maintains the low-inflation regime.

II. Monetary and fiscal policy: safeguarding stability
and trust

Key takeaways
•

As core economic functions of the state, monetary and fiscal policy are inextricably intertwined.

•

To be conducive to a stable financial and macroeconomic environment and keep tensions between
them manageable, the policies need to operate within a “region of stability”. The ultimate risk of drifting
outside the region is a loss of the trust that society must have in the state and in its decision‑making.

•

In recent decades, monetary and fiscal policy gradually moved towards the boundaries of the stability
region, as they were often relied upon as de facto engines of growth. This has set the stage for the
current tensions between them, as well as for the macroeconomic and financial risks ahead.

•

Policy adjustments and institutional safeguards are needed to ensure that the two policies remain firmly
within the region of stability. These hinge on a keener recognition of the limitations of macroeconomic
stabilisation policies.

Introduction
For the first time in recent decades, we are seeing high inflation and financial stress
emerging in tandem. While each has its own specific causes (Chapter I), they are, to a
significant extent, a symptom of the cumulative effect of accommodative monetary
and fiscal policy over past decades, culminating in the extraordinary support
measures launched in response to the pandemic. In many countries, policy rates,
nominal and real, were historically low for a prolonged period and central bank
balance sheets surged to levels never seen in peacetime (Graph 1.A). At the same
time, persistent and large fiscal deficits led to a progressive increase in public debt to
unprecedented levels (Graph 1.B). These policy trajectories gave an important and
enduring push to inflation and fostered the build‑up of fragilities in the financial
system.1
The current tensions can be seen as a symptom that the two policies were
testing the boundaries of what might be called the “region of stability”. The region
maps constellations of monetary and fiscal policy that foster macroeconomic and
financial stability, and keep the inevitable tensions between the policies manageable.
The region’s boundaries are elusive and it is often only fully apparent ex post that
they have been tested, since economic systems can appear stable until, suddenly,
they are not. The ultimate risk of drifting outside the region is a loss of the trust that
society must have in the state and in its decision‑making.
The recent challenge to the boundaries is the latest in a long journey that
stretches back to at least the 1970s. At each point in time, the policy choices seemed
reasonable, even compelling. But cumulatively, they pushed the policies towards the
boundaries. The root cause of the drift has been a tendency for policymakers to
succumb to a kind of “growth illusion”, ie an overly optimistic view about the ability
of macroeconomic stabilisation policies to sustain economic growth.2
Policy adjustments and institutional safeguards are needed to ensure that
monetary and fiscal policy remain firmly within the region of stability. The policies

should aim to foster a stable financial and macroeconomic environment in which
sustainable growth, which is ultimately driven by supply factors, can take hold. And,
to do so, they need to retain sufficient safety margins to deal with unexpected
untoward events, as well as inevitable recessions. Ultimately, though, the adjustments
call for a shift in mindset, that is, a keener recognition of the limitations of stabilisation
policies, which cannot act as engines of growth. Having the region of stability as a
conscious and explicit policy consideration would help to guide action.
This chapter lays out the enduring challenge for monetary and fiscal policy to
stay within the region of stability and how it might be addressed. The chapter first
outlines the role of monetary and fiscal policy as core economic functions of the state
and introduces the concept of the region of stability. It then describes the journey of
monetary and fiscal policy over the past decades to the boundaries of the region,
ushering in high inflation and financial fragility. It next discusses the potential risks
ahead for macroeconomic and financial stability. The chapter ends by exploring policy
implications.

Policy interactions and the region of stability
As two core economic functions of the state, monetary and fiscal policy play a key
role in ensuring economic stability and trust in policymaking. Both policies entail
privileged powers to access and reallocate economic resources in society. Fiscal policy
hinges on the power to raise taxes and the prerogative to issue debt backed by future
tax revenues. Monetary policy wields the power to issue “money”, an irredeemable

means of payment. These powers are mutually
reinforcing. The requirement to pay taxes with money sustains money demand,
encouraging its use as a payment tool. In turn, a stable monetary system strengthens
the tax base. Furthermore, money issuance supports fiscal revenues through

The consolidated central bank‑government budget constraint

The balance sheets of the central bank and the government are joined at the hip. This, in turn, tightens the
link between monetary and fiscal policy and can blur the distinction between them. The balance sheets are
intertwined because the central bank is “owned” by the government or is part of it, sending to it remittances
based on the institution’s financial results. In addition, it is quite common for the two organs of the state to
hold claims on each other and issue others that are very close substitutes in private sector portfolios.
Examining the link between the two balance sheets sheds further light on the interaction between the two
policies.
Consider first the central bank’s balance sheet. Its assets typically consist of government securities, claims
on the private sector (eg lending to banks) and (often but not always) foreign currency reserves. Its liabilities
take the form of own debt (eg own paper or reverse repos) and “monetary liabilities”, ie cash in the hands of
the public and bank reserves – the “monetary base”. Very often, they may also include government deposits.
The residual between the value of the assets and liabilities is the central bank’s capital. The balance sheet of
the fiscal authority includes the central bank’s capital as an asset, as well as any other assets held, and liabilities
issued, by the fiscal authority.
Consolidating the two balance sheets highlights two important points.
First, large‑scale central bank purchases of long‑term government debt amount to a large debt
management operation, the nature of which depends on how the central bank finances them. Since cash is
entirely demand‑determined, the central bank can either issue its own short‑term debt – almost indistinguishable
from that of the government – or increase the amount of bank reserves. However, if the central bank wishes to
retain control over the interest rate, those reserves must be interest‑bearing: the interest rate would fall to zero
for as long as those reserves are not reabsorbed.1 The reserves are, in fact, indexed to the overnight rate.
Second, central bank profits and losses feed through to the government’s financial position. This can
strengthen or weaken it in ways that would not be apparent if one considered only the government’s financial
accounts. For instance, the government may lengthen the maturity of its liabilities. But if the central bank
purchased an equivalent amount, the corresponding government debt would be, in effect, overnight or
short‑term. This would raise, not lower, the sensitivity of the fiscal position to higher interest rates. The higher
sensitivity would show up as greater interest costs to the central bank and, through lower remittances to the
fiscal authority, reduce government revenues.
One example helps to illustrate these two points (Graph A1). Assume that the government issues more
long‑term (fixed rate) bonds to finance the acquisition of long-term assets, such as public infrastructure
(Graph A1.A). Next assume that the central bank buys this debt and finances it by issuing remunerated
overnight bank reserves (Graph A1.B). Looking at the balance sheet of the government alone, it would

The consolidated debt‑to‑GDP ratio shifts the region of stability. All else equal, as the ratio increases, the
region narrows, since a smaller set of interest rates and fiscal balances is consistent with macroeconomic and
financial stability. The key variables in (2) are the primary balance and the difference between the yield on the
debt and the nominal growth rate of the economy – the so‑called growth‑adjusted interest rate. Whenever
positive, this difference tends to increase the debt‑to‑GDP ratio over time, at a rate that increases with the
debt level. Even primary surpluses may not be large enough to offset this effect (see Box C for a detailed
discussion). Seigniorage can be largely ignored when inflation is low: it is small and, in contrast to the nominal
interest rate, demand‑determined and hence not under the control of the central bank. Non‑monetary
liabilities evolve broadly in line with GDP.3 This adds nuance to the ambiguous notion of “monetary financing”.
Thus, the consolidated budget constraint highlights that monetary and fiscal policy are inextricably
linked. Higher interest rates as, say, may be needed to address inflation, weaken the fiscal position and, if this
is precarious enough, can generate strains. By the same token, a fragile fiscal position reduces the monetary
policy room for manoeuvre, as it makes the control of inflation more costly. Indeed, in the case of acute
concerns about the sovereign’s creditworthiness, monetary policy could even lose control of inflation
altogether.4 The concerns could trigger a run on government debt, capital flight and a sharp depreciation of
the currency, which would generate inflation. A sharp tightening of monetary policy would simply intensify
concerns about a possible default, especially if part of the debt was denominated in foreign currency. Even if
default was avoided, this would be at the cost of higher, most likely runaway, inflation. Ultimately, maintaining
low and stable inflation requires fiscal backing.5
The central bank could also increase a non‑interest‑bearing reserve requirement, which is a form of tax on the banking
system.    2 Here M does not correspond to the monetary base or M0, as the latter also includes interest‑bearing
reserves.    3 Specifically, the demand for cash is largely a demand for transactions balances: it can be thought to depend
on nominal income and, with limited sensitivity, on the nominal interest rate. That for non‑interest‑bearing reserves is
either minimal or depends on the factors driving any reserve requirements, typically the deposit base to which they are
related. Deposits, too, can be thought of as a function of the same variables as cash.    4 In the majority of episodes of high
inflation and hyperinflation, the root cause was often a fiscal imbalance and/or an unrealistic target for the exchange rate
coupled with an accommodative response of the central bank. See eg Fischer et al (2002).    5 The crucial role of fiscal
policy in determining inflationary outcomes is at the heart of the fiscal theory of the price level (FTPL). Any increase in
government debt that is not backed by the credible expectation of higher future fiscal surpluses creates inflationary
pressures, with default being ruled out as too costly. The underlying mechanism that pushes the price level up is a wealth
effect. See eg Cochrane (2023) for a description of the FTPL and additional examples.

seigniorage and can help prevent technical government default as public debt is
redeemable against money.
The privileged powers of fiscal and monetary policy ultimately depend on an
implicit social contract underpinned by trust in the state. People consent to paying
taxes because they trust the government to use the proceeds for the public good.
Similarly, people accept the use of money as a means of payment because they trust
the central bank to preserve its value.
The need to retain society’s trust sets limits on the privileged powers of the two
policies. Monetary and fiscal policies can become a major force for prosperity if used
effectively to provide public goods and to ensure a stable financial and macroeconomic
environment, underpinned by a sound payment system. If instead their powers are
wielded unwisely, the policies can seriously damage the economy and, ultimately,
trust in the state.
The main channels through which monetary and fiscal policies influence economic
activity differ considerably. Fiscal policy does so primarily through the direct impact
of spending on goods and services, and the production of some of those services, as
well as through transfers to households and firms. Monetary policy works primarily
through the central bank’s operations in financial markets – notably the policy
interest rate – which have a pervasive effect on yields, borrowing costs, asset prices
and the exchange rate.
That said, overlaps are also substantial. Fiscal policy influences financial conditions
through debt issuance. Not only does public debt underpin the functioning of the
financial system and the pricing of assets, it can have a far‑reaching effect on the
yield curve, other asset prices and the exchange rate, as well as on the soundness of
the financial system when fiscal soundness is put in doubt. Monetary policy, in turn,
influences the state of public finances. It does so directly, by setting interest rates
(borrowing costs) and through its effect on the exchange rate (when debt is
denominated in foreign currency); and it does so indirectly, through its impact on
economic activity and inflation more generally, which can materially alter government
expenditures and taxes.
The two policies are further entwined through interlocking balance sheets
(Box A). Since the central bank is part of the state, its financial results feed into the
financial condition of the government through remittances. The large‑scale purchases
of government debt, as well as the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, have
made government finances more sensitive to central bank decisions.

The region of stability
The pervasive impact that monetary and fiscal policy have on economic activity, and
the overlapping nature of their transmission channels, means that the two policies
are joined at the hip. They may work in a coherent fashion to foster a stable financial
and macroeconomic environment; but they can, equally, undermine that stability
and generate tensions between them that are very difficult to manage.
The concept of the “region of stability” helps identify the appropriate zone of
operation of the two policies (Box B).3 This region captures the set of monetary and
fiscal policies that are consistent with macroeconomic and financial stability. The
boundaries of the region vary across countries and are difficult to pin down with
precision ex ante. They cannot be summed up in simple metrics, akin to a constraint
on the level of the fiscal deficit or on the policy rate.
Furthermore, the size, shape and locus of the region shift over time. Some
changes occur gradually, such as those due to structural developments in the labour
market and the structure of production. But the region can also shrink and shift
position rapidly, for example due to a sudden loss of confidence in policy or in the

Box B

The region of stability and its determinants

The region of stability identifies the set of fiscal and monetary policy combinations which are consistent with
macroeconomic and financial stability.1 When fiscal and monetary policies operate within this region, tensions
between the two policies may arise frequently but remain manageable. However, when fiscal and monetary
policies approach the boundaries of the region, they encroach on each other and endanger macro‑financial
stability.
A key challenge for policymakers is that the region of stability evolves over time in size, shape and
position (Graph B1.A). In certain periods, the region can be quite extensive, encompassing a broad set of
monetary and fiscal settings. But the region can then rapidly shrink. Monetary and fiscal policy combinations
that appear consistent with macro‑financial stability at a given point in time, may, all of a sudden, no
longer be.
Several factors influence the region of stability by changing the macro‑financial backdrop and the degree
of public confidence in the economic outlook and in the soundness of the policy framework (Graph B1.B).
Some of these factors are relatively slow‑moving. For example, structural forces – including technological and
financial innovation – can gradually alter the foundations of production and finance, in turn shaping the set of
monetary and fiscal policies that are consistent with macro‑financial stability. Demographic factors can also
slowly but profoundly change labour markets.2 And international trade and financial integration – or forces
that work against it – can heavily influence the global economic landscape and thus the room for fiscal and
monetary policy manoeuvre.
But other factors can evolve much faster, abruptly shifting the locus and size of the region of stability.
One possibility is sudden exogenous shocks. For example, the commodity price surge triggered by the Russian
invasion of Ukraine provides a vivid illustration of such a risk. Furthermore, confidence effects greatly heighten
the potential for sudden movements in the region. Market sentiment and public trust in the ability of
macroeconomic policies to preserve stability can shift rapidly and, in turn, dramatically narrow the fiscal and
monetary space. A sharp depreciation of the exchange rate is often the first sign of a loss of confidence as
well
as a key channel that constrains the policy headroom.3

Besides being affected by structural forces and exogenous shocks, policies other than monetary and fiscal
ones exert a heavy influence on the region. For example, microprudential and macroprudential regulation
play a critical role in limiting financial excesses and building precautionary buffers, thus preserving greater
space for fiscal and monetary policy.4 A targeted and well calibrated use of foreign exchange rate interventions,
in some situations possibly complemented by capital flow management measures, may also enhance
macroeconomic resilience, and provide fiscal and monetary policy with greater flexibility.5 And structural
reforms can considerably expand the region by boosting potential growth, thereby reducing public pressures
for monetary and fiscal policies to support economic activity.
Yet an even more important – although much less appreciated – aspect is that the cumulative impact of
fiscal and monetary policies themselves can profoundly alter the region of stability. Policy settings that may
appear stabilising in the near term can, over time, inadvertently shrink the region. For example, monetary and
fiscal settings with expansionary effects in the short term may come at the cost of higher instability down the
road by encouraging leverage and risk‑taking.6 Prolonged policy accommodation may also create misperceptions
about economic fundamentals. An extended period of easy monetary conditions when inflation is held down
by favourable tailwinds may provide the false impression of a permanent and independent decline in real
rates that can lure policymakers towards the region’s boundaries.7  
The concept of the region of stability thus underscores the critical intertemporal trade‑offs associated
with fiscal and monetary policy. In setting policy, policymakers should not only remain firmly within the region
of stability but they should also ensure that the cumulative impact of fiscal and monetary settings does not
shrink the region over time. Failure to do so can have severe consequences, by dramatically narrowing the
space for policy manoeuvre, heightening tensions between monetary and fiscal policies, and ultimately
undermining macro‑financial stability and trust in the key functions of the state.

See Borio and Disyatat (2021) for an early discussion on how the region of stability constrains and is in turn affected by
fiscal and monetary policy.    2 Structural factors – including rising inequality, an ageing population and decreases in
technological progress – have been proposed as possible drivers of the decline in real interest rates. See eg the discussion
in Blanchard (2022). Yet the empirical evidence is weak. See Borio et al (2017).    3 These concepts are at the centre of the
literature on currency crises, eg Krugman (1979), Obstfeld (1996) and Aghion et al (2004).    4 See eg Farhi and Werning
(2016), Cerutti et al (2017), Korinek and Simsek (2016) and Bergant et al (2023).    5 See eg Cavallino and Sandri (2023) and
Bianchi and Lorenzoni (2022).    6 High public and private leverage may, for example, constrain monetary policy and
undermine macroeconomic stability via fiscal and financial dominance concerns, as articulated for example in Sargent and
Wallace (1981) and Brunnermeier (2015). Evidence regarding the link between credit growth and subsequent financial
crises is presented in Borio and Lowe (2002) and Schularick and Taylor (2012).    7 For models in which monetary easing
may drive a prolonged reduction in real interest rates, see Rungcharoenkitkul et al (2019), Mian et al (2021) and Kashyap
and Stein (2023). Evidence about the effects of monetary policy on long‑term real rates is provided in Borio et al (2019),

economy at large – a risk that has become more acute over time due to the rapid
growth and increased fragility of the financial system. This underscores the need for
fiscal and monetary policy to operate well within the region and to leave sufficient
safety margins at its boundaries.
The cumulative effect of past fiscal and monetary policy decisions crucially
shapes the region’s boundaries. For example, prolonged periods of monetary and
fiscal accommodation may contribute to the build‑up of a broad range of
vulnerabilities – including greater leverage and risk‑taking – that can eventually
constrain the policies’ room for manoeuvre. Hence the typically intertemporal nature
of the trade‑offs involved. A policy conduct that may appear stabilising in the near
term can, over time, inadvertently shrink the region and take policies towards the
boundary. The economic system may appear stable for a long time until, suddenly, it
is not.
The boundaries are also approached through the interaction of the two policies.
For a given interest rate path, a fiscal policy stance that is cumulatively too loose will
risk higher inflation and a sovereign crisis, as debt builds up. For a given fiscal policy
path, a monetary policy stance that is cumulatively too easy can generate higher
inflation and financial stability risks. Along the corresponding paths, the two policies
can reinforce each other’s trajectories. Easy monetary policy can induce the

government to build up more debt; expansionary fiscal policy can make it harder for
monetary policy to be as tight as necessary.
Testing the region’s boundaries can trigger vicious cycles. In that case, both
policies end up narrowing their respective rooms for manoeuvre, shocks become
increasingly damaging and policies increasingly destabilising. The instability, in turn,
threatens or reflects loss of trust in the policies themselves. A common feature is loss
of trust in money – as a store of value, means of payment or unit of account – and in
the sustainability of public debt.
Instability in the wake of overstepping the boundaries of the region of stability
can take different forms. Common manifestations include high inflation, economic
slumps, sovereign default and financial stress. A sharp depreciation of the exchange
rate is a typical symptom and transmission channel. The most acute manifestation of
drifting far outside the boundaries is hyperinflations, such as those experienced in
some Latin American emerging market economies (EMEs) in the 1980s and 1990s.
These show how fiscal pressures and their monetary policy accommodation can
destroy the value of money (Graph 2.A).
Another manifestation is the coincidence of sovereign debt, systemic banking
and currency crises (Graph 2.B). Acute financial crises often feature the so‑called
doom loop between the sovereign’s balance sheet and the financial sector. In such
episodes, fiscal and financial instability reinforce each other, as banks suffer losses on
government bond holdings while governments need to shore up the failing banking
system. In turn, these fiscal and financial crises undermine trust in the currency, and
currency depreciation further exacerbates instability.

Testing the boundaries: the long journey so far
The journey: from the 1960s to today
Prior to the pandemic, monetary and fiscal policy were already approaching the
boundaries of the region of stability. Interest rates had been historically low for a

prolonged period and central bank balance sheets had risen to wartime‑like levels
following more than a decade of monetary stimulus in the wake of the Great Financial
Crisis (GFC). At the same time, public debt had reached historical highs following
persistent fiscal deficits. This constellation meant a substantial loss in room for policy
manoeuvre and left economies vulnerable to shocks as well as to the inevitable next
recession. Then, when the pandemic – a bolt from the blue – struck, the policies
tested those boundaries further, ushering in high inflation and financial fragility.
How did monetary and fiscal policies come to approach the boundaries
pre‑pandemic? It was the result of a long journey. The journey was not linear. The
symptoms of an overly expansionary policy stance evolved with the economic
landscape that those policies were helping to shape, together with more fundamental
structural forces. A consistent underlying factor was the overestimation of how far
macroeconomic policies could steer the economy and, by pushing hard enough,
ignite the engine of growth – a kind of “growth illusion”. This induced a progressive
loss of policy space over time.
It is useful to divide the journey going back to the 1960s into two phases, with
the mid‑1980s as a rough watershed. Graph 3 illustrates the break, with reference to
advanced economies (AEs) – see below for a discussion of similarities and differences
with EMEs.
Until the mid‑1980s, the key symptom indicating that the policies were testing
the speed limits of the economy, and hence the boundaries of the region of stability,
was rising inflation. Recessions were typically induced by a tightening of monetary
policy to quell inflation. With the financial system hemmed in by regulation, signs of
large build‑ups and contractions in credit were missing. During this phase, the drift to
the boundaries reflected, in part, the belief that policymakers could fine‑tune the
economy by a carefully calibrated mix of monetary and fiscal policy. Hence the

In response to the inflation crisis, policymakers took steps to bring monetary and
fiscal policies back within the region of stability. Central banks sought to end inflation
by aggressively hiking policy rates. Following the disinflation in the first half of the
1980s, monetary regimes prioritising price stability gradually became the norm.
Interest rates declined substantially from their previous peak. However, the rise in
interest rates on the back of monetary tightening in the early 1980s had exposed
fiscal fragilities in many countries. In combination with persistent fiscal deficits, this
led to a surge in public debt. Thus, many governments were forced to embark on
fiscal consolidation. For more than a decade from the early 1990s, public debt levels,
on average, stabilised.
The beginning of the second phase in the mid‑1980s reflected, paradoxically,
the confluence of these improvements in policy frameworks with fundamental
structural change. The combination altered business cycle dynamics in subtle but
far‑reaching ways. Financial systems were profoundly liberalised. By the early 1990s,
a “government‑led” financial system had given way to a “market‑led” one, both
domestically and internationally.4 And the globalisation of the real economy soon
followed. EMEs, most notably China, joined a seamless global labour force and tight
production networks spread across the world.
As a result of these changes, inflation ceased to be the main symptom of policies
testing the boundaries of the region of stability. Central banks secured price stability
as the globalisation of the real economy was eroding the pricing power of workers
and firms. This was a powerful structural tailwind, which helped central banks hardwire
the low‑inflation regime and meant that a given inflation rate would be consistent
with lower real and nominal interest rates. It was the era of the Great Moderation.
The symptoms of overstretch now took the form of financial imbalances,
ie outsize expansions in credit and asset prices, notably real estate prices, on the
back of strong risk‑taking. Inflation‑induced recessions gave way to financial recessions.
Inflation was on average low and stable and barely rose prior to business cycle
contractions, while falling mildly but persistently below the pre‑recession level in their
wake. Instead, business cycles featured sharp pre‑recession financial expansions that
turned into contractions. The recessions became commonly associated with financial
stress or, with prudential regulation failing to adjust to the new environment, even
outright crises, most spectacularly the GFC. These recessions had a longer‑lasting
impact on growth, as the economy laboured under a legacy of higher debt,5 thereby
also biasing traditional cyclical adjustment measures.
Over time, the shift from inflationary pressures to financial imbalances contributed
to the gradual erosion of policy space. Monetary policy naturally eased during
contractions to cushion the economy and fight the headwinds of private sector
balance sheet repair. But it had little reason to tighten much during expansions since
inflation remained low and stable. Interest rates progressively declined. For fiscal
policy, the GFC was a watershed. The outsize financial boom that preceded it greatly
flattered government accounts by artificially raising estimates of potential output and
boosting tax revenues, thereby disguising the more expansionary stance.6 Financial
crises then forced sovereigns to backstop the financial system and support faltering
economies, as some countries had already done in the banking crises of the 1990s.
Public debt initially increased massively, sustained by low interest rates that kept a lid
on debt servicing costs.
The challenges intensified in the aftermath of the GFC. Monetary policy struggled
to push inflation back up to target: the globalisation tailwinds that had helped to
bring inflation down to target pre‑GFC were hindering the central banks’ efforts to
push it back up. Fiscal policy did seek to regain some of the room for manoeuvre lost
in the aftermath of the GFC. But, as a result, monetary policy became the “only game
in town”. As time wore on, fiscal policy was then asked to support monetary policy in

the fight against low inflation by boosting economic activity. It was a topsy‑turvy
world compared with the one that had preceded it.
The pandemic gave the final push towards the boundaries. All the policy stops
were pulled out to shield households and firms from the full force of the lockdowns
put in place to deal with the Covid‑19 health emergency. Ostensibly, they could
stretch the room for manoeuvre further, but the risks were material. At least with the
benefit of hindsight, the support proved to be too large and prolonged. Inflation
surged on the back of such macroeconomic stimulus when the economy rebounded
with surprising vigour as restrictions were lifted and when supply failed to respond in
a sufficiently elastic way.7 And this took place against the backdrop of historically
high levels of public and private debt, as well as elevated asset prices. For the first
time, globally, a surge in inflation coincided with widespread financial vulnerabilities
(Chapter I).

The journey: reinforcing effects
Along the journey towards the boundaries of the region of stability, a number of
factors reinforced the trajectories of fiscal and monetary policy.
Arguably, one such factor was the waning traction of policies as they approached
the boundaries. Changes in policy rates tend to have a smaller effect on aggregate
demand when nominal interest rates are very low (Graph 4.A), reflecting, for example,
negative income effects on savers and the adverse impacts on bank profitability of
persistently low rates.8 This loss of traction implies that larger interest rate cuts are
needed to produce the same impact on output and inflation, pushing monetary
policy closer to the boundary of the region of stability. Moreover, the side effects of

monetary easing through higher risk‑taking and private debt build‑up tend to
become stronger when interest rates are low and stay there for a long time, narrowing

Fiscal stimulus also tends to become less powerful when public debt is higher.
This likely reflects adverse confidence effects that kick in when doubts about fiscal
sustainability grow. Therefore, larger fiscal measures are required to achieve the same
stimulus as debt trends up.10
The self‑reinforcing interactions between the two policies constitute a second
important factor. Lower interest rates reduced fiscal constraints, diminishing the
need and incentive to consolidate in economic expansions. Reductions in the
interest rate paid on the debt have indeed been associated with an increase in fiscal
deficits, especially during the post‑GFC period of ultra‑low interest rates (Graph 4.B).
Central bank large‑scale asset purchases of sovereign debt played a key role in this
respect. Across AEs, central bank holdings of government debt soared post‑GFC
(Graph 5.A), driven primarily by large‑scale bond purchases of major central banks
(Graph 5.B).
High public debt levels, in turn, probably reinforced incentives to maintain an
accommodative monetary stance. When debt levels are high, interest rate hikes have
a stronger impact on debt servicing costs, raising more acute concerns about adverse
macro‑financial and fiscal repercussions. By the same token, central bank balance
sheet normalisation becomes more difficult when public debt is high because
markets must absorb larger amounts of debt. These factors may have made it harder
to tighten monetary policy and shrink central bank balance sheets – a kind of “debt
trap”.

The journey: how different are EMEs?
The journey of EMEs has several similarities to that of AEs. It was shaped by the
same global forces that affected business cycles over time. For one, financial
liberalisation – sometimes country‑specific – elevated the role of financial cycles and
increased the incidence of banking crises. Prominent examples include the Southern
Cone crisis in Latin America in the early 1980s, the Tequila crisis in Mexico in 1994
and the Asian crisis of 1997–98. In addition, the globalisation of the real economy
weighed on inflation from the 1990s on, reinforcing the impact of the adoption of

price stability‑oriented monetary policy regimes. These basic similarities are reflected

also in the broad evolution of key variables such as inflation, interest rates, fiscal
deficits and public debt (Graph 6).
At the same time, there are also important differences, including among EMEs,
related to structural factors.
Some of these factors have mainly influenced differences in the journey across
EME regions. Political and institutional features can shape attitudes towards fiscal
policy, inflation and growth. Partly as a result, inflation has been structurally lower in
Asia than in Latin America, which saw hyperinflations in the 1980s and 1990s, often
combined with sovereign default and financial stress (Graph 7).11
Other structural factors drive differences, mainly, between EMEs and AEs more
generally. A key such factor is EMEs’ greater sensitivity to global financial conditions
and market sentiment. This greater sensitivity reflects, primarily, less developed
financial markets, including fewer FX hedging possibilities, and greater reliance on FX
funding.12 It has four main implications.
First, the region of stability is smaller and more fluid. The margin of error is
commensurately narrower and the risk of sudden and abrupt discontinuities higher.
As a result, when policies step outside the region of stability, market discipline is
typically felt earlier and more intensely than in AEs, forcing a rapid shift back.13
Second, the symptoms of breaches of the boundary of the region more often
take the form of capital outflows and large depreciations. The exchange rate plays a
bigger role, as a force behind fiscal fragility, inflation and financial instability. And
given the greater prevalence of fixed or tightly managed exchange rate regimes
until the late 1990s, the incidence of currency crises has been higher. This has
prompted a shift over time towards more flexible exchange rate arrangements,
accompanied by a widespread adoption of inflation targeting frameworks
(Graph 8.A).14
Third, the impact of monetary policy in AEs, notably in the United States, given
the dominant role of the US dollar, has been especially prominent. Changes in the
US monetary policy stance and swings in the US dollar have been major forces
behind the ebbs and flows of global conditions.BIS

shift to more flexible exchange rate regimes has attenuated, but by no means
eliminated, this influence.15
Fourth, the greater exposure to global financial conditions and repeated crises
has, over time, fostered EMEs’ awareness of the boundaries of the region of stability
and their fluidity. From the late 1990s, well before the GFC, they took steps to

well as, to a lesser extent, targeted capital flow management measures – key elements
of macro‑financial stability frameworks.16 Again, regional differences emerged, with
greater concerns about domestic financial imbalances and a lower degree of exchange
rate flexibility in Asia than in Latin America.
These enhanced policy frameworks have allowed countries to more successfully
weather the GFC and the Covid crises (Graph 7) by increasing shock resilience and
enabling countercyclical policies in bad times. They also help explain, for example,
why countries in Latin America have tightened monetary policy earlier and more
forcefully than many of their AE peers post‑Covid. At the same time, these
improvements have also somewhat relaxed the policy constraints the countries faced,
widening the perceived region of stability. This is, in turn, not without risks going
forward and could partly account for the deterioration in fiscal positions and ratings
post‑GFC (see Graph 6 and below).

Testing the boundaries: risks in the journey ahead
What is the next step in the journey of AEs and EMEs? What are the implications of
having tested the boundaries of the region of stability? The ongoing struggle to
restore price stability and fend off financial stability risks has triggered tensions
between fiscal and monetary policy that raise further challenges down the road.
Three main interrelated challenges stand out. First, public finances are facing
major strains owing to the combination of record high levels of public debt, strong
spending pressures, higher interest rates and weakening growth prospects. Second,
large fiscal deficits and high public debt are at risk of working at cross purposes with
monetary policy tightening, potentially complicating the fight against inflation. Third,
the deterioration in public finances and the sharp repricing of long‑term debt in the
wake of interest rate hikes may raise financial stability risks.
Consider each issue in turn.

Risks to fiscal positions and the sovereign’s creditworthiness
The increase in public debt in AEs and EMEs has led to a deterioration in sovereigns’
creditworthiness (Graph 9.A). In AEs, sovereign credit ratings worsened considerably
following the surge in debt levels in the wake of the GFC. In EMEs, credit ratings have
gradually deteriorated during the past decade in line with the increase in debt levels.
The unexpected inflation surge after the Covid‑19 pandemic has temporarily
embellished fiscal accounts by boosting nominal GDP and thus mechanically reducing
debt‑to‑GDP ratios. Inflation has also flattered fiscal balances. Since many taxes are
levied in proportion to nominal variables – such as wages, sales etc – they tend to
increase immediately as prices rise. By contrast, public expenditures are largely fixed
in nominal terms from year to year.
Yet improvements in fiscal balances due to inflation are ephemeral. Rising costs
will feed into higher public spending and governments will confront pressures to
raise public wages and social transfers in line with price increases, if this is not already
occurring automatically through indexation mechanisms. Furthermore, the monetary
tightening required to bring inflation down will increase borrowing costs and
constrain economic growth. Indeed, the historical experience shows that periods of
higher inflation tend to be followed, if anything, by rising – not declining – public
debt (Graph 9.B).
Looking ahead, fiscal authorities will confront severe challenges due to large new
spending pressures, the possibility of higher medium‑term interest rates and dimmer
growth prospects.

First, consider the implications of new spending pressures for the path of public
debt going forward. Estimates for AEs and EMEs suggest that age‑related
expenditures will grow by approximately 4% and 5% of GDP, respectively, over the
next 20 years. Absent fiscal consolidation, this would push debt above 200% and
150% of GDP by 2050 in AEs and EMEs, respectively, even if interest rates remain
below growth rates, as was the case in the pre‑pandemic years (Graph 10).
Other factors may add to the pressure on public finances. The commitment to
supporting a transition towards a sustainable global economy in response to
climate change is one. In addition, geopolitical tensions are likely to lead to a
material increase in defence spending. An illustrative scenario that includes a rise in
public spending by 2% of GDP on top of the increase in age‑related spending,
would lead to an additional increase in public debt of approximately 50% of GDP
by 2050.
These worrying debt projections are, in fact, rather optimistic: they assume that
real interest rates will remain 1 percentage point below growth rates, broadly in line
with the experience in recent years. As is well known, this configuration tends to ease
debt sustainability pressures (Box C).
Indeed, there are two important reasons why it would be imprudent to count on
large and permanent negative differentials between interest rates and growth rates.
First, inflation may prove stubborn and require higher interest rates for longer than
currently expected. High inflation may also lead to a re‑assessment of inflation risk,
prompting investors to demand higher risk premia to hold government bonds. And
attempts to regain price stability may ultimately result in a substantive economic
slowdown.
Second, the link between structural factors and low real rates, which is often
relied upon to project persistently low interest rates, is not watertight.17 The economy
may thus exit the current period of high inflation by confronting a new reality with
higher real rates.
Should real rates increase on a sustained basis, public debt sustainability would
come under further considerable pressure. Two factors compound the effect of
interest rate hikes on public finances.

Fiscal limits and the risks to debt dynamics

A substantial part of the recent debate on public debt and fiscal sustainability revolves around the idea that
a persistently negative differential between the interest paid on public debt and the growth rate of the
economy – the so‑called interest‑growth differential, or, in jargon, r – g – is a boon for public finances. The
reason is that it helps preserve debt sustainability irrespective of the fiscal stance. While this is never portrayed
as a call for reckless fiscal spending, it does provide some comfort that spare fiscal capacity can be tapped in
case of need and encourages more expansionary policies.1 The degree of comfort, however, can easily be
misleading, with material risks.
Historically, a negative interest‑growth differential has been relatively common (Graph C1.A). The prolonged
period of average positive differentials in advanced economies starting in the 1980s is more of an exception.2 But
the same is true of the relatively low volatility of the differential since the 1990s. Indeed, historically, adjustments
in interest‑growth differentials have been abrupt and unpredictable.3
Textbook approaches to fiscal limits are based on a stylised budget constraint of the narrow government
sector and rely on the relationship that outlines the accumulation of public debt (see also Box A):
𝐷𝐷# − 𝐷𝐷#%& = 𝑟𝑟# 𝐷𝐷#%& − 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃# ,
𝐷𝐷# − 𝐷𝐷#%& = 𝑟𝑟# 𝐷𝐷#%& − 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃# ,
where Dt is the nominal amount of outstanding debt at time t, rt is the effective interest rate paid on
outstanding debt and PBt the primary balance (including central banks’ remittances to the government).
Dividing by (nominal) GDP, rearranging terms and approximating, one obtains:
𝑑𝑑# = (𝑟𝑟# − 𝑔𝑔# )𝑑𝑑#%& − 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝# ,
𝑑𝑑# = (𝑟𝑟# − 𝑔𝑔# )𝑑𝑑#%& − 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝# ,

𝑝𝑝𝑏𝑏 ∗ = 𝑑𝑑 ∗ (𝑟𝑟 ∗ − 𝑔𝑔∗ );

this can be taken as the value around which (countercyclical) fiscal policy should be conducted to maintain
debt at the level d*, once cyclical factors have played out.
Focusing first on the case r* > g*, higher long‑run debt levels require the government to run increasingly
high primary surpluses to offset interest payments. But there are limits to running large primary surpluses for
extended periods. From a purely economic standpoint, taxes cannot be raised indefinitely without generating
incentives to evade taxes, eventually eroding the tax base – the so‑called Laffer curve effect. And even more
importantly, from a political economy perspective, taxes cannot be raised at will without provoking a backlash,
nor can public expenditure be cut below certain limits without jeopardising the provision of basic public
services. All these factors imply that there is a limit on the maximum sustainable primary balance, which,
together with r* and g*, also establishes an upper limit on public debt – the so‑called debt limit.
Keeping in mind the uncertainty of r – g and its sensitivity to the dynamics of debt also helps to avoid the
pitfalls of drawing strong inferences from the above stylised identity. It follows that the conclusion that any
level of public debt can be sustained when r < g is incorrect. Even if the relationship appears to hold, it does
so for a given state of the economic environment, including the level and expected path of public debt: there
is no guarantee that r will remain below g once the fiscal stance changes. Uncertainty and endogeneity can, in
fact, turn a deceptively safe spot into a situation in which fiscal consolidation is required.4 Spikes in yields can
occur suddenly in response to adverse events, and a high level of indebtedness makes them more likely.
Moreover, even if changes in the interest‑growth differential are more gradual, the government may find itself
constrained in adjusting its fiscal stance. Two factors could get in the way.
The first is a high level of debt. On one hand, this amplifies the reaction of yields to adverse shocks.5 On
the other hand, it magnifies the effects that changes in the interest‑growth differential have on the
debt‑stabilising primary balance. In other words, with higher debt, a given increase in r – g will require a larger
adjustment to the primary balance. This is illustrated in Graph C1.B, which shows the relationship between
primary balances and debt, as sketched in equation (3). For example, if r increases by 2 percentage points, the
necessary increase in the primary balance is just 1 percentage point when debt is 50% of GDP, but it is three
times as high when debt is 150% of GDP.
Such a large adjustment may not be feasible due to the political economy constraints mentioned above.
And even if technically feasible, investors may question the ability of the government to stick to a painful plan:
in the end, their assessment of debt sustainability may rely more on their perceptions of the effective capacity
of the sovereign to collect more taxes and/or cut expenditures than on estimates of r – g. This could trigger a
credibility crisis and a full‑blown run on public debt.6  
Another source of risk is the maturity structure of the stock of public debt. A comparatively shorter
maturity of public debt means higher refinancing needs and a higher sensitivity of rt to changes in market
rates. This amplifies the magnitude of sudden increases in the interest‑growth differential due to changes in
interest rates. Typically, a worsening in sovereign risk goes hand in hand with higher risk premia and a
shortening of new bond issuance, as the cost of refinancing at longer horizons is higher. This, in turn, increases
rollover risks and makes a run on debt more likely. Furthermore, as fiscal accounts become more sensitive to
interest rate changes, this could hamper the ability of monetary policy to control inflation.
In practice, estimating the debt limit is a daunting task. First of all, it is unclear where one should place
the limit on primary balances. Historical experience suggests that primary surpluses are unlikely to exceed 5%
for extended periods. Yet country‑ and episode‑specific circumstances can play a large role in determining
such a threshold, which should be taken with a pinch of salt.7 Second, there is considerable uncertainty about
the possible evolution of future interest rates and GDP growth rates. Finally, and more importantly, they are
also likely to be interrelated and endogenous to debt itself. Higher indebtedness is likely to be associated with
higher risk premia, and hence higher interest rates to be paid on public debt. Moreover, there is some evidence
that high public debt can be associated with lower growth.8 Accordingly, the only reasonable approach to
gauging fiscal limits is to use stress tests or to compare the effects of alternative assumptions.
All in all, running public finances in a region that is closer to the limits increases the risk of abrupt
adjustments that could derail the economy. A prudent approach is called for.
See eg Blanchard (2019). However, recent research argues that what matters for the sustainability of public debt is not
only the interest‑growth differential, but also the difference between the marginal product of capital and the growth rate
of the economy, see eg Reis (2021).    2 One possible reason is that, when creditworthiness is preserved, public debt can
provide investors with liquidity and safety, and hence trades at a premium over other riskier and less liquid assets.    3 See
also Mauro and Zhou (2021).    4 For example, Mian et al (2022) argue that the debt sustainability condition needs to be
explicitly complemented by a term accounting for the sensitivity of interest rates to the debt level.    5 For example, Lian et
al (2020) show that the probability and the size of reversals in r – g are related to the size of public debt and the share of
foreign currency debt.    6 Note that a similar scenario could be one in which inflation surges and the central bank struggles
to control it.    7 See Eichengreen and Panizza (2016).    8 Threshold effects of debt on growth are also used by IMF (2018).

may exacerbate fiscal risks, increasing risk premia and further undermining economic
activity. Countries with higher public debt levels thus tend to experience shorter phases
with interest rates lower than growth rates, as well as a higher probability of a reversal.19
In EMEs, the potential for vicious circles between fiscal sustainability, slowing
growth and rising interest rates is higher. One key reason is that exchange rate
reactions can suddenly push countries to bump up against debt limits. Loss of
confidence in debt sustainability can trigger sharp depreciations that, in the presence
of currency mismatches, can wreak havoc on public and private balance sheets,

Inflation risks
Pressure on fiscal positions and sovereign risk may increase inflation risks going forward.
In the near term, fiscal deficits remain large in many countries, thus sustaining
aggregate demand and inflation. Hence, monetary and fiscal policy are at risk of
working at cross purposes, complicating the fight against inflation (Chapter I). This
heightens the risk of transitioning to a high‑inflation regime – a concern that
becomes more acute the longer inflation remains elevated.
Taking a long‑term perspective sheds further light on these risks. The evidence
indicates that the inflationary effects of fiscal policy depend on the fiscal and
monetary policy regime. In AEs, if fiscal policy is prudent – leaning against public
debt increases through higher primary balances – and central banks are independent,
fiscal stimulus has modest effects on inflation (Graph 12.A).20 But if fiscal policy fails
to stabilise debt (ie is profligate) and central bank independence is questioned, the
inflationary effects of fiscal policy are much stronger.
The effects of fiscal stimulus on inflation tend to be greater in EMEs (Graph 12.B).
This is largely due to the role of the exchange rate. In AEs, fiscal stimulus tends to
have no significant effect on the exchange rate. By contrast, fiscal expansions in
EMEs trigger a significant depreciation of the exchange rate.21 In turn, exchange
rate depreciations feed into higher inflation, and to a larger extent than in AEs
(Graph 13.A).
The transmission of fiscal stimulus to exchange rates in EMEs largely reflects
concerns about sovereign risks. Fiscal expansions are associated with increases in
sovereign risks, as captured by credit default swap (CDS) spreads (Graph 13.B). These
increases, in turn, trigger depreciations (Graph 13.C). In this respect, exchange rates
act as the proverbial canary in the coal mine, being highly responsive to the first signs
of macroeconomic instability. Beyond feeding back into higher domestic prices and
thus undermining efforts to contain inflation, exchange rate depreciations can also
pose considerable financial stability concerns.

pressures to expand fiscal space by keeping interest rates low. In other circumstances,
monetary policy faces an economic constraint because interest rate hikes risk
precipitating a sovereign debt crisis.
While the two types of dominance tend to go hand in hand and can undermine
the central bank’s credibility and independence, they have somewhat different
implications. Strong institutional safeguards designed to shield the central bank’s
operational autonomy can be effective when pressures are purely of a political nature.
By contrast, they can do relatively little when the constraint is economic and reflects
trade‑offs linked to higher rates.
Even if high debt levels do not lead to outright forms of fiscal dominance, they
may still contribute to raising inflationary pressures. For example, survey evidence
suggests that high public debt increases household inflation expectations, especially
among people that have less confidence in the central bank’s determination to fight
inflation.23

Financial stability risks
The deteriorating sovereign debt outlook in many economies also points to heightened
risks for the financial sector. Ultimately, a vulnerable sovereign means a vulnerable
financial system. There are two reasons for this, over and above any negative effects
on the financial system generated by adverse macroeconomic outcomes.
The first reason is that, most directly, the financial system is exposed to the
sovereign. To be sure, sovereign debt can be a cornerstone of a well functioning
financial system. It can underpin the system’s smooth functioning, by providing a
safe store of value, a solid benchmark for the pricing of assets and a liquid asset that
facilitates economic transactions, not least in its role as collateral (eg for repos or to
meet margin calls; Box D). Moreover, government debt is a key instrument through

Government debt as collateral and market functioning

Government debt plays a key role in the financial system. It is typically the domestic currency asset with the
highest credit quality. It is traded in the deepest and most liquid markets, and provides the benchmark for
pricing virtually all other assets. It is the main instrument that central banks use in their liquidity management
operations to set policy interest rates or, through large‑scale asset purchases, to influence asset prices more
broadly. And, increasingly, it is a primary form of collateral.
The use of government securities as collateral, broadly defined, is an integral part of market participants’
risk management and underpins vast financial markets. Government paper is extensively used to post margins
in derivatives transactions to reduce counterparty credit risk (Graphs D1.A and D1.B). And it is the instrument
of choice in repurchase agreement (repo) transactions (Graph D1.C), which involve the exchange of securities
for cash for a pre‑defined period. Repos are functionally equivalent to borrowing/lending against collateral.
Several reasons explain the use of government debt as collateral. First, policymakers’ objective of boosting
the depth and liquidity of government bond markets was a key motivation behind the development of repo
markets.1 Second, lenders’ preferences to substitute relationship finance with arm’s length finance naturally
shift the focus from the creditworthiness of the counterparty or borrower to the quality of the asset used as
collateral. Third, post‑GFC regulatory and financial system reforms have incentivised the use of collateral as an
additional risk mitigant.2  
Government paper has thus acquired the status of “quasi‑money”. It competes with cash – mostly bank
deposits or bank reserves with the central bank – in derivatives margins (Graph D1.B). And, through repos,
holders can raise cash without having to sell the underlying security. In fact, haircuts in core safe government
bond markets are often tiny or non‑existent, in the range of 0–2%. This means that an investorRestricted
can raise
almost as much cash as the value of the government paper they hold.

Gross positive credit exposure represents the current value of the credit exposures of BIS-reporting dealers to (bank and non-bank)
counterparties (ie “in-the-money” contracts). Up to 2014, “collateral” stands for the variation margin (might include independent amount)
reported as “received and posted” by ISDA members (a population similar to BIS-reporting dealers) against non-centrally cleared OTC
derivatives in ISDA margin surveys, adjusted for double-counting. After the break in the series, variation margin received by phase 1 firms
(from 2016 onwards) and phase 2 and phase 3 firms (from 2019 onwards). Data for 2016 correspond to Q1 2017. 2 For uncleared, at

generate major market dislocations, as was evident during the euro area sovereign debt crisis. But, even short
of that happening, the pervasive use of government paper as collateral can have major implications for the
dynamics of markets under stress.
One reason is rooted in the system’s procyclicality. In good times, the availability of collateral and
compressed margins can contribute to the build‑up of vulnerabilities. As leverage and liquidity mismatches
expand, the perceived need to screen and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties declines, thus
leading to a build‑up of credit risk, paradoxically when risks seem particularly low on the surface. In bad times,
as risk materialises and/or market volatility picks up, spikes in haircuts and margins put a premium on the
safest and most liquid forms of collateral, such as government paper. This can set in motion fire sales of less
liquid assets to satisfy collateral needs. In the extreme, liquidity strains can degenerate into outright solvency
concerns.
A second reason is that, while the use of government paper as collateral may be compelling at the level
of each individual agent, widespread use may ultimately undermine this paper’s safe haven status and
generate systemic events. A certain “fallacy of composition” would be at work, whereby an initial decline in
the value of collateral induces many market participants to sell it at the same time, thus giving rise to
destabilising price dynamics.3 One possible trigger is an unexpected tightening of monetary policy. This is
what occurred, for instance, during the bond market crash of 1994, when highly leveraged positions in
government paper were unwound.4 Another possible trigger is escalating concerns about inflation. Such
concerns appeared to play a role in the recent stress in UK gilt markets. Following a fiscal announcement that
pointed to a highly expansionary stance, government paper was sold and the drop in its price was amplified
by the deleveraging of investment vehicles on which pension funds had been relying to hedge the duration
risk of their liabilities.5  
The potential for unintended consequences of widespread collateral use carries policy messages. In
particular, there is a strong case for imposing higher collateral haircuts and margins that limit the increase in
leverage during good times and dampen the ensuing contraction in bad times. While such measures to
contain procyclicality would still exploit the risk‑mitigating properties of collateral, they would reduce the
likelihood of liquidity shortages or declines in collateral values that necessitate central bank interventions.

it retains the highest credit quality and that financial institutions manage the
associated interest rate risks properly. Otherwise, it can easily turn from a source of
stability into one of major instability.
Historically, the spectre of a loss of sovereign creditworthiness has been a major
source of risk for the financial system. In the extreme, the sovereign can default on
its debt, causing large losses for debt holders.24 Even in the absence of default, a
serious erosion of sovereign creditworthiness can trigger stress and higher risk
premia in the government bond market. This propagates to banks, other financial
institutions and capital markets, weakening balance sheets and tightening funding
conditions, possibly even precipitating a crisis.
The second reason why a vulnerable sovereign can threaten the financial system
is that the government provides the ultimate backstop for the system. Of course,
prudential regulation and strong standalone resolution mechanisms are the first line
of defence. Moreover, central banks can act as lender of last resort and market‑maker
of last resort in times of severe stress, thereby buttressing the liquidity of the system.
But only the government can backstop the system’s solvency, through deposit
insurance and other guarantees, as well as, when needed, outright recapitalisation of
failing institutions.25
This backstop role is visible in bank ratings. The fact that banks’ all‑in credit ratings
are meaningfully above their stand-alone ratings highlights the importance of implicit
government guarantees (Graph 14.A).26 The wider ratings gap for EMEs compared
with AEs suggests that reliance on the creditworthiness of the sovereign – and the
potential cost for the government – are particularly important for EME banking
systems (Graph 14.B).

64

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

Indeed, partly because of the sovereign’s backstop function, the fiscal costs
(direct and indirect) of financial crises are typically huge, as measured by the change
in public debt following a crisis. Historically, public debt has tended to jump in the
aftermath of a banking crisis, in both AEs and EMEs (Graph 15). The fiscal cost was
especially large in the case of the GFC, reaching a median rise in debt‑to‑GDP of
about 40 percentage points in AEs. A significant portion of crisis costs typically reflect
fiscal recapitalisation packages and other outright support for the banking sector,
although the bulk represents indirect costs from the macroeconomic fallout and any
discretionary fiscal responses.27
The two‑way link between the sovereign and the financial sector gives rise to the
risk of a costly feedback loop. Through it, deteriorations in the creditworthiness of
the sovereign and the banks can reinforce each other – the proverbial doom loop of
the sovereign‑bank nexus.28 Such episodes have been more common in EMEs. But
the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area has shown that AEs are not immune.29 Credit
ratings show that the credit risk of sovereigns and banks are tightly connected in both
EMEs and AEs (Graph 14.C). Similarly, spreads on CDS referencing sovereign assets
and bank assets are typically tightly linked, indicating that bank and sovereign risks
tend to move in tandem.30
Over the past decade, the rapid increase in sovereign debt has left investors
and financial intermediaries increasingly exposed not only to sovereign credit risk,
but also to interest rate risk.31 This is particularly the case, as governments
increasingly issued longer‑maturity debt during the low‑yield era to lock in low
financing costs (Graph 16.A). And even though large‑scale asset purchases by some
AE central banks reduced exposures by replacing sovereign debt with bank reserves
in private sector portfolios, the average maturity of debt net of central bank
purchases has still risen since pre‑GFC (Graph 16.B). A hypothetical 300 basis point
increase in government bond yields, for example, would result in estimated losses to
bondholders (excluding the central bank) corresponding to between approximately
Restricted
10 and 35% of GDP in major AEs, and up to 10% in major EMEs (Graph 16.C). Those

rapid growth post‑GFC. The sector, which holds close to half of total financial assets
globally,32 on average accounts for approximately 40% of government bond holdings
in AEs and 60% in EMEs.33 The tight interconnections between banks and NBFIs
mean that distress can easily spread between the two sectors and intensify in the
process (Graph 17.C).34
High sovereign debt heightens the risk to the financial system not just because
of the sheer size of the exposures but, importantly, because it increases the likelihood
of sharp bond yield moves. In particular, during monetary policy tightening phases,
long‑term yields have tended to rise more in high‑debt countries than in low‑debt
countries, especially among EMEs (Graph 18.A). To a significant degree, this has been
due to higher credit risk premia: sovereign CDS premia have tended to rise markedly
for high‑debt EMEs when monetary policy is tightened, but not for low‑debt EMEs
(Graph 18.B). While the effects of rate hikes on yields are smaller for AEs, this is based
on a sample that includes a prolonged period of heavy government debt purchases
by AE central banks. As these purchases end and begin to reverse, the situation may
change.
The risk of sharp yield adjustments is higher when liquidity in bond markets is
structurally poor. The Covid‑19 crisis showed how quickly market functioning can
break down when liquidity conditions in sovereign bond markets are fragile. In
March 2020, one‑sided selling pressure (the “dash for cash”) – disorderly deleveraging
by hedge funds and other players – interacted with intermediation bottlenecks to
create a perfect storm that led to dysfunction even in markets that are typically
among the most liquid ones in the world.35 The fact that, currently, indicators point
to fragile liquidity conditions suggests that risks of market dysfunction should not be
underestimated (Graph 18.C).

system is hit by shocks that induce agents to sell the paper. This can undermine the
safe haven status of government bonds even when their credit quality is not in doubt.
In the current hiking cycle, government debt exposures have already been a
source of financial stress. So far, the problems have been linked to interest rate risk,
not sovereign risk (Chapter I). They have reflected the accumulation of exposures
during the long phase of unusually low interest rates. Losses on government bond
holdings have been at the heart of recent stress in the banking system in the United
States and of NBFIs in the United Kingdom. The stress has prompted broad‑based
central bank liquidity support and, in the case of the banks, the extension of deposit
guarantees, which in turn increases the potential costs to public finances. Looking
ahead, however, given prospective further deterioration in the creditworthiness of
sovereigns, credit risk could also become, once again, a source of stress.
This analysis suggests that the financial sector is especially vulnerable following
a prolonged period of lax fiscal policy and loose monetary policy. This is because the
overall size of sovereign exposures is higher, the sensitivity of those exposures to
adjustments in yields is greater and the likelihood of those adjustments is also
greater. If investors perceive that the policy mix is reaching the boundaries of the
region of stability, government bonds could reprice rapidly and forcefully. Yields
would rise sharply as investors would require significantly higher compensation to
be exposed to inflation risk or, especially in the case of EMEs, to sovereign credit risk.
And sovereigns with lower creditworthiness would be particularly vulnerable. This, in
turn, would compound risks among banks and other financial institutions.

Policy implications
The analysis of the journey to the boundaries of the region of stability and of the risks
ahead raises both near‑ and longer‑term challenges for monetary and fiscal policy.
In the near term, the challenge is to ensure a consistent policy mix that delivers
a return to low inflation while tackling financial stability risks (Chapter I), thereby
withdrawing from the boundaries of the region of stability. The priority for monetary
policy is to restore price stability. Should a shift to a high‑inflation regime take place
and inflation become entrenched, it would be very costly to return to a regime of
low and stable inflation.36 At the same time, monetary policy will have to alleviate
financial strains to prevent systemic financial instability. There will be a premium on
distinguishing, to the extent possible, the measures designed to achieve the two
objectives. Regardless, it will be essential to ensure that the tightening path consistent
with lower inflation is not compromised by the immediate needs of the financial
sector. Fiscal policy plays an important complementary role. Through consolidation,
it would help to reduce pressure on aggregate demand and inflation, limit the risk of
being a source of financial instability and provide more headroom, should it be called
upon, to support crisis management by tackling solvency concerns.
The longer‑term challenge is to ensure that monetary and fiscal policies operate
well within the region of stability on a lasting basis, heeding the lessons learnt along
the journey. This has implications for strategies, institutions and mindsets.
To avoid testing the boundaries of the region of stability, policy strategies should
aim to retain room for policy manoeuvre over time. In the journey to the boundaries
over the past decades, these safety margins evaporated to a significant extent due to
an asymmetric conduct of policy over the business cycle, with easing in the bust not
compensated for by a commensurate tightening in the boom.
To retain greater monetary space, once price stability is re‑established, monetary
policy could be more tolerant of moderate, even if persistent, shortfalls of inflation
from point targets. In a low‑inflation regime, inflation has certain self‑stabilising

68

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

properties, so that there is less need to respond forcefully to correct deviations from
target. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that monetary policy has less traction in
lifting inflation under such conditions. Such a refinement in frameworks would also
help limit the side effects that arise from prolonged periods of monetary
accommodation. Foremost among such side effects is the build‑up of financial
vulnerabilities, which tend to further constrain both monetary and fiscal policy
headroom when financial stress emerges.
Careful consideration should also be given to keeping central bank balance
sheets as small and as riskless as possible, subject to delivering successfully on the
mandate. This would have three benefits. First, it would limit the footprint of the
central bank in the economy, thereby reducing the institution’s involvement in
resource allocation and the risk of inhibiting market functioning. Second, it would
lessen the economic and political economy problems linked to transfers to the
government. Finally, it would maximise the central bank’s ability to expand the
balance sheet when the need does arise. Given the costs of large and risky balance
sheets, the initial size is a hindrance, not an advantage. The balance sheet needs to
be elastic, not large.
As for fiscal policy, there is an urgent need to consolidate fiscal positions. Relying
on inflation to reduce the government debt burden is obviously not an option. It
would have only a temporary effect. And, in the longer run, it would generate the
very instability that would seriously damage the economy and public finances in the
process. Moreover, to support consolidation it would be useful to incorporate the
role of financial factors more systematically. For instance, when assessing fiscal space,
it would be important to account for the flattering effect of financial booms on fiscal
accounts and the possible costs of financial stress. Greater reliance on automatic
stabilisers more generally would also help.
Consolidation should go hand in hand with fiscal strategies that boost
sustainable growth. For one, efforts could be made to reduce or eliminate the typical
bias in tax systems that favours debt over equity. This has encouraged excessive
reliance on debt as an engine of growth. In addition, the quality of public spending
is crucial. For example, it would be important to rebalance government expenditures
towards well chosen and effectively executed investment projects – especially in
infrastructure and green energy – as well as human capital building (education and
health). Such a rebalancing would correct the decade‑long downward trend in public
investment that made room for more inflexible spending components, such as
entitlements. Quite apart from being an ultimate policy objective, higher growth
would also deliver stronger public finances and at higher real interest rates – more in
line with an efficient allocation of capital and resources.
Beyond adjustments to monetary and fiscal policy strategies, institutional
safeguards are necessary to limit tensions between the two policies and promote
their coherence. Central bank independence remains the key pillar to ensure that
monetary policy can pursue its price stability mandate, especially in the current
context of elevated public debt levels and stubbornly high inflation. On the fiscal side,
stronger institutional safeguards would help encourage prudent fiscal policy. To this
end, fiscal rules and fiscal councils could play an important role in setting guardrails,
all the more so if backed by appropriate constitutional provisions.
But policy adjustments should not be limited to monetary and fiscal policy alone.
Other policies can play a complementary role.
Prudential policy is critical, given how disruptive financial instability can be for
the region of stability. Both its microprudential and macroprudential dimensions are
important.
As regards microprudential regulation and supervision, a lot has been done
following the GFC. That said, progress has been uneven. And recent strains in the

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

69

banking sector indicate that there is still work to do, with respect to both regulatory
standards and, equally importantly, supervisory practices (see Chapter I for an
elaboration). Some of that work relates more specifically to the risks linked to
sovereign exposures. For banks, the Basel III framework continues to apply a
preferential regulatory treatment to those exposures, particularly with regard to
credit/default, interest rate and liquidity risks for exposures valued at amortised cost
and held in the banking book.37 Similarly, while efforts are under way to address
NBFI vulnerabilities, these have so far been insufficient, including with regard to the
NBFI‑sovereign nexus. As such, more could be done to ensure that regulation better
mitigates sovereign risk for both banks and NBFI entities and to avoid undue risk
concentrations.38 Any such stricter prudential treatment would need to be calibrated
and implemented in the light of the special role of sovereign debt in the financial
system.
Macroprudential regulation is an important complement to its microprudential
counterpart. Well calibrated, it can help deal with, and mitigate, the costs and
intensity of domestic financial cycles.39 It can also help address the consequences of
ebbs and flows of global financial conditions, supported by foreign exchange
intervention and, in case of need, capital flow management measures.
The ultimate objective would be to set up a more holistic macro‑financial stability
framework. In such a framework, monetary, fiscal and prudential policy would operate
in a coherent fashion to foster economic stability. This would considerably alleviate
trade‑offs and avoid overburdening individual policies. Post‑GFC, major steps have
been taken in that direction. That said, this is still very much a work in progress,
analytically and practically.40 And the integration of fiscal policy has not proceeded
as far as the others.
Sound structural policies boosting sustainable growth will be key to relieve
monetary and fiscal policy from the pressures to act as engines of growth which
pushed them beyond the boundaries of the region of stability. Achieving higher and
sustainable growth can only be accomplished by boosting the productive potential
of the economy through effective measures that enhance the supply side. Over the
past decades there has been a worrying slowdown in global growth. The slowdown
was driven, in particular, by a marked decline in the growth of total factor productivity
(TFP), which measures the efficiency of use of labour and capital inputs. To revive TFP
growth, therefore, it is essential to enhance the efficiency of production. This requires
renewed efforts to design and implement structural reforms, which have slowed
substantially since the early 2000s. Boosting competition in product markets,
reducing red tape and facilitating a more efficient allocation of labour are key areas
to provide new impetus for innovation and growth.
Ultimately, what is needed is a change in mindsets. Policymakers need to have a
keener recognition of the limitations of macroeconomic stabilisation policies.
Monetary and fiscal policy can be a major force for good, but, if overly ambitious, can
also cause great damage. The journey described in this chapter shows that, if the
specific challenges evolve with the economic landscape, the root cause of failures
does not. The fallacies of the “growth illusion” highlight that stabilisation policies
cannot be engines of lasting economic growth.41 The concept of the region of
stability, hard as it may be to apply in real time, can promote the necessary shift in
perspective. This is because the concept embodies the recognition of the limitations
of macroeconomic policies. The region is first and foremost not a precise set of
numbers, but a lens through which to look at the world and to guide policy. It can
help preserve the all‑important trust that society must have in the state and its
decision‑making.

The concept of a region or corridor of stability was coined by Leijonhufvud
(2009) in the early 1970s to indicate how the economy can become unstable if it
is operating outside a particular range. Borio and Disyatat (2021) have
underscored how this region places constraints on the room for manoeuvre for
fiscal and monetary policy while in turn being affected by the cumulative fiscal
and monetary stance over time.

a smaller effect on inflation in low‑inflation regimes. This is because, as one
might expect, monetary policy has a larger impact on the common component
of price changes – a measure closer to the concept of “true” inflation – than on
relative price changes, see BIS (2022a) and Borio, Lombardi, Yetman and
Zakrajšek (2023).

9

This effect is reinforced by larger effects of a given change in the monetary
policy stance on asset prices and credit over time, see BIS (2015) and Hofmann
and Peersman (2017).

10

For evidence on the negative link between fiscal multipliers and the level of
public debt, see Ilzetzki et al (2013) and Banerjee and Zampolli (2019).

11

For a discussion of the roots of inflation in Latin America, see Bernanke (2005).
Kehoe and Nicolini (2021) provide a detailed account of the monetary and fiscal
interactions in Latin American countries since the 1960s.

12

See BIS (2019, 2022b) and CGFS (2019).

13

For instance, as a result of a history of inflation and default, the safe level of
external debt can be very low for many EMEs due to the “debt intolerance” of
investors (Reinhart et al (2003)).

14

As highlighted by Calvo and Reinhart (2002), there is often a discrepancy
between de jure and de facto exchange rate regimes. In particular, many EMEs
have flexible exchange rate regimes officially, but in practice pursue managed
exchange rate arrangements limiting exchange rate swings and reflecting the
vulnerability to such swings.

15

See BIS (2019, 2020, 2021, 2022b) for analyses of the enduring challenges of
capital flow and exchange rate fluctuations for policy frameworks in EMEs.

For a discussion of the features of EME macro‑financial stability frameworks, see
BIS (2019, 2022b).

17

Empirical analyses examining the historical relationship between real interest
rates and the standard set of saving‑investment drivers find – without imposing
strong theoretical priors – little evidence of a systematic link; see eg Borio et al
(2017) and references therein.

18

See IMF (2023).

19

These facts are documented in Lian et al (2020) based on a large panel of
advanced and emerging market economies since 1950. See also Mauro and
Zhou (2021) for evidence that negative differentials between interest rates and
growth rates are not systematically associated historically with a lower risk of
government default.

20

The classification of fiscal regimes as prudent or profligate follows Mauro et al
(2015).

21

See Banerjee et al (2023).

22

The classical statement of fiscal dominance goes back to Sargent and Wallace
(1981).

23

Grigoli and Sandri (2023) examine the sensitivity of household inflation
expectations to public debt levels using information provision experiments in
surveys conducted in Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United States.

24

Sovereign loss‑given‑default rates have averaged 37% based on a sample of
180 defaults in 68 countries over the period 1970 to 2010; see Cruces and
Trebesch (2013).

25

Moreover, to the extent that the sovereign supports the broad economy, it
reduces defaults and unemployment, and hence supports the financial system.

26

Stand-alone ratings reflect the intrinsic financial strength of banks, ie the
likelihood of default provided that no external support is forthcoming. All‑in
ratings take into account the likelihood and magnitude of extraordinary external
support, in particular from the government, that banks may receive when in
distress. See Packer and Tarashev (2011) for a discussion.

27

For banking crises in AEs, the direct fiscal costs related to financial sector support
corresponded, on average, to approximately a third of the total increase in
public debt following the crisis. Taking into account any subsequent recoveries,
the ratio was around one fifth. See Laeven and Valencia (2013, 2018) for details.

28

See eg Farhi and Tirole (2018) and Borio, Farag and Zampolli (2023).

29

See eg Li and Zinna (2018).

30

See the discussion in Borio, Farag and Zampolli (2023) and references therein.
Dieckmann and Plank (2012) analyse the sovereign CDS market in AEs and find
evidence of a private‑to‑public risk transfer through expectations of government
bailouts.

Graph 1: Statistics are computed using a smaller set of countries when data are not
available.
Graph 1.A: The sample covers AR, AU, BE, BR, CA, CH, CL, CN, DE, ES, FI, FR, GB, HK,
ID, IE, IN, IT, JP, KR, MX, MY, NL, NO, PE, PH, SE, SG, TH and US.
Graph 1.B: General (if not available, central) government core (if not available, total)
debt at nominal (if not available, market) value. The sample covers AR, AT, AU, BE, BR,
CA, CH, CL, DE, DK, ES, FR, GB, GR, IN, IT, JP, NL, NO, NZ, PT, RU, SE and US.
Graph 2.A: Inflation measured as year‑on‑year growth rate; mean across countries in
sample: AR, BO, BR, MX, PE, UY and VE. Central bank claims on government is the
sum of claims on central, state and local government, and public non‑financial
companies.
Graph 3: Business cycle dates are from National Bureau of Economic Research for US;
Economic Cycle Research Institute for AU, CA, CH, DE, ES, FR, GB, IT, JP and SE. For
BE, FI, IE, NL and NO business cycles are dated with a business cycle‑dating algorithm.
Episodes for which data for the previous and next 20 quarters are available are used
in computing the medians.
Graph 4.A: Impulse response of real GDP to a 100 bp expansionary monetary policy
shock. The threshold for the low rate regime is 2.25%, chosen to maximise empirical
fit using a grid‑search procedure. See Ahmed et al (2021).
Graph 4.B: From 25‑year moving window mean‑group panel estimation of fiscal
reaction functions. The sample covers: AT, AU, BE, CA, CH, DE, DK, ES, FI, FR, GB, GR,
IE, IT, JP, NL, NO, NZ, PT, SE and US. The empirical fiscal reaction function takes a
standard form, modelling the primary deficit as a function of the lagged public
debt‑to‑GDP ratio, the output gap and the interest rate paid on the outstanding
debt. See Cheng et al (2023).
Graph 5.A: General government gross debt held by domestic central bank. The
sample covers AT, AU, BE, CA, CH, DE, DK, ES, FI, FR, GB, GR, IE, IT, JP, NL, NO, NZ, PT,
SE and US.
Graph 5.B: Central bank holdings of bonds issued by the central government except
the ECB (debt securities issued by the general government).
Graph 6: Median across AEs = AU, BE, CA, CH, DE, ES, FI, FR, GB, IE, IT, JP, NL, NO, SE
and US. EMEs = AR, BR, CL, CN, CO, HK, ID, IN, KR, MX, MY, PE, PH, SG, TH and VN.
For fiscal balance and public debt, IMF forecasts for 2023.
Graph 7: Median annual inflation across countries within each region, simple average
of medians for each period. For crises, data for AE, MT and SA are not available;
latest is 2017.
Graph 8.A: The sample covers AE, AR, BR, CL, CN, CO, CZ, DZ, HK, HU, ID, IL, IN, KR,
KW, MA, MX, MY, PE, PH, PL, RO, RU, SA, SG, TH, TR and ZA.

Graph 8.C: Cumulative sum of the average number of measures per country. No data
available for CY, DZ, JP, KW, MA and MT.
Graph 9.A: Average sovereign debt ratings from Fitch, Moody’s and S&P. The series
plotted represent cross‑country medians, for a smaller sample when data are not
available. AEs = AT, AU, BE, CA, CH, CY, DE, DK, EE, ES, FI, FR, GB, GR, HR, IE, IT, JP, LT,
LU, LV, MT, NL, NO, NZ, PT, SE, SI, SK and US. EMEs = BR, CL, CN, CO, CZ, HK, HU, ID,
IL, IN, KR, MA, MX, MY, PE, PH, PL, RO, SG, TH, TR, VN and ZA.
Graph 9.B: Change in general government debt as a percentage of GDP between
year t and t+5 and over inflation in year t, excluding periods when a debt
restructuring took place. The sample includes annual data between 1970 and 2022
for AE, AR, AT, AU, BE, BR, CA, CH, CL, CN, CO, CZ, DE, DK, DZ, ES, FI, FR, GB, GR, HK,
HU, ID, IE, IL, IN, IT, JP, KR, MA, MX, MY, NL, NO, NZ, PE, PH, PL, PT, RO, RU, SA, SE, SG,
TH, TR, US and ZA. The fitted line is obtained by regressing changes in the
debt‑to‑GDP ratio over inflation and country fixed effects. The sample is restricted to
annual inflation rates below 100%. If episodes with inflation above 100% are included,
there is no statistically significant relation between changes in debt and inflation.
Graph 10: Baseline projections assume an interest rate‑growth differential equal to
–1% and constant primary deficits in percent of GDP as of 2022. Age‑related
spending are based on IMF projections for pension and healthcare spending for
2030 and 2050. For the additional spending increase scenario it is assumed that the
primary deficit will increase by 2% of GDP by 2030 and stay at that level afterwards.
Historical debt is computed using a smaller set of countries when data are not
available. Simple average across AEs = AT, BE, DE, ES, FI, FR, GB, IE, IT, JP, NL, PT and
US. EMEs = AR, BR, CL, CN, CO, CZ, HU, ID, IL, IN, KR, MX, PL and ZA.
Graph 11.A: The sample covers AT, AU, BE, CA, CH, DE, DK, EE, ES, FI, FR, GB, GR, IE, IT,
JP, LT, LU, LV, NL, NO, NZ, PT, SE, SI, SK and US. For 2022, data not available for GB, JP,
NL, PT, SI and SK.
Graph 11.B: The sample covers AR, AT, AU, BE, BR, CA, CH, CL, DE, DK, ES, FR, GB, GR,
IN, IT, JP, NL, NO, NZ, PT, RU, SE and US. Statistics are computed using a smaller set of
countries when data are not available. Government debt‑to‑GDP multiplied by the
simple average of short‑term and long‑term interest rates, where government debt
is general (if not available, central) government core (if not available, total) debt at
nominal (if not available, market) value. The counterfactual median debt service cost
is constructed using the interest rate levels prevailing in 1995.
Graph 12.A: Based on Banerjee et al (2022). The sample covers AT, AU, BE, CA, CH,
DE, DK, ES, FI, FR, GB, GR, IE, IT, JP, NL, NO, NZ, PT, SE and US. Fiscal regimes are
classified as prudent or profligate based on Mauro et al (2015). Monetary policy
independence is defined as being high or low based on legal limitations on central
bank lending to the public sector in Romelli (2022). Estimation sample from 1972–
2011 upon data availability.
Graph 12.B: Based on Banerjee et al (2023). Coefficient intervals at 90% confidence
bands clustered by country. The sample covers AEs = AT, AU, BE, CA, CH, DE, DK, ES,
FI, FR, GB, GR, IE, IT, JP, NL, NO, NZ, PT, SE and US. EMDEs = BO, BR, CL, CN, CO, DO,
GH, HK, HN, HT, HU, ID, IL, IN, KR, MX, NI, PE, PH, PL, RO, RU, TH, TR, UY and ZA. The

III. Blueprint for the future monetary system:
improving the old, enabling the new

Key takeaways
•

Tokenisation of money and assets has great potential, but initiatives to date have taken place in silos
without access to central bank money and the foundation of trust it provides.

•

A new type of financial market infrastructure – a unified ledger – could capture the full benefits of
tokenisation by combining central bank money, tokenised deposits and tokenised assets on a
programmable platform.

•

As well as improving existing processes through the seamless integration of transactions, a unified
ledger could harness programmability to enable arrangements that are currently not practicable,
thereby expanding the universe of possible economic outcomes.

•

Multiple ledgers – each with a specific use case – might coexist, interlinked by application programming
interfaces to ensure interoperability as well as promote financial inclusion and a level playing field.

Introduction
Throughout history, developments in the monetary system and society at large have
been closely interwoven. This interplay has been a story of one side pulling the other,
leading to dramatic leaps in economic activity over time. On the one hand, the
evolving needs and demands of society have spurred the monetary system to adapt.
On the other hand, key innovations in money and payments have unleashed latent
demand for new types of economic activity that have led to dramatic spurts of
economic growth and development.
The rapid expansion of trade and commerce over the past 500 years would be
scarcely imaginable if buyers and sellers still had to cart around heavy chests full of
metal coins to pay for goods and services. The advent of money in the form of book
entries on ledgers overseen by trusted intermediaries opened the door to new
financial instruments that bridged both geographical distance and the long lags
between the delivery of goods and settlement of payments.1 With the advent of the
electronic age, paper ledgers became digital, adding impetus to the “dematerialisation”
of money as well as claims on financial and real assets. Electronic bookkeeping
accelerated paper-based processes, allowing accounts to be updated at the speed of
light. Through dematerialisation and digitalisation, the interplay between money and
the economy has wrought profound changes on society at large.
Today, the monetary system stands at the cusp of another major leap. Following
dematerialisation and digitalisation, the key development is tokenisation – the
process of representing claims digitally on a programmable platform. This can be
seen as the next logical step in digital recordkeeping and asset transfer. Tokenisation
could dramatically enhance the capabilities of the monetary and financial system by
harnessing new ways for intermediaries to interact in serving end users, removing
the traditional separation of messaging, reconciliation and settlement. Tokenisation
could unlock new types of economic arrangement that the frictions inherent in the
current monetary system have hitherto made impractical.

Crypto and decentralised finance (DeFi) have offered a glimpse of tokenisation’s
promise, but crypto is a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future
of money.2 Not only is crypto self-referential, with little contact with the real world,
it also lacks the anchor of the trust in money provided by the central bank. While
stablecoins have mushroomed to fill this vacuum by mimicking central bank money,
the implosion of the crypto universe in the past year shows that there is no substitute
for the real thing. Away from crypto, efforts by commercial banks and other private
sector groups have explored the capabilities of tokenisation for real-world use cases.
But these efforts have been hampered by the silos erected by each project and the
resulting disconnect from other parts of the financial system. These projects also lack
integration with a tokenised version of the settlement asset in the form of a central
bank digital currency (CBDC).
The collapse of crypto and the faltering progress of other tokenisation projects
underline a key lesson. The success of tokenisation rests on the foundation of trust
provided by central bank money and its capacity to knit together key elements of the
financial system. This capacity derives from the central bank’s role at the core of the
monetary system. Among its many functions, the central bank issues the economy’s
unit of account and ensures the finality of payments through settlement on its balance
sheet. Building on the trust in central bank money, the private sector uses its creativity
and ingenuity to serve customers.3 In particular, commercial banks issue deposits,
the most common form of money held by the public. Supported by regulation and
supervision, this two-tiered structure preserves the “singleness of money”: the
property that payments denominated in the sovereign unit of account will be settled
at par, even if they use different forms of privately and publicly issued monies.
While the current monetary system has served society well, pinch points in the
system that emerge from time to time highlight the frictions that users chafe against.
These frictions result from the current design of the monetary system where digital
money and other claims reside in siloed proprietary databases, located at the edges
of communication networks. These databases must be connected through third-party
messaging systems that send messages back and forth. As a result, transactions need
to be reconciled separately before eventually being settled with finality. During this
back-and-forth process, not only do participants have an incomplete view of actions
and circumstances, but the uncertainties and misaligned incentives preclude some
transactions that have clear economic rationale. While workarounds such as collateral
or escrow can mitigate such frictions, these solutions have their limits and create their
own inefficiencies. Tokenisation is a more fundamental route towards addressing the
shortcomings of the current system.
New demands are also emerging from end users themselves as advances in
digital services raise their expectations. Indeed, these emerging demands may be
just the tip of the iceberg. As services delivered through smartphone apps make
deep inroads into people’s daily lives, users expect the same seamless operation of
the monetary and financial system as the seamless interactions of apps on their
smartphones. These demands are beginning to outgrow the siloed domains and
their reliance on the to-and-fro processes at the edges of the network.
This chapter presents a blueprint for a future monetary system that harnesses
the potential of tokenisation to improve the old and enable the new. The key
elements of the blueprint are CBDCs, tokenised deposits and other tokenised claims
on financial and real assets. The blueprint envisages these elements being brought
together in a new type of financial market infrastructure (FMI) – a “unified ledger”.4 The
full benefits of tokenisation could be harnessed in a unified ledger due to the
settlement finality that comes from central bank money residing in the same venue
as other claims. Leveraging trust in the central bank, a shared venue of this kind has
great potential to enhance the monetary and financial system.

A unified ledger transforms the way that intermediaries interact to serve end
users. Through programmability and the platform’s ability to bundle transactions
(“composability”), a unified ledger allows sequences of financial transactions to be
automated and seamlessly integrated. This reduces the need for manual interventions
and reconciliations that arise from the traditional separation of messaging, clearing
and settlement, thereby eliminating delays and uncertainty. The ledger also supports
simultaneous and instantaneous settlement, reducing settlement times and credit
risks. Settlement in central bank money ensures the singleness of money and
payment finality.
Moreover, by having “everything in one place”, a unified ledger provides a setting
in which a broader array of contingent actions can be automatically executed to
overcome information and incentive problems. In this way, tokenisation could expand
the universe of possible contracting outcomes. The unified ledger thus opens the way
for entirely new types of economic arrangement that are impossible today due to
incentive and informational frictions. The eventual transformation of the financial
system will be limited only by the imagination and ingenuity of developers that build
on the system, much as the ecosystem of smartphone apps has far exceeded the
expectations of the platform builders themselves. Even in the near term, a unified
ledger could unlock arrangements that have clear economic rationale. Possibilities
include new types of deposit contract that bolster financial stability, improvements in
supply chain finance and new ways to improve the financial system’s resilience and
integrity.
The unified ledger concept can be broad or narrow, with the first instances likely
to be application-specific in scope. For example, one ledger could aim at improving
securities settlement, while another could facilitate trade finance in supply chains.
Tokenised forms of money would figure in each ledger to provide the transaction
medium. Each unified ledger would bring together only the intermediaries and assets
required for each application. The scope of a ledger will also determine the relevant
players that must be involved in the governance arrangements. Separate ledgers
could be connected through application programming interfaces (APIs), or, as their
scope expands over time, they could incorporate additional assets and entities, or
merge together.
Some of the benefits envisaged from the unified ledger could be reaped by
interlinking existing systems through APIs into a “network of networks”. While such a
network of networks would still consist of separate systems and fall short of fully
fledged programmability across systems, the worst drawbacks of siloed systems
could be mitigated.
This next stage in the financial system’s journey will be one that combines the
best efforts of both the private and public sectors. Central banks could work with
regulated private entities to develop technological solutions and standards to meet
specific use cases. With their public interest mandate, central banks are best placed
to establish a common venue for each use case by interlinking with the monetary
system. Proper oversight and supervision will be a prerequisite for this endeavour.
In embracing evolution and change, central banks and the private sector should
follow key guiding principles to ensure that the monetary system harnesses innovation
for the public interest. First, the tried and tested division of roles between the public
and private sector in the two-tiered system remains the cornerstone. The second
principle is upholding a competitive level playing field that promotes innovation and
financial inclusion. And third, the future monetary system needs to meet the highest
standards of data security and privacy, while ensuring system integrity by guarding
against illicit activity such as money laundering, financing of terrorism and fraud.
The rest of the chapter introduces the concept of tokenisation and how it could
be mobilised in the design of key elements of the future monetary system: central

bank digital currencies, tokenised deposits and tokenised claims on financial and real
assets. The chapter then proposes unified ledgers to integrate these components
seamlessly. Concrete examples show how this kind of integration could improve the
old and enable the new. The final section discusses high-level guiding principles on
scope, governance, incentives for participation, operational resilience and privacy.

Tokenising money and assets
The blueprint for the future monetary system rests on several key concepts
surrounding tokenisation.

Tokenisation basics
Traditional ledger systems and tokenised systems operate under fundamentally
different rules. In traditional ledger systems, account managers are entrusted with
maintaining and updating an accurate record of ownership. In contrast, in a tokenised
setting, money or assets become “executable objects” that are maintained on
programmable platforms. They could be transferred through the execution of
programming instructions issued by system participants without the intervention of
an account manager. While tokenisation does not eliminate the role of intermediaries,
it changes the nature of that role. The role of the operator in a tokenised environment
is as a trusted intermediary serving in a governance role as the rule book’s curator,
rather than as a bookkeeper who records individual transactions on behalf of account
holders.
The claims traded on programmable platforms are called tokens. Tokens are not
merely digital entries in a database. Rather, they integrate the records of the
underlying asset normally found in a traditional database with the rules and logic
governing the transfer process for that asset (Graph 1). Hence, whereas in traditional
systems the rules that govern the updating of asset ownership are usually common to
all assets, tokens can be customised to meet specific user or regulatory requirements
that apply to individual assets. We discuss in a later section how this dual nature of
tokens could be used to good effect in a supervisory and compliance setting by

directly embedding supervisory features into the token itself, which can be tailored
to specific rules.
Tokenisation – the process of recording claims on financial or real assets that exist
on a traditional ledger on a programmable platform – introduces two important
capabilities. First, by dispensing with messaging and the reliance on account managers
to update records, it provides greater scope for composability, whereby several
actions are bundled into one executable package. Second, it enables the contingent
performance of actions through smart contracts, ie logical statements such as “if,
then, or else”. By combining composability and contingency, tokenisation makes the
conditional performance of actions more readily attainable, even quite complex ones.5
This chapter examines several use cases of such contingent performance of
actions. One is in the design of supply chains in which several participants interact
under uncertainty and with incentives that may not be perfectly aligned. Another
example is the design of banking deposit contracts where built-in contingencies that
depend on the actions of other depositors alter the incentives of depositors to be a
first mover in a bank run setting. Such contingent deposit contracts could nullify the
so-called first-mover advantage.
Many interesting real-world applications require the tokenisation of assets that
currently exist in traditional databases. These assets could range from financial
securities whose ownership is recorded in securities depositories to real assets, such
as commodities or real estate. The tokenisation process for such assets occurs
through so-called ramps that define a mapping between assets in traditional databases
and their counterparts in tokenised form (Graph 2). The assets in the traditional
database are immobilised or “locked” to serve as collateral that backs the tokens
issued on the programmable platform. The locking of assets ensures that the transfer Restricted
of their tokenised counterparts guarantees the transfer of the underlying assets.

Central bank digital currency and private tokenised monies
The full potential of tokenisation needs a monetary unit of account that denominates
transactions, as well as the accompanying means of payment. In crypto, stablecoins
that reside on the same platform as other crypto assets perform the role of the means

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

89

of payment. However, for reasons highlighted already, central bank money and the
settlement finality that it brings is a much firmer foundation for tokenisation.6 The
full potential of tokenisation is therefore best harnessed by having central bank
money reside on the same venue as other tokenised claims. This is because
programmable transactions could incorporate settlement using the economy’s unit
of account as an essential part of the tokenised arrangement.
For this reason, the development of a wholesale CBDC is core to the functioning
of a tokenised environment. As a tokenised means of settlement, wholesale CBDCs
would serve a similar role as reserves in the current system, but with the added
functionalities enabled by tokenisation. Transactions in wholesale CBDC could
incorporate all the features such as the composability and contingent performance
of the actions mentioned above. The BIS Innovation Hub, in partnership with central
banks around the world, stands at the forefront of experimentation with CBDCs and
tokenisation (Box A).
Enhanced digital representations of central bank money could include a retail
variant open to use by ordinary users. A retail CBDC is a digital version of physical
cash that can be used by households and firms for everyday transactions. By
providing the public with a ready way to convert alternative private digital monies
into digital cash, ie a direct link to the sovereign unit of account in digital form, the
central bank would further support singleness.7
While the role of CBDCs in a tokenised environment is clear, there is greater
room for debate concerning the appropriate form of private tokenised money that
complements CBDCs. There are currently two main candidates for private tokenised
monies: tokenised deposits and asset-backed stablecoins.8 Both represent liabilities
of the issuer, who promises customers that they can redeem their claims at par value
in the sovereign unit of account. However, tokenised deposits and asset-backed
stablecoins differ in how they are transferred and in their role in the financial system.
These differences have implications for their attributes as a tokenised form of money
that complements CBDCs.
Tokenised deposits could be designed to resemble the workings of regular bank
deposits in the current system; see McLaughlin (2021). They could be issued by
commercial banks and represent a claim on the issuer. Like regular deposits, they
would not be directly transferable. Central banks’ liquidity provision for settlement
would continue to ensure smooth functioning of payments.
To bring out the parallels between tokenised deposits and conventional deposits
in the current system, consider how a payment is made currently, using deposit
balances. When John makes a payment of GBP 100 to Paul, Paul does not receive a
GBP 100 deposit at John’s bank. Rather, John’s account balance at his bank is reduced
by GBP 100, while Paul’s balance at his bank increases by the same amount.
Meanwhile, the adjustments in the individual accounts at the two banks are matched
by a transfer in central bank reserves between the two banks. The same payment
outcome could be achieved in a tokenised world by reducing John’s tokenised
deposit holding at his bank and increasing Paul’s tokenised deposit holding at his,
while simultaneously settling the payment through a concurrent transfer of wholesale
CBDC (Graph 3). Paul continues to have a claim only on his bank, where he is a verified
customer, and has no claim on John’s bank, nor on John.
Tokenised deposits would not only preserve but at times enhance some key
advantages of the current two-tier monetary system.
First, tokenised deposits would help preserve the singleness of money. In the
current system, singleness of money for payments involving commercial bank deposits
is achieved because central banks operate settlement infrastructures that guarantee
the ultimate transfer of payments at par value in terms of the sovereign unit of
account. Tokenised deposits would preserve this arrangement. However, the fact that

Experiments with wholesale central bank digital currencies and tokenisation

The BIS Innovation Hub stands at the forefront of experimentation with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
and tokenised assets (Table A1). The work includes projects within and across jurisdictions and in multiple
currencies, often in partnership with the private sector.
Experiments with CBDCs1 have shown that tokenisation can reduce the complexity of securities settlement
by facilitating simpler and more direct holding systems, as shown in Project Helvetia. The findings from
Helvetia also suggest that using wholesale CBDC, as opposed to linking real-time gross settlement systems to
a financial infrastructure, could provide greater scope for future innovation and efficiency gains in the
settlement process. In this context, tokenisation facilitates increased automation through the use of smart
contracts. It can speed up settlement as tokenised assets typically settle automatically, ie both legs of a
transaction settle simultaneously and instantly. Tokenisation also increases operational transparency, as shown
in Projects Jura, Dunbar and mBridge. These three completed wholesale CBDC projects focus on use cases
where CBDCs were transferred against either another CBDC (payment versus payment, PvP) or tokenised
securities (delivery versus payment, DvP). While systems exist to cater to both cross-border PvP and DvP,
coverage is not universal in terms of currencies and jurisdictions, and costs are often deemed too high for
universal usage. These projects were able to offer new solutions to long-standing operational challenges and
policy questions. For example, in Project Jura, subnetworks allow the platform to respect jurisdictional boundaries
and data location requirements and notaries allow central banks to control and monitor transactions in their
currencies both in terms of payments and PvP settlements. Moreover, programmability allows new types of
contingent payment, while certain policy measures (eg capital controls) can be built in from the start.
Beyond CBDCs, other projects have explored the practical and technological complexities of tokenised
assets in the context of green finance (Project Genesis) and trade finance (Project Dynamo).

settlement in wholesale CBDC is automatically triggered through smart contracts
would improve the immediacy of the current process, further narrowing time gaps to
reduce risks.
Second, payments in tokenised deposits settled in wholesale CBDC would ensure
finality. By using its own balance sheet as the ultimate means of settlement, the
central bank provides the means for ensuring the finality of wholesale payments. As
the trusted intermediary, it is the central bank that debits the account of the payer

and credits the account of the payee, after which the payment is final and irrevocable.
In the above example, finality ensures that Paul does not have a claim on John (or
John’s bank), but on his bank only.
Third, tokenised deposits would ensure that banks could continue to offer credit
and liquidity in a flexible way. In the current two-tiered monetary system, banks
provide individuals and firms with loans and on-demand access to liquidity through,
for example, credit lines. Most of the money that circulates in the monetary system
today is created in this way. This is in large part possible because the recipients of
credit can simultaneously hold deposit accounts at banks, allowing banks to create
deposits when making a loan.9 Unlike narrow banking models, this flexibility allows
banks to adjust to the needs of firms and households in the light of changing
economic or financial conditions. Of course, adequate regulation and supervision
are required to prevent excessive credit growth and risk-taking.
Stablecoins are an alternative form of private tokenised money, but they have
important shortcomings.10 In contrast to tokenised deposits, stablecoins represent a
transferrable claim on the issuer, akin to a digital bearer instrument. A payment using
stablecoins transfers the issuer’s liability from one holder to another. Imagine that
John holds 1 stablecoin unit (SCU) issued by a stablecoin issuer. When John pays Paul
SCU 1, John’s claim on the stablecoin issuer is transferred to Paul, who did not have a
claim on that issuer before the transfer. There is no need to update the stablecoin
issuer’s balance sheet, and there is no settlement on the central bank’s balance sheet.
Whoever holds the instrument has a claim on the issuer and can transfer it without
the need for consent or involvement of the issuer. In this case, Paul is left with a claim
on an issuer he may not trust.
As stablecoins are tradable, their prices can deviate from par, thus undermining
the singleness of money. Deviations from singleness can occur if there are differences
in liquidity across stablecoins or if variations in the quality of the backing or
characteristics of the issuer lead to differences in the perceived creditworthiness of
different issuers. Even higher-order uncertainty can arise, such as that associated with

doubts about whether others harbour doubts about the value of a stablecoin, which
can lead to discounting and hence undermine singleness.11 For these reasons, as well
as the absence of a clear regulatory and supervisory framework and the lack of a
central bank as a lender of last resort, there have been multiple recent episodes where
stablecoin prices have lost their pegs (Graph 4).
Asset-backed stablecoins also do not allow for the elastic provision of a general
means of payment. Any dollar against which a stablecoin is issued should be, at least
in principle, invested directly in safe and liquid assets. Stablecoins thus reduce the
overall supply of liquid assets that are available for other purposes.12 Even if well
regulated and supervised, stablecoin issuers would operate like narrow banks.
Finally, tokenised deposits have advantages over stablecoins in terms of
compliance with know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and
combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) rules. Going back to the example above,
Paul holds the liability of the stablecoin issuer after the transfer from John. But the
issuer did not perform any identity verification or compliance check on Paul, which
creates a risk of fraud. To ensure compliance with KYC, AML and CFT regulation for
stablecoins, a significant regulatory overhaul would be necessary.13 In contrast,
tokenised deposits, by closely resembling the traditional deposit transfer process,
could leverage the existing regulatory and supervisory frameworks for financial
institutions.

Achieving seamless interoperability through unified ledgers
The potential of tokenisation lies in its ability to knit together transactions and
operations that encompass money and a range of other assets that reside on the

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

programmable platform. Money in tokenised form provides the essential means of
payment that mirror the underlying economic transactions. At the heart of the system
lies central bank money in tokenised form that facilitates settlement finality.
This section outlines the concept of a unified ledger where central bank digital
currencies, private tokenised monies and other tokenised assets coexist on the same
programmable platform. In simple terms, a unified ledger could be considered a
“common venue” where money and other tokenised objects come together to enable
seamless integration of transactions and to open the door to entirely new types of
economic arrangement.
The concept of a unified ledger does not mean “one ledger to rule them all” – a
sole ledger that overshadows all other systems in the economy. Depending on the
needs of each jurisdiction, multiple ledgers, each with a specific use case, could
coexist. APIs could connect these ledgers to each other and existing systems (Box B).
Over time, they could incorporate new functions or merge as overlaps in scope
expand. The scope of a unified ledger would also determine the parties involved in
each ledger’s governance arrangements.
While the creation of a unified ledger would require the introduction of a new
type of financial market infrastructure (FMI), some of the envisaged benefits could

Connecting ledgers through application programming interfaces

Box B

A unified ledger combines tokenised money and assets on a common platform. By doing so, it enables
programmability, composability and multi-asset atomic settlement. On the road to a unified ledger, an
intermediate solution would be to integrate legacy systems and existing infrastructures with new
programmable platforms through application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs can interconnect systems
and implement ramps that lock assets in traditional ledgers and unlock them in programmable platforms. If
well designed, APIs may guarantee settlement finality as conventionally defined (CPSS-IOSCO (2012)).
However, because APIs involve multiple systems with different operators and protocols, API implementations
cannot achieve atomic settlement. Graph B1 shows three different models that range from the smallest
incremental enhancement to a fully fledged unified ledger.
In the first model, an API connects the existing payment system to a programmable platform that
contains only a limited number of asset classes (Graph B1.A). The programmable platform does not contain
tokenised private monies or central bank digital currency (CBDC). Clearing and settlement of payments are
achieved using traditional accounts at banks and via the conventional settlement system (eg a real-time gross
settlement system). A set of APIs coordinate workflows by sending and receiving messages across systems.
The operators from both systems establish the standards for APIs. Settlement finality is achieved in the usual
way. However, in this model, atomic settlement involving transactions with private monies, central bank money
and other assets would not be feasible.
In the second model (Graph B1.B), the programmable platform contains tokenised private monies and
tokenised assets, and APIs connect these to the central bank’s settlement infrastructure.1 The platform contains
no partition for the central bank. Tokenised private money partitions are connected to traditional systems
through APIs and smart contracts. These contracts contain rules that ensure that the updating of accounts
across participants is accompanied by settlement in central bank money in the traditional settlement system,
which is triggered through APIs. This model guarantees atomic settlement for private monies and other assets,
but not for transactions that involve CBDC.
In the third model (Graph B1.C), wholesale CBDC, tokenised private monies and tokenised assets coexist
on a fully fledged unified ledger. Wholesale CBDCs could be provided in two ways. In the first, CBDCs may
take the form of a central bank liability that is issued directly on to the unified ledger. Alternatively, the central
bank could tokenise existing reserves using an API that connects the unified ledger to the current reserve
system. This system supports settlement finality and atomic settlement for transactions involving wholesale
CBDC, private tokenised monies and tokenised assets.

The latter approach is being adopted in the Brazilian Digital Real pilot project (Central Bank of Brazil (2023)).

also be reaped through more incremental changes to existing systems and
interlinking them through APIs into a network of networks. Weighing the pros and
cons of a big leap against those of a series of incremental changes is important when
considering innovation of any kind but it is especially important for the large discrete
changes entailed by new infrastructures such as a unified ledger. Some automated
processes for exchanging data that resemble operations in tokenised environments
could be achieved by connecting existing systems through APIs. In the short term,
modifying existing systems would require lower upfront costs and less coordination
among stakeholders than creating a unified ledger.
Yet history shows that incremental fixes have their limits, especially when they
accumulate on top of legacy systems. Each new layer would need to look forwards
while being constrained by having to look backwards to ensure compatibility with
legacy systems. These constraints will become more binding as more layers are added
on top, eventually holding back innovative developments. The history of computing
and software is replete with such examples.14
For these reasons, it is often the case that harnessing the benefits of technological
advances necessitates a fundamental rethink of the financial infrastructure that
supports new types of operation. Tokenisation presents another such opportunity,
where the introduction of programmable platforms could bring long-term benefits
that far outweigh the short-term costs arising from investment as well as the costs
and coordination efforts in shifting to new standards and procedures. Of course, the
relative balance between the benefits of a unified ledger and those from interlinking
existing systems through APIs will depend on the state of technology and the specific
needs of each jurisdiction. There is no one size fits all.

The building blocks of a unified ledger
A unified ledger leverages the benefits of tokenisation on a common platform. Based
on a secure environment for storing and sharing data through encryption, it could
enable new forms of transaction, thus expanding the universe of contracting outcomes.
There are two key aspects to the design of a unified ledger. The first is that it
combines all the components needed to complete a transaction on one platform,
ie it has everything in one place. The second is that it features money and assets as
executable objects, which means they could be transferred safely and securely
without going through external authentication and verification processes and without
relying on external messaging systems.
The structure of a unified ledger can be described in terms of the following
building blocks (Graph 5). The ledger comprises a data environment and an
execution environment, which are subject to a common governance framework. The
data environment contains the digital representations of money and assets in
separate partitions that are owned and operated by the respective competent
operating entities (dashed lines). The data environment also includes information
necessary for the operation of the ledger, such as the data required for the secure
and legal transfer of money and assets. The data environment also encompasses all
information necessary to incorporate real-world events into any contingent
performance of actions. Information can be a direct result of transactions on the
ledger or may be obtained from the outside environment.15
Any operation involving one or more of these elements is carried out in the
execution environment, either directly by users or through smart contracts. For each
specific application, operations in the execution environment combine only the
intermediaries and assets required for each application. For example, a payment
between two individuals, executed via a smart contract, would bring together the
users’ banks (as providers of tokenised deposits) and the central bank (as provider

The unified ledger comprises its data and execution environments as well as the rules, standards and governance applying to those
environments. The data environment contains money, assets and information (internal or external to the ledger). Each of these includes
partitions (denoted by dashed lines) delineating ownership and/or access by the relevant entities. Operations involving one or more of these
elements are carried out in the execution environment, either directly by users or through smart contracts. The lock indicates that some
operations may be performed on confidential encrypted data.

of CBDC). Should the payment be conditional on some real-world contingency, that
information would also be included.
The common governance framework specifies the rules and standards of how
the different components interact in the execution environment, as well as which
privacy rules apply. Preserving strict confidentiality is a prerequisite if a unified ledger

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

97

is to be a practical proposition. Confidentiality and data control are achieved in two
mutually reinforcing ways: data partitions and data encryption (denoted with a lock
in the execution environment). Partitions guarantee that data and information are
visible and accessible to only the respective authorised parties for each partitioned
domain, ensuring strict confidentiality. At the same time, cryptographic techniques
could ensure that data can be shared confidentially as inputs in the execution
environment. The details are discussed in the following sections.

Use cases: improving the old
While the monetary system has served society well, its current design could lead to
the emergence of pinch points. Digital money currently sits at the edges of
communication networks, where it resides in siloed proprietary databases operated
by banks and non‑banks. External messaging systems are required to link these
databases. The separation of messaging, reconciliation and settlement can lead to
delays and means that participants often have an incomplete view of completed
actions. Consequently, errors may go undetected for longer, leading to higher error
resolution costs and increased operational risk. For these reasons, payment processes
can be costly, cumbersome, slow and opaque. And they can fall short of meeting
users’ changing demands.
The complexity and lack of transparency in existing payment systems is evident
even in a simple payment involving customers of two different banks (Box C). A
transfer of funds from payer to payee involves a large number of messages, internal
checks and adjustments. Participants generally cannot track the progress of their
payments in real time. In particular, the payee does not see when the process is
initiated, and the payer does not know when it is completed.16
The payment process is even more complex in cross-border transactions, further
amplifying frictions. For one, these require international messaging systems on top
of domestic ones. Differences in operating hours and/or holidays as well as
inconsistencies across operating systems, for example in the form of different
messaging standards, can lead to further delays, increasing settlement risk. In
addition, the involvement of more intermediaries (eg correspondent banks) increases
operational risk. For cross-border payments involving different currencies, there is
also foreign exchange (FX) settlement risk, namely the risk that one party to a
currency trade fails to deliver the currency owed.17
A unified ledger could improve the way payments are executed. Having private
tokenised monies and CBDC on the same platform eliminates the need for the
sequential messages across siloed databases. This enables so-called atomic settlement,
in which two assets are exchanged simultaneously, such that the transfer of one
occurs only upon transfer of the other.18 In the process, settlement, ie the wholesale
leg of the payment from one intermediary to another, also occurs instantaneously in
wholesale CBDC.19 At the same time, the use of a partitioned data environment with
appropriate access controls allows full transparency for the transacting parties, while
keeping the transaction private from those who are not involved. Finally, by
combining messaging and payment rails on the same platform, the ledger eliminates
delays in the payment process, thereby mitigating settlement risk.
Securities settlement could benefit greatly from execution on a unified ledger.
The current process for securities settlement involves multiple parties, such as
brokers, custodians, central securities depositories, clearing houses and registrars.
Accordingly, there is a need for various messaging instructions, money flows and
reconciliation procedures, all of which lengthen the process, increase the costs and
expose parties to additional risks. By bringing tokenised money and securities
together on a programmable platform, some of these risks could be mitigated by

98

Messaging in a standard person-to-person wire transfer

Box C

Messaging that governs digital money is currently located at the edges of communication networks and
money transfers involve multiple messages through third-party messaging systems. At each step of the
process, participants often have only a limited view of the completed actions.
The complexity and lack of transparency in existing payment systems can be illustrated with a simple
example of a wire transfer from Alice to Bob (Graph C1). The process begins with Alice sending a payment
request to her bank using the bank’s mobile app (step 1). Bank A responds by debiting Alice’s account by the
transfer amount together with any fees (step 2) and sending a payment order to the settlement system (step 3).
The settlement system debits Bank A’s settlement account and credits Bank B’s account (step 4) and sends an
advice of credit with a reference number to Bank B (step 5). There follows an acknowledgement with a reference
number to Bank A (step 6). Bank B must ensure Bob has an account and perform any know‑your‑customer or
anti-money laundering checks (step 7). If any of these checks fail, then Bank B will need to send a reversal
request to the settlement institution (potential step 8a shown in light grey). Otherwise, Bank B credits Bob’s
account (step 8b) and sends a message to Bob notifying him of the adjustment to his account (step 9).
In some payment systems Bank B must accept the transfer by Bank A before it takes place. In this case,
steps 5 and 7 come before step 4. It is also worth emphasising that in the description provided in Graph C1,
Alice is not notified that Bob has received the transfer. This can be achieved through additional messages Restricted
from Bank B to the settlement system (step 10), from the settlement system to Bank A (step 11), and then with
a final confirmation message from Bank A to Alice (step 12). These steps appear in light grey in Graph C1 to
show that they are not common to all systems.

shortening settlement lags and obviating the need for messaging and reconciliation.
Moreover, the simultaneous execution of the delivery and payment legs could
expand the scope of securities covered in delivery-versus-payment (DvP) arrangements,
further contributing to risk mitigation. Box D discusses this possibility in more detail.
Another important use case is the mitigation of settlement risk in the
multi‑trillion dollar FX market. Existing netting and payment-versus-payment (PvP)
mechanisms help to mitigate settlement risk, but do not fully eliminate it, not least
as existing PvP arrangements are at times unavailable, unsuitable for some trades
or deemed too costly by market participants.20 Atomic settlement around the clock,
instead, could eliminate settlement lags. Moreover, smart contracts that combine
currencies with authorised FX providers could allow more currencies to be
integrated on a common platform at a lower cost, expanding the scope of PvP
arrangements.

Streamlining securities settlement through a unified ledger

Box D

Today, the process of trading securities and settling securities transactions involves multiple parties, with a
myriad of messaging instructions, reconciliation efforts and money flows involved (Graph D1). Central
securities depositories (CSDs) electronically manage securities either directly or indirectly (eg through a
custodian) for the security’s beneficial owner. A securities buyer or seller initiates the process by instructing her
broker or custodian to initiate the trade. During the time between trading and final settlement (the “settlement
cycle”, which can take up to two days), parties are exposed to replacement cost risk (ie the risk of a trade
failing to settle and having to be replaced at an unfavourable price). In addition, during the settlement process
itself, counterparties are exposed to principal risk (ie the risk that one counterparty does not fulfil the
agreement – failing either to pay or to deliver the security). The CSD must verify the identity of account
holders and ensures reconciliation and confirmation of what is being settled with the relevant third parties
(eg clearing agents).
A unified ledger could reduce these risks by reducing the number of counterparties and shortening
confirmation and reconciliation times. If both tokenised money and securities are hosted on a common
platform, the risks and costs that arise from having them reside in separate ledgers can be reduced
substantially. The simultaneous execution of the delivery and payment legs could also expand the scope of
securities covered in delivery-versus-payment (DvP) arrangements, helping to mitigate principal risk between Restricted
counterparties. Appropriate liquidity saving mechanisms would need to be instituted, as atomic settlement
also puts higher liquidity demands on the system – much like the move from deferred net settlement to
real‑time gross settlement.

A stylised example of the securities settlement process and the unified ledger

Use cases: enabling the new
Beyond improving existing processes, a unified ledger could open the door to entirely
new types of “arrangements and transactions” that expand the universe of possible
contracting outcomes. This is made possible through the combination of smart
contracts, a secure and confidential environment for storing and sharing information
and the execution of transactions enabled by tokenisation.
Smart contracts increase the scope for successful coordination. In many
instances, mutually beneficial outcomes cannot be achieved when participants need
to undertake costly joint efforts. The reason is that individual participants may have

100

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

Graph D1

an incentive to free ride on the contribution of others. Contingent performance
promises to overcome such coordination problems. For example, a smart contract
could specify that each participant contributes only a certain amount to a joint
venture if all other participants also contribute. This way, free-riding is eliminated.
Overcoming coordination problems may be particularly useful in the context of
banking, where the use of contingency in term deposit contracts could contribute to
the stability of bank funding and the banking sector more generally. Typically, term
deposit contracts are bilateral arrangements between the bank and the depositor. Yet
from time to time, the value of deposits can depend on the collective decisions of all
depositors, especially during stress periods in the banking sector. In this context,
strategic uncertainty arises as early withdrawals are met on a first-come, first-served
basis, while the bank invests funds in illiquid assets. Depositors who withdraw first
thus have an advantage and this can lead to bank runs. This problem could be
mitigated by allowing explicit coordination through the design of new types of
deposit contracts that impose contingent performance of actions on depositors.
Such contracts could ensure that early withdrawers do no better than late
withdrawers, thus eliminating the motivation to withdraw funds purely out of fear
that others might do the same. This type of arrangement would not prevent all
potential types of run from occurring, but it could mitigate the textbook case of
first‑mover advantage and coordination failures.
Supply chains are another possible use case that would make full use of a unified
ledger’s capabilities to incorporate real-time information into smart contracts. The
problem of supply chain financing has been a notoriously difficult one to solve in
real-world settings. Supply chain financing has attributes of a DvP problem as
explained below, but one which also features uncertainty and information
asymmetries about the underlying state of the world.
Graph 6 depicts a stylised supply chain. A buyer (usually a large firm) purchases
goods from suppliers (often small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs), which in
turn require goods from other suppliers for production. A common problem is that
the buyer would prefer to pay for the goods only once delivered. However, suppliers
need to pay their workers and purchase materials to produce the goods beforehand. Restricted
They thus require some form of financing until they receive payment from the buyer.

For well known reasons, including the risk that the buyer will not pay upon delivery,
obtaining trade credit usually requires firms to pledge collateral.21 For example, an
SME in Italy might expect delivery of intermediate goods via ship from its Indian
supplier in one month’s time. To set up production now, it can pledge these goods as
collateral to obtain a loan from a bank or its suppliers. Should the company default,
the creditor can reclaim the collateral. However, creditors might be reluctant to
provide sufficient credit or charge a prohibitively high interest rate, as the collateral
might lose value due to pirate attacks or storm damage to the ship. The firm might
also engage in fraudulent behaviour and try to pledge the collateral to different
parties simultaneously, which is common in trade finance.22 These frictions to
obtaining financing imply that suppliers often have to rely on their own funds to
meet their working capital needs.
By combining the different components of the supply chain relationships and the
steps of the financing process in one place, a unified ledger could mitigate the
problems plaguing trade finance. Contracts that formalise the conditional
performance of actions could eliminate incentive problems. Smart contracts could
specify an automatic payment from the buyer to its suppliers upon delivery of goods,
or partial early payment when intermediate steps are reached. This way, creditors
would not need to worry about the risk that the buyer will not honour its obligations.
Banks could extend loans featuring smart contracts that act upon real-time
information on shipments provided by internet-of-things (IoT) devices, such as GPS
data. In the above example, the interest rate could automatically fall, or additional
credit be granted, once the ship passed the Horn of Africa, a notoriously high-risk
area for piracy. This way, suppliers could finance part of their working capital needs
as early as the production phase. Finally, because all trade finance contracts would be
written on a shared ledger, it would be impossible to write duplicate loan contracts
tied to the same collateral, which would further enhance lenders’ willingness to
extend credit to firms.
In addition, by providing a secure and confidential environment for storing
and sharing information, the ledger could harness the benefits of data to lower the
cost of and improve access to credit. The use of data can bring both benefits and
costs. Data allow lenders to better assess the riskiness of borrowers, reducing both
costs and the need for collateral. For example, lending by big techs, which use big
data and machine learning to assess credit risk, is less sensitive to changes in real
estate collateral values than bank credit (Graph 7.A).23 But network effects can lead
to market concentration and ultimately higher costs for households and firms: the
analysis of large troves of data enhances existing services and attracts further users,
which in turn create new data, leading to a data-network-activities or “DNA”
loop.24 Moreover, privacy concerns can make individuals reluctant to share their data.
With data-sharing technologies (discussed below), mathematical computations can
be performed directly on encrypted or anonymised data. Users hence retain control
over their data when sharing them on the ledger. Through improved data-sharing
arrangements, the unified ledger could enhance financial inclusion, in particular
among disadvantaged segments of the population such as racial minorities and
low‑income households. These “thin credit file” applicants stand to benefit
disproportionately from screening via non-traditional data: as banks’ traditional
credit scores are noisier indicators of their default risk than for other groups of the
population, additional data yield a more precise signal of their credit quality
(Graph 7.B).25 In turn, lenders can offer loans at lower rates.
Through encryption technology, a unified ledger could also enable new ways to
enforce AML and CFT requirements. Financial institutions safeguard highly sensitive
and proprietary data that often need to be kept confidential by law. However, the
inability to share such sensitive data without exposing confidential information can

hinder efforts to combat money laundering and other illicit activities. The use of a
unified ledger could provide transparent and auditable records of transactions,
transfers and ownership changes. Encryption methods allow financial institutions to
share these data confidentially with each other and across borders to detect fraud
and money laundering while remaining compliant with domestic data regulations.
These benefits could be further enhanced by leveraging tokenisation and the
dual nature of tokens encompassing both identifying information and the rules
governing transfer. In the case of payments, for example, supervisory compliance
requirements that depend, among other things, on the transacting parties, their
location and the type of transfer could be directly embedded into the token.26 While
not undertaken in the context of a unified ledger, the BIS Innovation Hub’s Project
Aurora is exploring how privacy-enhancing technologies and advanced analytics might
be leveraged to combat money laundering across financial institutions and borders.
The combination of smart contracts, information and tokenisation could also
improve the issuance of and investment in securitised assets and bonds. One
example is mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which pool mortgage loans into
tranches of debt that are subsequently purchased by investors. Yet even in the deeply
liquid $12 trillion US MBS market, the process of securitisation involves over a dozen
intermediaries.27 Automation through smart contracts could eliminate time lags in
information and payment flows, streamlining the securitisation process. A token
could integrate real-time data on borrower repayments and how they are pooled
and distributed to investors, further reducing the need for intermediaries.
Another use case is in green finance. The BIS Innovation Hub’s Project Genesis
illustrates some of the benefits of tokenisation and smart contracts. The project
involves a platform from which an investor can download an app and invest any
amount into tokenised government bonds that fund a green investment. Over the
bond’s life cycle, smart contracts allow the investor not only to see accrued interest,
but also to track in real time how much clean energy is being generated and how far

BIS Annual Economic Report 2023

103

carbon emissions are being reduced as a result of the investment. Moreover, the
investor can sell the bond in a transparent secondary market.
Taken together, these examples show how applications of the unified ledger
have the potential to enhance the current monetary and financial system. For
existing processes, a unified ledger could seamlessly automate and integrate
transactions. And by leveraging the benefits of tokenisation and providing a secure
environment for sharing data, a unified ledger could enable altogether new types of
transaction.

Guiding principles for a unified ledger
Any application of the unified ledger concept should adhere to a number of high‑level
guiding principles. First and foremost, any application should be fully integrated with
the two-tiered structure of the monetary system. In this way, the central bank could
continue to support the singleness of money by providing settlement in wholesale
CBDC, and the private sector could continue to innovate to the benefit of households
and firms. In addition, there are important principles related to its scope and
governance. These will specify how best to ensure a level playing field and foster
competition, as well as how to ensure data privacy and operational resilience. The
concrete implementation of these principles ultimately depends on the needs and
preferences of each jurisdiction as well as the details of the specific application.

Scope, governance and competition
The first important question regards the scope of the ledger. As discussed above, the
concept of a unified ledger does not exclude a multiplicity of coexisting ledgers, each
with a specific use case. In practice, the concept is likely to be applied first to specific
applications where benefits are more immediate (Box E). For example, one ledger
could aim at improving securities settlement, involving only the relevant parties, while
another could pertain to trade finance in, say, the shipping industry. Starting from
specific use cases, the ledger’s scope could expand over time as it includes additional
assets and entities. Ultimately, the scope of the ledger will depend on the specific
needs and constraints of each jurisdiction.
Irrespective of its scope, a unified ledger would effectively be a new type of FMI
or a combination of multiple FMIs. As such, a natural starting point for drawing up
standards would be the Principles for financial market infrastructures,28 which, in
addition to setting out requirements for access, safety and operational resilience, state
that FMIs should provide clear and certain final settlement (Principle 8) in central
bank money where practical and available (Principle 9). These principles apply to a
wide range of infrastructures such as payments systems, central securities depositories,
securities settlement systems, central counterparties and trade repositories.
The scope of the ledger has direct implications for its governance arrangements,
competitive design and the incentives to participate.
Governance of a unified ledger could follow existing arrangements, whereby
central banks and regulated private participants take part in governance under
established rules. For example, when money and payments are involved on a ledger,
the central bank will necessarily play a role as the provider of the ultimate settlement
asset. Its specific involvement in governance arrangements could take various forms,
much as it does in the case of traditional payment systems, where public ownership,
regulation and oversight, as well as private mutual ownership are all viable
options.29 To ensure integrity, regulated and supervised private participants should
remain in charge of customer-facing activities. They should also adhere to established

104

The tokenisation continuum

Box E

Tokenisation – the process of recording claims on real or financial assets that exist on a traditional ledger on a
programmable platform – needs to overcome several economic, legal and technical challenges.
An intrinsic feature of many markets is economic friction generated by uncertainty and misaligned
incentives, which can be mitigated by trusted intermediaries. For example, when a bank makes a loan to a
non-financial firm, the borrower knows more about the quality of its project and the effort devoted to it. To
ensure that funds are put to their intended use, lenders need to screen the quality of the borrower ex ante
and monitor performance ex post. Technology alone is unlikely to overcome these market imperfections,
leaving a role for intermediaries to screen borrowers.
Tokenisation efforts must also address legal issues. Rules and regulations governing tokenised assets must
be aligned with those of their non-tokenised counterparts, which requires regulatory coordination to prevent
unintended consequences such as shadow activities, theft and regulatory arbitrage. This task is easier for
assets subject to legal frameworks and regulations that are standardised and can be easily translated into a
computer algorithm. Broader issues include those pertaining to investor and consumer protection, cyber
security and regulatory compliance across borders.
There are also technical challenges, especially in the design of ramps that map assets on traditional ledger
systems to their tokenised counterparts. Ramps lock assets in their platform of origin as collateral for the
tokens that are issued on the programmable platform. Locking and unlocking the original assets requires
seamless interaction and coordination across systems. For example, to lock a property on a platform, the
on‑ramp would need to ensure that the property is no longer tradable outside the platform. As property titles
are kept in disparate local registries, full automation could be difficult without the involvement of (offline)
intermediaries. Generally, the feasibility of on-ramping and the associated benefits on the programmable
platform will depend on the level of automation and harmonisation of the systems of origin.
As discussed in a recent BIS study, these aspects define a tokenisation continuum (Graph E1).1 It
highlights a trade-off: for those applications where tokenisation is easiest, per-unit gains are likely to be Restricted
modest; but the gains are likely to be largest for applications where tokenisation is most difficult. Therefore,
in the short term, tokenisation could focus on identifying assets that are suitable for tokenisation and traded
in large volumes.

KYC, AML and CFT regulations, as well as perform ongoing due diligence to ensure
compliance with privacy regulations.
The demands on governance arrangements increase with the scope of the ledger.
For example, a unified ledger for cross-border payments would require seamless
interoperability across private payment service providers (PSPs) and central banks
located in various jurisdictions with different regulatory and supervisory frameworks.
It would hence require significant harmonisation efforts across jurisdictions. A ledger

105

that targets domestic securities settlement, on the other hand, would require less
intensive coordination efforts.
An open and level playing field is important for competition and financial
inclusion. From a public policy perspective, it is critical to consider how the
introduction of a common platform may affect the industrial organisation of money
and payments, and ultimately of the entire financial system. Promoting healthy
competition between private actors through open platforms can foster innovation
and lower costs for end users by reducing rents. By designing platforms and
attendant regulations with these goals in mind, public authorities can help ensure
that network effects work for the benefit of consumers. To this end, the use of
encryption techniques such as homomorphic encryption could help prevent the
concentration of data within centralised entities, and hence the emergence of
dominant players.
An important challenge in promoting competition is providing the right
economic incentives for potential participants. Without the right incentives, PSPs
might decide not to join. Efforts to centralise over-the-counter (OTC) bond markets
offer valuable lessons.30 Trading government bonds on an exchange, as opposed to
over the counter, can lead to lower costs through improved matching and greater
liquidity, especially during stress periods.31 However, high entry and operating costs
or benefits from established investor-dealer relationships can deter some players
from joining. As the main players in OTC markets, dealers also often enjoy market
power and high profits, which can make them reluctant to join a common
platform.32 But unless a sufficient number of players join, there may be insufficient
liquidity and virtuous network effects cannot take hold. The experience from the
introduction of fast payment systems suggests that mandating participation while
simultaneously providing an infrastructure that allows for private sector innovation
can be key to ensuring adoption.33 Once the benefits of network effects unfold, new
players will join voluntarily.34

Data privacy and operational resilience
By bringing together money, assets and information on a common platform, a unified
ledger raises important issues about data privacy and operational resilience.
Adequate safeguards are necessary to protect users’ privacy. The concentration
of different types of data, possibly including transaction data in combination with
information on geolocation and purchased products or services, raises concerns
about data theft and abuse.35 As a fundamental right, privacy requires a conservative
approach to data management on the unified ledger. Commercial secrecy is no less
important. Businesses may be hesitant to participate in a unified ledger application
unless they can protect confidential information such as smart contract code and
transaction logs.
A key element to guaranteeing privacy is to create partitions in the ledger’s data
environment (Graph 5). Each entity, such as banks or the owners of tokenised assets,
will see only transactions and associated data on their own partition. Updates to the
data environment are initiated by the account owners through use of their private
keys. These private keys are used to authenticate and authorise transactions, ensuring
that only legitimate account owners can make changes to their own partition of the
ledger’s data environment.
In addition, encryption and other privacy-preserving technologies can ensure
the safe sharing and use of data. When different entities interact in a transaction,
information from different partitions needs to be shared and analysed in the
execution environment. Secure data-sharing technologies enable mathematical
computations to be performed directly on encrypted or anonymised data, without

revealing sensitive information. Some intermediaries and users may be more willing
to share data in encrypted form with other parties, which could foster competition
and innovation rather than market concentration and captive behaviour. Commercial
secrecy can be maintained by encrypting individual smart contracts. Only the code
owner, or parties designated by the code owner, would have access to the contract
details.
Various privacy-preserving technologies can protect confidential and personal
data in a unified ledger, each with its own benefits and costs, depending on the
specific application. Table 1 summarises the key characteristics of selected technologies
and the trade-offs involved in their use. Homomorphic encryption and differential
privacy allow users to share their data with other parties in encrypted form. Secure
multi-party computation and federated learning, on the other hand, enable entities
to use common machine learning algorithms while keeping their data in their local
partitions. These methods differ in terms of their degree of privacy protection,
computational burden and ease of implementation.36
A concrete example of how encryption technology might be used is a small
bank that would like to apply a big tech’s advanced machine learning model to
assessing the credit risk of its loan applicants. Traditionally, the bank would have to
grant the larger player access to its data for this task, which requires a great level of
trust that the data will not be used to competitively undermine the small bank. With
homomorphic encryption or similar methods, however, the bank can send encrypted
data and take advantage of the big tech’s analytic services without handing over the
actual data. The big tech, in turn, could further improve its algorithms as they are
trained on larger data sets.
As institutions that serve the public interest with no commercial interest in
personal data, central banks could play a crucial role in designing ledger applications
where privacy safeguards are implemented from the ground up. The ledger could be

designed to embed privacy laws directly into the programming of tokens. In many
cases, data privacy laws give consumers the opportunity to grant or deny third
parties consent to use their data. For example, the European Union’s General Data
Protection Regulation gives its citizens the “right to be forgotten” by asking firms to
delete their personal data. Likewise, the California Consumer Privacy Act endows
Californians with the right to know what personal information is being collected and
to prevent its sale or ask for its deletion. However, it is often difficult for users to
exercise their options effectively, and to verify whether firms have actually deleted
their data. By embedding the option to prevent the sale of data or to delete them
directly into a smart contract specific to a certain token and transaction (eg payment
data should only be accessible by certain institutions), data privacy laws could be
made more effective.
Beyond privacy protection, rising costs from cyber attacks (Graph 8.A) highlight
the need for strong institutional and legal safeguards for cyber resilience.
Safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of the ledger’s data requires multiple
layers of security such as encryption, authentication, access controls, monitoring and
regular security audits. A cyber attack on a critical FMI or ledger could not only entail
significant monetary and reputational damage, but also lead to widespread disruption
in the financial system and ultimately inflict significant societal costs.37 The more
comprehensive the ledger, the bigger the risks of a single point of failure and therefore
the larger the potential associated costs. An appropriate level of investment in cyber
resilience and security is therefore paramount.
A unified ledger could help ensure a sufficient level of investment in cyber
security. Cyber security is a public good. If one institution spends more to protect its
own infrastructure, it makes the system as a whole safer, thereby benefiting all other
institutions. However, given such positive externalities, the classical problem of
under-investment by private parties arises.38 Collectively, financial institutions will
spend too little on cyber security (Graph 8.B). The unified ledger, sustained by a
public-private partnership that internalises these externalities, could overcome this
issue. It would lead to greater investment in cyber security, increasing overall system
resiliency.

Conclusion
To realise the full benefits of innovation in money, payments and a broader range of
financial services, it is crucial to have a vision for the future monetary system and for
the role of central banks in driving innovation to meet evolving needs. Given the
unpredictable nature of innovation, the focus should be on building a monetary
system that is adaptable enough to support safe and sound innovation by the private
sector, in any form that this may take.
This chapter has presented a blueprint for a future monetary system that
harnesses the transformative potential of tokenisation to improve existing structures
and open up new possibilities. This blueprint has sketched out a new financial market
infrastructure – a unified ledger – that integrates CBDCs, tokenised deposits and
other tokenised claims on financial and real assets in one place.
A unified ledger has two key advantages. First, it provides a venue where a
broader array of contingent actions and financial transactions could be seamlessly
integrated and automatically executed. In this way, it enables simultaneous and
instantaneous settlement. In contrast to the crypto world, settlement in central bank
money ensures the singleness of money and the finality of payments. Second, by
having everything in one place, it allows new types of contingent contracts that
serve the public interest by overcoming obstacles associated with information and
incentive problems.
The ideas behind the unified ledger show how the future monetary system
might evolve. In practice, the specific needs and constraints of each jurisdiction will
dictate which applications of the concept will take root first, and on what scale.
Along this journey, multiple ledgers, each catering to specific use cases, could coexist
and interconnect through APIs to ensure interoperability.
Crucially, this journey requires a shift in emphasis from individual experimentation
to joint innovation. Public-private collaboration is essential to develop technological
solutions, establish common platforms and ensure proper oversight and supervision.
Through cooperation, innovation and integration, it is possible to pave the way for a
monetary system that builds on trust, enables new economic arrangements,
enhances the efficiency and accessibility of financial transactions and responds to
the evolving demands of households and firms.

evolution from instruments in the payment system to sophisticated instruments
of credit, and their role in fostering the growth of trade and commerce. Related
discussions are also presented in Quinn and Roberds (2015, 2016) and Frost et
al (2020), who also discuss how the Bank of Amsterdam took on a lender of last
resort function in the 1763 panic, providing emergency liquidity by accepting a
broader range of collateral, and with open market operations.

Token-specific contracts also allow for the ability to transfer fractions of a token,
so-called fractionalisation. Fractionalisation could lower the barriers to entry for
households, thus helping to widen financial inclusion.

Asset-backed stablecoins are by far the most prevalent form of stablecoin. They
are usually pegged to a numeraire, such as the US dollar, and backed by assets
such as government bonds, short-term corporate debt or bank deposits. The
issuer typically manages the underlying collateral and coordinates the coins’
redemption and creation. Currently, stablecoins are used mainly within the
crypto system and are typically provided by unregulated issuers.

This discussion is based on stablecoins of the safest possible variety, namely
those fully backed by the safest and most liquid assets. Other varieties such as
those backed by risky assets or algorithmic stablecoins do not represent a viable
alternative (BIS (2022)).

These considerations would also be relevant to retail CBDC. However, similar
measures that apply to cash today, such as the Financial Action Task Force
requirements, could apply to retail CBDC.

For example, Lotus 1-2-3 was the standard spreadsheet program throughout the
1980s and into the early 1990s. It was widely used by financial traders, portfolio
managers and analysts in investment and commercial banks, brokerage houses
and money management companies. Despite various updates, technical setbacks
meant that Lotus was struggling to keep pace with the rapid advances in
computing power. In the early 1990s, Lotus was surpassed by Microsoft’s Excel,
which provided new functionalities and easier usability through a graphical user

interface. Similarly, a key reason why smartphones replaced earlier versions of
the cell phone was not because they were better for making calls or sending
texts, but because they let third parties use their creativity in developing new
products and services through apps.
15

Real-world information can be represented on the ledger in two ways. First, via
oracles, which are third parties that enter data onto the unified ledger so that
they can be directly referenced by smart contracts. Second, via application
programming interfaces (APIs). The so-called oracle problem (Duley et al (2023)),
which hinders the use of real-world data on decentralised platforms, would not
apply, as the unified ledger would use a trusted and mutually accepted set of
rules and procedures for data access and conflict resolution in the event of
discrepancies.

16

In the case of a card payment from a customer to a merchant there is an
additional authentication and verification process that involves the merchant,
the purchaser’s bank, the acquiring bank and, in many cases, an access control
service that verifies the payment instrument (eg debit/credit card).

17

See CPMI (2023).

18

Atomic settlement involves the reduction of settlement lags (potentially to zero, ie
“instant settlement”), while extending the functionality of delivery-versus-payment
(DvP) and payment-versus-payment (PvP) arrangements such that multiple
linked transactions by various parties can be bundled and settled together
(“simultaneous settlement”). See Bech et al (2020) and Lee et al (2022).

19

Another improvement from the adoption of a unified ledger relates to the
transaction initiation process. Most person-to-business transactions currently
involve an initial validation/verification process that involves contacting an
intermediary, verifying the customer’s identity and the payment instrument
(eg the debit card using the CVV code) and having all these checks communicated
to all relevant participants (eg the buyer, the merchant, the buyer’s bank and the
acquiring bank). On a unified ledger, these steps are replaced by the use of
private and public keys, which confirm legitimate ownership of funds.

20

More broadly, PvP arrangements may add to funding liquidity risks, as funding
is needed to carry out a transaction when required.

how tokenisation could improve supply chain finance.

For example, the so-called servicer collects borrower repayments, pools them
and forwards them to a trustee. The trustee then distributes the pooled
repayment to security holders according to the structure set in the transaction

Most OTC markets rely on large financial institutions (dealers) to intermediate

conducting all-to-all trading, and the ability to generate efficiency gains from
instant netting of bilateral settlement obligations.

36

Privacy-preserving technologies are based on various methodologies. HE uses
the principle of additive and multiplicative homomorphism to enable computations
on encrypted data, yielding the same result as if the computations were performed
on the original data. SMPC allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function
without revealing their input values. However, as the number of parties increases,
SMPC may entail higher communication costs. FL allows each party to train a
machine learning model separately without sharing their data. Instead, parties
only reveal their updated model parameters to a third or central party to
collectively build a better machine learning model by aggregating the parameters.
DP adds calibrated noise to the original data to protect the privacy of the data.
However, there is a trade-off between accuracy and privacy in DP, as improper
calibration of noise can result in inaccurate results.
