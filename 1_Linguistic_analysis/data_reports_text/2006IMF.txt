Assumptions and Conventions

A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic
Outlook. It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates will remain constant at their average
levels during July 5–August 2, 2006, except for the currencies participating in the European exchange
rate mechanism II (ERM II), which are assumed to remain constant in nominal terms relative to the
euro; that established policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions
about fiscal and monetary policies in industrial countries, see Box A1); that the average price of oil
will be $69.20 a barrel in 2006 and $75.50 a barrel in 2007, and remain unchanged in real terms over
the medium term; that the six-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on U.S. dollar deposits
will average 5.4 percent in 2006 and 5.5 percent in 2007; that the three-month euro deposits rate will
average 3.1 percent in 2006 and 3.7 percent in 2007; and that the six-month Japanese yen deposit rate
will yield an average of 0.5 percent in 2006 and of 1.1 percent in 2007. These are, of course, working
hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error
that would in any event be involved in the projections. The estimates and projections are based on
statistical information available through end-August 2006.­
The following conventions have been used throughout the World Economic Outlook:
...

to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;

—

to indicate that the figure is zero or negligible;

–	between years or months (for example, 2004–05 or January–June) to indicate the years or
months covered, including the beginning and ending years or months;
/

between years or months (for example, 2004/05) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.­

“Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.­
“Basis points” refer to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent
to !/4 of 1 percent point).­
In figures and tables, shaded areas indicate IMF staff projections.­
Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown are due to rounding.­
As used in this report, the term “country” does not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is a
state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.­

Preface

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the
IMF’s surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments
in international financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and
policies is the product of a comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments,
which draws primarily on information the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member
countries. These consultations are carried out in particular by the IMF’s area departments together
with the Policy Development and Review Department, the International Capital Markets Department,
the Monetary and Financial Systems Department, and the Fiscal Affairs Department.­
The analysis in this report has been coordinated in the Research Department under the general
direction of Raghuram Rajan, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project has been
directed by Charles Collyns, Deputy Director of the Research Department, and Tim Callen, Division
Chief, Research Department.­
The primary contributors to this report are Thomas Helbling, Subir Lall, Kalpana Kochhar,
­S. Hossein Samiei, Roberto Cardarelli, Florence Jaumotte, Toh Kuan, Valerie Mercer-Blackman, Hélène
Poirson, Martin Sommer, Nikola Spatafora, Irina Tytell, and Johannes Wiegand. To-Nhu Dao, ­Christian
de Guzman, Stephanie Denis, Nese Erbil, Angela Espiritu, Patrick Hettinger, Bennett Sutton, and
Ercument Tulun provided research assistance. Mahnaz Hemmati, Laurent Meister, and Casper Meyer
managed the database and the computer systems. Sylvia Brescia, Celia Burns, and Jemille Colon were
responsible for word processing. Other contributors include Ricardo Adrogue, Sergei Antoshin, Bas
Bakker, Dan Citrin, Gianni De Nicolo, Roberto García-Saltos, Christopher Gilbert, David Hauner,

Papa N’Diaye, Christopher Otrok, Arvind Subramanian, Stephen Tokarick, Thierry Tressel, Kenichi
Ueda, and Khuong Vu. Jeff Hayden of the External Relations Department edited the manuscript and
coordinated the production of the publication.­
The analysis has benefited from comments and suggestions by staff from other IMF departments,
as well as by Executive Directors following their discussion of the report on August 22 and 23, 2006.
However, both projections and policy considerations are those of the IMF staff and should not be
attributed to Executive Directors or to their national authorities.­

Foreword

The World Economic Outlook is truly a joint product, primarily with inputs from the Research Department of the International Monetary Fund, but also from the staff of a number of other departments.
I thank Charles Collyns, David Robinson (who was with us during the important initial phase of this
Outlook), Tim Callen, members of the World Economic Studies Division, and all the IMF staff from
other divisions and departments who worked together to bring this World Economic Outlook to you.­
The world economy continues to be strong, with a third year of significantly-above-trend growth.
Growth continues to become more balanced with the United States slowing and the euro area picking
up, while Japan’s growth is moderating toward trend. A key element to the strong world performance
is the extraordinary growth of emerging markets and developing countries.­
Much has rightly been made of the strong productivity growth of the U.S. economy over the last
decade or so, which has contributed to this purple patch for the world. Far less has been made of the
equally impressive productivity growth in emerging markets and developing countries. In Chapter 3,
we examine the sources of labor productivity growth in Asia (the primary source of growth in output per capita), and compare it with other regions of the world. Asian labor productivity growth has
benefited not just from fast accumulation of physical and human capital but also significant total factor
productivity (TFP) growth—growth that typically comes from technological progress and from using
the factors of production more efficiently. Indeed, in both China and India, TFP growth exceeds the
contribution of physical or human capital accumulation. This extraordinary change has been made
possible through an enabling environment that has fostered the development of efficient manufacturing (and in the case of India, services), while encouraging some movement of labor out of low-productivity agriculture.­
Given the still high share of employment in agriculture in China, India, and the ASEAN countries,
and provided the policy environment continues to be enabling, growth will continue to come from the
shift out of agriculture. Given that a substantial population will still be employed in agriculture in the
poorer Asian economies for some time, an important objective of policy should be to improve agricultural productivity. Equally important for the richer countries is to improve productivity in the service
sector, especially because services will constitute an increasingly important fraction of their economies.
For a number of Asian economies, a critical element of any policy mix to improve agricultural and
service sector productivity will be opening up these sectors to foreign entry and competition.
Productivity growth, especially when unexpected, has a number of valuable benefits. Other things
equal, it reduces unit labor costs, and increases the potential growth rate of the economy. Thus it helps
keep inflation under check. It also helps offset the investment and growth consequences of adverse
supply shocks. That the world economy has remained robust in recent years despite higher oil and
commodities prices is due, in no small part, to the enabling policies that allowed economies to continuously improve productivity.­
Robust global growth over the last few years has brought some new policy challenges. For one,
unexpectedly high demand for some non-oil commodities may have generated enormous revenues for
some commodity producers temporarily, but conditions will change as supply catches up. As Chapter 5
suggests, prospects for non-oil commodities, especially metals, may be different from oil in that there
is more likely to be a robust supply response as investment increases to meet the unexpectedly higher
demand. Our model, as well as futures prices, suggests that metals prices are likely to decline in the
future. Non-oil-commodity-dependent economies should anticipate this risk by being cautious on rais-

xi

foreword

ing expenditures that are hard to reverse, such as public sector salaries, and instead focus on expenditures that help build diversified productive capacity for the future.­
Another risk is that some market-led processes may overshoot when times are good. For instance,
widespread productivity growth may have played a role in the emergence of global current account
imbalances. The strong productivity growth in the United States, as is well known, certainly made the
United States an attractive place to invest in, drawing in capital and producing a counterpart current
account deficit in the late 1990s. In addition though, as Chapter 4 suggests, the United States’ sophisticated arm’s length financial system made it easier for consumers to borrow against future incomes and
consume immediately, augmenting the size of the current account deficit. Indeed, the expectation of
higher future incomes coupled with accommodative monetary policy and low interest rates may have
fueled the U.S. housing boom, which boosted consumption even more as the financial system allowed
borrowing against collateral.­
Even though emerging markets have experienced strong productivity growth in recent years, many
did not have financial systems that could translate this into either higher investment or higher consumption. Their rising incomes were therefore channeled into net savings that helped finance the
United States’ dissaving. The ability to run current account imbalances therefore has allowed the world
to grow faster than it would otherwise have. This is a good thing but it has limits. It is important, therefore, that we bring imbalances down in stable times so that we have room to expand them when future
needs arise—this is just prudent countercyclical global policy.­
Prudence is especially important when the times are changing. Revisions to U.S. data suggest that
productivity growth was not so high as earlier believed. Furthermore, productivity growth has been
declining as the expansion matures, and unit labor costs have been accelerating. With tight labor
market conditions (including in other industrial countries), and high capacity utilization, inflationary
pressures are on the rise. Even as liquidity is being withdrawn, the Federal Reserve has to assess not
just how much the economy will slow because of prior rate increases (and their effects via the housing
market) and higher energy prices, but also what the potential growth of the economy truly is. It also
has to pay attention to the narrowing global output gap. There are risks of both excessive tightening as
well as overly gradual tightening.­
While growth in the rest of the world is likely to pick up some of the slack of a slowing U.S. economy,
it is hard to estimate precisely how much of that momentum is independent of U.S. growth because the
world has become so much more closely integrated over the last few years. Our baseline is that world
growth will continue to be strong, but that forecast is surrounded by significant risks to the downside.­
Policymakers should recognize that some of their country’s performance is not just because of their
own skills at the helm but because of spillovers from the robust global economy, as well as the benign
financial conditions. The emerging protectionism not just in trade, but increasingly in preventing
cross-border acquisitions and foreign direct investment, can interrupt the process of global productivity
growth that has been so critical to the robust health of the world in recent years. This is why country
authorities should strive hard, not just to revive the Doha Round, but even to make it more ambitious.
They should work together to sustain the smooth flow of goods, capital, and ideas across borders, not
least through the various mechanisms proposed by the IMF’s Managing Director in his Medium-Term
Strategy to invigorate the quality of the multilateral dialogue. Finally, wherever possible, they should
ensure that public policy does not exacerbate imbalances created by the private sector, as well as avoid
creating uncertainties where none existed before. Prudent, predictable policy, in this environment of
increasing uncertainty, is the need of the hour.­

Executive Summary

Global Economic Environment
• The global expansion remained buoyant in
the first half of 2006, with activity in most
regions meeting or exceeding expectations
(Chapter 1). Growth was particularly strong in
the United States in the first quarter of 2006,
although it has slowed subsequently. The
expansion gathered momentum in the euro
area, and continued in Japan. Emerging markets have grown rapidly, especially China, and
low-income countries have also maintained
an impressive growth performance, helped by
strong commodity prices.­
• At the same time, there are signs that inflationary pressures are edging up in some
countries as sustained high rates of growth
have absorbed spare capacity. Headline inflation in a number of advanced economies
has for some time been above central bank
comfort zones, pushed up by rising oil prices,
but there are now signs of increases in core
inflation and inflation expectations, most
notably in the United States. In Japan, there is
increasing evidence that deflation has finally
ended.­
• Oil and metals prices have hit new highs.
Prices have been supported by tight spare
capacity in global markets against the background of buoyant GDP growth, and in the
case of oil, rising geopolitical tensions in the
Middle East and risks to production in some
other large producers (notably Nigeria).
Futures markets suggest that oil prices will
remain elevated for the foreseeable future.­
• Major central banks have responded by
tightening monetary policy. The U.S. Federal Reserve continued to raise interest rates
through June, although pausing in August;
the European Central Bank has raised interest
rates further in recent months; and the Bank
of Japan ended its zero interest rate policy

in July. The U.S. dollar has weakened against
the euro, and to a lesser extent the yen, while
long-term interest rates have firmed.­
• Rising inflation concerns and tighter monetary conditions led to some weakness in
advanced-economy equity markets and a series
of larger moves in some emerging market
asset prices in May–June, although markets
have been more stable since July. These moves
appear to largely represent corrections after
major price run-ups, rather than a fundamental reassessment of economic risks, and
seem unlikely to have a major growth impact,
although growth in some individual countries may be dampened as their central banks
have raised interest rates to calm financial
market conditions and head off inflationary
pressures.­
• Global imbalances remain large. Despite
an acceleration in export growth, the U.S.
current account deficit is expected to near
7 percent of GDP in 2007. Surpluses in oil
exporters and a number of Asian countries
are expected to stay high, with China’s surplus
remaining in excess of 7 percent of GDP.­

Outlook and Risks
• The forecast for global growth has been
marked up to 5.1 percent in 2006 and 4.9
percent in 2007, both !/4 of a percentage point
higher than in the April 2006 World Economic
Outlook.­
• Growth in the United States is expected to
slow from 3.4 percent in 2006 to 2.9 percent
in 2007, amid a cooling housing market.
Growth in Japan will also ease as the cycle
matures. In the euro area, the recovery is
projected to sustain its momentum this year,
although growth in Germany will be reduced
in 2007 by the planned tax increase. Among
emerging markets and developing countries,

xiii

Executive Summary

growth is expected to remain very strong, with
the Chinese economy continuing its recent
rapid expansion.­
• The balance of risks to the global outlook
is slanted to the downside, with IMF staff
estimates suggesting a one in six chance that
growth could fall to 3!/4 percent or less in 2007.
The most notable risks are that inflationary
pressures could intensify, requiring monetary
policy to be tightened more than currently
expected; that oil prices could increase further
against the background of limited spare capacity and geopolitical uncertainties; and that the
U.S. housing market could cool more rapidly
than expected, triggering a more abrupt slowdown of the U.S. economy.­
• The potential for a disorderly unwinding
of global imbalances remains a concern. A
smooth, market-led unwinding of these imbalances is the most likely outcome, although
investors would need to continue increasing
the share of U.S. assets in their portfolios
for many years to allow this to happen. The
depth and sophistication of U.S. financial
markets has facilitated the financing of recent
large current account deficits. However, there
remains some risk of a disorderly adjustment,
which could impose heavy costs on the global
economy.­

Policy Challenges
Advanced Economies
• Central banks in advanced economies will
need to carefully weigh the relative risks to
growth and inflation in the period ahead. The
U.S. Federal Reserve faces a difficult situation
of rising inflation in a slowing economy, but
given the importance of keeping inflation
expectations in check, some further policy
tightening may still be needed (Chapter 2).
In Japan, interest rate increases should be
gradual, as there is little danger of an inflationary surge, while the reemergence of deflation would be costly. In the euro area, further
increases in interest rates are likely to be

xiv

needed if the expansion develops as expected,
but for now inflation pressures seem broadly
contained, and faced with continuing downside risks to growth, policymakers can afford
to be cautious in tightening monetary policy
further.­
• In most of the large advanced economies,
fiscal consolidation in the face of aging
populations remains a huge challenge. Fiscal
consolidation is envisaged in many countries
in the coming years, but it is neither ambitious enough nor backed up by clearly identified policy measures. Social security systems
need to be put on sounder footings, and
effective ways found to contain the inexorable
rise in health care costs.­
• Structural reforms to improve the business
environment and global competitiveness
remain essential to bolster growth prospects.
In the euro area, faster progress to advance
the Lisbon agenda—particularly more open
competition in services, more flexible labor
markets, and financial sector reforms—
remain key to boost productivity growth and
improve job opportunities. In Japan, priorities include public sector reforms, steps to
enhance labor market flexibility and financial
sector efficiency, and reforms to improve productivity in the services sector.­
• Chapter 4 examines how differences in
financial systems can affect economic cycles in
advanced economies. A new index is constructed that characterizes financial systems
according to the degree to which transactions
are based on long-term relationships between
borrowers and lenders or are conducted at
“arm’s length.” The chapter finds that while
there has been a general trend toward bank
disintermediation and a greater role for financial markets, the pace has differed across countries, and there are still important differences
in financial systems. The chapter offers some
evidence that such differences in financial
systems may affect cyclical behavior. Specifically, in more arm’s length systems, households
may be able to better smooth consumption
in response to changes in income, but their

Executive Summary

spending may be more sensitive to changes in
asset prices. Corporate investment appears to
react more smoothly to cyclical downturns in
relationship-based systems, but arm’s length
systems seem better at reallocating resources in
response to structural changes.­
• The move toward more arm’s length financial systems that has been under way in most
countries over the past decade is set to continue, given technological innovations and the
removal of regulatory barriers. Policymakers
will need to maximize the benefits from this
ongoing change, including by implementing
complementary reforms to increase labor
market flexibility, improve the portability
of employee pension plans, and strengthen
bankruptcy procedures. Supervisory and regulatory policies will need to keep up with the
increasing sophistication of the financial sector, while macroeconomic policy management
will need to adapt to reflect possible changes
in cyclical behavior.­

Emerging Market and Developing Economies
• In emerging market and developing economies, policymakers must adjust to the more
challenging global environment by continuing to reduce vulnerabilities and by putting
in place reforms that will help sustain the
current growth momentum. Recent developments have provided a reminder that emerging market economies remain susceptible
to turbulence in global financial markets.
Countries at risk include those with still weak
public sector balance sheets, large current
account deficits, and less well-anchored inflation expectations. In a number of countries
in emerging Europe, the increasing reliance
on private debt flows to finance large current
account deficits is a concern. More also needs
to be done in emerging market and developing economies to advance market-oriented
reforms, particularly by reducing barriers to
competition, to create the climate for vigorous private sector–led growth.­

• Chapter 3 analyzes Asia’s remarkable growth
performance, and focuses on what needs
to be done to sustain strong growth in the
future. The chapter finds that the favorable
policy environment in Asia has been the key
to strong total factor productivity growth and
rapid accumulation of physical and human
capital in the region. Indeed, the importance
of establishing a favorable policy environment is the key lesson that late developing
countries—both within Asia and in other
parts of the world—can learn from the successful early developers such as Japan and
the newly industrialized economies (NIEs).
Trade liberalization, improved access to
education, and steps to promote financial
development and encourage entrepreneurship would facilitate the ongoing shift of
resources out of agriculture and into industry and services. Efforts to boost productivity growth in industry, and particularly the
relatively more sheltered services sector, will
also pay important dividends. Policies to
encourage increased competition in services
include removing barriers to entry, encouraging foreign investment, and streamlining
regulations.­
• Chapter 5 examines the outlook for prices
of nonfuel commodities. These prices—particularly for metals—have risen sharply
in recent years, defraying the losses from
higher oil import bills for exporters of these
commodities. The chapter finds that price
increases have largely been driven by strong
demand, particularly from China, as well as
supply bottlenecks. In addition, the chapter
finds that speculative activity does not seem
to have been a significant driver leading
commodity price movements, although
speculators may have played a role in providing liquidity to markets. Metals prices are
expected to come down over the medium
term as new production comes on stream to
meet rising demand. The key policy message
for countries that export commodities—particularly metals—is that they should not
assume that high prices will be sustained.

xv

Executive Summary

Current revenue windfalls should be saved
or invested to support future growth in
noncommodity sectors, rather than used to
increase spending in areas that will be difficult to reverse later.­

Multilateral Initiatives
• Joint policy efforts would help to ensure a
smooth reduction of global imbalances. An
orderly private sector–led adjustment, involving a rebalancing of demand across countries,
with accompanying further depreciation of
the U.S. dollar and exchange rate appreciations in many surplus countries (notably in
parts of Asia and oil producers), remains the
most likely outcome. However, there remains
a risk of a more disorderly unwinding that
would imply a heavy cost for the global economy. The risks of such a disorderly adjustment
would be considerably reduced by sustained
policy actions across the major players in
the world economy involving steps to boost
national saving in the United States, including
through fiscal consolidation; greater progress
on structural reforms in Europe and Japan;
reforms to boost domestic demand in emerging Asia (consumption in China, investment
elsewhere) together with greater exchange

xvi

rate flexibility; and increased spending in
oil-producing countries in high-return areas,
consistent with absorptive capacity constraints,
especially in the Middle East, where the large
buildup of investment projects already in
train is welcome. Taking a joint, multilateral
approach may help to advance implementation by providing assurance that possible risks
associated with individual actions would be
alleviated by simultaneous policy initiatives
elsewhere. The present multilateral consultation by the IMF can contribute to this process.­
• Efforts are needed to reinvigorate the process of multilateral trade liberalization. The
apparent deadlock in the Doha Round is
deeply disappointing. Trade liberalization on
a nondiscriminatory (most favored nation, or
MFN) basis remains the best way to open up
new global growth opportunities. The threat
of protectionist pressures needs to be firmly
resisted.­
• High and volatile prices in world energy
markets remain a major concern that will
require sustained efforts from all sides to
address. Increased investment is needed to
build up adequate production and refining
capacity, while appropriate incentives for
consumers would encourage improved energy
conservation.­

Global Prospects and Policy Issues

World output increased briskly in the first half of 2006,
and global growth is projected at 5.1 percent for the year
as a whole before moderating to 4.9 percent in 2007
(Figure 1.1 and Table 1.1). Nevertheless, inflationary
concerns, tighter conditions in financial markets, and
further jumps in oil prices to new highs have highlighted downside risks as the global economy enters the
fourth year of this current expansion. Other notable
sources of uncertainty include the threat of an abrupt
slowdown in the U.S. housing market; lingering doubts
about prospects for growth in the other advanced economies; and questions about the resilience of emerging
market countries in a more challenging global environment. Moreover, large global imbalances continue to
prompt concerns, while the potential for protectionist
pressures has increased now that the Doha Round seems
to be deadlocked. Against this background, policymakers will need to respond flexibly to events and act with
foresight to head off potential strains, recognizing the
importance of spillovers across countries and the benefits
of taking a joint approach to managing global risks
and promoting a robust world economy.­

The global expansion was broad-based in the
first half of 2006, with activity in most regions
meeting or exceeding expectations, and recent
indicators suggest that the pace of expansion
is being maintained in the third quarter (Figure 1.2). Growth was particularly strong in the
United States in the first quarter, although it
slowed in the second quarter in the face of
headwinds from a cooling housing market
and rising fuel costs. The expansion gathered
momentum in the euro area, notwithstanding
a slow start to the year in Germany, and the
Japanese economy continued to expand. Growth
in China has accelerated even further, emerging
Asia and Europe have continued to grow rapidly,
and the pace of activity has picked up in Latin
America. Middle Eastern oil exporters and low-

Global Economic Environment

income countries in Africa have also maintained
impressive growth rates.­
Sustained high rates of global growth have
absorbed spare capacity and led to some
emerging signs of inflationary pressures. While
estimates of potential GDP are always subject to
uncertainty, output gaps seem to be closing in
much of the world (Figure 1.3), while buoyant
demand for fuel and raw materials has contributed to record high prices for oil and other
commodities. Headline inflation in many of the
major advanced economies has for some time
been above central bank comfort zones, pushed
up by rising oil prices, but there are now signs of
increases in core inflation, in market-based and
survey measures of inflation expectations, and in
unit labor costs, particularly in the United States
(Figure 1.4). In emerging markets, a number
of countries—including Argentina, India, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, and Venezuela—are
facing price pressures following sustained
periods of rapid growth or large exchange rate
depreciations.­
Against this background, central banks in the
major advanced economies have taken steps to
tighten monetary conditions. The U.S. Federal
Reserve continued to raise the Fed funds rate
through June, although pausing in August, seeking to balance inflation concerns against signs
that the U.S. expansion is beginning to slow (Figure 1.5). The European Central Bank has raised
its policy rate further, and the Bank of Japan has
moved away from quantitative easing and in July
raised the overnight policy rate from zero to 25
basis points. Central banks in Australia, Sweden,
and the United Kingdom have also tightened in
recent months. Longer-term government bond
yields have increased, although they still remain
quite low in real terms relative to average levels
over the past 25 years (Figure 1.6).­
Since late 2005, the U.S. dollar has depreciated against the euro, and to a lesser degree the
yen, partly reversing its appreciation during the
previous 12 months (Figure 1.7). The recent
depreciation of the U.S. dollar seems to reflect
in part perceptions that with the U.S. expansion
at a more mature stage, interest differentials

vis-à-vis the other major currencies are likely to
narrow, as well as increased market concern with
global imbalances as the U.S. current account
deficit has continued to widen and the surpluses
in parts of emerging Asia and oil exporters have
increased further (Figure 1.8). In real effective
terms, the U.S. dollar is now close to its average level since 1980, while the euro is somewhat
above its long-run average in real terms, and the
yen somewhat below. Volatility in currency markets has also risen back to more normal levels,
in part reflecting the fact that monetary policy
decisions have become more data dependent
and harder to predict.­
Rising inflation concerns and tightening by
major central banks had a marked impact on
financial markets during March–June, 2006.
Starting in March, currencies of some countries
with particularly wide current account deficits—
Iceland, New Zealand, and Hungary—depreciated sharply. There was a more general retreat
from equity markets and emerging market
currencies in May and June (Figure 1.9 and
Box 1.1). Particularly affected were asset prices
that had previously risen sharply (such as equities in Colombia and India), and the exchange
rates of countries with high current account
deficits (such as Hungary, South Africa, and
Turkey). With these developments coming on
top of already overheated conditions in some
countries, a number of central banks in emerging market countries have raised rates to calm
financial conditions and to head off inflationary
pressures. Since July, however, conditions have
been more stable.­
The IMF staff’s assessment is that these
market events should not significantly slow the
overall momentum of global activity, although
growth in some individual countries (such as
Turkey) may be dampened. For the most part,
asset price declines seem to have represented
corrections after major run-ups rather than a
fundamental reassessment of economic risks. It

These

developments are examined in depth in Chapter I of the IMF’s September 2006 Global Financial Stability
Report.



Outlook and Short-Term Risks

is striking that the impact on emerging market
external bond spreads was relatively subdued, in
part reflecting progress made in strengthening
fiscal positions and the buildup of international
reserve cushions, as well as recent debt buyback programs that have improved the supplydemand balance in these markets. Welcome
progress has also been made in improving the
structure of public debt, with increased sales
of local currency debt to foreign investors,
although some of the wind was also taken from
these markets in the recent correction. Nonetheless, recent market pressures have provided
a timely reminder of the need for continuing
progress to improve public sector balance sheets
and to address other vulnerabilities.­
Oil and other commodity prices continued
at elevated levels in the first eight months of
2006, with petroleum and metals prices reaching new highs (Appendix 1.1). Oil prices
have been supported by tight spare capacity
in global markets—both in production and
refining—against the background of buoyant
GDP growth, security concerns in the Middle
East, and continued risks to production in some
large producers elsewhere (notably Nigeria).
Metals prices also have been boosted by strong
demand growth, especially in emerging markets,
by capacity shortages, and by labor disputes.
Prices of food and other agricultural products
rose in relative terms in the first part of 2006,
although they have not participated in the price
boom affecting oil and metals in recent years.
Against this background, some commentators
have suggested that speculative activity may have
contributed to recent price surges, particularly
in oil and metals. However, an IMF staff analysis, reported in Chapter 5, suggests that while
speculators may have played a role in providing
liquidity to markets, speculative position-taking
does not seem to have been a significant driver
leading commodity price movements.­

growth has been marked up to 5.1 percent
in 2006 and 4.9 percent in 2007, !/4 percentage point above the April 2006 WEO projection in both years (Figure 1.10). This would
be the strongest four-year period of global
expansion since the early 1970s. This favorable
outlook depends on the view that inflationary pressures will be successfully contained
with modest further interest rate increases
by the major central banks, that the growth
of domestic demand will be better balanced
across the advanced economies, that emerging and developing countries will largely avoid
capacity bottlenecks, and that global financial
market conditions will be more stable now that
excessive valuations in some sectors have been
reduced. More specifically:
• The U.S. economy would grow 3.4 percent in
2006, before slowing to 2.9 percent in 2007,
broadly in line with potential. A cooling housing market would continue to dampen private
consumption and residential investment, but
corporate investment should be supported by
high capacity use and strong profitability.­
• Growth in the euro area would rise to 2.4 percent in 2006—its highest rate in six years—
before moderating to 2 percent in 2007.
Stronger corporate balance sheets have paved
the way for higher investment, rising employment, and a better balanced expansion. The
slowing in 2007 would largely reflect scheduled tax increases in Germany.­
• The Japanese economy would grow by 2.7
percent in 2006, based on solid domestic
demand, before easing to 2.1 percent in 2007.­
• Growth in emerging markets and developing
countries would remain very strong at 7.3 percent in 2006, and slow only marginally to 7.2
percent in 2007. China would sustain growth
around 10 percent—an upward revision relative to the April 2006 World Economic Outlook—

This

forecast is broadly in line with the private sector
consensus and projections from other international agencies such as the OECD for 2006, while for 2007 the IMF
staff projection for global growth is about 1/4 percentage
point above the consensus.

Outlook and Short-Term Risks

while India and Russia would also continue to
grow rapidly. Latin American countries would
continue to lag, although growth prospects
have been marked up in this region.­
• Headline inflation in the advanced economies would increase modestly to 2.6 percent
in 2006, and start to come down in 2007 as
the upward impetus from oil price increases
recedes. Inflation pressures would also generally be contained in emerging market and
developing countries.­
• The U.S. current account deficit would rise
further—to 6.9 percent of GDP in 2007—with
large surpluses continuing in Japan, parts of
emerging Asia, and oil-exporting countries in
the Middle East and elsewhere.­
• Private capital flows to emerging market and
developing countries would slow from the torrid pace of 2005, but with the overall net current account surplus of these countries rising
further, the pace of accumulation of international reserves would remain high (Table 1.2).­
The risks to this baseline forecast would seem,
however, increasingly tilted to the downside,
even more so than at the time of the April 2006
World Economic Outlook. As reflected in the fan
chart for global growth (Figure 1.11), which
is based on the past forecasting record and an
assessment of the current distribution of risks, in
the IMF staff’s view there is a one in six chance
of growth in 2007 falling to 3!/4 percent or less,
a significant slowdown compared to the last four
years.­
Before considering these downside risks in
more detail, it is worth highlighting sources
of potentially even more rapid growth. These
would seem to be concentrated in emerging
markets, where growth has been underpredicted by IMF staff in recent years. In China, in
particular, investment could be even higher than
projected, in part reflecting abundant banking system liquidity, although such an outcome
would further increase concerns about a boombust investment cycle. More broadly in emerging markets, a return to calmer global financial
conditions could presage a resurgence of portfolio inflows, which could foster easy monetary

conditions, a rebound in asset prices, and a further strengthening of domestic demand. In the
advanced economies, the main upside potential
would seem to be in business investment, given
strong corporate profitability and rising capacity
utilization.­
Turning now to the downside, markets have
been concerned that a continued buildup of
inflation pressures in advanced economies could
require a more aggressive monetary policy
response to cool the growth momentum, particularly in the United States. Clearly, there are
risks in this direction coming from tightening
capacity constraints and the continuing potential for high headline inflation to seep into price
expectations and bolder wage demands. Cost
push pressures have risen in the United States in
recent quarters, reflecting both rising employee
compensation and slowing productivity as the
expansion matures, although unit labor cost
growth has remained subdued in the euro area
and Japan (Figure 1.12).­
A related risk to the outlook comes from
the continued potential for supply-side shocks
in the oil market, which could give a further
upward impetus to international oil prices,
thus exacerbating inflationary pressures while
cooling household demand. In the baseline
forecast, the international oil price is expected
to average $75 a barrel in 2007, close to the
peak reached in early August (see Appendix
1.1). As emphasized in past issues of the World
Economic Outlook, up to now the global economy
has been able to absorb quite well the run-up
in oil prices, reflecting that—to a considerable
degree—the price increases have been driven
by strong demand growth rather than supply
constraints, and that central banks have had the
credibility to focus on core rather than headline inflation. The decline in energy intensity
of global output compared to the 1970s has
also played a role in containing the impact of
oil price increases. However, with spare capacity remaining at recent very low levels, supply
concerns have played a growing role in pushing
up oil prices, and a major disruption in a large
producer or a further escalation of security

Outlook and Short-Term Risks

concerns in the Middle East could well lead
to another upward oil price spike. Over time,
investment in new production and refining
capacity both inside and outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), diversification into alternative energy
sources, and increased conservation efforts
by consumers responding to price incentives
should restore spare capacity to more comfortable levels, but the lags are lengthy, and considerable uncertainty remains about the pace and
extent of these responses.­
There are also supply-side risks from nonfuel
commodity prices. In total, nonfuel commodities represent almost twice as large a share of
world trade as fuels and can have an important
impact on the global economic environment,
both for consumers and the exporters, which
(like oil) tend to be in emerging market and
developing countries. In fact, for a number
of these countries, nonfuel commodity price
increases have provided significant terms-oftrade gains or at least offset some of the losses
from higher oil import bills (Figure 1.13), while
in some countries like Chile government revenues from these sectors are an important share
of total revenues.­
Chapter 5 of this report discusses the prospects for nonfuel commodity markets in more
detail. Its analysis suggests that, as with oil,
recent price increases have been substantially
driven by a surge in demand, particularly
in rapidly growing, large emerging markets
like China. This surge in demand has outstripped supply capacity, especially in metals
where ­supply responses are subject to longer lags than in agriculture. However, unlike
the ­petroleum market, nonfuel commodity
prices are expected to retreat more rapidly
from recent highs as new capacity comes into
operation, although not to fall back to earlier
levels—in part because higher energy costs have
boosted costs of production. Nonfuel comOil

options prices suggest that in August 2006 markets
put a 10 percent chance on Brent oil exceeding $90 a
barrel in December 2006.

modity exporters will thus need to be cautious
in managing the uncertain stream of foreign
exchange earnings and government revenue
from these sources.­
A key risk on the demand side is that the continued cooling of advanced-economy housing
markets will weaken household balance sheets
and undercut aggregate demand. At this point,
concerns center on the United States, although
other markets, such as those in Ireland, Spain,
and the United Kingdom, also still seem overvalued by most conventional measures. In the
United States, the April 2006 issue of the World
Economic Outlook suggested that, by 2005, average
home prices had risen around 10–15 percent
above levels consistent with fundamentals.
Recent data indicate that the market is now
softening quite rapidly, with home sales and
mortgage applications weakening, housing starts
falling, and house price increases dropping. The
baseline U.S. growth forecast assumes house
price growth will continue to slow, implying a
drag on domestic demand from the housing
market of approximately !/2 percentage point in
each of 2006 and 2007. However, if the housing market were to cool more abruptly, IMF
staff estimates suggest that this could subtract
up to an additional 1 percentage point from
GDP growth relative to the baseline. To be sure,
house price softening in other countries like
Australia and the United Kingdom, coming off
larger upward spikes in house prices than experienced in the United States, has been absorbed
thus far with relatively mild and brief economic
slowdowns. Nevertheless, the concern remains
that a sharp adjustment in the housing sector
would generate strong headwinds for the U.S.
economy.­
Other demand-side risks relate to the extent
to which expansions in Europe and Japan will
be sustained by increasing strength of household demand, reducing reliance on exports
and exposure to a slowdown of demand in the
United States. Such a rebalancing appears to
be under way, but concerns remain, particularly
in Europe, where both job growth and wage
increases remain modest in the face of slow

Outlook and Short-Term Risks

productivity growth and labor market rigidities. There are also uncertainties related to the
ongoing process of fiscal consolidation in these
countries; deficit reduction is necessary in the
face of upcoming demographic pressures on
spending and dependency ratios, but could
cause short-term shifts in aggregate demand
that are hard to predict. An example is the 3
percentage point increase in the value added
tax (VAT) in Germany in early 2007, which is
expected to lower GDP by around !/2 percentage
point in 2007 relative to 2006, but the impact
could even be larger. Such fiscal-related uncertainty is also significant in Italy, where the new
government is expected to bring in an adjustment package to address its deep-seated fiscal
imbalances.­
Recent developments have provided a
healthy reminder that emerging markets
remain sus­ceptible to turbulence in global
financial markets, notwithstanding progress in
reducing underlying vulnerabilities. Countries
particularly at risk would include those with
still weak public sector balance sheets and less
well anchored inflation expectations. Moreover, recent experience has underlined that a
buildup in current account deficits from private
saving-investment imbalances and an associated
rapid growth of bank credit can also cause difficulties when expectations about the availability
of external funding change (see Box 1.1).
Adverse events affecting emerging markets
become more likely in the context of higher
interest rates and financial market volatility in
the advanced economies, and could be initiated by global shocks that prompt a reduction
in risk appetite, a downward shift in emerging
market growth prospects, and a weakening of
non-oil commodity prices. As illustrated in Box
1.2, a sharp reversal of market sentiment away
from emerging markets could put downward
pressures on exchange rates that would need to

sector balance sheets should provide a basis

stresses.­

Unwinding Global Imbalances
Large global imbalances continue to be a
concern for the outlook. To be clear, the existence of significant current account deficits and
surpluses does not by itself imply the threat of
instability. In an increasingly globalized world
economy, the free movement of capital across
borders permits periods in which countries’
savings and investment rates may diverge, imply-

ing substantial current account deficits and
surpluses. Such financial flows can be positive
for the world economy, representing the shift of
resources from parts of the world with abundant
savings relative to investment opportunities to
areas offering higher rates of return to capital.
However, past experience suggests that high
current account deficits relative to GDP have
typically not been sustained for long periods,
either because domestic saving and investment
patterns change or because countries run up
against financing constraints—for example,
because of shifting perceptions about relative
rates of return across countries or because international investors resist a continued buildup
in country exposure in their portfolios. In this
latter situation, savings and investment behavior has had to adjust to bring current account
positions back in line with available financing.

The key issues then are the sustainability of
the current pattern of global imbalances and
whether the eventual adjustment will be orderly
or disorderly.­
To assess the sustainability of the current
pattern of global imbalances, one must understand the source of the imbalances and how they
have been financed. A variety of factors have
been suggested to explain the current situation,
including the positive impact of the strong U.S.
productivity performance on asset prices, household wealth, and consumption; the emergence
of a sizable fiscal deficit in the United States
since the turn of the century; the investment
slowdown in emerging Asia outside China since
the Asian Crisis; the highly liquid conditions
in world financial markets, especially since the
collapse of the information technology bubble;
the willingness of emerging market countries,

particularly in Asia, to build high levels of international reserves; and the need to recycle oil
exporters’ surpluses after the recent escalation
of petroleum prices.
An element of the story that has received
increasing attention recently is the role played
by the U.S. financial system in attracting foreign savings in increasingly integrated global
capital markets (see, for example, Caballero,
Farhi, and Gourinchas, 2006.). The depth and
liquidity of U.S. financial markets, together
with the rapid pace of innovation and development of new products offering wide and
increasing opportunities for effective risk
management, have made the United States
an attractive ­destination for global investors’
funds. At the same time, financial innovations
and new ­products have increased opportunities for “consumption smoothing,” in particular for households to increase spending out
of wealth generated from the large increases
in U.S. equity and house prices. A notable
part has been played by the rapid rise in the
asset-backed securities markets, particularly
mortgage-backed securities, which now account
for over 10 percent of global bond markets,
together with borrowing instruments that
have facilitated equity extraction and cash-flow
management. These market developments have
played a part in allowing the continuing decline
in the U.S. savings rate since the mid-1990s,
while also offering a major conduit for capital
inflows to the United States.­
Chapter 4 of this report offers some perspective on this phenomenon, aiming to assess the
degree to which financial systems in advanced
economies have migrated from relationshipbased to arm’s length financing structures and
the implications of this shift for economic cycles.
It suggests that while all financial systems have
moved in the direction of arm’s length systems,

See

discussions in previous issues of the World Economic
Outlook, including “Global Imbalances—A Saving and
Investment Perspective” in the September 2005 issue,
and “Oil Prices and Global Imbalances” in the April 2006
issue.

14

Unwinding Global Imbalances

the process has gone farthest in the United
States, and in some respects the gap between
the United States and most others has widened.
It also provides some evidence that arm’s length
structures provide greater potential for consumption smoothing and that the dynamism of
the U.S. financial system has played a significant role in attracting financing for the U.S.
current account deficit. The chapter cautions,
however, that arm’s length systems may provide
less support for activity in the face of asset price
corrections.­
It is beyond the scope of this report to allocate the causality precisely among the various
factors contributing to global imbalances. To
a large extent, different explanations complement rather than compete with each other,
and their relative importance has varied over
time. However, what is clear is that while the
explanations help one to understand why
the imbalances have emerged and have been
sustained over a period of time, none of them
implies that large imbalances can be sustained
indefinitely.­
To be sure, the United States’ high and
­widening current account deficits in recent
years have been financed without undue strain
on the global financial system, with real longterm interest rates remaining on the low side.
The pattern of such financing has varied over
time, with direct investment and portfolio
equity inflows playing an important role in the
late 1990s, and debt-related flows providing
the bulk of financing more recently, including
a significant but not dominant role played by
official flows corresponding to the accumulation of large international reserves by a number of countries. Moreover, recent months have
seen some developments that, over time, will be
helpful in reducing the imbalances, including
some depreciation of the U.S. dollar, stronger
growth in U.S. exports, news that the U.S.
fiscal deficit in the present fiscal year will be
lower than earlier predictions, rising growth of
domestic demand in the euro area and Japan,
and some increased exchange rate flexibility in
Asian countries. However, the underlying prob-

lem remains little diminished. Medium-term
projections assuming constant real effective
exchange rates show the U.S. current account
deficit remaining close to 2 percent of global
GDP, with Asia and oil exporters continuing to
run substantial surpluses (Figure 1.14). These
projections imply that the United States would
need to continue absorbing a rising share of
world asset portfolios. However, eventually,
the buildup of U.S.-based assets in global asset
portfolios would approach saturation, and an
adjustment of current account imbalances
would be required.­
The most likely outcome is still a gradual
and orderly unwinding of the imbalances over
a number of years. With the housing market
cooling in the United States, private saving is
likely to rise as the asset price boost to wealth
accumulation fades away. By contrast, consumption growth would accelerate in emerging Asia
(especially China) as precautionary savings
motives moderate, and absorption by oil exporters is also expected to rise, particularly in the
Middle East where the authorities are advancing
ambitious investment plans. This shift in relative
growth of domestic demand, accompanied by a
sustained depreciation of the U.S. dollar in real
terms and real exchange rate appreciation in
surplus countries, notably in parts of Asia and
oil exporters, would contribute to a more normal pattern of current accounts over a number
of years. Such an adjustment could occur as a
market-led process, without the need for major
shifts in policy frameworks.­
However, as discussed in Box 1.3, such a
smooth, market-led process is likely to succeed only if investors are prepared to continue
increasing the share of their portfolios in U.S.
assets for many years. If not, there would be
some risk of a disorderly unwinding, involving a
more rapid fall of the U.S. dollar, volatile conditions in financial markets, rising protectionist
pressures, and a significant hit to global output.
The potentially heavy cost of such a disorderly
unwinding underlines the importance of joint
efforts to reduce the imbalances in a timely fashion, as discussed further below.­

Policy Challenges

Policy Challenges
The heightened uncertainty about economic
prospects, the associated increased volatility in
financial markets, and the concerns over global
imbalances have made it all the more important
for policymakers to respond flexibly to events, to
act with foresight to head off potential strains,
and to take a joint approach to managing global
risks.­
The environment is particularly challenging for
the major central banks that provide the linchpin
for global stability. In the United States, monetary policy faces the difficult situation of rising
inflation in a slowing economy, and the Federal
Reserve will need to continue to monitor incoming data carefully while clearly communicating
its assessment to the market. Given the importance of keeping inflation expectations firmly in
check, some further policy tightening may still be
needed. In Japan, while recent price data have
confirmed the end of entrenched deflation and
the transition from zero interest rates has been
handled smoothly, interest rate increases going
forward should be gradual since there is little
danger of an inflationary surge, while reemergence of deflation would be costly. In the euro
area, further interest rate increases are likely to
be needed if the expansion develops as expected,
but for now inflation pressures seem broadly
contained, and faced by continuing downside
risks, policymakers can afford to be cautious in
tightening the monetary policy stance.­
Policymakers in emerging markets must also
adjust to the more testing environment, being
careful to respond promptly to any emerging
strains. A major challenge in China and some
other emerging Asian countries is to manage a
transition to more flexible exchange rates that
would allow necessary appreciation to take place
and provide more room for monetary policy
to respond to shifts in the global environment
and in domestic conditions. For similar reasons,
Russia and some other oil exporters could also
benefit from more flexible exchange rates.
Emerging market countries that rely heavily on
external financing (such as those in Eastern
Europe) or that still have high public debt (in

May 1–June 13, 2006

After a period of relative calm, volatility in
global financial markets increased sharply in the
first half of 2006. The first turbulence occurred
in late February–early March when several
Middle Eastern stock markets fell sharply. Next,
exchange rates in Iceland and New Zealand—
two countries that had built up substantial external imbalances in previous years—came under
pressure. Finally, in early May a more broadbased correction of emerging markets’ currencies and equity valuations set in, taking place in
the context of tightening monetary conditions
in the main currency areas. The sharpest corrections in asset prices were in those markets where
foreign investors had taken large exposures and
that had appreciated the most in 2005 and early
2006. Dedicated emerging market equity funds
saw outflows of $15.8 billion between mid-May
and end-June of this year, after having received
inflows of more than $50 billion between the
beginning of 2005 and mid-May 2006 (see
the first figure). Often the outflows triggered
substantial exchange rate depreciations, exceeding 10 percent (from mid-May until end-June)
in countries such as Turkey, South Africa, and
Colombia.
While this reversal of portfolio equity flows
has received considerable attention, such flows
constitute only a small share of all capital flows
to emerging market countries. Over the past
30 years, they have accounted for less than 6
percent of all net inflows, and even in 2005,
their share was only 15 percent. In comparison,
net foreign direct investment (FDI) has been
more than seven times as large over the past 20
years, and net debt flows—public and private
combined—almost nine times as large. Hence,
a broader reversal of capital flows beyond
portfolio equity investments could be far more
disruptive for emerging markets. So far, there
have been no indications that other flows have
been severely affected by recent developments:

sovereign bond spreads, for example, have
remained close to record lows.
To assess the risks of a wider reversal, it is
helpful to analyze the historical experience with
capital flows to middle- and low-income countries over the past three decades, focusing on
the three main recipient regions: East Asia andBox 1.1.1
the Pacific, emerging Europe and Central Asia,
and Latin America and the Caribbean (see the
second figure).
• Net FDI inflows have been the most stable
category, and also the most important since
the early 1990s. FDI flows do vary cyclically
around a secular increase—flows to Latin
America halved between 1999 and 2002

before recovering during the current expansion phase—but year-to-year changes have
tended to be relatively small.
• Public sector debt flows have also been fairly
stable. Moreover, their importance as a source
of financing has declined sharply in recent
years. Since 2003, public debt flows have even
turned negative, as many sovereigns have used
their improved fiscal positions to reduce external debt levels. This may help explain why
most sovereign bond spreads have remained
relatively unaffected by the recent turmoil.
• In contrast, net debt flows to the private sector have been much more volatile. There
have been three periods when private debt
flows surged rapidly: the late 1970s–early
1980s; the mid-1990s; and, more recently,
since about 2003. The first two episodes
corresponded to region-specific, boom-bust
credit cycles, culminating in the Latin American debt crisis of 1982 and the Asian financial
crisis of 1997. In both cases, net debt flows to
the private sector turned negative in the crisis
and remained so for several years, imposing
severe contractions on the affected economies. The more recent surge reflects to a
large part lending by banks in advanced economies to emerging Europe and Central Asia,
and to a lesser extent a revival of private debt
flows to East Asia, notably China. In emerging
Europe, private sector debt has replaced foreign direct investment as the primary source
of external financing; in 2005, it accounted
for 60 percent of net capital inflows.

This

drop in part reflected a slowdown in privatizations in the late 1990s and the chilling effect on
infrastructure investments of private investors’ losses
in Argentina after the crisis.
Historically, there has been a strong and positive
correlation between portfolio equity flows and private
debt flows to emerging market countries (0.78 in the
1990–2005 period). For individual regions, the correlation is not as strong, but is still positive.
In 2005, $46 billion of all net private debt flows to
Emerging Europe and Central Asia were medium- and
long-term bank loans, $32 billion short-term debt
flows, and $19 billion bond financing.

CHAPTER 1   Global Prospects and Policy Issues

Box 1.1 (concluded)
Historical experience would caution that the
recent heavy debt flows to Eastern Europe and
Asia could again prove unsustainable—even
though there are good reasons why the recent
surge may be less risky than previous ones. For
example, in China and Russia—the two countries that have received the largest private debt
inflows in recent years—risks are mitigated by
large net foreign assets of the public sector,
reflecting high reserve cushions and relatively low external debt levels. In central and
southeastern Europe, a mitigating factor is the
presence of well-supervised and largely foreignowned banks. Moreover, in some countries
progress toward joining the European Union
and the prospect of Economic and Monetary
Union (EMU) membership may boost investor
confidence sufficiently to render a reversal in
capital flows less likely.
In spite of these factors, the risks associated with the recent surge in private debt
flows should not be discounted. The debt flow

them from most other recipient countries of large
private debt inflows in recent years.

Latin America and elsewhere) will need to be
adaptable, taking advantage of opportunities to
reduce these vulnerabilities further, while being
quick to respond to adverse developments to
maintain market confidence and preserve hardwon inflation-fighting credentials.­
At the same time, reforms needed to sustain
longer-term growth should not be put on the
back burner. In most of the major advanced
economies, fiscal consolidation in the face
of aging populations remains a huge challenge. Some welcome progress has been made
in reducing high fiscal deficits over the past
three years, particularly in France, Japan, and
the United States, while Canada’s surplus has
been maintained (Table 1.3). However, for

20

reversals in Latin America in the 1980s and
in East Asia in the 1990s were also considered
unlikely—until they occurred. Many central and
eastern European countries run large current
account deficits, which would be difficult to
finance if private debt flows dried up (also see
the discussion in the Emerging Europe section
of Chapter 2). The presence of foreign banks
does not eliminate such risks: bank inflows
could suddenly stop if the parent bank decides
to reduce its exposure to the region. In the
event of a reversal, fixed exchange rates—which
remain widespread in the region—might be
difficult to maintain. Floating the exchange
rate would help to restore external balance, but
would weaken balance sheets, as a sharp depreciation would increase the burden of the private
sector’s foreign currency debts (including to the
domestic banking system), a process illustrated
by earlier experience elsewhere. Of course, vulnerabilities differ across countries, but regional
spillovers and common lender contagion could
lead to problems for the region at large. Furthermore, even if private debt inflows did not
reverse but “only” fell back to historical averages, this would still imply a substantial decline
in net external financing, and could force sharp
adjustments on many economies.

most countries, trajectories going forward look
unambitious, even assuming steady growth. As a
result, fiscal deficits and net public debt would
still be quite high at the end of the five-year
projection period (with the notable exception
of Canada), especially considering the rising
fiscal costs of an increasingly elderly population.
Italy and Japan face particularly large tasks,
while fiscal consolidation efforts in the United
States take on particular importance in light of
the need to raise national savings and contain
the current account deficit. Tackling these fiscal
concerns effectively will require setting suitably
ambitious medium-term budget objectives, as
well as addressing deep-seated issues, including putting social security systems on a sound

CHAPTER 1   Global Prospects and Policy Issues

Box 1.2. How Emerging Market Countries May Be Affected by External Shocks
While emerging market countries have
strengthened their underlying policy fundamentals during recent years, pressures on emerging
market asset prices in May–June have provided
a reminder that many of these countries remain
vulnerable to shifts in global economic and
financial conditions. This box explores these
downside risks based on some illustrative simulations for a generic Latin American country that
is exposed to these vulnerabilities. The simulations are generated from a small open economy
model that has now been calibrated for a
number of Latin American countries by IMF
staff. The results show the potential costs of
delaying policy responses to a changing external
environment for economies in Latin America
and elsewhere where inflation expectations are
not yet firmly anchored and where investor risk
perceptions can change quickly.
Underlying the simulations, it is assumed
that inflation in the United States rises by
about !/2 percentage point more than previously expected, prompting the Fed to raise the
federal funds rate by an additional 75 basis
points (see the figure). This increase dampens
growth in the United States in the short run. At
the same time, it is also assumed that investor
appetite for riskier emerging market assets is
reduced in the context of more unsettled global
financial conditions, implying a rise in the risk
premium, particularly for holding paper issued
by subinvestment grade countries.
Such an external shock could put immediate downward pressure on the exchange rate
of Latin American countries, and raise inflation expectations. Faced with this situation, a
forward-looking central bank operating under
an inflation-targeting framework would quickly
tighten the stance of monetary policy. In the
“no delay” simulation an increase in interest
Note: The authors of this box are Ricardo Adrogue
and Roberto Garcia-Saltos.

monetary policy reaction function, and a risk-adjusted
interest rate arbitrage equation. For a more detailed
description, see Berg, Karam, and Laxton (2006).

22

rates of around 200 basis points is sufficient
to limit the increase in headline year-on-year
inflation to 1 percentage point in the short
term, and then subsequently return it to its
target rate (see the figure). The tightening in
monetary conditions, combined with reduced
confidence in the context of more uncertain
international conditions would result in a more
pronounced slowdown in economic activity
than in the United States and a larger negative
output gap.
The figure also illustrates the costs of a
delayed policy response in the face of such a
shock. In this case, there would be a larger
upward shift in inflation expectations and a
sharper depreciation of the exchange rate, fueling a sustained rise in headline inflation. In the
“delayed response” simulation, it is assumed that
there is a monetary policy response only after
two quarters, and as a result the hike in interest
rates would need to be substantially greater to
bring inflation back under control. Moreover,
the delayed policy response would imply a
further deterioration in confidence. Altogether,
the economy would undergo a larger and more
protracted slowdown in this scenario.
The appropriate timing and strength of monetary policy responses to such external shocks
in emerging market countries will obviously vary
from country to country, depending, among
other things, on the track record of policy management that has been established, the extent of
balance sheet and other vulnerabilities, and the
scale of external financing needs. In countries
where long-term inflation expectations are wellanchored and there is confidence in sustained
prudent policy management, pressure on the
exchange rate may be limited, and it may not be
necessary to hike rates by more than U.S. rates.
However, in cases where monetary regimes have
a short track record or where balance sheet
vulnerabilities and external financing needs
remain more of an issue, it may be necessary
to raise rates aggressively to prevent a sustained
slide in the exchange rate, deteriorating confidence, and significant second-round effects on
inflation.­

Box 1.3. How Will Global Imbalances Adjust?
The September 2005 and April 2006 issues of
the World Economic Outlook presented alternative
scenarios for the unwinding of global imbalances
based on a four-region version of the Global
Economy Model (GEM). These illustrative
simulations have now been updated with 2006 as
the new starting point, using historic data up to
2005. The 2005 data show a further widening in
the U.S. current account deficit, while the U.S.
net foreign asset position has in fact improved
slightly due to favorable valuation effects.
“No Policies” Scenario
The “no policies” scenario assumes that
imbalances are unwound through changes in
private sector saving behavior and orderly movements in exchange rates (see first figure). The
adjustment occurs without substantial policy
changes in any of the major economies, but
depends critically on the willingness of non-U.S.
residents to hold substantial and rising amounts
of U.S. assets at relatively low interest rates.
• In the United States, the private savings rate
rises gradually as households adjust to lower
rates of increase in asset prices (and particularly the cooling of the housing market), and
U.S. output growth moderates to around
3 percent, in line with potential. Combined
with a further 15 percent real effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar, these changes slow
the growth of U.S. domestic demand, and proNote: The authors of this box are Michael Kumhof

others (2005). Parameters have been set for the model
in a way that is intended to provide a plausible and
consistent modeling of macroeconomic behavior in
the main country groups, but it should be emphasized
that judgment plays a part in this exercise, and alternative models will give different results. In particular,
the quantitative effects of U.S. fiscal consolidation on
the current account balance depend on a number
of assumptions, with some models producing smaller
effects than others. See, for example, Erceg, Guerrieri,
and Gust, 2005; and Kumhof, Laxton and Muir, 2005.
This scenario is different from the WEO baseline
scenario, in part because real effective exchange rates
are allowed to adjust rather than held constant by
assumption.

duce a steady decline in the current account
deficit to about 4 percent of GDP by 2015.
U.S. net foreign liabilities rise to 55 percent of
GDP by 2015 and would eventually stabilize at
around 85 percent of GDP in the long run.
• The main counterpart of the reduction in
the U.S. current account deficit would be
in emerging Asia. In the scenario, productivity growth in emerging Asia is assumed to
decline gradually over time to converge
toward rates in more advanced economies,
while domestic demand is boosted by a
progressive decline in the private savings rate
from current high levels. This more balanced
growth pattern is accompanied by a real effective exchange rate appreciation of about 15
percent. Accordingly, the current account
surplus declines from its recent highs of
around 5 percent of GDP to about 2 percent
of GDP by 2015. Emerging Asia therefore
maintains a rising creditor position vis-à-vis
the United States, but the trajectory of this
position is no longer explosive.
• Adjustments in the euro area and Japan and the
rest of the world are more limited. In the scenario, there are competing influences on the
real exchange rate and therefore on the current account: depreciation against emerging
Asia dominates in the short run, but is offset
in the medium term by appreciation against
the U.S. dollar. Productivity growth in the euro
area and Japan is assumed to remain sluggish
over the medium term, so that output growth
remains low. Domestic demand in the rest of
the world is boosted by rising absorption, both
investment and consumption, in oil exporters.
In summary, real exchange rate and current
account adjustments in this scenario are sizable
but orderly. However, this benign outcome

These calculations do not take into account the
possible impact of valuation changes on the net foreign asset position.
In the simulation, the rise in the real effective
exchange rate comes about as a result of higher
domestic inflation, as sterilization of the reserve buildup is assumed to be only partially effective.

1See Appendix 1.2, September 2005 World Economic Outlook for a detailed discussion of these projections. Since the no policies baseline
includes significant short-term real appreciation in Asia through higher inflation, it may overestimate the adjustment in current accounts in
the initial period.

Box 1.3.1

CHAPTER 1   Global Prospects and Policy Issues

Box 1.3 (concluded)
depends critically on two interrelated assumptions. First, foreigners are assumed to be willing
to accommodate a further very substantial
buildup in U.S. foreign liabilities, from currently less than 30 percent to ultimately around
85 percent of U.S. GDP. This would represent
a very high level of external indebtedness,
even for a large industrialized country. Second, foreigners would be willing to allocate
an increasing share of their asset portfolios
to U.S. assets without demanding a large risk
premium, even though they may face continued foreign exchange losses. As emphasized in
previous issues of the World Economic Outlook,
these assumptions may not be realistic, and it is
relevant to explore alternative scenarios based
on more pessimistic assumptions.
Disruptive Adjustment Scenario
The updated disruptive adjustment scenario
shows how a much more abrupt and disorderly
adjustment could be triggered by a worldwide
reduction in appetite for U.S. assets combined
with a significantly increased interest rate risk
premium. The decline in the demand for U.S.
assets is strongest in emerging Asia, where
policymakers are assumed to reduce the rate
of reserve accumulation and allow more rapid
exchange rate appreciation. The resulting
abrupt exchange rate realignments are assumed
to temporarily reduce global competitive pressures, implying higher wage and price markups.
With inflation rising, central banks around the
world would be prompted to raise interest rates.
• In the United States the current account deficit
contracts rapidly to 2 percent of GDP, accompanied by a drop in the currency and a sharp
increase in interest rates to combat inflationary pressures. U.S. growth declines to around
1 percent for two years as a sharp drop in
domestic demand from higher interest rates
more than offsets rising net exports.
The increase in markups could result either from
an unleashing of inflationary pressures that have been
contained by low prices of traded goods produced
in emerging Asia or from a temporary increase in
protectionist actions.

26

• Among the remaining three regions, the sharpest real exchange rate appreciation occurs
in emerging Asia, almost eliminating the
region’s current account surplus by 2010.
Growth also declines, although remaining
over 4 percent. The euro area and Japan and
the remaining countries experience similar
effects, but on a smaller scale.
• There are clear risks of even worse outcomes
than shown in the disruptive adjustment
scenario. A major concern is that a disorderly
exchange rate adjustment and global recession would risk a severe disruption in financial
markets, hurting productive capacity, depressing access to credit and aggregate demand,
and leading to asset price deflation. Another
concern is that a downturn in activity could
trigger a wave of protectionism, causing a substantial reduction in living standards across all
countries.
The Strengthened Policies Scenario
The strengthened policies scenario is based
on a menu of policies implemented across different regions of the world economy that would
significantly reduce the risk of a disorderly
adjustment (see second figure).
• Greater exchange rate flexibility in emerging Asia.
This is assumed to be accompanied by gradually reduced foreign exchange purchases by
monetary authorities and by an improvement in productivity as an increasing share
of wealth is invested in productive physical
capital inside the region.

Channels for such disruption would include
exchange rate–related valuation losses on corporate
and especially bank balance sheets, and the effect of
increased interest rate volatility on financial intermediaries through its effects on the solvency of corporate borrowers and on exposures from international
arbitrage transactions (the carry trade).
The worldwide output losses caused by such policies could be very high. For a quantitative analysis, see
Faruqee and others (forthcoming).
Policy actions other than the ones mentioned here
may be feasible, including measures to boost private
investment in some parts of Asia, and measures to
encourage private saving in the United States.

• Fiscal consolidation in the United States. The initial U.S. general government deficit of around
4 percent of GDP is assumed to be eliminated by 2012 by a combination of spending
restraint and tax increases. This reinforces
the underlying tendency for private savings to
Box 1.3.2
rise embedded in the “no policies” scenario,
allowing both a reduction in foreign liabilities
and a greater increase in the domestic physical capital stock. These shifts lower world real
interest rates by 25 basis points after 10 years,
contributing to raise growth worldwide.

• Structural reforms in the euro area and Japan.
More ambitious product and labor market
reforms are assumed to lower markups in
Europe and Japan over time, eliminating
about two-thirds of the gap with U.S. levels
over a 10-year period. This shift induces
households and firms in this region to invest
more in their economies, raising productivity
growth.
• Additional spending by oil exporters. The large
wealth transfer from higher oil prices is
assumed to be used by these economies to
increase investment and productivity (at a
greater pace than built into the baseline
scenario).
The strengthened policies scenario illustrates
the clear payoffs to joint action both in terms
of reducing imbalances and improving growth
prospects on a sustainable basis (see first figure
for comparisons with the no policies and disruptive adjustment scenarios). The negative effect
of policy action on short-run growth is limited—
substantially less severe than under the disruptive adjustment scenario—while there would
be beneficial effects for medium- and long-run
growth everywhere. This is due not only to the
direct effect of domestic policies, but also to
the spillover effects from successful policies
implemented elsewhere. Growth becomes better
balanced across regions, with the euro area and
Japan catching up and growth in emerging Asia
settling at a higher rate than in the alternative
scenarios. Growth also becomes better balanced
within each economy, with lower but more
sustainable consumption growth in the United
States and higher consumption growth in the
euro area, Japan and emerging Asia.
Under the strengthened policies scenario,
the U.S. current account deficit declines to
around 1 percent of GDP by 2015. As a result,
the buildup in U.S. net foreign liabilities is
contained at below 40 percent rather than 85
percent of U.S. GDP, implying a much reduced
risk that changes in the preferences of foreign
creditors of the United States could lead to an
abrupt adjustment that would have a very negative growth impact in all regions.

27

CHAPTER 1   Global Prospects and Policy Issues

In emerging market and developing countries
too, more needs to be done to move forward
market-oriented reforms while also taking steps
to ensure that the opportunities and the benefits of growth are broadly shared. Chapter 3 of
this report looks at the Asian growth experience
in some detail. It concludes that maintaining
the successful growth record in Asia and further
reducing poverty and income disparities will
increasingly depend on reforms that enhance
competition and flexibility, while at the same
time improving access, especially for low-income
groups, to education, health care, and a reasonable social safety net. These lessons are also very
relevant outside Asia. Corporate governance
and financial sector reforms to increase market discipline would help to ensure an efficient allocation of investment in China, while
stronger social safety nets could help support
consumption growth. Tighter financial regulation in emerging Europe would reduce vulnerabilities related to rapid credit growth. Labor
market reforms and fiscal reforms to improve
the targeting of public spending on social and
investment priorities would substantially improve
prospects for low-income groups across a range
of countries.­
High and volatile prices in world energy markets remain a major concern that will require
sustained efforts from all sides to address. Plans
for increased investment by major oil producers
in the Middle East are highly welcome. However, recent unilateral efforts to ensure national
energy security through self-sufficiency—including keeping foreign companies out of national
markets, promotion of national champions,
and rushing to secure oil fields abroad at any
cost—is a path that could increase global inefficiencies without reducing the risks to the
international community. Rather than such
“energy protectionism,” what is needed is to
make sure that markets function well, providing appropriate and predictable incentives to
producers to invest (particularly in riskier and
higher cost sources of energy), and to ensure
adequate spare capacity. Moreover, conservation
efforts should be encouraged by ensuring that

28

consumers face prices that reflect the full social
costs of energy use. Further efforts to improve
energy statistics, including more consistent and
reliable measures of petroleum reserves, would
encourage more rational and far-sighted decision-making.­
Continuing at the global level, multilateral
trade liberalization remains essential for enhancing prospects for sustained global growth. The
present deadlock in the Doha Round negotiations is deeply disappointing, and raises concerns about a resurgence of protectionism.
Renewed efforts are needed to reinvigorate
the process of multilateral trade liberalization,
guard against protectionist pressures, and avoid
over-reliance on bilateral trade agreements as
a means to advance trade liberalization. Trade
liberalization on a nondiscriminatory (i.e., most
favored nation, or MFN) basis remains the best
way to open up global growth opportunities.­
Continued attention is also needed to maintain the buildup in aid flows to the poorest
countries, to supplement their own efforts to
reach the Millennium Development Goals. Such
efforts would become doubly important if the
Doha Round cannot be resuscitated or if there
is a softening of the buoyant commodity prices
that have helped to underpin robust growth in
sub-Saharan Africa.­
As emphasized in previous issues of the World
Economic Outlook, policy actions across the major
players in the world economy would help to
ensure a smooth resolution of the problem of
global imbalances. Box 1.3 discusses how this
resolution could be achieved through a combination of steps to boost national saving in the
United States, including through a more ambitious commitment to fiscal consolidation over
the medium term; greater progress on structural
reforms in Europe and Japan; reforms to boost
domestic demand in emerging Asia (consumption in China and investment elsewhere),
together with greater exchange rate flexibility;
and increased expenditures by oil-exporting
countries in high return areas, consistent with
absorptive capacity constraints, especially in
the Middle East, where the large buildup of

Appendix 1.1. Recent Developments in Commodity Markets

investment projects already in train is welcome.
Each of these policy goals is in the best interest of the countries concerned, but progress in
advancing toward these goals has been in some
cases slower than desirable, hampered in part
by the difficulty of developing national political consensus on policy changes that will have
distributional consequences. A joint, multilateral
approach may help to advance implementation
by stressing cross-border linkages and spillovers;
providing additional reassurance that possible
risks associated with individual actions would
be alleviated by policy initiatives elsewhere; and
generating a sense of common commitment by
the world community that would provide the
best hope to ensure continued rapid global
growth and prosperity. The multilateral consultation now being undertaken by the International Monetary Fund with China, the euro
area, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and the United States
aims to help toward developing such a joint
approach.­

Appendix 1.1. Recent Developments in
Commodity Markets
The main author of this appendix is Valerie MercerBlackman, with contributions from To-Nhu Dao and
Nese Erbil.
In the first seven months of 2006, the IMF
commodities and energy price index increased
by over 15 percent in dollar terms, led by surging base metals prices (in particular copper,
zinc, and nickel). The increase was underpinned
by higher demand for commodities, driven by
robust global economic growth. Energy prices
continued to rise, albeit at a more moderate
pace, with crude oil prices posting new highs in
early August in the context of heightened tensions in the Middle East.

Crude Oil and Other Petroleum Products
Oil price increases over the past eight months
have reflected buoyant global activity, which
has tempered the response of oil demand to

higher prices, and supply concerns related to
geopolitical uncertainties. Looking forward,
with spare capacity expected to remain tight,
futures markets suggest that prices for crude oil
will remain high for the remainder of 2006 and
2007 (Figure 1.15).

Price Developments
During the first eight months of 2006, the
average petroleum spot price rose by 16 percent. The oil price rose sharply above its preKatrina peak in early May and again in early
August to reach a new record high of $76, amid
concerns related to the intensification of the
standoff over the Islamic Republic of Iran’s
nuclear program, the outbreak of fighting in
Lebanon and Israel, and the closing of a large
Alaskan oil field by British Petroleum. Continued violence in the Nigerian oil-producing
region and security threats to Iraqi oil infrastructure have also contributed to market fears about
potential supply shortages (the Islamic Republic
of Iran, Iraq, and Nigeria together export almost
four times as much as the current global spare
capacity). Announcements by some governments
of policies aimed at greater control of their oil
and gas fields (as in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Russia) have also contributed to higher uncertainty
and cautious investment behavior (see below).
However, despite these uncertainties, price
volatility does not appear to have increased (see
Figure 1.15).
Gasoline prices in OECD member countries
and in Asia have increased by 25–30 percent so
far in 2006, and in the United States in August
were only 13 percent below their record level
following hurricane Katrina. Temporary upward
pressure on margins came in part because many
U.S. refineries were still shut down or operating at reduced rates due to last year’s hurricane
damage, while others had deferred planned

because of bottlenecks created by the transition
to reformulated gasoline blended with ethanol.
Natural gas prices in the United States have continued to decline, and at end-August were below
European prices.

Oil Consumption
Global oil consumption increased by 0.5
million barrels per day (mbd) (0.6 percent) in
the first half of 2006 relative to the same period
in 2005 (Table 1.4 and Figure 1.15). Consumption in the United States fell somewhat over
this period (in part owing to one-off factors),
but still was higher than expected, with gasoline
consumption recovering strongly in the second quarter of 2006. Oil consumption growth
remained high in China (the second largest
consumer of oil) and in the Middle East, while
it fell slightly in Europe and Japan. Evidence
suggests that in countries such as Indonesia,
Malaysia, and Jordan, efforts to increase the
pass-through of global oil prices into domestic
prices, while politically difficult, have helped
dampen demand (Table 1.5). Retail gasoline
and diesel prices were also recently raised
almost 10 percent in China and India, but in
these countries the effect on household consumption in the short term is expected to be
limited.
Overall, it appears that price increases
since 2003 have had some dampening effect
on demand, but the strength of GDP growth
in many countries—especially China and the
United States—has prevented a fall in overall
consumption. This is in contrast with the significant weakening in demand observed following
the oil price hikes of 1979–80.
In China, refiners will now have a marginally higher
incentive to supply the domestic market than before, so
the easing of shortages could lead to higher consumption, which had been suppressed by rationing; while in
India, prices of kerosene—a heavily consumed domestic
fuel—were not changed.
Most studies show that the short-term price elasticity
of demand for oil is very low (on the order of 0.01 to
0.03 percent within a year), and the income effect tends
to dominate.

Oil Production and Inventories
Non-OPEC production in the first half of
2006 rose by 0.14 mbd compared to the same
period last year, somewhat lower than expected
at the beginning of this year (Figure 1.15).
Production increases came from Russia (where
production is recovering from a low in 2005),
Azerbaijan, Brazil, and non-OPEC Africa. In the
OECD region, a recovery in U.S. production
following the hurricanes was somewhat offset
by production declines in Europe, particularly
the North Sea. OPEC production fell marginally during the first half of 2006, with output
declines in Saudi Arabia and to a lesser extent
the Islamic Republic of Iran. Lower-thanplanned OPEC production mostly reflects the
situation in Nigeria, where about 0.7 mbd of
its 2.5 mbd production has been shut down
since the beginning of the year due to violence
in the Niger delta. Overall, supplies remain
tight: most analysts currently estimate readily available OPEC spare capacity at between
1–2 mbd, and much of it is of the heavy sour
crude type, which is difficult to refine (see
Figure 1.16).

Readily

available capacity excludes capacity from
Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nigeria, and
Venezuela.

OECD crude oil inventory levels remain at
historically high levels, likely reflecting strong
precautionary demand (accommodated, in part,
by OPEC’s willingness to make additional supplies available) amid perceptions that prices will
remain high and market tightness will persist.
OECD commercial crude and product stocks
increased steadily to 2.4 billion barrels in June
2006, equivalent to 54 days of forward cover
(Figure 1.16).

Short-Term Prospects and Risks
Despite signs of slowing demand in some
regions, the crude oil market is expected to
remain tight for the foreseeable future. The
International Energy Agency (IEA) has lowered
projections for global consumption growth in
2006 from 1.8 mbd early in the year to 1.2 mbd,
as increased pass-through in many countries
and sustained high prices are expected to
impact demand further. However, many analysts
are projecting somewhat higher consumption
growth above 1.3 mbd, citing continued strength
in China and the United States. Projections of
non-OPEC supply growth in 2006 range widely
from 0.6 to 1.1 mbd (the latter by the IEA), but
may prove overly optimistic as they assume a
substantial recovery in the second half of 2006.
In turn, OPEC estimates its capacity to increase
by 1 mbd by end-2006 relative to end-2005.

1Domestic gasoline prices remain significantly below international prices.

Therefore, even under optimistic scenarios for
demand and supply, global spare capacity is
likely to remain low. Refining capacity is also
expected to remain tight in 2006–07, especially
in the United States.
Against this background, futures markets suggest that oil prices would remain in the $70–75
range in 2006–07, with short-term fluctuations
driven by political developments. A sharp drop
in prices (say, to $50 a barrel) would require
either a significant fall in demand induced by
slower economic growth or (less likely), an eas-

adverse developments on the supply side, such
as further production outages in Nigeria and
Iraq, or potential supply problems in the Islamic
Republic of Iran, Venezuela, and the Gulf of
Mexico (a strong hurricane season is expected),
could push prices up further. Oil options prices

Investment by International Oil
Companies (IOCs)
It is often argued that IOCs are not doing
enough to increase investment—and thus
­capacity—to mitigate upward pressures on oil
prices. According to data on companies listed
on stock exchanges in the Group of Seven
(G-7) countries, oil and gas companies have
posted record profits in the past two years—well
above the rest of the nonfinancial corporate
sector—largely owing to the increase in energy
prices. In the United States, the oil and gas
corporate sector has almost doubled in valuation since mid-2000, well above the increase in
the total S&P index, while oil service companies,
which supply equipment and related services,
have done even better (Figure 1.17). However,
notwithstanding a significant increase in real
investment since 2000, investment levels are still
below the levels in the early 1990s, when spare

Even if the response of demand to higher
prices strengthens, rebalancing the oil markets
will depend fundamentally on supply adjustments in an industry with very long investment
cycles (5–10 years). The key in the years ahead,
therefore, is whether sufficient investment will
take place. However, both international oil
companies (IOCs) and national oil companies
(NOCs) appear to be following a cautious
approach toward investment. Medium-term forecasts by the IEA and others suggest that current
investment rates could be as much as 20 percent
below what would be necessary to satisfy future
global demand under the assumption that prices
weaken somewhat from current high levels. This
section discusses possible reasons for this cautious investment behavior and how it could be
related to the changing supply structure of the
global oil market. Data deficiencies, however, in
particular in the case of NOCs, do not permit a
conclusive statement on investment behavior.

capacity was much higher, and a large share of
profits has gone toward paying higher dividends
and acquiring new assets.11
A number of specific factors have impeded
higher investment by IOCs. First, investment
opportunities are constrained by limited access
to reserves in some oil-rich countries, while
changes in regulatory regimes and risks of
nationalization in some countries have made
returns on new investments more uncertain.
Second, in OECD countries and in others where
IOCs dominate production, existing conventional fields are going into decline, and it has
become more difficult and costly to extend their
production life. Third, following the extensive
downsizings of the 1990s, the IOCs are constrained by the availability of qualified staff and
are facing higher short-term investment costs.12
As a result, an increasing share of earnings has
been used to acquire other oil companies as a
less risky alternative to greenfield investments.
The median share of oil and gas companies’
cash earnings spent on domestic and foreign
asset acquisitions increased from 13 percent
in the 1990s to 20 percent during 2001–04.
Such acquisitions imply an increase in capital
expenditures and production capacity for an
individual IOC, but not for the global economy
as a whole.
Faced by limited opportunities in conventional
fields, the IOCs have become active in developing
alternative production sources (such as fields in
new areas or new technologies). In these areas
too, the IOCs face competition from NOCs—
including from oil-importing countries—which
in recent years have become just as active as IOCs
in acquiring foreign assets, as well as in forging

to differences in accounting standards and in the number

12This is also an issue in many NOCs (although less
so for very large oil producers where expertise has been
maintained). Moreover, there are cost pressures on equipment and other input since their suppliers are working at
full capacity.

downstream and upstream ventures abroad, creating new challenges and opportunities for IOCs
(see Box 1.4).
Investment by National Oil
Companies (NOCs)
NOCs in a number of major oil producers—particularly where financial constraints are
less binding or there is flexibility in attracting
private capital—have ratcheted up plans for
investment in the past year. Large companies—
such as Saudi Arabia’s Aramco, UAE’s ADNOC,
and Kuwait’s KPC, which can self-finance
projects and have maintained their human and
productive capital base during the lean years of
the 1990s—have developed ambitious capacity
expansion plans at all levels of the production
chain.13 Some NOCs in more fiscally strapped
countries have recently sought new ways of
accessing private sector financing and know-how,
while at the same time abiding by the constitutionally mandated prohibition of foreign ownership. NOCs such as Mexico’s Pemex, Algeria’s
Sonatrach, and the Islamic Republic of Iran’s
INOC set up “build-operate-transfer” projects
with IOCs, and have seen investment in these
projects take off very rapidly, although overall
investment has lagged.
Real investment of most other NOCs does
not appear to have recovered from the decline
in the 1990s despite a slight pickup since 2000,
although data are limited.14 Investment has
been constrained by numerous explicit and
implicit restrictions imposed by their own
governments. NOCs in many low-income, but
oil-rich, countries are often short of financial
13Aramco has already started implementing plans to
invest more than $50 billion over three to six years to
expand production by almost 20 percent and refining by
50 percent; ADNOC plans to increase production by 30
percent and KPC by 60 percent by 2020.
14Based on information on capital and exploratory
expenditures from the Oil and Gas Journal for 19 NOCs to
2004. The NOCs that publish investment data produced
about 53 percent of total NOC oil output. There is no
investment information on four major Middle Eastern
NOCs—Aramco, ADNOC, INOC and NIOC (Iraq)—and
limited data on other NOCs.

resources, because cash flow is siphoned off to
the budget—for example, through high implicit
fuel subsidies (when the domestic fuel price
for consumers is kept artificially low) and in
some cases as a result of corruption. Even where
the intentions of the government are benign,
competing objectives can lead to politically
difficult trade-offs. For example, if the government needs to undertake fiscal adjustment, it
may do so at the cost of reducing resources
available to the NOC. Dada (2005) shows that
budgetary allocations to NOCs are a significant
determinant of NOCs’ investment the following
year. Consequently, the lack of investment in
oil production infrastructure over a number of
years can imply that NOCs are not in a position
to take full advantage of potential gains from
current price levels.

Nonenergy Commodities
The IMF nonfuel commodity index rose by
19 percent in dollar terms between January and
July 2006, reaching its highest level in real terms
since 1990 (Table 1.6). Metals prices increased by
32 percent between January and July 2006 mostly
on the strength of copper, zinc, and nickel:
prices of these base metals spiked by 60–70 percent over a six-week period through early May,
then dropped by 25 percent by end-June. Metal
prices are expected to fall further in the second
half of 2006, but are still projected to show a 45
percent increase for 2006 relative to 2005.

While demand remains strong, supply concerns have also contributed to high and volatile
prices. Many producers, particularly of copper,
zinc, and nickel, have been affected by deteriorating ore quality, production disruptions
caused by outages and earth slides, and labor
disputes. Moreover, global inventories remain at
historically low levels, while the introduction of
new capacity has been delayed because of high
energy and equipment costs and labor shortages. A surge in investor interest in commodities has come hand in hand with the tightening
of market conditions, but empirical analysis by
IMF staff suggests that speculative activity—measured as the number of net long noncommercial
positions—has followed rather than been the
cause of the high price levels (see Chapter 5,
Box 5.1). Looking forward, despite an expected
capacity increase in metals this year, the tight
market situation will probably continue into late
2007–early 2008, until sufficient new capacity
comes into operation.
The food price index rose 11 percent between
January–July 2006 (Figure 1.18). Unfavorable
weather conditions early this year reduced grain
production significantly, while demand continued at record highs, drawing down already
low global stocks. Seafood prices rose sharply
during this period, largely on robust demand
in European countries. Beverage prices fell by 2
percent in the first seven months, due mostly to
increases in coffee supplies. Looking ahead, for
2006 as a whole, food prices are expected to rise
by 8 percent, while beverage prices will increase
by less than 2 percent.
The agricultural raw material price index rose
4 percent between January and July 2006, led
by natural rubber and hardwood prices. Natural
rubber shortages in 2005 have been extended
into 2006 and pushed prices up by 33 percent,
in part because continued high oil prices have
boosted prices of synthetic rubber. Hardwood
prices continued their gain from 2005, mainly as
a result of strong Chinese demand. Raw materials prices are expected to ease in the second
half of 2006, but still increase 5 percent overall
in 2006.

Appendix 1.1. Recent Developments in Commodity Markets

Semiconductors
In the first half of 2006, semiconductor
demand was stronger than anticipated, mainly
in the consumer electronic product sectors
(Figure 1.19). Total worldwide sales revenues
grew by 9 percent year-on-year, particularly in
the Americas and the Asia-Pacific regions, on
surging volume growth; the number of units
sold rose 8 percent, while prices rose slightly.
The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)
has revised up its forecast for growth in worldwide semiconductors sales, to 10 percent in
2006, and expects sales growth to continue at
around this pace in 2007 before slowing down
in early 2008.
The fastest-growing global major end-market
segment is cellular telephones, especially thirdgeneration (3G) phones. This segment is now
second only to personal computers in terms of
total chip consumption. Other major drivers
of demand for semiconductors include digital
cameras, digital television, and MP3 players,
with increasing demand for products using flash
memory.15 Indeed, the explosive growth in flash
memory demand has drained traditional capital
from the DRAM market, which has consequently
had limited capacity expansion.
Continuing high demand and tight capacity utilization rates have led to surging investment in the semiconductor industry. Capital
expenditure, in particular in the Asia-Pacific,
is expected to increase 16 percent worldwide
in 2006. Despite adequate inventory levels,
new construction and upgrades of foundries
continue, with more than one-third of all new
capacity planned in 2007 for flash memory
production. Concerns have thus been raised by
industry analysts about too much capacity coming online at the end of 2006, in particular if a
slowdown in major consumer markets impacts
equipment spending.

CHAPTER 1   Global Prospects and Policy Issues

Box 1.4. International and National Oil Companies in a Changing Oil Sector Environment
The increasing importance of national oil
companies (NOCs) has brought new challenges
and potential opportunities for international
oil companies (IOCs). This box discusses the
changing relationship between IOCs and NOCs,
and suggests that improved partnership between
the two—taking better advantage of each
other’s strengths and needs—would strengthen
prospects for increasing investment in the oil
sector as a whole.­
The structure of NOCs and their governance
and partnership arrangements with IOCs vary
considerably. Oil production growth in 2000–05
has generally been higher in countries where
IOCs’ presence is greater. The bulk of world
reserves are in countries with majority NOC
control. However, the regulatory quality of the
government is lower in this group of countries
(this remains true if only developing countries
are compared; see table).­
The global oil industry continues to have an
oligopolistic structure, but the importance of
NOCs in the control of production has risen
dramatically. Twenty national and international
oil companies own almost 80 percent of the
world’s proven reserves. Significantly, the top
four—which own 60 percent of the world’s
reserves—are NOCs from Saudi Arabia, the
Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait with
full ownership and control of their oil wells.
Moreover, some NOCs are quickly expanding outside their borders. Companies like
PetroChina, Petronas, and Petrobras, formerly
exclusively involved in domestic production,
have won lucrative international contracts.
NOCs from oil-importing countries such as
China, Japan, and India have been very active in
forging foreign upstream ventures and acquiring foreign assets, a behavior akin to traditional
major IOCs. The difference is that these strate-

Most NOCs are fully publicly owned, although
some NOCs (such as Brazil’s Petrobras, China’s Sinopec, and Oman’s PDO) have some private ownership.
When oil companies forge joint ventures, typically
a new company or subsidiary is created with equal
ownership rights of each partner.

gies are often driven by their countries’ energy
security policies. The distinction between types
of companies is also becoming blurred. It is not
uncommon to have a project run as a joint venture where the partners are a subsidiary of the
host NOC, an IOC, and a foreign NOC.­
Partnerships among different types of companies should, in theory, allow each side to
contribute its strengths, but in practice differences between major IOCs and large NOCs
make such unions rare. Part of the explanation
may have to do with fundamentally different
and clashing objectives between the two, as
suggested in Marcel (2006). IOCs want access
to equity, acceptable rates of return, and incentives for enhanced recovery. NOCs, for their
part, want access to the managerial, technical,
and financial expertise of IOCs without having to give up ownership and control of their

References

national reserves. NOC managers sometimes
express concern that IOCs have a tendency
to over produce fields in a quest to satisfy the
short-term expectations of their shareholders,
and that in the past they have not received the
full benefits of production-sharing agreements.
A number of governments have recently altered
contracting laws and production-sharing rules
with foreign investors so as to increase control
over their resources to varying degrees (as in
Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Russia). For
their part, IOCs have expressed frustration
about changing “rules of the game,” project
Indeed, this may partly explain why profitability
of international oil service companies has been even
higher than oil and gas exploration and production
companies since 2002 (see Figure 1.17); their services
are in high demand by NOCs because they provide
the know-how without generating competition for the
NOC assets.

risks associated with unpredictable political and

Well-designed partnerships could lead to
increasing investment levels in the oil industry as
a whole, especially if the risks and returns from
the production venture are appropriately distributed. Given that NOCs today own the majority of
the world’s reserves, IOCs are coming to terms
with the reality that their future activity may
have to increasingly take place in partnerships
in which profits and control must be shared. In
turn, governments of NOCs will have to work to
provide a more stable and transparent investment environment and stronger governance
of NOCs. Once these frictions are worked out,
global investment in the sector would be better
placed to respond to price incentives.­

United States and Canada: Inflationary
Pressures Are Beginning to Rise
Following exceptionally strong growth in
early 2006, the pace of expansion in the United
States has subsequently moderated. The advance
GDP estimate for the second quarter suggests
that growth slowed to 2.9 percent, from 5.6
percent in the first quarter. Private consumption
growth weakened against the background of
higher interest rates, a cooling housing market,
high gasoline prices, and lackluster employment gains. Business investment in equipment
and software was also surprisingly weak, but
net exports contributed positively to growth as
imports slowed. For the year as a whole, growth
is projected at 3.4 percent, before slowing to 2.9
percent in 2007 (0.4 percentage points below
that expected at the time of the April 2006 World
Economic Outlook; see Table 2.1). Underlying
this forecast is the expectation that consumption and residential investment growth will slow
further as the housing market weakens, but that
business investment should rebound against
the background of strong profits and limited
spare capacity. Risks, however, are slanted to the
downside.­
The most likely source of headwinds in the
short term is the housing market. Rising house
prices have provided a significant boost to con-

sumption, residential investment, and employment in recent years, but the market now looks
overvalued and, as mortgage rates have risen,
activity has slowed. Mortgage applications have
declined sharply from their peak, the supply
of homes on the market is rising, homebuilder
confidence has fallen to a 15-year low, and
house price appreciation has slowed. A further
cooling of the market would dampen residential
investment and consumption, including through
a decline in confidence, a drop in home equity
withdrawal, and lower employment in the real
estate and related sectors. The impact of slowing house price appreciation on consumption
would be reinforced by a further decline in
equity prices or an increase in gasoline prices.­
Despite the recent slowing in growth, inflationary pressures have begun to edge up as
excess capacity in product and labor markets
has diminished (and actually been eliminated
on some measures), energy prices have risen
and begun to feed through into some other
prices (particularly transportation), and the
restraining effect that globalization has had on
inflation in recent years has faded (Figure 2.1).
The year-on-year increase in the price of a new single
family home slowed from over 11 percent in September
2005 to 11/2 percent in July 2006. The sales price of existing homes, as measured by the Office of Federal Housing
Enterprises Oversight (OHFEO), has so far decelerated
less dramatically, from a peak of 14 percent in June 2005
to 10 percent in the second quarter of 2006, but other
more frequent measures of existing home prices have
slowed sharply.
See Box 1.2 of the April 2006 World Economic Outlook
for an analysis of house prices in industrial countries and
the possible impact of a sharp slowing in house price
appreciation in the United States on growth. Specifically,
the analysis suggested that a slowing in the rate of real
house price appreciation from 10 percent to zero could
reduce growth in the United States by up to 2 percentage
points after one year.

Outlook for an analysis of the impact of globalization on

Headline and core (excluding food and energy)
CPI inflation rates have moved higher—indeed
the core CPI increased by 3.5 percent (annualized rate) during May–July 2006, the fastest pace
since mid-1995—and inflation expectations have
risen, albeit modestly. Wage gains has also accelerated, and with productivity growth slowing,
unit labor cost growth has picked up.­
Against this background, the Federal Reserve
increased the Federal funds rate by 25 basis
points to 5.25 percent at its June policy meeting
but left rates unchanged at its August meeting,
while cautioning that inflation risks remain. The
future path of the monetary policy stance is now

42

dependent on what incoming data suggest about
the balance of the competing risks to growth
and inflation. Nevertheless, given the importance of keeping inflation expectations firmly in
check, some further policy tightening may still
be needed. There will also be a premium on the
Federal Reserve clearly communicating its policy
intentions, and a more explicit statement of its
medium-term inflation objective may be helpful
in this regard.­

and increased private saving—is a key component of the multilateral strategy to reduce
global imbalances (Table 2.2). Encouragingly,
recent fiscal performance has been better than
expected, largely because of unexpected revenue
buoyancy, the permanency of which remains to
be seen. The U.S. administration now expects to
achieve its goal of halving the federal deficit by
FY2008, a year ahead of schedule. Nevertheless,
much remains to be done, given that a number
of factors not fully reflected in the administration’s forecast could boost the deficit (including ­pressures to curtail the rising impact of the

Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT, and the costs
of the ongoing military operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan). Setting a more ambitious deficit
reduction path—for example, a goal of achieving budget balance (excluding social security)
over the next five years, requiring fiscal consolidation of some #/4 percent of GDP a year—would
help provide a firmer basis for the United States
to face future demographic pressures, put the
budget in a stronger position to respond to
future economic downturns, and help reduce
global imbalances. The likely impact that this
accelerated fiscal consolidation would have on
growth—both domestically and overseas—in
the short term could be partly mitigated if it
were part of joint policy action to tackle global
imbalances and if it provided scope for an easier
monetary policy stance (see Chapter 1, Box 1.3).­
The focus of fiscal consolidation appropriately remains on the expenditure side, although
the unprecedented and back-loaded compression of discretionary non-defense spending
already assumed in the budget will make
further savings difficult. Revenue measures
therefore should not be ruled out, particularly
initiatives that broaden the revenue base—
including a reduction in tax preferences, such
as for mortgage interest and other proposals by
the President’s Commission on Tax Reform—or
help achieve other objectives, such as higher
taxes on energy that would lower oil consumption. Fiscal consolidation needs to be supported
by entitlement reform to put the Social Security
and Medicare systems on a sustainable longterm footing in the face of population aging
and rising health care costs.­
Regarding private saving, some increase
is already built into the projections as the
housing market slows. In terms of policies,
the administration has introduced health
saving accounts that should raise incentives
for household saving. Recently passed pension legislation will also help in this regard,
both by making it easier for employers to
offer defined-contribution (401(k)) plans
that require employees to “opt-out” rather
than “opt-in,” which should lead to higher

44

enrollment in such plans, and by requiring companies to reduce funding gaps in
their defined-benefit pension plans. Moving
to a tax system with a greater reliance on a
consumption tax rather than taxes on income
would also increase incentives to save, while
greater transparency about likely future
shortfalls in the social security system and
in private pension plans may increase awareness of the need for higher saving to ensure
adequate retirement income.­
The Canadian economy continues to perform robustly, benefiting from its strong macroeconomic policy framework and the boom in
global commodity prices. The main risks to the
outlook are external, including the possibility
of a sharper-than-expected slowing in the U.S.
economy and a disorderly adjustment of global
imbalances that could result in a substantial further appreciation of the Canadian dollar. With
wage growth decelerating and CPI inflation well
contained, the Bank of Canada recently halted
the process of monetary tightening that had
begun in September 2005. A strong fiscal position remains at the center of the new government’s economic policies, with the FY2006/07
budget including welcome commitments to
lower public debt (to 25 percent of GDP by
FY2013/14), contain expenditure growth, and
reduce the tax burden on the corporate sector.­

Western Europe: Structural Reforms
Remain the Key to Stronger Growth
Economic activity in Western Europe is
strengthening. In the euro area, the recovery
has gained further traction, with real GDP
growth accelerating to 3.6 percent (annualized
rate) in the second quarter of 2006. Growth is
increasingly being driven by domestic demand,
particularly investment. Second quarter growth
accelerated in Germany—helped by a boost
from the World Cup—and France, and remained
robust in Spain. In the United Kingdom, where
the economic cycle is more advanced, growth was
around 3 percent in the first half of 2006. Robust
employment creation and the stabilization of

Western Europe: Structural Reforms Remain the Key to Stronger Growth

the housing market underpinned consumption
spending, while investment remained strong.­
Looking forward, recent indicators suggest that
the pace of expansion in the euro area should
be sustained during the second half of 2006, and
real GDP growth is now projected at 2.4 percent
for the year as a whole, up from 1.3 percent in
2005, before slowing to 2 percent in 2007. Corporate investment is expected to remain buoyant—
among the three largest economies, this pickup
should be strongest in Germany, where profitability has recovered and corporate restructuring is well advanced, and weakest in Italy where
corporate debt is still rising and profitability is
weaker. Consumption growth is expected to be
more moderate given modest employment and
wage growth (the announced 3 percentage point
increase in the VAT rate in Germany is expected
to boost consumption in late 2006 and reduce it
in early 2007). In the United Kingdom, growth
is expected at 2.7 percent this year and next,
broadly in line with potential.­
There are a number of uncertainties to
the outlook. On the upside, robust business
confidence in the euro area could generate
stronger-than-expected investment and employment growth. On the downside, against the
background of large global imbalances, Europe
remains exposed to the possibility of sharp currency appreciation that could undercut exports
and investment in the traded goods sector and
impose capital losses on holders of U.S. dollar
assets. Further increases in energy prices would
reduce disposable incomes and slow consumption, while recent falls in equity markets, if
sustained, could also weigh on business and consumer confidence going forward. Lastly, house
prices in Spain, Ireland, and the United Kingdom still look elevated, and could come under
pressure in a rising interest rate environment.­
A critical challenge for Europe is to ensure
that the current cyclical upswing translates into
a sustained and long-lasting expansion so that it
can deal effectively with the domestic problems
it faces—particularly the need to strengthen
fiscal positions ahead of the onset of population
aging—and contribute to an orderly unwind-

ing of global imbalances. Over the past decade,
growth in Europe has fallen short of that in
the United States (although some individual
countries have outperformed the United
States). Although increases in labor utilization
have been similar—with a stronger rise in the
employment ratio in Europe offset by a larger
decline in hours worked—productivity growth
has declined in Europe while it has increased
in the United States (Figure 2.2). The decline
in productivity growth in Europe is widespread
across sectors, reflecting extensive product and
labor market regulations that limit competition
and impede the movement of resources between
industries in response to technological change
and globalization. Indeed, in the United Kingdom where labor and product market reforms
are relatively advanced, productivity growth
has been stronger. The productivity growth
differential with the United States, however,
has been particularly large in three sectors—
manufacturing, financial services (and more
so if the insurance subsector is excluded), and
retail/wholesale—where substantial gains have
been achieved in the United States as a result
of industry consolidation and the greater use of
information technology.
Under the Lisbon Strategy, EU countries have
agreed to address existing impediments to stronger productivity growth, but implementation
needs to be accelerated, particularly in sectors
where productivity growth in Europe is lagging.
For example, under the European Commission’s
See Inklaar, O’Mahony, and Timmer (2005) and
Timmer and van Ark (2005), for detailed analyses of how
differences in producing and using information technology have affected productivity differentials between the
United States and Europe. On the other hand, Gordon
and Dew-Becker (2005), argue that the productivity slowdown in Europe is too widespread to be solely due to IT.
Chapter IV In the April 2003 World Economic Outlook
(“Unemployment and Labor Market Institutions: Why
Reforms Pay Off”) found that labor and product market
reforms could increase real GDP in the euro area by
10 percent in the long run. A report by the European
Commission (2005) found that the implementation of
reforms in the Lisbon strategy could increase potential
growth in the European Union by around 3/4 percentage
point a year.

Financial Services Action Plan considerable
progress has been made in the integration
and harmonization of the financial sector, but
further steps are needed to reduce barriers
to competition across Europe. These include
speeding up the integration of payments, clearing, and settlement systems, reducing obstacles
to cross-border mergers—including by reducing
differences in legal, regulatory, and supervisory
frameworks across countries—reducing state
involvement in the financial system, and integrating mortgage markets. In the retail sector,
the easing of regulations that limit the establishment of new stores and impede cross-border
competition would boost efficiency.­
Fiscal outcomes in the euro area were generally better than expected in 2005, with the
aggregate deficit declining by !/2 percent of GDP.
A more modest fiscal adjustment is expected this
year based on published budgets, and two countries (Italy and Portugal) are expected to have
fiscal deficits in excess of 3 percent of GDP. In
Italy, the fiscal situation is particularly difficult,
with the general government deficit projected
at 4 percent of GDP this year, although strong
revenue growth provides scope to achieve a better outcome if expenditure is firmly controlled.
Turning to 2007, on current policies little
change is projected in the deficit, and achieving
the targeted reduction to 2.8 percent of GDP
will depend on the implementation of structural
fiscal reforms covering key expenditure areas.­
The current upswing provides an important
opportunity for policymakers to make progress
in further reducing fiscal deficits. Under the
reformed Stability and Growth Pact (SGP),
most countries in the euro area are aiming for
budget balance or even a small surplus over
the medium term. Yet how such consolidation
will be achieved remains largely unspecified,
and firm plans still need to be put in place to
give credibility to these commitments. Welfare
reforms and reductions in the government wage
bill are key, not only to lower deficits, but also to
provide room to cut taxes on labor and thereby
boost employment. In Spain, while the budget
is in surplus, a tighter short-term fiscal policy

Japan: Monetary Policy Adjusts to the End of Deflation

stance would help contain existing demand
pressures.­
Population aging will put heavy pressure
on pension and healthcare spending over the
medium term, with European Commission
estimates suggesting that age-related spending will rise by close to 4 percent of GDP by
2050. Reforms to pension systems are under
way in France, Germany, and Italy—yet more
will be needed. An important dynamic of pension reforms is that demographic change—by
increasing the political weight of older persons
who may have the most to lose—could make the
implementation of such reforms more difficult
in the future.­
Turning to monetary policy, with inflation
running above its “below but close to” 2 percent
objective, credit growth remaining strong, and
the economic recovery solidifying, the European Central Bank has appropriately withdrawn
monetary stimulus, raising interest rates by a
cumulative 100 basis points since December.
Looking forward, further interest rate increases
will likely be needed to maintain price stability
over the medium term if the expansion develops
as expected. But, with underlying inflationary
pressures still well contained—unit labor costs
are subdued, core inflation (excluding food and
energy) is around 1!/2 percent, and inflation
expectations are well-anchored—policymakers
can afford to be cautious in tightening the monetary policy stance, all the more so given the risk
of euro appreciation and weaker growth in the
United States.­
In the United Kingdom, after holding its
policy rate constant for a year, the Bank of England raised its rate in early August by 25 basis
points to 4.75 percent. Future monetary policy
decisions are delicately balanced. While risks to
aggregate demand are skewed to the downside,
particularly in 2007, there is also a possibility
that energy price increases may yet give rise
to second-round effects on inflation. On fiscal
policy, the budget deficit is expected to narrow
slightly, reflecting strong revenues from higher
energy prices and the booming financial sector.
Over the medium term, fiscal consolidation will

depend critically on restraint of current spending, the plans for which are being developed
as part of the 2007 Comprehensive Spending
Review. The fiscal position in the United Kingdom is less sensitive to population aging than
elsewhere in the European Union, but with the
public pension being considerably less generous than in other European countries, concerns
have centered on whether individuals are saving
enough to provide an adequate retirement
income. As suggested by the Pensions Commission, the introduction of a national defined
contribution scheme with automatic enrollment
and low operating costs may be useful to boost
private savings.­

Japan: Monetary Policy Adjusts to the
End of Deflation
In Japan, after a solid first quarter, real
GDP growth eased in the second quarter of
2006, owing primarily to inventory decumulation, a sharp contraction in public investment,
and drag from net exports. Nevertheless, the
expansion remains well-founded as private
final domestic demand, the main driving force
since 2005, has grown at a solid pace. Private
fixed investment in particular continues to be
buoyant, underpinned by robust profits and
a turnaround in bank credit, while private
consumption is increasing at a more moderate
rate, as labor income gains have been modest.
Growth is projected at 2.7 percent for 2006 as
a whole, moderating to just above 2 percent
in 2007. The near-term risks to the outlook
are broadly balanced. On the upside, growth
could be boosted by stronger-than-expected
domestic demand, as confidence remains high
and the pace of household income growth may
pick up with the continued expansion. On the
downside, the economy is vulnerable to adverse
external developments, including a further rise
in oil prices, a cooling U.S. economy, or a sharp
appreciation of the yen against the backdrop of
a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances.­
Indications are growing that after seven years
of falling prices, Japan has finally escaped from

Deflation Risks

(Percent change from a year ago unless otherwise stated)
The future path of policy interest rates in Japan needs to balance risks of deflation
against those of rising inflation. Measures of expected future inflation suggest that
inflation remains well anchored at low levels. At the same time, some deflation risks
remain.

entrenched deflation. Year-on-year changes in
the headline and core CPI have been positive
in recent months, with core inflation at about
!/4 percent. Producer prices have led the CPI
transition by about one and a half years because
of global price increases for raw materials and
industrial supplies. While the GDP deflator
continues to decline on a year-on-year basis
(although primarily reflecting higher prices
of commodity imports), changes in the final
domestic demand deflator have begun to enter
positive territory.­
With the expansion now well established and
favorable prospects for low, but steady, inflation in 2006–07, the normalization of monetary
policy has become the key near-term macroeconomic policy challenge. Since March 2006, the
Bank of Japan has largely reversed the extrainjection of bank liquidity under its former
policy of quantitative easing. The nominal
policy rate, which was raised to 25 basis points
in mid-July after having been pegged at zero
since early 2001, will eventually have to be raised
further to more normal levels. However, with
actual inflation barely positive and estimates of
trend inflation—a measure of expected average inflation—just above zero, risks of a relapse
into deflation in response to an adverse shock,
such as a substantial slowing in global growth,
cannot be ignored (Figure 2.3). The future path
of the policy interest rate, therefore, needs to
carefully balance the risks of a return to deflation against those of the possibility of accelerating inflation. The risks of the latter at this stage
appear limited given that inflation expectations
are anchored at very low levels, unit labor cost
growth is subdued, and the very rapid expansion
of base money until recently has not translated
into strong broad liquidity and/or credit growth.­
Against this background, the Bank of Japan
appropriately plans to err on the side of caution
and raise policy rates gradually. In support of
such an approach, it would be helpful for the
Bank of Japan to define its medium-term inflation goals clearly so as to avoid any uncertainty
about its intentions. Recently, the central bank
has reported that the “understanding of price

Emerging Asia: China’s Growth Spurt Benefits the Region But Carries Risks

stability among members of the Policy Board”
is annual CPI inflation of 0 to 2 percent. This
range, however, is not a target to be achieved
over a pre-set time horizon, and it will be
reviewed annually. As inflation becomes established, it would be desirable for the range (or its
floor) to rise over time since a lower bound of
zero for the range would leave open a risk that
adverse disturbances could push the economy
back into deflation. In addition, more explicit
communication on the risks and policies at the
lower end of the current range for inflation
would guide market expectations and further
clarify the Bank of Japan’s policy intentions.­
Restoring fiscal sustainability is the key
medium-term macroeconomic policy challenge.
Despite fiscal adjustment during 2003–05—the
deficit (excluding social security) was reduced
by about 3 percentage points to 5.3 percent of
GDP in 2005—gross and net public debt continue to rise and, at around 180 and 90 percent
of GDP, respectively, are among the highest
in industrial countries. Current fiscal policy
plans aim to achieve a primary surplus for the
central and local government by FY2011. This
adjustment, however, would not be sufficient to
stabilize net government debt over the six-year
period, given current estimates of potential output growth, which are depressed by the low rate
of labor force growth (see Chapter 3, Box 3.1).
IMF staff estimates suggest that an additional
adjustment of about 2 percent of GDP over this
period would be necessary to stabilize net debt,
an important objective given the high public
debt ratios and prospects of growing pressures
on expenditure from the rapidly aging population. While adjustment measures so far have
been concentrated on the expenditure side,
future efforts likely would need to include some
revenue measures. Raising the consumption
tax rate, which is currently low by international
standards, and broadening the income tax base
would help to generate revenues with the least
adverse effects on underlying growth.­
Structural fiscal reforms should be complemented by broader reform efforts aimed at
raising productivity growth. If appropriately

designed, such a package would have a mutually
reinforcing impact on fiscal sustainability. The
priorities are reforms of government financial
institutions—the impending privatization of
Japan Post is a welcome step forward; steps to
strengthen competition in the services sector
(e.g., by facilitating market access in the retail
sector); and enhanced labor market flexibility
(including through higher female labor force
participation, and increased pension portability to bolster mobility across firms and sectors).
It will also be important to fully complete the
financial and corporate sector reform agenda.
Leverage in the nonfinancial corporate sector
has declined substantially, but it remains high by
international standards—especially in small and
medium-size enterprises outside the manufacturing sector—and higher corporate profitability
partly reflects very low nominal interest costs.
Similarly, while balance sheets of large banks
have improved with declines in nonperforming loans, progress by regional banks has been
more limited, and bank profitability, while
improved, remains below average in international comparison.­

Emerging Asia: China’s Growth Spurt
Benefits the Region but Carries Risks
Growth continues to run above 8 percent
in emerging Asia, with much of the momentum due to vibrant expansions in China and
India (Table 2.3). In China, real GDP grew by
11.3 percent (year-on-year) in the second quarter
of 2006, with a renewed acceleration in investment growth and surging net exports. In the
newly industrialized economies (NIEs), growth
has strengthened since mid-2005 with a pickup
in exports, especially of electronic goods due
to rapid growth in China and the strong global
economy. In contrast, growth has started to slow
in most of the ASEAN-4 countries, owing mainly
to the effects of higher oil prices and monetary
policy tightening in response to rising inflation.­
The outlook is for continued strong growth
of 8!/4 percent in 2006–07—about !/2 percentage point higher than projected at the time

of the last World Economic Outlook—reflecting
more favorable global economic conditions,
continued high growth in China, and moderate
deceleration in India after the strong momentum in 2005 and early 2006. Growth in the NIEs
is set to slow, especially in 2007, when growth
in the import demand of advanced economies
is projected to decelerate. In contrast, a modest
rebound in activity is expected in the ASEAN-4
countries as the factors behind the recent slowing recede.­
The near-term risks to the outlook are broadly
balanced for the region, albeit with some differences across countries, depending on external
and financial vulnerabilities on the one hand
and on the exposure to growth in the advanced
economies on the other. On the upside, there
is the possibility of even faster-than-projected
growth in China—if the recent pace is maintained—and in India. A higher growth rate in
China would elevate growth elsewhere in the
region—but especially in Hong Kong SAR,
Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines, Singapore,
and Thailand—given the strengthening intra-

50

regional trade linkages (Figure 2.4). On the
downside, risks include the possibility of an
investment boom-bust cycle in China and its
regional impact, higher oil prices, the heightened threat of protectionist action in advanced
economies following the deadlock of the Doha
Round, an outbreak of an avian flu pandemic,
and slower growth in the advanced economies,
especially Japan and the United States. The latter remain the final destinations for a substantial
share of the region’s final goods exports, and
business cycle fluctuations in the United States
and Japan still affect the region to a considerable degree, especially in the NIEs. In addition,
tighter monetary policy to head off inflationary
pressures may lower growth prospects in the
region. The region would also be vulnerable to
a deterioration in international financial market
conditions, although, compared to other market
regions and their own past, most economies in
emerging Asia generally now seem better positioned to weather such a deterioration. External
vulnerabilities in particular have been substantially reduced throughout the region, given per-

Emerging Asia: China’s Growth Spurt Benefits the Region But Carries Risks

sistent current account surpluses and substantial
reserve accumulation in recent years.­
Headline inflation has increased with higher
oil prices, but most countries have succeeded
so far in restraining core inflation with quite
small increases in nominal policy rates, helped
by real currency appreciation that reflects strong
external positions, although price controls and
energy subsidies have also contributed in some
countries. Together with declining currency risk
premiums, this has provided for narrowing real
interest differentials against the major currencies, and the generally low real interest rates
throughout the region have supported domestic
demand. However, to head off risks of rising
inflation, policymakers in the region may need
to respond to increasing interest rates in the
major currencies areas—especially Japan—and
to more testing international financial market
conditions, with some likely adverse effects on
growth. In India, inflation has picked up with
rising oil prices and strong domestic demand.
While the Reserve Bank of India has raised interest rates in recent months, further tightening
may be needed to resist inflationary pressures.­
With robust domestic demand growth in
many countries and high oil prices, the regional
current account surplus is expected to moderate by about !/2 of a percentage point to around
4!/4 percent of GDP in 2006–07. Within the
region, current account performance varies
considerably. In Korea and, more recently,
­Indonesia, current account surpluses have
declined, while Thailand and India have experienced a turnaround to a deficit. In all of these
countries, exchange rate flexibility has increased
in the past two years, often in the context of
inflation-targeting monetary policy frameworks,
while domestic demand has begun to play a
more prominent role in output growth. Nevertheless, private investment remains relatively
weak in many countries, and reforms aimed
at enhancing the business environment are
particularly important at this juncture. Priorities
include measures to deepen and integrate capital markets across the region and steps to lower
regulatory burdens.­

Figure 2.4. Emerging Asia: The Regional Impact of
China's Rapid Growth
The strong growth momentum in emerging Asia owes much to vibrant growth in
China, given its increasingly prominent role in intraregional trade, and India.
Nevertheless, growth fluctuations in the advanced economies still have a
considerable impact on fluctuations in the region, since markets in the advanced
economies remain important destinations for the region’s exports of final goods.

CHAPTER 2   Country and Regional Perspectives

In contrast, China’s current account surplus
continued to rise in 2005 and the first half of
2006 and now accounts for some 70 percent
of the regional surplus of about $260 billion
(annual basis). Structural factors, including
capacity expansion in sectors producing import
substitutes, account for some of the rise in
­China’s surplus, but continued exceptionally
strong export growth has also contributed.
While there has been some limited flexibility in
the renminbi exchange rate in recent months,
in current circumstances—with the large current account surplus continuing to rise and
capital inflows remaining strong—more substantial appreciation of the currency would help to
reduce the current account surplus and give
the central bank greater control of domestic
monetary conditions. The central bank’s current
focus on limiting renminbi fluctuations against
the dollar makes effective liquidity control difficult, and direct measures of monetary control
and limited interest rate increases have not been
sufficient to restrain strong credit growth. The
latter has contributed to concerns about the
possibility of an investment boom-bust cycle,
as the current exceptionally rapid investment
growth could lead to overcapacity, falling profits,
and balance sheet problems in the corporate
and financial sectors. The move toward greater
exchange rate flexibility would have to be supported by a continuation of the complementary
financial sector reform currently under way,
which would strengthen the economy’s capacity
to cope with greater interest rate and exchange
rate movements. Exchange rate appreciation
would also bolster households’ purchasing
power, which, together with reforms to the pension, health, and education systems and to the
financial sector, would boost consumption.
Policymakers across the region should take
advantage of the broadly favorable growth
outlook to implement structural reforms aimed

See Chapter 5 of the IMF’s September 2006 Regional
Outlook for the Asia and Pacific region for evidence of
lower-than-expected consumption in China against a
benchmark estimate based on standard determinants.

at promoting fiscal sustainability and reducing
vulnerabilities. In countries with high public
debt and/or budget deficits (particularly India,
Pakistan, and the Philippines), fiscal positions
need to be put on a sustainable medium-term
footing. In the Philippines and, to a lesser
extent, Indonesia, the structure of public debt is
associated with foreign currency risks, and continued fiscal consolidation and improvements in
the composition of this debt would contribute
to reducing the vulnerability to swings in global
investor sentiment and enhance monetary policy
credibility. In India, strong spending pressures
have emerged, limiting fiscal adjustment in
FY2006/07 after more substantial consolidation
in recent years. With the general government
deficit and debt still high, further consolidation
is clearly warranted at both the central and state
government levels, including through measures
aimed at broadening the tax base and reducing
subsidies.­
Asia has benefited from impressive high
growth over an extended period. Chapter 3,
“Asia Rising: Patterns of Economic Development and Growth,” analyzes this experience and
looks at the policy implications. Drawing on the
experience of fast-growing Asian countries at
various stages of the catch-up process, it argues
that policymakers need to meet a number of
challenges to ensure that rapid growth in the
region is sustained. First, steps to promote trade
openness, widespread access to education, and
financial sector development and to encourage
entrepreneurship (such as reducing the costs of
starting a business) will be important to facilitate
the continued shift of resources out of agriculture to industry and services. Second, productivity growth in the services sector would be
boosted by policies to strengthen market access
and competition. Third, Asian countries that
are the least advanced in the catch-up process
can learn from the experience of other countries in the region, including the important role
that institutional quality, financial development,
business climate, and trade openness play in
creating a favorable environment conducive to
capital accumulation and productivity growth.­

Latin America: Continuing to
Build Resilience
The economic expansion in Latin America
gathered momentum in the first half of this
year, with regional GDP on track to rise by 4#/4
percent in 2006 as a whole and by 4!/4 percent
in 2007 (Table 2.4). Moreover, inflation largely
remained subdued, anchored by credible monetary policy regimes in most of the larger countries. While external performance has continued
to be supported by high prices for key commodity exports, domestic demand has become the
main engine of growth. Convergence of inflation to targets has provided room to unwind
previous monetary tightening in Brazil and
Mexico, supporting a pickup in growth in both
countries. In rapidly growing Argentina, the
monetary policy stance has been gradually tightened in response to double-digit inflation but
remains accommodative. At the same time, public spending has picked up across the region, on
the back of continued revenue buoyancy, especially in Venezuela. There have also been signs
of a resurgence of private investment, helped

by increasing confidence, declining interest
rates, and quite rapid increases in bank credit,
although investment rates remain far lower than
in emerging Asia. Political uncertainty remains
a concern, however, reflecting in part questions
about the ability of governments in a number of
countries to resist populist measures.­
Unsettled conditions in global financial markets in May–June 2006 initially dampened Latin
American equity prices and exchange rates, particularly in the most liquid markets (e.g., Brazil)
or in markets that had previously seen strong
price run-ups (e.g., Colombian equities). However, markets have since recovered much of the
lost ground, and Latin America’s expansionary
momentum seems to have been little affected.
This resilience seems to reflect in part reduced
vulnerabilities, including a shift to current
account surpluses, more flexible exchange rate
regimes, higher reserve cushions, and strengthened fiscal positions across the region. Nevertheless, recent market pressures have provided a
timely reminder that the global context is likely
over time to become less friendly to emerging

53

CHAPTER 2   Country and Regional Perspectives

markets, with rising interest rates, less buoyant
non-oil commodity prices, and reduced appetite
for the riskier assets. This prospect poses the
question of what further steps countries in Latin
America could take to prepare for more testing
conditions ahead.­
Disciplined fiscal policy should be at the core
of an effective policy framework for dealing with
this challenge. Taking advantage of cyclically
strong revenues to raise the primary surplus in
good times helps to lower public sector debt and
provide a more robust basis to weather periods
of weakness. Fiscal restraint also provides greater
room for monetary easing, thus reducing incentives for potentially destabilizing capital inflows
and encouraging private investment. Chile has
shown what can be achieved: its fiscal surplus is
likely to rise to 6 percent of GDP in 2006 in line
with its rule-based framework, reducing public
debt to low levels and directing a significant
proportion of copper-based revenues into an offshore stabilization fund. Moreover, the effective
fiscal sterilization of the impact of rapid export
growth has helped to contain appreciation of
the Chilean peso, without recourse to foreign
exchange market intervention in the context of
rapid increases in copper-related revenues.­
Looking across Latin America more broadly,
primary surpluses have increased significantly
during the present cyclical upswing, on the back
of strong revenue growth, but there have been
signs of an acceleration in government spending over the past two years, in contrast to the
more restrained policies followed in 2003–04
(Figure 2.5 and Box 2.1). While greater spending on infrastructure and social priorities could
bring long-term dividends, there is a concern
that not all of the increased expenditure is
well-targeted—in oil exporters and importers
alike—and may prove difficult to unwind if and
when global economic conditions become more
testing. Moreover, public debt levels, while
­coming down, still remain high (over 50 percent of GDP in many of the Latin American
countries shown in Figure 2.5), limiting scope
for a counter-cyclical response to any future
weakening of growth.­

54

Faced with heavy foreign exchange inflows
over the past two years, many Latin American countries have allowed exchange rates to
strengthen, with some intervention to lean
against upward pressures on the exchange rate,
using the proceeds to build up international
reserves and finance debt operations. Exchange
rates have appreciated substantially from the
lows of 2002 in a number of countries, but
measures of real effective exchange rates are still
broadly in line with long-term averages. Brazil
and Colombia have been particularly active in
retiring external debt and shifting the structure
of public sector liabilities away from dollardenominated debt, and in net terms Brazil has
now eliminated dollar exposure from its public
sector balance sheet. As a result, public sector
balance sheet vulnerabilities have been substantially reduced across the region, although the
transition toward long-term, fixed-rate, domesticcurrency-denominated debt remains incomplete.­
Looking ahead, recent more difficult market
conditions have provided a reminder of the
importance of allowing adequate exchange rate
flexibility in both directions. In the context of
more stable global financial market conditions,
strong foreign exchange inflows may return.
Sustained sterilized intervention would impose
heavy quasi-fiscal costs—more so than in Asia
where interest rates are generally lower. Moreover, excessively reducing exchange rate variations in the face of foreign exchange inflows
may discourage appropriate risk management by
market participants and could lead to easy monetary conditions—a concern in Argentina, for
example, where the use of regulatory countermeasures will need to be supported by a further
tightening of macroeconomic policies to contain
inflation. Some further appreciation of the real
exchange rate may be hard to avoid in such
circumstances, although the impact on competitiveness may be mitigated by broader structural
reforms to reduce domestic costs and improve
the business climate. In the face of more turbulent conditions—as exemplified by the sell-off in
May–June 2006—countries would need to allow
rates to depreciate in line with market condi-

Latin America: Continuing to Build Resilience

tions, generally limiting intervention to what
may be helpful to stabilize disorderly market
conditions, while tightening monetary policy if
needed to safeguard inflation objectives.­
The long-term challenge for Latin America
remains to unlock the region’s clear growth
potential. Despite recently improved performance, Latin America has remained consistently
the slowest-growing region among the emerging
market and developing countries in recent years.
These growth outcomes, and the slow progress
in reducing poverty, have fueled popular frustrations. Continued progress toward strengthening
macroeconomic policies and reducing balance
sheet vulnerabilities should help to provide the
basis for more sustained growth than in the past,
but stepping up the pace of growth and more
tangible progress toward social goals is likely to
depend on extending market-based reforms,
while also taking steps to ensure that benefits of
growth are broadly shared. Most Latin American countries made considerable progress in
advancing reforms through the 1990s, but the
pace of reforms slowed toward the end of the
decade, against the background of financial
crisis. More recently there have been renewed
advances in some countries, but there have also
been setbacks, including steps that partially
unwind privatization and pension reforms in a
number of countries. Looking forward, reform
priorities include tackling budget rigidities
to improve the targeting of public spending
(including especially infrastructure and pro-poor
social programs); reforms to encourage deepening financial intermediation; measures to raise
economic openness (where Latin America still
lags well behind other regions); labor market
reforms to increase the flexibility of response
to new opportunities and encourage job growth
in the formal sector; and reforms to strengthen
governance and the business environment.­
The policy framework for production of oil
and gas is an important issue in the region.
Latin America possesses the world’s second largZettelmeyer (forthcoming) provides a good recent
overview of this issue.

Fiscal Sustainability

Latin American countries have significantly improved primary balances in recent
years, helped by strong revenue growth. However, primary spending has risen
sharply over the past two years, after a period of restraint. Public-debt-to-GDP ratios
have declined, but remain high for a number of countries.

CHAPTER 2   Country and Regional Perspectives

Box 2.1. Improved Emerging Market Fiscal Performance: Cyclical or Structural?
Fiscal performance in many emerging market
countries has improved substantially in recent
years. The average overall fiscal balance of the
largest 37 emerging market countries improved
by nearly 3 percent of GDP from 2002 to 2005
(see first figure), and public debt dropped substantially, although it still remains above 50 percent of GDP in nearly half of those countries.
These averages conceal an even better record
for some regions and countries (although of
course a less stellar performance in others).
Nonetheless, this improvement potentially
has significant economic and financial market
implications, depending on whether it signifies
a sustainable trend, or whether it is a transitory
phenomenon that will be reversed when these
economies encounter more difficult times. In
other words, the key question is: to what extent
has the improvement been driven by structural
or by cyclical factors?
There is no doubt that there has been some
underlying structural improvement in fiscal positions in emerging market economies.
Helped by improvements in the underlying fiscal institutions, strengthened expenditure management, increased transparency, and sounder
fiscal responsibility frameworks, many governments have been able to restrain expenditures
in the face of buoyant revenues and easy access
to capital markets—a departure from procyclical
behavior in previous upturns. This is reflected
in the drop in the average primary expenditure-to-GDP ratio in Latin America and Asia,
although in emerging Europe revenues and
primary spending rose in tandem. For the average of emerging market countries, the primary
expenditure ratio was no higher in 2005 than in
2002 before revenues started to boom (see first
figure), although in some countries there has
been a tendency to ease spending restraint in
2005 and 2006.

and Manmohan S. Kumar.

Second, several emerging market countries
have reduced their financing costs through debt
restructuring and generally sound economic policies. Stronger policies have helped to accelerate
integration in global financial markets, further
Box 2.1.1

56

Latin America: Continuing to Build Resilience

lowering borrowing costs. For instance, the fact
that, with credit ratings improving, institutional
investors in the major industrial countries—particularly pension funds—have begun to invest
systematically in emerging market financial
instruments has led to an expectation of more
stable capital flows. This in turn has further
reduced the risk premiums demanded on emerging market assets, and lowered interest costs.
Nevertheless, part of the improvement
in emerging market countries’ government
finances appears to have reflected favorable
cyclical factors. Buoyant GDP growth and soaring commodity prices have boosted government
revenues in many countries (by an average of 2
percentage points of GDP from 2002 to 2005).
Given a stable expenditure-to-GDP ratio, the
improvement in the average primary balance is
essentially due to rising revenues. Such revenue
buoyancy, however, has an important cyclical
component that, although not readily quantifiable, is likely to account for a significant part
of the rapid increase in revenues. For example,
revenues rose by a full 6 percent of GDP on average in the five of the 37 sample countries that
are mainly exporting commodities. The public
debt ratio has also benefited from strong GDP
growth. Growth subtracted on average about
7 percent of GDP from this ratio over the past
four years, while primary balances subtracted
only about 1 percent of GDP (second figure).
Benign global financial conditions in recent
years have also helped fiscal performance.
Global interest rates have been very low, and
high liquidity and search for yield have contributed to declining yield spreads (see, for
example, IMF, 2004). Moreover, many emerging
market countries’ currencies have strengthened substantially relative to the dollar and
other currencies in which much of their debt is
denominated, particularly in 2005. Both interest
rate and exchange rate factors contributed to

Excluding countries that are mainly exporting
commodities does not materially change these results:
the average primary balance would be about 0.7 percent of GDP worse for 2004 and 2005.

balance (Hauner and Kumar, 2005). This is
particularly evident for the emerging European

the global environment, but also from interest Box 2.1.2
rate convergence in the context of EU accession.
There is a risk that a reversal in cyclical
conditions and the external financial environment could induce a deterioration in budgetary
positions. And the most vulnerable countries
could be hit hardest, because they tend to
have benefited most from higher risk appetite. It is thus important for emerging market
­countries—especially those with larger underlying vulnerabilities—to maintain disciplined
fiscal policies to take maximum advantage of
continued favorable global conditions.­

est hydrocarbons reserves, but for the most part
has not responded to the rise in international
prices since 2004 with increased production
and investment. On the positive side, long-term
investment by partially state-owned Petrobras has
allowed Brazil—the region’s third largest producer—to achieve self-sufficiency in 2006. However, production has grown slowly or contracted
elsewhere, including such major oil producers
as Mexico and Venezuela, reflecting low rates
of investment in the past and governance issues
that are only now beginning to be addressed
(Figure 2.6). In Mexico, investment has been
boosted recently to counter the decline of the
country’s largest oil field. Bolivia was able to
achieve a rapid increase in gas exports after
opening up its hydrocarbons sector to private
companies, but the recent decision to nationalize production and raise royalties has raised
uncertainty and may have jeopardized prospects
for new investment. Similarly in Ecuador, private
oil production rose rapidly in 2005 after completion of a major pipeline, but public production
has declined, and prospects now depend on the
government’s ability to improve the investment
climate to attract new private investors and to
strengthen public sector governance. The key
issue here is less whether production and investment rights are allocated to the private or public
sector, but whether the government is able to
establish a stable and predictable set of production and investment incentives and governance
structures to provide a firm basis for the huge
financing and the long-term planning horizons
required for major hydrocarbons projects.­

Emerging Europe: Managing Risks from
Heavy Reliance on Foreign Savings
The economic expansion has remained robust
in emerging Europe, with regional growth running at about 5!/2 percent in 2005 (Table 2.5).
Buoyant domestic demand generally has been
the main driving force—fueled by increasing net
capital inflows and credit growth. The growth
momentum varies across the region, depending

ning domestic demand, exchange rate developments, and progress in addressing structural
rigidities. Growth has been particularly vibrant
in the Baltic countries and Turkey, and it has
accelerated in the Czech Republic and the
Slovak Republic. The pace has been weaker
in Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia, although
more recently growth in Poland has picked up,
supported by higher export market growth,
improving investor sentiment, and firming labor
market conditions.­
The outlook is for continued solid regional
growth in the range of 5–5!/2 percent in
2006–07, as robust domestic demand growth is
expected to continue, and with the strengthening expansion in the euro area adding an
external impetus. Compared to the last World
Economic Outlook, however, growth is expected to
slow more noticeably in Turkey—policy interest
rates have been raised by 425 basis points since
June to head off a weakening currency and
intensifying inflation pressures—and in Hungary, in 2007, in view of the substantial fiscal
consolidation that is targeted in that year. The

adverse impact on regional growth is roughly
offset by Poland’s improved near-term growth
prospects. The region’s characteristic large
current account deficits—only in the Czech
Republic, Poland, and Slovenia are deficits relatively modest—are projected to widen in 2006,
reaching 5.7 percent of GDP for the region as
a whole, before declining slightly in 2007. The
risks to the growth outlook are slanted to the
downside, with the region’s heavy reliance on
foreign savings a particular vulnerability if international financial market conditions become
even more testing.­
When assessing such risks, one needs to
consider that the region’s generally large current account deficits have reflected in part
favorable investment opportunities, given scarce
capital and low labor costs, in the context of
EU accession and integration. That said, to
varying degrees within the region, these deficits
have also been associated with rapid credit and
consumption growth, asset price increases, and,
in some cases, substantial real exchange rate
appreciations—often in the context of limited

nominal exchange rate flexibility—a constellation prone to create external vulnerabilities. In
some countries, the inflows have been associated
not just with private sector financial imbalances,
but also with substantial fiscal imbalances, notably in Hungary but, to a lesser extent, also in
Poland and the Slovak Republic. On the supply
side, a key concern is that the large net capital
inflows are increasingly in the form of more
volatile portfolio and so-called “other flows,”
including short-term debt, rather than foreign
direct investment (FDI). Indeed, as noted in
Box 1.1, the region became the largest recipient of net non-FDI flows among all emerging
market regions in 2005 (Figure 2.7). The important share of lending from advanced-economy
banks to their subsidiaries in “other flows” may
mitigate the risks to some extent, although any
reduction in net financing would still require
substantial external adjustment.­
Against this background, policymakers must
carefully balance the growth opportunities
provided by foreign savings against the risks.
While the extent of risks varies considerably
across countries, given large differences in factors such as the size of short-term external debt
and reserve coverage, reducing vulnerabilities is
a policy priority, not the least in view of possible regional spillovers, given that the countries
share similar vulnerabilities and common creditors. The policy mix to achieve this depends on
country circumstances, but generally includes
the following:
• Fiscal consolidation. In countries with fiscal
sustainability problems, determined fiscal
adjustment is needed to maintain investor
confidence and avoid unfavorable public debt
dynamics. This is most urgent in Hungary,
where the deficit is likely to reach 10 percent
of GDP this year. While the authorities plan to
reduce the deficit by some 4 percentage points
of GDP in 2007, the proposed measures may
be challenging to implement, given legal and
administrative complexities, and since they are
mostly tax-based, the consolidation package
may adversely affect potential growth, not just
aggregate demand in the near term. In other

Emerging Europe: Managing Risks from Heavy Reliance on Foreign Savings

countries, some fiscal tightening may be helpful to moderate domestic demand pressures
and their impact on external balances and
inflation. This is particularly relevant when a
fixed nominal exchange rate constrains monetary policy options, as in the Baltic countries,
or when public debt ratios are still high, as is
the case in Turkey.­
• Adequate prudential supervision and regulatory
frameworks. The often rapid credit growth in
the region partly reflects normal financial
deepening from a low base. However, as
noted in previous issues of the World Economic
Outlook, there has been a notable increase
in riskier forms of credit, especially a substantial fraction of bank lending in foreign
currency, and the share of credit financed by
short-term borrowing from foreign banks has
risen. Regulators need to ensure that financial
systems are in a position to manage exchange
and interest rate risks, including by tightening
regulatory standards when appropriate.­
• Monetary policy tightening. Higher interest rates
need to be the first line of defense when
inflation risks increase either because of
strong domestic demand or acute downward
pressures on the exchange rate. This policy
challenge is well illustrated by the Turkish
central bank’s strong response to the sharp
depreciation of the Turkish lira (19 percent in
nominal effective terms between January and
June this year). The bank will need to stand
ready to tighten further if incoming data
point to an unfavorable medium-term inflation outlook. Inflationary pressures have been
more moderate in Central European countries, especially in the Czech Republic and
Poland, but they have begun to pick up more
recently, and some central banks raised policy
rates in response (Czech Republic, Hungary,
and Slovak Republic). Policymakers will need
to stand ready to tighten further if continued
rapid growth, depreciating exchange rates, or
rising global inflationary pressures add to current pressures on prices.­
In some of the new member states of the
European Union that have already begun to

keep fluctuations in the external value of their
currencies within the required limits before
euro adoption, strengthening external positions
through domestic demand moderation would
also reduce the vulnerabilities of exchange rates
to swings in investor confidence and capital flow
reversals. The most relevant problem is that
despite successful disinflation, inflation convergence—to less than 1.5 percentage points above
the average level in the three European Union
countries with the lowest rates—has been hampered by the combination of limited nominal
exchange rate flexibility and pressures for real
appreciation, which has tended to push inflation
above the average in key trading partners. While
some of the pressures for real appreciation are
difficult to avoid as they result from so-called
“Balassa-Samuelson” effects stemming from
rapid productivity growth in the tradables sectors, they also reflect buoyant domestic demand
and large capital inflows which, in the absence
of monetary policy tools, should be offset primarily by fiscal tightening, although measures
aimed at restraining credit growth may also be
needed.­
More broadly, with most countries in the
region aiming for euro adoption in the medium
term, policymakers need to ensure adequate
preparation for the loss of monetary policy
autonomy and the capacity to achieve external adjustment through nominal exchange
rate changes in the face of country-specific
events. Otherwise, if countries give up nominal
exchange rate flexibility too early, such adjustment could require relative price changes
The recently acceded members of the European
Union in emerging Europe are committed to adopting the euro and, thereby, to the associated process of
macroeconomic policy convergence. This process is most
advanced in the five countries that have entered the
so-called European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II)
and have begun to limit fluctuations in the external value
of their currencies against the euro—Slovenia, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, and Slovak Republic. Slovenia was
recently accepted into the euro area from January 2007,
while Lithuania’s entry was delayed because its 12-month
average inflation rate over the period April 2005 to
March 2006 was slightly above the relevant criterion and
was expected to rise further during 2006.

through deflation, which is of particular concern in those countries with already large current account deficits that will eventually have
to unwind. On the fiscal front, meeting the
relevant Maastricht criteria will require sustained policy discipline in a number of countries, especially in Hungary, but also in Poland
and the Slovak Republic. Structural reforms
are also key to strengthen economic flexibility,
as well as to boost prospects for the closing of
the productivity gap with EU15 countries, both
for new and prospective new members in the
region (see Schadler and others, 2006). Policy
priorities again vary across countries, given wide
differences in structural regimes, but generally
include:
• Reducing labor market rigidities. Employment
rates in the region remain low compared
to other emerging market countries. While
partly reflecting transition-specific factors,
such as an unusually rapid rate of job destruction that will gradually dissipate, low employment rates also owe to labor market rigidities,

62

such as cumbersome restrictions on dismissals
and temporary employment, fiscal disincentives to both labor supply and demand, and
rigidities hampering regional mobility (e.g., in
the housing market).­
• Institutional reform. Reforms in this domain
would aim at reducing costs of doing business, increasing product market competition, fostering further financial deepening,
and increasing efficiency in government
operations.­

Commonwealth of Independent States:
Managing Large Foreign Currency
Inflows
Real GDP growth in the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS) is on course to
reach close to 7 percent in 2006, before easing
to about 6!/2 percent in 2007 (Table 2.6). The
region continues to benefit from high commodity prices and correspondingly strong export
earnings (Figure 2.8). In several countries,

Commonwealth of Independent States: Managing Large Foreign Currency Inflows

At

present, the Russian energy company Gazprom
charges between $47 (Belarus) and $160 (Moldova)
for 1000 cubic meters of natural gas. This compares to
a price of $230 per 1000 cubic meters for customers in
western Europe. Gazprom increased export prices to
some CIS customers earlier this year, and has announced
its intention to bring prices even more closely in line with
“market valuations.”

domestic demand has received an additional
boost from substantial private capital inflows
(Russia, Kazakhstan), official financing (Georgia), and/or remittances (Armenia, Georgia,
Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan). Investment is recovering, including in Russia, where
the impact of factors responsible for the slowdown in 2004–05—including banking sector
turbulences and a tax-induced decline in oil sector profitability—is waning. Short-term growth
prospects are generally positive, although they
remain heavily dependent on commodity price
developments. In the Ukraine, growth picked
up quite strongly in the first half of 2006, but
the outlook remains clouded by a projected
deterioration in the terms of trade—due to the
repricing of gas imports from Russia and a possible reversal in the export price of steel—and
lingering policy uncertainties.­
The favorable external environment has
created important challenges for macroeconomic management, however, that need to be
addressed with some urgency to boost longerterm growth prospects. High commodity prices
have relaxed short-term fiscal policy constraints,
both directly—by increasing export tax revenues
and the profits of state-owned enterprises—and
indirectly by boosting aggregate demand, and
thereby receipts from consumption and income
taxes. Often policymakers have used these
extra funds prudently, including to pay down
public debt and/or to build up foreign currency reserve cushions. More recently, however,
some governments have granted large pension and wage increases (Azerbaijan, Belarus,
Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan), which have further
boosted consumption, undermined competitiveness, and would be hard to reverse should
the commodity price cycle turn. Policymakers

CHAPTER 2   Country and Regional Perspectives

should not assume that recent revenue gains will
all be permanent (see Chapter 5). In countries
where scope for fiscal easing exists—such as in
Russia, where there is room for some increase in
public spending without sacrificing sustainability,
and in Kazakhstan—a more expansionary stance
should be accompanied by a reinvigoration of
stalled reforms to ensure that higher spending
boosts investment and potential GDP growth.­
Monetary policy also faces important challenges. While inflation has declined in recent
months, it remains at or close to double-digit
levels in many countries, especially oil exporters. Further progress is needed, but addressing disinflation is complicated by the focus of
many central banks on stabilizing the nominal
exchange rate against the U.S. dollar in the face
of large current account surpluses and capital inflows. With the scope for sterilization of
foreign exchange purchases limited by underdeveloped domestic debt markets, base money
growth remains above levels consistent with low,
single-digit inflation rates. The danger is that
inflationary pressures may become entrenched,
in which case costly measures may be required
in the future to reverse the inflation buildup.
While early repayment of external public debt
or transfers into offshore oil funds (Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan) can help to reduce base money
growth, the most effective way to lower inflation
would be to allow for further nominal exchange
rate appreciation, thus enhancing the scope for
monetary control aimed at disinflation. In some
energy-importing countries, inflationary pressures could also emerge from the prospective
repricing of fuel and gas imports, in which case
monetary policymakers will need to ensure that
the necessary pass-through of higher costs does
not feed into core inflation, wages, and inflation
expectations.­
The commodity price boom has also complicated efforts to diversify production and exports
away from primary materials to goods with a
higher value-added component. Attracted by
high expected export earnings, recent investments—both domestic and foreign financed—
have often focused on extractive industries

64

(Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan) or on commodity
transport infrastructure (oil and gas pipeline
projects in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia,
Kazakhstan). Moreover, the overall level of
investment in the region remains too low at 21
percent of GDP—the recent recovery notwithstanding—which casts doubt on the sustainability of current growth rates over the medium
term. Structural reforms to improve the investment climate are crucial to avoid the emergence
or aggravation of supply bottlenecks. In countries with large current account surpluses—
notably Russia—higher investment would also
contribute to reducing global macroeconomic
imbalances.­
External positions are strong in many countries in the region, especially fuel exporters. For
the region as a whole, a current account surplus
of over 10 percent of GDP is projected for 2006.
Large surpluses have permitted a rapid reduction in the overall level of external debt in oil
exporters, especially by the public sector. In
several countries (including Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia), however, the private sector
has accumulated substantial foreign currency
liabilities in recent years (Figure 2.8), often
intermediated by the banking system. As a consequence, the private sector’s vulnerability to a
tightening in external financing conditions has
increased. Financial system soundness indicators
have remained broadly stable, but this is partly
on account of the favorable macroeconomic
environment. A strengthening of prudential
regulations and risk-based supervision would
help to reduce risks of financial instability in
the face of a downturn, as would measures to
restrict regulatory forbearance and—in some
cases—policies to assure that the risks associated
with the buildup of foreign currency liabilities
remain contained.­

expected at 5.2 percent this year—the third successive year it has exceeded 5 percent—before
increasing to 6.3 percent in 2007 as oil output
recovers in Nigeria and new oil fields in Angola
and Equatorial Guinea come on stream (Table
2.7). Oil-exporting countries have contributed significantly to this strong performance.
Increased oil production in a number of countries and the large terms-of-trade gains from the
significant rise in oil prices have boosted domestic incomes and spending. Growth in oil-importing countries—although lagging that in oil
exporters by a substantial margin—has also been
surprisingly robust, despite higher oil prices and
the removal of international textile trade quotas,
which has adversely affected a number of coun-

tries, most particularly Lesotho and Swaziland.
This resilience contrasts with earlier periods
of high international oil prices, when growth
in these countries was hit hard (the exception
being 1972–74, when the regional terms of trade
actually increased because of the concurrent
boom in nonfuel commodity prices; see Figure
2.9; and Dudine and others, 2006).
Why has growth in oil-importing countries
held up so well in the face of high oil prices?
• The rise in nonfuel commodity prices has
certainly helped to cushion the impact of
higher oil prices in some countries, but this
has not been universal (Box 2.2). For example, Mozambique, Zambia, and South Africa
have benefited from higher metals prices, and

• The global economic environment has been
supportive and regional export growth has
generally been strong.­
• Countries that have experienced a deterioration in their terms of trade in recent years
have seen an increase in aid and stronger
capital inflows that have helped cushion the
income loss (see Box 2.2).­
• Stronger domestic policy frameworks have
helped support economic activity, particularly
investment. Despite the impact of higher oil
prices, inflation generally remains well contained and fiscal positions have deteriorated
only modestly. Together with the institutional
transitions that have taken place in a number
of countries in recent years—see the September 2005 World Economic Outlook—this has
created a better business climate, although the
costs of doing business in Africa remain high.10
Nevertheless, while strong growth is expected
to continue, there are a number of risks to the
outlook. First, if oil prices remain elevated, they
may have a more detrimental impact on growth
going forward than they have done in the recent
past, particularly if combined with a sharperthan-expected decline in non-oil commodity
prices (see the analysis of the outlook for
nonfuel commodity prices in Chapter 5). Second, export performance would suffer if global
growth slowed or—against the background of
large global imbalances—the euro appreciated
10An institutional transition is defined as a sustained
improvement in the quality of economic institutions in
a country. The quality of institutions is assessed using
an overall index composed of indicators encompassing
the legal structure and property rights, the freedom to
trade internationally, and regulation of credit, labor, and
business (see Chapter III of the September 2005 World
Economic Outlook for details). The importance of sound
institutions for growth was taken up in Chapter III of the
April 2003 World Economic Outlook.

Africa: Strong Growth Continues Despite High Oil Prices

Box 2.2. Commodity Price Shocks, Growth, and Financing in Sub-Saharan Africa
The recent sharp increase in oil prices
has been a burden on oil-importing countries around the world, especially low-income
countries that can ill afford higher oil bills.
However, unlike earlier episodes of oil price
hikes (1979–80; 1998–2000), there have been
simultaneous increases in prices of a number
of other commodities, including metals and
some agricultural products, that are exported
by low-income countries, in the context of
buoyant world demand. This box looks at the
overall impact of commodity price changes on
low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In
particular, it asks which countries have benefited
from the commodity price changes; which have
suffered, and by how much; and what has been
the impact on growth?
Gainers and Losers
Oil prices increased by about 25 percent per
year in real terms over the period 2002–05, but
major price gains were also recorded by a number of other commodities, including uranium
(38 percent per year), copper (30 percent),
coffee (19 percent), gold (10 percent), and aluminum and diamonds (about 9 percent). Prices
Note: The authors of this box are Arvind
­Subramanian and Thierry Tressel.

of other important commodity exports, such as
tea, coffee, beef, and cotton, rose in the range
of 3 to 5 percent a year.
In net terms, countries in sub-Saharan Africa
have gained from these commodity price
changes (column 1 of the table). But this
aggregate masks quite disparate developments
at the country level. Out of the 33 countries for
which disaggregated trade data are available
through World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS),
13 countries experienced a terms-of-trade gain,
averaging 4.3 percent of GDP per year, while 20
countries suffered terms-of-trade losses, averaging 1.7 percent of GDP per year. The net gainers
were predominantly oil exporters ­(Cameroon,
Gabon, Nigeria, and the Sudan), but also
included exporters of diamonds (Botswana),
uranium (Niger), copper ­(Zambia), aluminum
(Mozambique) and tobacco ­(Zimbabwe). The
largest losers were all net oil importers (Ghana,
Madagascar, and Senegal).
Disaggregated commodity trade data (available
from the United Nations WITS Trade database) for
countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In calculating the
terms-of-trade impact, the counterfactual assumption is that prices would have otherwise remained at
their 2002 levels; and to isolate the pure price effect,
the changes were computed in terms of base period
import and export volumes.

growth performance of terms-of-trade losers is broadly
similar to that of the gainers.

Changes in aid and private flows

The remarkable feature of this commodity
price cycle has been the fact that virtually all
countries, even those that have suffered a termsof-trade loss, have maintained robust growth.
Real GDP growth averaged 4.1 percent over
2003–05 in the 33 countries in the sample, with
net terms-of-trade gainers and losers registering broadly similar growth (3.2 percent and
4.2 percent, respectively) (column 2). This is
surprising since, other things equal, countries
that experience real income gains would usually
be expected to experience higher aggregate
demand growth, and hence higher overall
growth. To look at this in more detail, the correlation between this income effect of terms-oftrade and growth across countries is depicted
in the figure. The presumption is that this
correlation would be positive, but in fact the figure shows a surprisingly weak correlation. The
­disaggregated picture is even more puzzling.
The correlation is actually strongly negative for
cases where there has been a positive terms-oftrade change and mildly negative for terms-oftrade losers.
One possible explanation for why growth in
terms-of-trade losers has held up well is that
world growth has remained robust, which has
supported export volumes of all countries,
­especially in countries that suffered termsof-trade losses. For the period 2003–05, the
annual average growth in export volumes for
the terms-of-trade losers was about 6.8 per-

cent compared with about 2.5 percent for the
gainers. In other words, volume effects have
offset price effects, helping to maintain overall
growth rates.
Box 2.2
Consumption and hence growth in the
terms-of-trade losers could have been buttressed by aid and private capital flows, offsetting the dampening income effects of adverse
Another possible channel shoring up demand would
be movements in real exchange rates. But the data suggest that terms-of-trade losers also saw a real exchange
rate appreciation (of about 6 percent on average), even
though the magnitudes were lower on average for this
group than for the terms-of-trade gainers.

Africa: Strong Growth Continues Despite High Oil Prices

terms-of-trade developments. For countries in
sub-Saharan Africa, the predominant source
of financing has been aid. Have aid flows
helped countries facing terms-of-trade losses?
In aggregate, aid flows to sub-Saharan Africa
have increased since 2002, on average by
about 1 percent of GDP per year (column 3 in
the table). Moreover, the pattern of aid flows
has helped to cushion countries facing net
terms-of-trade losses: terms-of-trade gainers
saw a small increase in aid flows while losers
saw a much larger increase, averaging nearly 2
percentage points of GDP. Private capital flows
have also contributed to consumption smoothing, rising by !/2 percentage point of GDP per
year for net terms-of-trade losers, contributing
further to cushioning the impact of the shocks
(column 4).
Overall, adding up changes in aid flows,
private capital flows and earnings from commodities, terms-of-trade gainers saw an increase
in external flows of about 4.2 percent of GDP
(column 5), but terms-of-trade losers also saw an
increase of 0.6 percent of GDP on average. The
negative correlation between aid and private
flows, on the one hand, and the terms-of-trade
changes on the other, illustrates the stabilizing
role performed by the former (lower panel of
the figure). This may have been an important
factor in explaining the resilience of growth
even in countries that experienced terms-oftrade losses.
Private capital flows includes foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio investments and other private
capital flows (including trade credit and bank borrowing), but not private transfers such as remittances.
Nine countries, however, did experience a decline
in their overall flows (Burkina-Faso, Cameroon, Côte
d’Ivoire, Lesotho, Mauritius, Mozambique, Senegal,
Togo, and Uganda).

substantially (undermining the competitiveness
of the CFA franc-zone countries). Third, countries that have widening current account deficits
and are more reliant on private capital flows—

There is also a possible supply side explanation for the observed pattern of growth: differences in governance. The average score for a
measure of governance compiled by the World
Bank that measures the rule of law is on average lower for terms-of-trade gainers than for
losers, and this difference is statistically significant. This is not surprising because, worldwide,
commodity exporters typically tend to fare less
well on measures of institutional quality. The
most telling illustration is Zimbabwe, which
experienced one of the largest terms-of-trade
gains and yet registered the worst growth
performance (–6.9 percent on average) over
the period in question. The low correlation
between the income effect from commodity
price changes and growth is consistent with the
view that the impact on overall growth depends
to a great deal on the broader institutional
context.
In conclusion, the welcome surprise of this
commodity price cycle is that the net terms-oftrade losers in sub-Saharan Africa have maintained robust growth on average, cushioned in
part by aid and private capital flows. However,
the resilience of these economies could be
tested if nonfuel commodity prices moderate
(as suggested in Chapter 5), while oil prices
stay high. Another open question is whether
the large terms-of-trade gainers (mainly the oil
exporters) will use their commodity earnings
prudently to improve economic management
and governance on a durable basis (for example, Nigeria and some other oil producers are
saving a high and increasing proportion of their
oil revenues) or whether they will once again be
victims of the oil curse.

of institutional quality.

CHAPTER 2   Country and Regional Perspectives

health care systems. Lastly, political uncertainties
and armed conflicts could adversely affect the
outlook in a number of countries (e.g., ongoing
unrest in the Niger delta presents a downside
risk to growth in Nigeria).­
The improved growth performance in subSaharan Africa in recent years is very welcome,
but it still falls well short of the 7 percent
annual growth needed to meet the Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) of halving poverty
by 2015 (and sub-Saharan Africa is not on
target to meet the other MDGs either). It is
important that governments in the region continue to press ahead with reforms to promote
private sector investment—including foreign
investment, which remains low and largely
concentrated in Nigeria and South Africa—
and employment. Such reforms will need to
encompass further trade liberalization, reduced
government involvement in the economy,
improvements to the business environment
through the streamlining of regulations and
improved governance, the development of
infrastructure, and the further strengthening
of economic institutions. Efforts to strengthen
domestic policies should continue to be supported by the international community, including through debt relief,11 making good on
recent commitments to further boost aid, and
bold market opening initiatives by advanced
and developing countries to improve access for
regional exports.­
In addition to these broad policy requirements, oil-exporting and -importing countries
in the region face specific challenges. In oil
exporters, policymakers will need to strike an
appropriate balance between spending and
saving the additional oil revenues. The higher
revenues certainly provide scope for some additional government spending to foster growth,
generate employment, and reduce poverty, but
they should be managed in a way that is consistent with achieving overall macroeconomic

70

policy objectives (notably containing inflation,
which in many oil exporters is running above
the regional average). In Nigeria, for example,
a key challenge is to reduce inflation decisively to single-digit levels, which will require a
tight fiscal stance in the near term. Improved
transparency in the use of oil revenues is also
important to ensure that the benefits of this
sector are spread widely among the population.
In this regard, implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in
oil-producing countries in the region should be
a priority.­
In oil-importing countries, the challenge is
to continue to adjust to high oil prices, while
pursuing reforms that strengthen medium-term
growth prospects. Most countries have so far
appropriately allowed the increase in international oil prices to pass through to domestic
energy prices so that demand adjusts. This will
need to continue, with countries with weaker
fiscal and external positions having little scope
to avoid passing through higher prices without
delay. Exchange rates will have to adjust to the
deterioration in the terms of trade (through
nominal depreciation in countries with flexible
exchange rates, or wage and price adjustment
in countries with fixed exchange rate regimes),
and if higher oil prices feed into wages and
inflation, a tightening of monetary conditions would be called for. In South Africa, for
example, the inflation outlook has deteriorated
against the backdrop of rising oil prices, rapid
credit growth, and the recent depreciation of
the rand, and the central bank has appropriately
tightened monetary policy to counter these pressures. Adjustment to high oil prices will need
to go hand-in-hand with efforts to strengthen
the social safety net to assist the poor who are
disproportionately affected by higher energy
prices. In countries where a social safety net
does not exist, other pro-poor programs could
be introduced or strengthened—for example,
in Ghana, the government eliminated school
fees and increased spending on health care
and rural electrification at the same time that it
increased fuel prices.­

Middle East: Living with Booming
Oil Exports
Oil revenues in the Middle East region have
risen further in the first half of 2006, because
of both higher prices and some expansion in
production (notably in Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates). Reflecting
the income gains, oil-exporting countries have
continued to enjoy robust growth, particularly
in the non-oil sectors, while external current
account and fiscal balances have improved
further. With non-oil sector growth running
at 8 percent, inflation has begun to pick up,
although it remains generally well contained
(except in the Islamic Republic of Iran) by the
combination of pegged exchange rates, open
product and labor markets, and low global inflation. Equity markets in the region faced major
corrections in early 2006—prices fell by some
25 to 35 percent from their peaks—but so far,
financial stability has been preserved and the
macroeconomic impact is likely to be contained.­
Despite large terms-of-trade losses, growth in
oil-importing countries in the Mashreq (which
account for about 20 percent of regional GDP)
generally has held up well. This resilience
reflects the supportive global economic envi-

ronment and rapid credit growth as well as
country-specific factors, such as delays in the
pass-through of higher oil prices (Jordan) and
higher Suez Canal receipts (Egypt).12 In Lebanon, growth has been hampered by political
uncertainty over the last year, and real GDP is
expected to decline substantially in 2006 as a
result of the recent conflict. Higher oil prices
have also led to a pick up in headline inflation,
and in weaker external positions (Jordan).­
Looking forward, the outlook for the
region generally remains favorable, given that
oil prices are expected to remain high, and
regional GDP growth is projected at close to
6 percent in 2006 (Table 2.8). With continued
prudent financial policies and little growth
in oil production, GDP growth is expected to
moderate slightly to about 5!/2 percent in 2007.
The regional current account surplus is projected to rise further to 23 percent of GDP in

is not classified as an oil exporter in the
World Economic Outlook even though the country is a
net exporter of crude oil and, increasingly, natural gas
because the share of fuel exports in total exports of
goods and services is less than 50 percent. Accordingly,
the country has directly benefited from higher oil prices,
not just indirectly through position regional spillovers.

for non-oil exporters in the Mashreq, although
the latter will continue to benefit from a supportive environment at both the regional and
the global levels. Risks to growth are broadly
balanced. On the upside, surging oil revenues
could ­provide for higher government expenditure, while possible further corrections in some
still richly valued asset prices are a downside
risk. For the non-oil exporters, the external
balance implications of the large terms-of-trade
losses add an element of vulnerability to the
outlook. Finally, geopolitical risks remain a serious concern.­
The central policy challenge for the oilexporting countries remains managing booming
oil revenues. Most countries have appropriately
begun to use the opportunity provided by
higher revenues to increase spending to address
long-standing structural problems, in particular the need to generate employment for the
rapidly growing working-age population and to
boost infrastructure and human capital development (Figure 2.10). In addition, national oil
companies in the region have developed plans
for ambitious capacity expansion and are ratcheting up investment. At the current juncture,
there seems ample scope for this buildup of
spending, given high unemployment in many
countries and still low inflation, although with
continued rapid credit growth, the risks of overheating need to be carefully monitored. It will
however, be important for higher expenditure to
be accompanied by determined efforts at capacity-enhancing reforms to ensure that the funds
are well used and bring lasting supply-side benefits; otherwise, growth will remain dependent
on continued high oil prices. Priorities in this
regard are reforms that contribute to increasing
private sector participation and investment in
major sectors that would help to diversify oildependent economies.­
With many oil exporters in the region pegging their currencies to the U.S. dollar, inflation will inevitably rise somewhat with higher

References

expenditure, as prices of locally produced
goods and services will increase compared to
those traded internationally. However, if expenditure increases are appropriately aligned with
macroeconomic conditions and are accompanied by structural reforms, any pick-up in inflation should remain contained and temporary.
In contrast to the generally low inflation in the
region, inflation is running at about 12 percent
(year-on-year basis) in the Islamic Republic
of Iran, reflecting the combination of rising
­government expenditure and expansionary
monetary policy. With monetary control hampered by multiple, internally inconsistent policy
objectives and limited operational autonomy
of the central bank, some fiscal policy tightening will be required to reduce inflation, with
additional support from greater exchange rate
flexibility.­
In oil-importing countries, the key macroeconomic policy challenge is to facilitate the
economic adjustment to the terms-of-trade loss,
which is likely to include a substantial permanent component. Allowing for the full passthrough of the higher world oil prices to final
users will be key to ensure budget sustainability
and adjustment in energy consumption. Recent
fuel price increases in Jordan were appropriate
steps in this direction. In view of generally large
current account deficits, fiscal consolidation is
urgently needed to reduce external vulnerabilities related to public debt. In Egypt, the favorable outlook provides an excellent opportunity
to reduce the large fiscal deficit and put public
debt on a declining path. In some countries,
real exchange rate depreciation may be helpful
to support the external adjustment. Given limited exchange rate flexibility in the oil-importing countries, this adjustment may require some
macroeconomic policy tightening to rein in
domestic demand and reduce inflation below
partner country levels. Concurrent structural
reforms aimed at raising trade openness and
productivity would provide important synergies.­
Finally, policymakers throughout the region
should be mindful of prudential risks in the
financial sector. With oil export proceeds partly

flowing into the domestic banking system and
substantial net capital flows to non-oil exporters,
broad money and, even more so, credit growth
have accelerated sharply in many countries over
the past three years and remain very high. At
the same time, the favorable oil market outlook
and buoyant investor confidence have underpinned large increases in equity and property
prices relative to GDP in 2004–05, even though
some of these gains were reversed in the first
half of 2006. This combination has raised concerns about increased leverage in private sector
balance sheets, including in the household
sector, rising financial sector exposure to asset
price corrections, and a possible deterioration in
credit quality. Supervisors need to monitor such
risks carefully and ensure adequate prudential
standards. At the same time, reforms aimed at
improving market liquidity and transparency will
help to reduce asset price volatility that is not
related to fundamentals. The recent lifting of
restrictions in equity markets for foreign investors in Saudi Arabia was a welcome step in this
regard.­

Asia Rising: Patterns of Economic Development
and Growth

A

sia’s striking growth performance has
long attracted the interest of both policymakers and researchers. For several
decades, growth has been very strong
in the region as a whole—even spectacular in
the newly industrialized economies (NIEs) and,
more recently, China. Between 1981 and 2001,
the number of people living in extreme poverty
declined dramatically in East Asia (by over 400
million in China alone). At the same time, given
the presence of both early and late developers, Asia continues to display wide disparities in
per capita income, ranging from over $33,000
in Singapore to $2,000 in Bangladesh. Average
income levels in developing Asia as a whole are
still well below those in other regions.­
This chapter looks at relative growth performance across Asia, with a focus on the following
questions:
• To what extent is the development path
blazed by Japan, and later the NIEs, now
being followed by the ASEAN-4, China, India,
and the newly emerging economies, such as
Vietnam? Are there systematic differences
between East Asia and the rest of Asia? Or
between Asia and other regions of the world?

the Association of South-East Asian Nations: Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.
The chapter focuses on the following Asian countries
and subregions: Japan; the NIEs; the ASEAN-4; China;
India; and “Other Asia” (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao
P.D.R., Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam).
“Asia” is defined as comprising all the above countries;
“developing Asia,” all the above countries except Japan
and the NIEs; “East Asia,” all the above countries except
Japan, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Asia as a whole is
contrasted with the following regions: advanced economies excluding Asia; Latin America and the Caribbean;

• What have been the sources of growth differences, both within Asia, and compared with
other regions? What has been the role of policies in achieving strong outcomes in Asia?
• How can Asia’s exceptionally high growth
rates be sustained? What policy measures
would help to maintain strong growth? Have
the reforms introduced after the Asian financial crises already had a detectable impact on
growth and productivity?
Overall, the chapter finds that Asia’s remarkable growth performance reflects strong total
factor productivity (TFP) growth, as well as
rapid accumulation of both physical and human
capital. In turn, these accomplishments were
driven by a more favorable institutional and
policy environment than observed in other
developing economies, including in particular
greater trade openness, macroeconomic stability, financial development, and in many cases
educational attainment. Looking ahead, further
improvements in policies and institutional quality would help to sustain high sectoral productivity growth rates and facilitate the continued
shift of resources from agriculture to industry
and services, hence supporting sustained rapid
growth, convergence toward advanced-economy
income levels, and the elimination of poverty
across the region.­

Asia’s Economic Success
Asia’s real income per capita rose sevenfold
between 1950 and 2005 (Figure 3.1), significantly
reducing its gap relative to the United States.
Asia’s success stands in marked contrast with the
failure of Latin America and other developing

1 The growth takeoff is defined as occurring in 1955 for Japan, 1967 for the newly

industrialized economies (NIEs), 1973 for the ASEAN-4 (Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, and Thailand), 1979 for China, 1982 for India, and 1990 for other Asian
economies.

Within Asia, there have been significant, wellknown differences across countries in the timing
of their initial “takeoff” into sustained growth
and, more broadly, the start of their “integration” into the world economy. Later developers, including China, appear to have started
their takeoff at lower income levels than Japan
or the NIEs. At the same time, the overall pace
of growth in later developers does not appear
significantly different from that experienced
by Japan and the NIEs at similar stages of the
integration process.­
A similar story emerges when looking at
broader development indicators. Asia’s share
of world trade more than doubled during
1970–2005, whereas Latin America’s decreased
(Figure 3.2). Within Asia, all regions have
captured a rising share of world trade, but the
rapid expansion in China’s trade over the past
decade stands out, even though it started from a
very low base. Asia has also enjoyed an especially
rapid increase over the last half century in levels
of educational attainment.­
Declining dependency ratios (a measure of
the nonworking age population to total population) have certainly been supportive of growth
in Asia, but not significantly more so than in
other developing regions (Figure 3.2). However,
the heterogeneity within Asia is very striking. In
the NIEs and China, population aging will likely
cause dependency ratios to start rising again
within the next five years, whereas in India the
demographic transition started only relatively
recently.­
Strong policy frameworks have been a key
element behind Asia’s success stories. Over the
last several decades, Asian fast developers have
been characterized by a broadly stable macroThis chapter defines the growth takeoff as occurring
in 1955 for Japan; 1967 for the NIEs; 1973 for ASEAN-4;
1979 for China; 1982 for India; and 1990 for Other Asia.

economic environment. Inflation has been contained within relatively narrow bands, with the
exception of the periods following the oil-price
shocks and the 1997 Asian Crisis. Related to this,
while some high-performing Asian economies
ran substantial fiscal deficits, their high savings
and rapid growth enabled them to avoid inflationary debt financing. More broadly, Asia has
benefited from continued institutional strengthening, financial development, and in many cases
more open trade policies.­
Nevertheless, while considerable progress has
been made, many developing Asian countries
still have far to go before their income and
development levels approach those in advanced
economies. Indeed, almost 700 million Asians,
or 20 percent of the total population, still live
in extreme poverty, a substantial proportion of
them in rural areas (Chen and Ravallion, 2004).
To get a sense of whether and to what extent
Asia’s growth is indeed likely to be sustained
over the long run, the chapter undertakes a
systematic analysis of this growth performance.
It first examines the sources of growth, and then
considers the role that policies have played in
achieving these outcomes.­

Asia’s strong growth performance can be analyzed in terms of demographic developments,
the movement of labor and capital from low- to
high-productivity sectors, within-sector factor
accumulation, and technological progress. To
the extent that growth reflects increases in total
factor productivity as well as, say, capital accumulation, it is more likely to prove sustainable
over the long term. To explore this issue, the
respective contributions of the various sources
of growth are calculated using different growth
accounting exercises, first at the aggregate level
and then at the sectoral level. The findings are
then related to policy variables to help understand what underlies the observed trends.­
As a first step, growth in output per capita is
decomposed into changes in (1) labor productivity (output per worker); (2) participation

rates; and (3) the age structure of the population. The results show that, during 1970–2005,
growth differences—both across regions and
within Asia—were driven mainly by labor productivity (Figure 3.3). That said, in both Asia
and Latin America, demographic developments
provided an important boost to growth. In a few
countries, such as Indonesia, Korea, and Taiwan
Province of China, the demographic growth
impact amounted to more than 1 percentage
point per year.­
Next, growth in labor productivity can be
decomposed into (1) capital deepening (i.e.,
increases in physical capital per worker); (2) rising labor quality; and (3) growing TFP. The
results indicate that, during 1970–2005, Asia
enjoyed both faster physical capital accumulation and faster TFP growth than other developing economies; in contrast, Asia’s catch-up with
advanced economies largely reflected capital
accumulation. More specifically, physical capital
accumulation contributed 1.75 to 3 percentage points to growth in fast-developing Asian
countries, much more than observed in other
regions (Figure 3.3). Rising education levels
were also important, boosting Asian growth on
average by !/2 percentage point. TFP contributed
0.75 to 2 percentage points to growth in India,
Japan, the NIEs, and Thailand. In Japan,

8See Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2005) and Jorgenson

of the literature, the capital share in income is assumed
equal to 0.35. The main results are robust to estimating
its value. Estimates of physical capital are based on Nehru

Lederman (1999) using World Economic Outlook data on
gross fixed capital formation. Estimates of human capital
are based on Barro and Lee (2000).
9Our results for the NIEs are broadly similar (over comparable periods) to those reported in Young (1995) with
the exception that TFP growth for Singapore through
1990 is estimated at over 1 percentage point, rather than
0.2 percentage point. Sarel (1996) discusses the sensitivity
of the estimates to alternative assumptions.

more than observed in other regions. Rising education levels were also important. Total factor productivity (TFP) contributed 0.75 to

TFP growth declined steadily after the initial
takeoff; Box 3.1 analyzes in greater detail the
determinants of, and future prospects for, Japanese productivity growth. In the ASEAN-4, low
average TFP growth masks significant crosscountry heterogeneity, with the Philippines
having performed relatively poorly (see also
IMF, 2005a, 2006a). In China, strikingly, both
capital accumulation and TFP growth were
substantially higher than in other Asian fast
developers, both when compared over the same
period, and at similar stages of their integration process.10
The growth literature has recently devoted
much attention to the impact of investment in
information and communications technology,
or ICT (see, for instance, Jorgenson and Vu,
2005). Key questions are whether the accelerated decline in ICT prices that characterized
the 1990s led to a surge of investment in ICT
equipment and software, and whether this had a
significant impact on productivity. These issues
are analyzed using a smaller cross-country data
set covering the period 1989–2005.11 The results
suggest that economy-wide investment in ICT
capital indeed had an impact on growth, averaging about !/2 percentage point in the NIEs and
China (Figure 3.4). However, Asia does not stand
out along this dimension, and the impact of nonICT capital accumulation is much larger.12
Regarding the effects of the Asian Crisis,
growth rates have typically recovered to pre­crisis levels.13 In contrast, investment rates

10Estimates for TFP growth in China may be influenced
by inaccurate investment price deflators. See also Young
(2003) for a discussion of Chinese statistics.
11This is an updated version of the dataset in Jorgenson
and Vu, 2005.
12The ICT revolution can also affect aggregate productivity more directly, through TFP growth in ICT-producing
sectors themselves. These sectors account for 10 percent
or more of total value added in several Asian countries,
including Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and
Taiwan Province of China. However, it did not prove possible to estimate TFP growth within these sectors.
13See, for instance, Cerra and Saxena (2003). Studies of a broader sample of financial and currency crises
also typically find that such crises do not have long-term
effects on growth (Barro, 2001; and Park and Lee, 2001).

Box 3.1. Japan’s Potential Output and Productivity Growth
After four decades of rapid growth, Japan’s
economy stagnated in the 1990s, following
the collapse of the asset-price bubble. Japan’s
economic revival over the past four years raises
the question of whether the country’s potential output growth has now begun to recover
as structural adjustments to the imbalances of
the so-called “bubble” years have strengthened
fundamentals. At the same time, an aging population weighs against strong growth of potential
output. With Japan’s birth rate well below the
population’s replacement rate, the working-age
population has been contracting since 2000,
and the elderly dependency ratio (the share in
the working-age population of people at least 65
years old) is now the highest among industrial
countries. With a declining labor force, per
capita income growth will depend critically on
higher productivity.

What Is Potential Output Growth in Japan?
There are a plethora of studies on Japan’s
potential output growth. Depending on the
methodology used, results differ markedly in
terms of the estimated potential output growth
and the contributions of key factors. Estimates
of potential output growth prepared by official
agencies range between 11/2 and 2 percent. A
recent IMF staff study (IMF, 2006b) seeks to get
a new handle on the determinants of Japan’s
potential growth, taking into account gains from
past structural reforms as well as capital deepening and embodied technical change. The key
results are as follows.­
• Potential output growth has increased steadily
since 2001 to over 11/2 percent in 2005, from
less than 1 percent a year at the end of the
1990s (first figure). Nonetheless, it remains

well below levels attained during the 1980s,
when it was close to 4 percent a year.­
• The improvement in potential output growth
is mainly attributable to a rise in total factor
productivity (TFP) growth—the outcome of
an improved use of resources and increased
competition. TFP growth has increased to
11/4 percent a year in 2005, from less than
1/4 percent in 1998.­
• The contribution of the capital stock, on the
other hand, has declined since the collapse of
investment in the early 1990s: growth in the
capital stock now accounts for just over 1/2 percentage point of potential output growth,
down from more than 2 percentage points in
the early 1990s. This decline partly reflects
adjustments in the corporate sector that have
delayed new investment and disposed of old
capital stock.­

Box 3.1 (concluded)
• Finally, labor inputs continue to contribute
negatively to potential output growth, reflecting a shrinking working-age population as
well as a plateau in the labor force participation rate and a secular rise in structural
unemployment. The negative contribution of
employment has, however, been partly offset
by a positive contribution of the number
of hours worked, as a result of the recent
pickup in full-time job growth.­

The recent pickup in TFP growth reflects
improvements across most sectors of the Japanese economy, particularly manufacturing (see
second figure).­
• TFP growth in the manufacturing sector
averaged 33/4 percent a year between 2000
and 2004, up from virtually zero on average between 1995 and 1999. Within the
manufacturing sector, there have been large
improvements in TFP growth in information
technology (IT)-related sectors such as “electrical machinery, equipment and supplies,”
“precision instruments,” and “machinery.”
These developments are consistent with the
findings by Jorgenson and Motohashi (2005)
that the IT sector’s contribution to aggregate
productivity growth has increased since the
mid-1990s.­
• Both the real estate sector and the finance
and insurance industry also contributed
significantly to the rise in productivity
growth. For example, TFP growth in the
real estate industry rose to an average of
1/2 percent a year during 2000–04, compared
with –33/4 percent during 1995–99. How­
ever, gains in aggregate TFP growth have
been somewhat limited by developments
in the wholesale and retail construction,
and “other services” sectors, which now
account for just over a third of total output and about 50 percent of total employment (broadly speaking, these sectors have
suffered from over-regulation or excess
capacity).­

Source: IMF staff calculations.

What Is the Likely Impact of Reforms Undertaken in
Recent Years?
The empirical evidence suggests that the
recent improvement in TFP stems at least in
part from greater product market competition
(notably in tradables), higher openness, and
increased research and development (R&D)
intensity (see table). Econometric estimates
imply that reducing markups by 1 percentage
point stimulates TFP growth by about the same
amount; raising import penetration by 10 percentage points increases TFP growth by about
!/4 percentage point; and increasing R&D intensity by 1 percentage point raises TFP growth by
broadly the same amount.­

plagued by severe measurement problems, especially

tural)—together with R&D investment could significantly boost TFP, and hence potential output
growth. Further efforts to liberalize the labor
market to reduce structural unemployment
could also provide substantial gains to potential output growth. Structural unemployment
appears to be in part related to the generosity
of the unemployment insurance system (the
level of out-of-work benefits relative to in-work
wages and salaries) and the aging of the labor
force, which worsens skills mismatches, increases
rigidities through seniority-based pay scales
and lower reallocation of workers, and reduces
participation.­
Combining product and labor market reforms
with a moderate increase in women’s participation rate over five years could raise potential
growth over the same period by !/2 percent a
year. Of this !/2 percentage point increase in
potential output growth, a !/4 percentage point
would stem from higher TFP growth, and the
remainder from rising labor inputs.­
Women’s participation rate is assumed to increase
by 23/4 percentage points, to 64 percent. The average
for the United States and the United Kingdom is 69
percent.

Sectoral Effects: Cross-Sector Shifts or
Within-Sector Growth?
This section gauges to what extent strong
Asian productivity growth reflects sectoral shift
and composition effects, as opposed to pure
within-sector productivity growth. The sectoral
shift effect refers to the increase in average
labor productivity that results as labor and capital move over time from lower- toward higherproductivity sectors, in response to economic
incentives and policies. The sectoral composition effect captures the higher aggregate
productivity growth that follows from having a
higher share of sectors with intrinsically high
productivity growth. Importantly, sectoral shifts
are not mechanical processes: their speed and

The share of industry in value added is higher than predicted in developing Asia,
especially in ASEAN-4 (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand) and
China, reflecting strong productivity in this sector. On the other hand, the share of
employment in agriculture is very high across developing Asia and much more so
than predicted by fundamentals, suggesting low productivity in this sector. India
stands out with a relatively high productivity in services.

extent reflect the willingness and ability of labor
and capital to move toward higher-productivity
uses, all of which are strongly affected by the
policy environment.­
The analysis is performed at two levels of
aggregation. First, a distinction is made between
agriculture, industry, and services, using data
from the World Development Indicators (World
Bank, 2006). The second decomposition focuses
on sectoral effects within manufacturing (the
main component of industry), and draws a distinction between high-skill and low-skill subsectors (here, the UNIDO Industrial Database is
the main source of data). Throughout, the focus
is on labor productivity, rather than TFP, owing
to the limited data available on sectoral capital
stocks.­

Across Agriculture, Industry, and Services
Asia currently stands out as having a relatively
high share of value added in industry, and a
low share in services (Figure 3.5 and Appendix
3.1).15 This holds true whether Asia is compared
to the United States, to Latin America, or to the
levels predicted on the basis of its fundamental
characteristics.16 However, there is significant
variation within Asia. Japan and the NIEs are
advanced economies and they share the sectoral composition of similarly placed economies
in other regions. In contrast, China and to a
lesser extent the ASEAN-4 are characterized
by an exceptionally high share of value added
in industry and an exceptionally low share in
services, compared to both other countries and
predicted levels; the opposite holds true for
India.­
In addition, developing Asia in general, and
China and India in particular, have a much
higher employment share in agriculture (and a
correspondingly lower share in services) than

and restaurants; transport; telecommunications; financial

Sectoral Effects: Cross-Sector Shifts or Within-Sector Growth?

predicted based on fundamental characteristics.
Combining the information on value added and
employment suggests relatively low agricultural
productivity throughout developing Asia. In
contrast, productivity levels are relatively high
in industry for China and the ASEAN-4 and in
services for India.­
Although still large, the relative importance of
agriculture has in fact declined sharply in Asia
over the last three decades (Figure 3.6).17 The
shift was larger than observed in other regions,
and proved especially strong in China, the
ASEAN-4, Korea, and Taiwan Province of China.
For instance, agriculture accounted for about a
third of Korea’s and Taiwan Province of China’s
economies in the 1960s, but less than one-tenth
by the 1980s. Throughout developing Asia, the
movement of labor into the services sector was
at least as large as that toward industry. Also,
while in most of Asia the share of industry in
total employment is still growing, in Japan and
the NIEs a movement from industry to services
is well under way.­
The effect of sectoral shifts on aggregate
productivity depends on the intersectoral differences in productivity levels. For the world as
a whole, labor productivity in nonagricultural
sectors is about three times higher than in agriculture; in Asia, the differential is even larger,
consistent with the finding that agricultural
productivity is lower than predicted (Figure
3.6).18 As a result, the shift from agriculture
to industry and services has had a significant
positive effect on Asian productivity levels (see
below). Intersectoral productivity differentials
remained high at the end of the period; indeed,
they have widened over time in both China and
India, reflecting strong productivity growth in,
respectively, industry and services. This suggests
further potential growth benefits from future
intersectoral resource movements.­
17The employment share of agriculture declined by an
average 0.6 percentage point per year.
18While the measurement of productivity, especially in
services, is subject to many caveats, these intersectoral
gaps appear sufficiently large to reflect real productivity
differences.

Figure 3.6. Employment and Labor Productivity in the
Agricultural Sector Over Time
(Percent of total employment unless otherwise noted)

The agricultural sector's share of total employment has generally decreased over
time in all regions, but the decline has been faster in Asia, which started from a
higher level. Despite some convergence, productivity in non-agricultural sectors
remains well above that of agriculture, particularly in Asia.

1955 for Japan, 1967 for the newly industrialized economies (NIEs), 1973 for the ASEAN-4
(Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand), 1979 for China, 1982 for India, and
1990 for other Asian economies.

3 Sample includes China, India, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore (except
for agriculture, which has a marginal role in this country), and Thailand. Productivity levels
are adjusted based on economy-wide PPP factors; this may overstate productivity in
industry, while understating productivity in services.

86

Turning to sectoral composition, its effect on
aggregate productivity depends on the sectorspecific rates of productivity growth (Figure 3.7).
A general pattern, observed across all regions
of the world during 1980–2004, is that productivity growth in both industry and agriculture
exceeded that in services. For Asia, three other
facts stand out.­
First, productivity growth was highest in
industry—with the exception of India, where
productivity grew most rapidly in services. A
number of reasons have been put forward
for India’s performance, including advances
in communications technology, which have
allowed India to exploit its comparative advantage in services (especially its plentiful supply
of trained English-speaking personnel); the
successful deregulation of services sectors such
as communications;19 privatization and opening up to foreign direct investment (FDI); and
financial sector reforms (Gupta, 2005; and
Kochhar and others, 2006).­
Second, productivity growth in Asia in
both industry and (until recently) services far
exceeded that in other regions of the world,
consistent with Asia’s faster aggregate productivity growth, and implying a catch-up in sectoral
productivity toward U.S. levels. Within Asia too,
countries with higher productivity growth in one
sector tended to have higher productivity growth
in other sectors. This suggests that growth is
importantly influenced by country-specific factors, which affect similarly the performance of
all sectors of an economy.­
Third, after the initial takeoff, productivity
growth eventually decelerated, especially in services—although this process has not yet begun
in China nor India (Figure 3.8). Indeed, while
Asian countries on average continue catching up
to advanced-economy industrial productivity levels, in services this process may be coming to a
19Productivity levels in the less protected software and
telecommunications sectors are about 40–50 percent of
U.S. levels. In contrast, productivity levels in the more
sheltered retail and retail banking sectors are only,
respectively, 6 and 12 percent of U.S. levels. See McKinsey
Global Institute (2001 and 2006).

Sectoral Effects: Cross-Sector Shifts or Within-Sector Growth?

halt before full convergence has been achieved,
and in agriculture little catch-up has been
observed since the end of the Green Revolution.
To offset this, as discussed later in this chapter,
determined policy action is needed to tackle
barriers to productivity growth.­
The gap in average labor productivity growth
between any given country and, say, the United
States can be decomposed into three components, reflecting differences in sectoral shifts;
sectoral composition; and within-sector productivity growth (see Appendix 3.1). Such a decomposition suggests that sectoral shifts have in
general helped Asia catch up to U.S. productivity
levels, both because labor moved out of agriculture at a faster rate in Asia, and because the
initial intersectoral productivity differentials were
higher in Asia (Figure 3.9).20 Specifically, sectoral
shifts boosted productivity growth in Asia relative
to the United States by !/2 percentage point per
year, out of a total observed differential of 2 percentage points. Regression analysis confirms the
potentially large productivity-enhancing effect of
employment moving from agriculture to other
sectors,21 in line with existing estimates for developing countries.22 All Asian subregions except
Japan benefited substantially over the last three
decades from sectoral shifts, especially China. By
contrast, in Latin America, sectoral shifts were
too weak to help promote convergence toward
the United States.­
Turning to the sectoral composition effect,
this is positive, though relatively modest, for
both Asia and Latin America, reflecting the
smaller share of services (where productivity has

22See, for instance, Poirson (2000 and 2001), and
Bloom, Canning, and Malaney (1999). Dekle and Vandenbroucke (2006) find also that labor reallocation from
the public to the private nonagricultural sector has played
an important role in China’s growth in recent years.

Within Manufacturing
A similar analysis was performed to determine
to what extent shift and composition effects
affected productivity within the manufacturing sector. For this purpose, manufacturing was
divided into skill-intensive and nonskill-intensive
sectors.23 Asia, and in particular the NIEs, China,
and India, stand out as having a relatively large
share of manufacturing value added and employment in skill-intensive sectors. This holds compared to both Latin America and (in most cases)
the levels that would be predicted based on
fundamentals such as income per capita, country
size, and population (Figure 3.10).24 Since the

grown relatively slowly) in these countries than
in the United States. Within Asia, the composition effect was especially large in China and
the ASEAN-4, reflecting the very high share of
industry in their value added.­
Altogether, sectoral shift and composition
effects account for about 40 percent of Asia’s
productivity catch-up toward U.S. levels. Thus,
the greater part of Asia’s catch-up reflects
strong productivity growth within both industry and services. Conversely, Latin America’s
­relative stagnation and divergence from the
United States largely reflect lagging productivity growth within both industry and services.
The key question, to which we return, is what
are the deeper fundamentals, including policy
variables, that explain these differences in
outcomes.

23Specifically, the 28 manufacturing subsectors in the
UNIDO database were aggregated into skill-intensive versus nonskill-intensive sectors. Each aggregate contained
14 subsectors. The definition of skill intensity was based
on the income share of skilled labor, calculated using
the input-output matrix for South Africa (Kochhar and
others, 2006).
24Hausmann, Hwang, and Rodrik (2005) and Rodrik
(2006) also find that China and India export an abnormally high share of products that are typically produced
by higher-income countries. Note also that when population is not included as a control, the difference between
Asia’s actual and predicted skill-intensive employment
share rises to 10 percentage points.

Sectoral Effects: Cross-Sector Shifts or Within-Sector Growth?

mid-1960s,25 the rate at which labor has moved
from nonskill to skill-intensive ­sectors has
been about the same as in the United States
and other advanced economies, and much
higher than in Latin America (although the
magnitudes involved are much smaller than is
the case for the shift out of agriculture). The
data confirm that both productivity levels and
productivity growth are higher in skill-intensive
than in nonskill-intensive sectors.26
Aggregate manufacturing productivity grew
faster in Asia than in the United States. However, the differential was smaller than in the
case of overall productivity; indeed, manu­
facturing productivity in the ASEAN-4 and India
actually grew more slowly than in the United
States (Figure 3.11). Most of Asia’s catch-up
in manufacturing productivity was attributable
to high productivity growth within skill-intensive sectors. The contribution of sectoral shifts
was generally small.27 Driving this, both the
magnitude of labor shifts across manufacturing ­subsectors and the productivity differentials between these subsectors were smaller
than between agriculture and the nonagricultural sector. The contribution from sectoral
composition was actually negative and quite
significant for Asia, at close to !/2 percentage
point per year. This result was driven mostly by
Indonesia and Other Asia, where the share of
skill-­intensive, high productivity-growth sectors is substantially smaller than in the United
States. Unlike Asia, Latin America experienced
a decline over time in manufacturing productivity relative to the United States, above all
because of slower productivity growth within
nonskill-intensive sectors, combined with a
relatively large share of such sectors in overall
manufacturing.­

Figure 3.10. Skill-Intensive Manufacturing Sectors:

Asia stands out as having a large share of manufacturing value-added and

(Percentage points, per year)

Most of Asia's catch-up in manufacturing productivity was attributable to high
productivity growth within skill-intensive sectors. The contribution from sectoral
composition was actually negative, driven by the lower share of value added in
skill-intensive sectors vis-à-vis the United States.

The analysis so far suggests that Asia’s strong
productivity performance has in good part
reflected differences in within-sector productivity growth rates. Further, those countries that
have performed well across countries in a sector
also have tended to perform well in other sectors, and this is not purely related to catch-up
effects. All this is consistent with a significant
role for country-specific factors, such as strong
institutions and favorable macroeconomic
policies—an issue now examined in greater
detail. Intersectoral resource movements have
also contributed significantly to Asia’s growth,
and this section goes on to examine how the
policy environment has facilitated such shifts of
resources.­
In recent years, the large empirical literature
on cross-country differences in output growth
(see, for instance, World Economic Outlook, April
2003, Chapter III; and Bosworth and Collins,
2003) has emphasized the key role of institutional quality and human capital. The empirical
literature on determinants of TFP growth across
broad samples of countries is more limited,28
and has generally emphasized the importance
of trade openness.29
The data set used in this chapter is consistent with these conclusions. Over the period
1965–2005, cross-country differences in productivity growth, as proxied by either labor productivity or TFP growth, were closely related to
variables that capture key aspects of the policy
environment (see Figure 3.12). In particular,
countries with higher productivity growth also
28There is, however, a substantial literature on the
determinants of productivity differences across industrial
countries, as well as national studies on the sources of
inter-industry productivity differences.
29For instance, Edwards (1998) uses alternative openness
indicators to demonstrate that more open ­countries experience faster TFP growth; Coe, Helpman, and Hoff­maister
(1997) show that developing countries that trade with
R&D intensive industrial countries have higher productivity growth; and Miller and Upadhyay (2000) find that
human capital boosts TFP in low-income countries only
when these countries achieve certain levels of openness.

Policy Determinants of Productivity Growth

Figure 3.12. Determinants of Productivity Growth,
1965–2005
(Level expressed as multiple of sample standard deviations)

Countries with higher productivity growth tend to have relatively strong institutions, a
more favorable business climate, better infrastructure, less restrictive trade policies,
higher education levels, and a lower initial share of agricultural employment.

institutional quality is measured by
the Kaufmann-Kraay-Mastruzzi index of government
effectiveness. The entrepreneurial climate is proxied by
the cost of starting a business (as a share of per capita
income) from the World Bank’s Doing Business database.
Education levels are measured by average educational
attainment, from Barro and Lee (2000). Trade openness is measured by the Welch-Wacziarg index (countries
are considered closed if any of the following hold: an
export-marketing board exists; the economy is considered
socialist; the period-average tariff rate exceeds 40 percent;
the share of goods subject to nontariff barriers exceeds
40 percent; or the local-currency black market premium
exceeds 20 percent).
31For instance, the Korean civil service was radically transformed during the 1960s, through, among
other moves, the introduction of merit-based systems in
recruitment and promotion, eventually becoming a wellregarded bureaucracy by the 1970s (World Bank, 1993,
Box 4.4). See Chapter III, “Building Institutions,” of the
September 2005 World Economic Outlook, for a broader
discussion of institutional change.

tended to have relatively strong institutions, a
better-developed financial system, a generally
more favorable business climate (as indicated by
lower costs of starting a business), better infrastructure, less restrictive trade policies, higher
education levels, and a lower initial share of
agricultural employment.30
Figure 3.12 also shows that Asia performs
better than Latin America and other developing
countries on most of these indicators, especially
with regard to institutional quality, trade openness, and financial sector development, suggesting they have been important factors behind its
strong productivity growth. That said, the quality
of Asia’s institutions, business climate, infrastructure, and policies do not yet match those of
advanced economies. In addition, regional aggregates mask significant intraregional variations:
for instance, the quality of infrastructure is much
higher in Japan and the NIEs than elsewhere
in Asia. In this context, it is worth underscoring
that the quality of a country’s institutions are not
a given, and can be strengthened by reforms,
even within relatively short periods.31
A more formal econometric analysis of the
determinants of aggregate productivity growth
confirms these broad correlations (see Appendix 3.1). Interestingly, the significance of the

CHAPTER 3   Asia Rising: Patterns of Economic Development and Growth

openness and initial schooling variables weakens
after controlling for institutions, confirming
earlier results from the literature. As argued in
Chapter III of the September 2005 World Economic Outlook, openness and educational quality
may affect growth outcomes in part precisely
through their impact on institutional quality.
Turning to within-sector productivity growth,
similar determinants emerge for industry as at
the aggregate level, while in services the cost of
starting a business appears especially important,
suggesting that fixed costs act more as a barrier
to entry in this sector given the typically smaller
scale of operations.
Some of these same factors are also important in facilitating shifts of labor from agriculture toward nonagricultural sectors, another
source of aggregate productivity growth. Most
prominently, trade liberalization has a statistically and economically significant impact on
the magnitude of shifts in employment toward
nonagricultural sectors, especially among Asian
countries, and this effect is quite robust to the
introduction of other determinants (see Figure
3.13, as well as Appendix 3.1). For instance,
trade openness played an important role in
encouraging the movement of labor out of the
agriculture sector in Japan, the NIEs, and the
ASEAN-4, whereas relatively low openness to
trade in China and India significantly slowed
this process.­ This suggests that trade openness
may boost productivity to a large extent through
its impact on sectoral reallocation.
Greater financial development has also promoted the movement of labor toward industry
and services, especially by alleviating liquidity
constraints facing current and potential entrepreneurs (see Rajan and Zingales, 1998). This
factor helped support the structural transformation process in Japan and the NIEs, but less
so elsewhere. Investments in human as well as
physical capital also played a role (albeit more
limited) in supporting migration out of agriculture (see Poirson, 2000 and 2001). Physical
capital accumulation is associated with increases
in the relative labor productivity of industry;
similarly, higher education levels increase an

92

individual’s capacity to make the transition to
the modern economy. Finally, and not surprisingly, the greater the initial share of employment in agriculture, the larger the scope for
labor to shift.
As discussed, productivity growth in Asia has
been relatively slow in service sectors. Indeed,
productivity in services relative to the United
States has stagnated in recent years. Empirical
studies suggest that deregulation and further
opening to foreign competition would be particularly beneficial in unlocking these sectors’
growth potential (see Nicoletti and Scarpetta,
2003; Conway and others, forthcoming; as well as
Box 3.1 for Japan; and the previous discussion of
India). Priorities include steps to promote greater
competition in infrastructure-related services,
such as telecommunications; further opening the
retail and financial sectors to foreign competition
(McKinsey Global Institute, 2001 and 2006); and
lifting restrictions on entry into social services,
including health and education. Increasing the
transparency and consistency of regulation and
streamlining administrative procedures would
also prove advantageous. For instance, in India,
where regulation of some sectors is decentralized,
harmonizing regulations across states would facilitate greater private sector participation.­
Much effort has recently been devoted
to improving the quality of Asian corporate
governance. As emphasized in Box 3.2, better
governance may be expected to yield significant
benefits in terms of growth and productivity,
particularly for those industries that rely most
heavily on external finance (see Khatri, Leruth,
and Piesse, 2002). Yet, while reforms in the
past few years have led to important improvements, the region still lags significantly behind
advanced-economy standards.­
Cross-country data sets can, admittedly, only
provide crude indications of the factors behind
individual countries’ performance.32 For exam-

32Among other issues, cross-country panel data for
most institutional measures are not widely available, making it difficult to relate productivity growth to the change
in (as opposed to level of) institutional quality.

conclusions

Conclusions
Asia has enjoyed a remarkable growth performance since the end of World War II. Both
income per capita and labor productivity in
most sectors have rapidly increased toward
advanced-economy levels. An analysis of this
striking record highlights several key lessons,

Figure 3.13. Determinants of Labor Shifts from
Agriculture 1

(Difference from Asia average; annual average; percentage points)
The magnitude of labor shifts out of agriculture is to a large extent determined by the
initial employment share of the sector and trade openness. Financial development
and capital accumulation also play a role in the structural transformation process.

ple, while the cross-country analysis above does
not explain well China’s remarkable productivity
growth, more detailed, country-specific studies
confirm a strong link to its post-1979 reforms.
These involved, among other moves, the substantial development of property rights, whose
impact was most dramatically felt in agriculture;
the opening of markets; the removal of barriers
to capital and labor mobility; and the setting
up of Special Economic Zones (see Tseng and
Rodlauer, 2003, in particular Chapter II; and the
April 2005 World Economic Outlook). In contrast,
slow TFP growth in the ASEAN-4, and especially
in the Philippines, may have reflected, among
other things, weaknesses in the quality of institutions and of infrastructure (IMF, 2005a and
2006a). As for Japan, Box 3.1 suggests that the
reduction of lingering product market distortions (e.g., cutting excessive domestic regulation
of the retail sector and further liberalizing agricultural trade), together with efforts to liberalize
labor markets and boost R&D investment, could
significantly boost TFP growth.­
Looking ahead, late developers (such as the
ASEAN-4, China, and India) will continue to
enjoy favorable catch-up effects for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, this analysis suggests
that continued convergence toward advancedeconomy income and productivity levels will
require further structural reforms to maintain
and indeed improve the favorable business
climate. In particular, this will require improved
corporate governance, as well as further upgrading of education levels and continued trade
liberalization, so as to both underpin strong
within-sector productivity growth and create
incentives for further labor reallocation toward
higher-productivity sectors.­

Box 3.2. The Evolution and Impact of Corporate Governance Quality in Asia

94

In the aftermath of the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98, many Asian countries
implemented new laws and regulations aimed
at strengthening corporate governance.
However, assessing the evolution of corporate
governance quality using measures of de jure
changes is difficult for two reasons. First, actual
improvements may not necessarily immediately
follow the enactment of new rules because of
lags in implementation and/or enforcement.
Second, firms can choose to implement measures strengthening their corporate governance
prior to or independently of the enactment of new
rules whenever the benefits of good corporate
governance, especially in terms of easier and
less costly access to finance, are critical for
their growth prospects. The relevant question,
then, is whether corporate governance quality
in Asia has actually improved. And, do improvements in corporate governance contribute to
growth?
A study by De Nicolò, Laeven, and Ueda
(2006) addresses these questions by constructing a time series of a composite Corporate
Governance Quality (CGQ) index for Asian
countries and other major emerging markets and advanced economies for the period
1994–2003. The CGQ index is a simple average
of three indicators, called Accounting Standards,
Earning Smoothing, and Stock Price Synchronicity.
These indicators are constructed from accounting and market data for samples of nonfinancial
companies listed in domestic stock markets and
are standardized so that they vary between zero
and unity. Larger values denote better corporate
governance quality.­
The Accounting Standards indicator is a simple
measure of the amount of accounting infor-

mation disclosed by each country’s 10 largest
firms (by asset size). Specifically, it measures
the fraction of variables reported out of 40 key
accounting items, selected based on data availability among those identified by the Center for
International Financial Analysis and Research
(CIFAR, 1993). The Earning Smoothing indicator
is a measure of “earnings opacity” proposed by
Leuz, Nanda, and Wysocki (2003) and Bhattacharya, Daouk, and Welker (2003) and tracks
the extent to which managers may conceal the
true performance of firms. Specifically, it equals
the rank correlation between cash flows (before
any accounting adjustments) and profits (after
accounting adjustments) across a set of firms in
each year. The Stock Price Synchronicity indicator
is a measure proposed by Morck, Yeung, and Yu
(2000), who find that stock price movements
are more correlated in countries where corporate governance is poor and financial systems
are less developed. The latter two measures
can be viewed as indicators capturing different, albeit complementary, dimensions of firm
transparency.
As shown in the first figure, the aggregate
CGQ index has improved in most Asian countries since the 1997–98 crisis, although in some
countries the changes are small or indeed negligible. As shown in the second figure, a similar
pattern characterizes the evolution of each
component of the index: some countries exhibit
notable improvements in all dimensions, while
others record negligible improvements (or even
a worsening) in some dimensions. Overall, the
most notable improvements appear to be in the
Earnings Smoothing and Stock Price Synchronicity
indicators, rather than in the Accounting Standards dimension.­

Nicolò, Luc Laeven, and Kenichi Ueda.­
1See OECD (2003). For reviews of the literature on
corporate governance, see Becht, Bolton, and Roell
(2003); and Berglöf and Claessens (2006).
2Corporate governance quality may be viewed partly
as an “endogenous” firm-level choice, as pointed out
by Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Palia (1999); and
Coles, Lemmon, and Meschke (forthcoming).

The correlation between the three measures is low,
ranging between 0.15 and 0.35.
As the CGQ index measures corporate governance quality at the country level, it records not only
improvements taking place in existing firms, but also
those due to the exit of poorly governed firms, which
may have occurred during episodes of severe financial
stress, such as the Asian Crisis.

A critical question is whether improvements in corporate governance quality have
“real” effects. Aggregate economic activity
and industry growth may be affected through
several channels. For example, improvements
in the quality of corporate governance may
affect growth by lowering firms’ cost of funds
and increasing the supply of credit, thereby
encouraging investment. Industries that rely
more on outside finance are likely to benefit
most from this channel. Better governed firms
may align managers’ and stakeholders’ interests more closely, providing stronger incentives
for managers to attain improvements in firms’
productivity.­

the relevance of these effects indirectly through

cross-country panel regressions, covering both
advanced economies and emerging markets,
that relate the CGQ index to measures of output
growth, total factor productivity (TFP) growth,
and industry growth. As shown in the table, their
results indicate that improvements in corporate
governance quality indeed have a positive and
significant effect on GDP and TFP growth, as
well as on the relative growth of those industries
dependent on external finance, consistent with

both for Asian countries aiming to continue
converging toward advanced-economy income
levels, and for other developing economies seeking to emulate their success.­
First, in most of Asia growth has benefited
from rapid increases in TFP, as well as fast accumulation of both physical and human capital.
In turn, these developments reflected a stronger
institutional and policy environment (including with respect to financial development,

96

the notion that well-governed firms are better
able to attract outside financing. For instance,
a one standard deviation increase in the CGQ
index boosts subsequent GDP growth by 0.9 percentage point (or half the sample standard deviation of GDP growth). The impact on TFP growth
is of a similar magnitude. Further, industry-level
sales growth depends positively on the interaction between the CGQ index and a measure of
the industry’s dependence on external finance,
showing that “financially dependent” industries
benefit relatively more from improvements in
corporate governance.
In sum, improvements in corporate governance quality appear to yield tangible benefits
in terms of growth and productivity, particularly
for those industries that rely most on external
finance. Thus, effective implementation of
corporate governance reform appears to be
an important contributing factor to economic
growth. Those Asian countries that effectively
improved their corporate governance appear
to have reaped these benefits. There remains,
however, considerable scope to strengthen corporate governance in Asia further.­
Defined as the share of investment not financed by
operating cash flow (see Rajan and Zingales, 1998).
The relevant coefficient is not measured with precision, that is, it is not statistically significant. However, a
similar regression where each component of the CGQ

dependent on external finance (see De Nicolò,
Laeven, and Ueda, 2006)

the business climate, and in many cases trade
openness) than observed in other developing
economies. Looking ahead, late developers in
Asia, and indeed other parts of the world, can
draw important lessons from these aspects of the
experience of fast-growing Asian economies. In
particular, the findings in this chapter underline
the importance of fostering higher standards of
education, so as to support skill- and innovationbased industries and move up the value-added

Appendix 3.1. Methods and Additional Results

chain, as well as of continuing to strengthen the
quality of corporate and financial-sector governance. Related to this, financial development
also plays a critical part in the growth process.
Within Asia, financial systems, still heavily
centered on banks, will need to be broadened
and deepened, for instance, through efforts
to develop the corporate bond market; among
other things, this will facilitate the financing of
required infrastructural improvements.­
Second, Asia’s long-run macroeconomic
achievements have also depended importantly
on policies that encouraged resource shifts from
low- to high-productivity sectors. This applied
both to the overall shift from agriculture toward
industry and services and to the continuing
move within manufacturing toward higher valueadded products. Looking ahead, a continuing
shift of labor away from the still-large agricultural sector will, especially in lower-income countries, provide an important channel to boost
growth and reduce rural poverty. Further efforts
to increase trade openness, ensure widespread
access to education and health care, and encourage entrepreneurship will help these countries
sustain this vital transition. More generally,
ensuring significant structural flexibility, including in labor markets, while establishing effective
social safety nets will prove increasingly important as Asia strives to maintain its competitive
edge, provide growing employment in industry
and services, and make significant inroads into
poverty eradication.­
Third, in Asia (as in many advanced economies) there remains a persistent gap in productivity growth rates between industry and services,
partly reflecting the sheltered nature of many
service sectors. Further, over time Asian service-sector productivity growth has decelerated
markedly, in many cases stalling convergence
toward advanced-economy productivity levels;
this can be viewed as an indication of missed
opportunities. As economies grow wealthier
and become ever more focused on services, it
will prove increasingly important to encourage
competition and productivity growth in this
sector, including by removing barriers to entry,

streamlining regulations, and strengthening
human capital.­

Jaumotte and Hélène Poirson.­
This appendix presents the methodology
underlying the results presented in this chapter,
as well as some additional results for the effects

growth.­

Sectoral Structure: Actual Versus Predicted
This section presents the methodology used
to evaluate the structure of Asian economies
and, in particular, to determine whether the
relative importance of agriculture, industry, and
services is in line with what would be predicted
based on fundamentals, such as GDP per capita
and the size of the economy. Following Kochhar and others (2006) the actual share of each
sector in value added (or, alternatively, employment) is regressed on a set of fundamental
determinants and a dummy variable for Asia or
the Asian subregions. Fundamentals included
are the logs of output per capita (in PPP U.S.
dollars), geographic size, and population. The
cross-country regressions are estimated by
ordinary least squares (OLS)33 using the latest
available data for the sectoral shares and a broad
sample of advanced and developing economies.
The predicted value for the sectoral share of
value added is then calculated as the difference
between the actual share and the value of the
dummy variable for that region. Table 3.1 shows
for each region, both globally and within Asia,
the actual shares of agriculture, industry, and
services in value added and in employment in
the latest available year, as well as the difference
between the actual and the predicted values. A
similar analysis is performed for the respective
33Using a generalized linear model, and imposing that
the share be between 0 and 100, yields similar results.

manufacturing, as presented in the chapter.­

Sectoral Decomposition: Methodology
This section describes the methodology used
to isolate the contributions of sectoral effects
and within-sector productivity growth to aggregate labor productivity growth. The analysis
focuses on two types of sectoral effects:
• The sectoral reallocation effect. When a country
reallocates labor from a low-productivity to
a high-productivity sector, this contributes to
raising its aggregate labor productivity (and
hence temporarily boosts labor productivity
growth).­
• The sectoral composition effect. When a country
has a higher value added share of highproductivity growth sectors, this will also
raise its aggregate labor productivity growth.­

98

Denoting labor productivity by y, the employment shares by s, the value added shares by sY,
sectors by j, and first difference by d, aggregate
labor productivity growth for any given country
and year can first be decomposed as follows:
dyt
yj,t
dyj,t Y
–––
dsj,t –––
+ ∑ ––––
s j,t–1.
yt–1 = ∑
y
y
j
t–1
j
j,t–1
The first term on the right is the sectoral
reallocation effect, where the change in the
employment share of a sector is weighted by its
productivity (scaled by initial aggregate productivity), while the second term is the contribution
of within-sector productivity growth, as measured
by the sector’s productivity growth weighted by
the initial value added share of the sector. Other
studies that have used similar decompositions
include Denison (1962 and 1967) and, more
recently, Bloom, Canning, and Malaney (1999),
and Dekle and Vandenbroucke (2006).­

Appendix 3.1. Methods and Additional Results

In order to isolate a sectoral composition
effect, the chapter further introduces a crosscountry dimension, by focusing on the differential in aggregate labor productivity growth
between the examined country and a comparator country, say the United States. In this case,
the second term, the contribution of within-sector productivity growth, can be further decomposed into a sectoral composition effect and a
new cross-country measure of the contribution
of within-sector productivity growth:

[

]

dyt dyUS,t
yj,t

j yj,t–1 yUS,j,t–1

The first term is now simply the difference
between the sectoral reallocation effects of the
country and the United States; this is called
the “sectoral reallocation” effect in the chapter.
The second term is the sectoral composition
effect, measured by the difference between the
sector’s value added shares in the examined
country and the United States, weighted by the
average productivity growth of the sector in the
two countries. Finally, the last term measures
the contribution from within-sector productivity
growth, as the difference between the sector’s
productivity growth in the examined country
and the United States, weighted by the average sector’s share in value added in the two
countries.­
This decomposition is carried out for each
year of the sample period34 and then a geometric average of the contributions is calculated
for the whole period. The average annual
contributions are rescaled to add up to the
average aggregate labor productivity growth. It
should be noted that the use of average labor

year, allowing a more precise decomposition of the
respective contributions of sectoral effects and productivity than if only the initial and end points of the sample
were used.

productivity (instead of marginal productivity) to evaluate the effect of the reallocation of
employment from one sector to the other (the
first term) rests on the simplifying assumption
that the ratio of marginal labor productivity to
average labor productivity is the same in all sectors. Some other studies have used alternative
(regression-based) approaches to circumvent
the absence of data on marginal labor productivity when estimating the sectoral reallocation
effect (e.g., Poirson, 2000 and 2001). Although
samples and data sources are different, the
order of magnitude obtained in these studies for
the sectoral reallocation effect is broadly comparable to the one obtained in this chapter.­

Econometric Analysis of the Determinants of
Productivity Growth
The analysis uses a standard growth model to
capture the effects of institutions and policies
on cross-country variation in labor productivity
and TFP growth. It also examines the determinants of within-sector productivity growth (in
industry and services) and of labor shifts from
agriculture to nonagricultural sectors, since
these are the main sources of labor productivity
growth. Throughout, institutions are measured
by the Kaufmann-Kraay-Mastruzzi index of
government effectiveness. The cost of starting
a business, as a share of per capita income, is
taken from the World Bank’s Doing Business
database. The measure of trade openness is the
fraction of years where the country was considered as open according to the Welch-Wacziarg
index, and reflects the policy stance. Financial
sector development is proxied by the ratio of
private sector credit to GDP, and education by
the Barro-Lee measure of average schooling
years. The initial level of the productivity gap
(relative to the United States) is included to
capture possible convergence effects (see Barro,
1997). The initial share of employment in agriculture is also introduced to control for sectoral
composition effects. Other fundamentals (such
as the quality of macroeconomic policies and
foreign direct investment) were not significant

1The coefficients denote the impact on the dependent variable (in percentage points) of a one standard deviation increase in its determinants.
The estimates are based on weighted least squares regressions (with robust errors) using as dependent variable the average annual value over
1965—2005 of the variable in the given column. *** denotes coefficients significant at the 1 percent level, ** at the 5 percent level , and * at

once these main determinants were controlled
for, and were thus omitted from the regressions.
The specification for intersectoral labor shifts is
broadly similar, but includes the rates of accumulation of physical and human capital, in line
with previous studies (see Poirson, 2000 and
2001).35 The dataset covers the period 1965–
2005 and the model is estimated by weighted
least squares (with robust standard errors), with
each country’s variance assumed to be inversely

proportional to the number of years for which
the country’s data are available. Initial levels of
financial sector development and education are
used to minimize endogeneity problems, while
for institutions and the cost of starting a business, values are only available for the end of the
sample period.­
The results broadly indicate that initial
income, openness, education, financial sector
development, and institutions have a strong and
significant impact on productivity growth consistent with the empirical literature on TFP and
growth per capita differences across countries
(Table 3.2 and Figure 3.14). The first panel of
the table shows results for a basic model that
omits institutions and the cost of starting a

Appendix 3.1. Methods and Additional Results

business. These suggest that strong productivity
growth relies importantly on:
• A convergence effect (proxied by low initial labor
productivity relative to the United States).
The catch-up effect is indicated by a negative and significant coefficient on the initial
productivity gap in all regressions. The negative coefficient on initial agricultural employment in the regression for labor productivity
growth suggests that countries with a larger
initial share of agricultural employment tend
to experience slower aggregate productivity
growth. Unsurprisingly, the initial employment share in agriculture is also a major
determinant of the magnitude of labor shifts.­
• Trade openness and financial sector development.
Both variables are strongly significant determinants of aggregate productivity growth. Their
effects work mostly through stimulating labor
shifts out of agriculture and boosting industry productivity growth. The effects of these
variables are not estimated precisely in the
services productivity growth equation: in the
case of trade openness, this might reflect the
fact that the indicator used in the regressions
is not a good proxy of the degree of openness
in the services sector.­
• Education. Initial education levels are most significant, both economically and statistically, in
the regressions for within-sector productivity
growth. For labor shifts from agriculture, the
small and only weakly significant effects from
human and physical capital accumulation
may reflect that these variables are themselves
endogenous to other determinants of labor
shifts, and have little separate effect.­
In the second panel of Table 3.2, the model
is augmented with the measures of institutions
and business climate. The results underscore
the importance of these variables. Institutional
quality has an economically and statistically
significant effect on productivity growth at
the aggregate and sectoral levels.36 However,

c­ ontrolling for institutions weakens the significance of the openness and initial schooling variables (in line with earlier results from
the literature and subject to the earlier caveat
about possible endogeneity of the institutional
variable).­
The cost of starting a business exerts a negative effect on productivity growth, especially
in services. Controlling for the cost of starting
a business tends to lower the significance of
financial sector development in the productivity growth regressions. In the equation for labor
shifts, no significant effect of start-up costs is
found. However, a more general specification
allowing for an interaction term between the
cost of starting a business and financial sector
development suggests that the latter matters to
the extent that it reduces the negative effects of
start-up costs.­

How Do Financial Systems Affect
Economic Cycles?

F

inancial systems in advanced economies
have undergone remarkable changes in
recent years, driven primarily by deregulation and improvements in technology.
The pace of these changes has varied across
countries, and important differences remain in
the structure of financial systems across these
economies. This chapter explores how these
differences in financial systems may affect the
response of households and firms to changes in
the economic environment, and thus influence
the cyclical behavior of national economies.­
The changes that have occurred in financial systems have transformed the opportunities for borrowing and saving facing households and firms.
Households now have access to a broader range of
borrowing options (e.g., through the widespread
use of credit cards and home equity loans) and
can easily invest in a wide range of financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and
derivatives. Firms have been able to increasingly
diversify their financing away from banks through
the issuance of bonds in capital markets, while
banks themselves have increasingly moved away
from their traditional deposit-taking and lending
role into fee-generating activities, such as the securitization of loans and the sale of risk management
products. The increase in securitization—through
instruments such as collateralized debt obligations
(CDOs)—has allowed the unbundling of financial
risks, which can be repackaged into portfolios of
financial instruments and transferred to investors willing to assume such risks. The cross-border
component of financial intermediation has also
grown rapidly, particularly at the wholesale level
(i.e., between financial institutions). For example,
although household mortgages are still typically

originated by domestic financial institutions,
markets for mortgage-backed securities attract a
significant presence of foreign investors in a number of countries.­
Despite these overall trends, however, there
are still wide differences across national financial systems. Variations persist in the size of
financial markets and in the importance of bank
and nonbank financial intermediaries (such as
mutual funds, private pension funds, and insurance companies; see Figure 4.1). Average stock
market capitalization as a ratio to GDP during 1995–2004, for example, ranged from 140
percent in the United Kingdom to 40 percent
in Italy. Over the same period, nearly half of the
financial liabilities of the German nonfinancial
sector (including households, nonfinancial
corporates, and the government) were with the
banking sector, while in the United States this
ratio was only around 15 percent.­
Given the close link between the financial
sector and household and firm balance sheets, a
key question is how these differences in financial systems affect macroeconomic behavior.
Although the amplitude of business cycle fluctuations has been on a declining trend across
advanced economies, differences remain in the
resilience of individual countries to business
cycle downturns, asset price fluctuations, and
technological changes (see, for example, Cotis
and Coppel, 2005). Yet few empirical studies to
date have analyzed the effect of different financial structures on business cycle behavior—attention has mostly focused on the role of overall
financial development for growth performance
(see, for example, Levine, 1997; and Wurgler,
2000).­
Against this background, this chapter constructs an index that captures the key differences between financial systems across advanced
economies. This index is then used to examine the relationship between the structure of

national financial systems and economic cycles.
In particular, the chapter addresses the following questions:
• How have financial systems evolved in the
advanced economies? Have they converged
across countries, or have changes in financial
structure proceeded at a differing pace, leading to greater divergence? Have these trends
influenced the relative attractiveness of different countries as a destination for cross-border
capital flows?
• Does the responsiveness of household
consumption and residential investment to
changes in income and wealth differ across
countries depending on the financial system?
• Does the character of the financial system
influence how firms respond to short-term
changes in demand and longer-term changes
in investment opportunities?
The chapter finds that while there has been
a general trend toward bank disintermediation and a greater role for financial markets in
many countries, the pace has differed and there
are still important differences across financial
systems. The results support the view that these
differences in financial structures do affect how
households and firms behave over the economic
cycle. In financial systems characterized by a
greater degree of arm’s length transactions,
households seem to be able to smooth consumption more effectively in the face of unanticipated changes in their income, although they
may be more sensitive to changes in asset prices.
In financial systems that rely less on arm’s
length transactions, firms appear to be better
able to smooth investment during business cycle
downturns, as they are better positioned to
access external financing based on their longterm relationships with financial intermediaries.
However, when faced with more fundamental
changes in the environment that require a reallocation of resources across sectors, financial

between two unaffiliated parties or between two related
parties acting as if they were unaffiliated parties with no
relationship with each other.

How Have Financial Systems Changed?

systems with a greater degree of arm’s length
transactions appear to be better placed to shift
resources to take advantage of new growth
opportunities. There is also evidence that crossborder portfolio investors appear to allocate a
greater proportion of their holdings in countries
where the arm’s length content of the financial
system is higher, which may contribute to the
financing of current account deficits.­

How Have Financial Systems Changed?
A first step in exploring the links between
financial systems and macroeconomic responses
is to characterize the key differences among
financial systems in the advanced economies.
While there are various ways of classifying financial systems, the approach taken in this chapter
focuses on the degree to which financial transactions are conducted on the basis of a direct (and
generally longer-term) relationship between two
entities, usually a bank and a customer, or are
conducted at arm’s length—where entities typically do not have any special knowledge about
each other that is not available publicly.­
A financial system featuring a high volume
of arm’s length transactions (hereafter referred
to as a “more arm’s length financial system”) is
highly dependent on publicly available information and on the enforcement of contracts
through formal and standard legal mechanisms
and procedures applicable to unrelated parties.
There is a strong role for price signals and open
competition among lenders. On the other hand,
in a more relationship-based system, transactions
between two parties—such as a bank and a corporate borrower—primarily rely on information
the lender has about the borrower that is not
available publicly. Mechanisms for enforcement
of contracts rely more heavily on the lender’s
direct influence on the borrower and/or the

lender’s monopolistic power in the market. In
practice, no system is purely relationship-based
or purely arm’s length, and even systems that
are more reliant on arm’s length transactions do
not preclude the use of relationships. Indeed,
recent years have seen the rise of certain types of
financial intermediation that do have relationship-based elements—such as venture capital and
private equity—within arm’s length structures.
Nevertheless, it is useful to assess where financial
systems are placed along a spectrum—with a
country’s position depending on the degree to
which arm’s length contracts dominate its financial transactions.­
For this purpose, a new Financial Index is
constructed to summarize the extent of the
arm’s length content of a financial system. The
index ranges between 0 and 1 for each country,
with a higher value representing a greater arm’s
length content in the financial system. The
overall Financial Index is derived from three
subindices (which are weighted equally in the
overall index) that seek to capture key elements
of a financial system:

3It

is important to recognize that the distinction
between more or less arm’s length–based financial systems is different from the more conventional distinction
drawn in the literature between bank-based and marketbased financial systems (see, for example, Levine, 2002).
The analysis in this chapter attempts to take into account,
for example, the higher or lower degree of arm’s length
content within national banking systems.
4While a summary indicator of course cannot capture
all the aspects in which financial systems differ across
countries, it provides a broad measure that is helpful
for analyzing the link between financial systems and
economic cycles.
5Each subindex was constructed as an average of three
(third-level) indicators capturing key aspects relevant to
arm’s length content, building on a range of underlying indicators. For each of these indicators, a country
is assigned a value equal to the ratio of the variable for
this country and the maximum value across all countries.
While an ideal index in the context of this chapter would
include only fundamental determinants of how a financial system influences economic agents’ decisions, data
limitations have led to the inclusion of a mix of indicators capturing both fundamentals (such as the degree of
investor protection) and outcomes (such as the existing
financial structure). See Appendix 4.1 for further details
on the index construction methodology and data sources.

• The degree of traditional bank intermediation,
which is the most obvious manifestation of a
high degree of relationship-based financial
transactions. This measure of the extent to
which deposit-taking institutions dominate
the process of intermediating savings takes
into account factors that may weaken the role
of relationships in lending decisions, most
notably the degree of competition between
banks and the availability of public financial
information.
• The degree to which new financial intermediation
has developed to provide an alternative nonbank channel for financing and/or to facilitate
the transformation of traditional relationships
between intermediaries and final customers.
New financial intermediation includes the
activities of a range of nondeposit taking institutions, such as pension and insurance companies; nontraditional activities undertaken by
banks, including the securitization of loans;
and the extent of financial innovation through
the use of new financial instruments, including
derivatives. The measures of financial innovation used in this subindex are intended to
gauge the transformation of aspects of traditional relationship-based lending not captured
elsewhere. For example, the market for credit
derivatives and collateralized debt obligations
(CDOs) may allow banks to develop lending
relationships less influenced by long-term
credit risk considerations. Similarly, the use
of interest rate swaps allows lenders to meet
the demand for specific loan structures by
6This

is because historically banks have been the main
intermediaries in a financial system, and have based
lending decisions on insider knowledge about their
clients. Traditional banking in this chapter also includes
the activities of other deposit-taking institutions, such as
credit unions and building societies.
7The role of relationships is likely to be weaker in a
system where banks pose greater competitive challenges
to each other and where inside information about borrowers is much more limited.
Securitization through CDOs allows credit risk to be
distributed in various tranches tailored to the different
risk tolerances of investors, with the sponsoring organizations (such as banks) able to remove the credit risk from
their own balance sheets.

Differences persist and have increased in the extent to which financial
intermediation is conducted through new financial intermediaries. The United States,

larger role of nonbank financial institutions, a greater diffusion of new financial
products, and a greater shift of banks away from traditional intermediation services.

their customers, while transferring interest rate

exposures.­
• The role played by financial markets, which
have a symbiotic relationship with nonbank
financial intermediation and the expansion of banks into nontraditional activities
described above (see, for example, Allen and
Santomero, 2001). Deep and liquid financial markets are essential, for example, for
the efficient functioning of a mutual fund
industry. The ease of market access, efficiency
of contract enforcement, and the degree
of investor protection are important determinants of how well financial markets can
perform their functions.­
One conclusion to emerge from the first of
these subindices is that the importance of traditional banking activities has declined in most
countries, with differences between countries
narrowing, and several countries moving closer
to the United States, the country where the role
of traditional banking is the smallest (Figure
4.2). Nevertheless, there are still large differences in the volume of funds intermediated by
banks across countries. For example, over the
last decade, the share of nonfinancial sector
assets and liabilities intermediated by banks has
declined an average of 5 percentage points in
the euro area countries, but at about 30 percent
in 2004 this share was still twice as high as in
the United States. These differences, however,
are partly offset by the fact that the degree of
competition and availability of information
is generally high in most countries where the
banking system still has a prominent role. This
suggests that there is a greater degree of arm’s
length content in banking activity in Europe
than suggested only by the higher volumes of
funds intermediated by banks.­
Differences across countries are more striking in the area of new financial intermediation
(Figure 4.3). Countries with a greater proportion of household savings allocated outside the

banking system include Australia, Canada, the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the
United States. In response to competitive pressures from the nonbank financial sector, banks
in these countries have also expanded more into
nontraditional fee-generating areas of intermediation such as loan securitization.10 In general,
they also appear to make greater use of financial
innovations such as asset-backed securities and
alternative investment vehicles such as venture
capital. While venture capital relies importantly
on relationships with firms (including managerial influence, informational advantages, and
a longer investment horizon), its rapid growth
over the past two decades has been facilitated
by the evolution in its financing structure and
by the associated increase in the importance of
institutional investors as suppliers of venture
capital financing (see Gompers and Lerner,
1998).11
Cross-country differences in the financial market development subindex are generally smaller
across countries than for the banking and new
financial intermediation indices (Figure 4.4).
This is in part due to the rapid convergence of
market infrastructure and securities regulation
across advanced economies. In particular, many
countries have either improved market access

10Clearly, differences in these indicators also reflect
heterogeneous regulatory and legislative environments.
For example, the large degree of nonbank financial
intermediation in countries like the Netherlands and the
United Kingdom reflects in part the relative importance
of private pension funds in these two countries. See
Allen and Gale (2000) for a study of the historical factors
underlying observed differences across financial systems.
11Venture capital (VC) is now predominantly set up as
a pooled fund with a VC firm as a general partner and
other investors—institutional investors, in particular—as
limited partners. As a result, the growth of institutional
investors has supported the expansion of venture capital
financing. The VC firm provides the management expertise and charges the other partners a management fee
(similar to other investment managers, such as mutual
and hedge funds). As a result, both the size and the arm’s
length content of venture capital have risen rapidly over
the past two decades. Reflecting in part these factors, venture capital financing as a percent of GDP in the United
States was three times as large as in European countries
during 1998–2004 (see OECD, 2006).

(as in France and Italy, where the share of nonfinancial corporate liabilities financed by markets through bonds and equities has increased
sharply over the last decade) or increased the
liquidity and depth of their stock and bond markets (as in Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain).­
The aggregate picture, as measured by the
overall Financial Index, suggests that despite an
increase in the arm’s length content of financial
systems across advanced economies, important
differences remain (Figure 4.5). Indeed, the
increase in the index has generally been larger
for those countries with relatively high values
already in 1995. Thus, there is little evidence of
convergence, a conclusion confirmed by more
formal statistical tests (see Appendix 4.1). The
differences across countries are mainly related
to persistent dissimilarities in the area of new
financial intermediation, the wider use of
financial innovation, and banks’ expansion into
nontraditional banking activities.­
This variation across countries in the Financial Index is indicative of important differences in the way financial systems perform
their intermediation function. In countries
with more arm’s length content, a larger share
of household and firm financing takes place
through capital markets. At the same time,
banks have moved away from traditional relationship-based lending, and their decisions are
guided less by the imperatives of their relationship with borrowers and more by their ability to
sell financial claims on to capital markets. Since
their credit exposures are lower—as fewer
loans now remain on balance sheets for the life
of the loan contract—banks can increasingly
choose from a larger pool of potential borrowers, and themselves have become one of a
greater number of potential lenders. Finally, in
systems with higher arm’s length content, investors who move away from holding traditional
bank deposits provide the necessary depth and
liquidity to capital markets and take on associated risks, either directly, or more commonly
through nonbank financial intermediaries such
as hedge funds, mutual funds, and investment
and pension companies.­

These differences in the way financial systems
function are well illustrated in the structure of
mortgage markets in different countries (Figure
4.6). Despite important differences between
mortgage markets, even among countries with
broadly similar financial systems, countries
with more arm’s length systems typically offer
a higher degree of leverage, longer repayment
horizons, and greater access to mortgage equity,
with the latter representing a vehicle for extracting liquidity from housing assets to finance
consumption. Additionally, certain economies
with more arm’s length systems (notably Denmark and the United States) provide better risk
sharing for households through greater use
of fixed-rate mortgages with long repayment
schedules and fee-free refinancing; refinancing is typically subject to early repayment fees
in countries where financial systems are less
arm’s length–based (see Green and Wachter,
2005). The ability of more arm’s length systems
to offer greater flexibility in housing finance
is underpinned by supporting institutions that
allow effective enforcement of collateral, and by
securitization of mortgage loans that helps pool
and diversify risks from individual borrowers.12
The extent of mortgage securitization varies
greatly across countries, with the United States
securitizing over 60 percent of new mortgages
with mortgage-backed securities, while France
and Germany securitize less than 5 percent of
new mortgages this way.13

12For

example, the usual time required for mortgage
enforcement procedures, from the writ of execution to
the distribution of the proceeds to creditors, is 60 to 84
months in Italy, 15 to 25 months in France, 8 months
in the United Kingdom and the United States, and 6
months in Denmark and the Netherlands. See Catte and
others (2004).
13A number of European countries, notably Denmark
and Germany, fund mortgage loans in the capital markets
using bonds (such as German Pfandbriefe) that allow
for better risk sharing than the traditional funding by
depository institutions. However, these bonds differ from
mortgage-backed securities as they remain on the balance
sheet of the issuer, therefore limiting the extent of risk
transfer by originating banks. In contrast, mortgagebacked securities can be traded away from the balance
sheets of mortgage originators.

Financial Systems and Households, Firms, and Cross-Border Capital Flows

How Do Differences in Financial Systems
Affect the Behavior of Households,
Firms, and Cross-Border Capital Flows?
This section presents evidence that suggests
that the substantial differences across financial
systems do affect the behavior of households
and firms over the economic cycle and influence financial flows across countries.14 It should
be emphasized at the outset, however, that
analyzing the links between financial systems
and macroeconomic behavior is a challenging
task, especially when trying to establish a causal
link from one to the other, and it is important
to keep in mind the possibility that third factors
may also play a role in affecting both financial
systems and economic outcomes.­

The Household Sector
The degree of arm’s length transactions in a
financial system may affect household behavior
through two channels:
• In a more arm’s length financial system,
households may be better able to smooth
consumption in the face of income shocks.
In such systems, investors can price collateral more effectively in a liquid market and
acquire financial claims on a diversified pool
of borrowers. This reduces the exposure of
investors to risks emanating from individual
households, such as the increased credit risk
from a loss of income or employment, and
makes available, on average, a larger amount
of financial resources to households.15
Indeed, as systems have moved toward more
arm’s length transactions, household borrowing has grown across advanced economies,

14The analysis in this section is based on the Financial
Index measured in 2004 because a larger amount of
information is available for that year. However, using 1995
values yields broadly similar conclusions.
15Evidence on the link between home equity withdrawal
and consumption in advanced economies is examined in
Catte and others (2004) and Klyuev and Mills (2006). For
a discussion of the growth of household credit in emerging markets, see Chapter II of the IMF’s Global Financial
Stability Report (September 2006).

with the increase more dramatic and the level
of household debt higher in countries with a
higher level of arm’s length content in their
financial systems (Figure 4.7).­
• The flip side is that in such systems households themselves may be more exposed to
asset price changes as they hold a greater proportion of market securities as assets on their
balance sheets. Further, since more effective
collateralization allows a greater degree of
leverage, a sufficiently large change in the
value of the collateral (such as a decline in
housing prices) may require households to
adjust their consumption sharply (see Box
4.1).­

The Sensitivity of Households to Changes
in Income
A large body of empirical evidence shows that
private consumption is sensitive to changes in
current income, contrary to the implications
of the permanent income hypothesis, which
proposes that consumption is determined by
permanent income, typically defined as average or expected income or the annuity value
of lifetime resources (see Deaton, 1992). This
finding of “excess sensitivity” of consumption to
current income has most often been attributed
to borrowing constraints faced by households,
implying that as borrowing constraints ease,
consumption can be expected to become less
sensitive to current income. Empirical studies
suggest that the excess sensitivity of consumption is relatively low in Canada and the United
States, somewhat higher in the United Kingdom,
and higher yet in France, Italy, and Spain.16
To investigate whether the degree of arm’s
length financing affects the ability of households
to cope with variations in income, two exercises
were conducted. Both suggest that a higher
degree of arm’s length financing can reduce the
16See Campbell and Mankiw (1991); and Jappelli and
Pagano (1989). Several studies, including Bacchetta
and Gerlach (1997) and Dynan, Elmendorf, and Sichel
(2006), have documented the decline in the excess sensitivity of consumption in the United States, attributing this
to financial deregulation.

impact of changes in current income on household behavior (see Appendix 4.2 for details):
• First, a simple panel regression was estimated
relating consumption growth to the growth
of disposable income and an interaction term
with the Financial Index (controlling also for
the impact of real short-term interest rates).
In general, countries with more arm’s length
systems tend to exhibit a lower correlation
between consumption and current income
growth, suggesting a greater degree of consumption smoothing. The marginal propensity
to consume out of current income is smaller
for countries with higher values of the Financial Index, as captured by the negative interaction term in the estimation.17 This result can
also be seen from the mapping between the
Financial Index and the correlation of consumption and current income growth (Figure
4.8).18 These findings are consistent with the
notion that consumers in these countries are
better able to smooth consumption in the face
of changes in their income.19
• Second, country-by-country estimations using
rolling regressions were analyzed to see if
residential investment is less sensitive to mortgage rates and income when financial systems
are more arm’s length. The results suggest
that these sensitivities have diminished over
time in the United States, but generally not
elsewhere.20 These findings may be explained

17When interpreting the results, the issue of simultaneous determination of consumption and income needs
to be kept in mind. The estimated marginal propensity
to consume captures the correlation between private
consumption and disposable income, and does not necessarily reflect causality.
18Appendix 4.2 reports the results of the formal empirical estimation.
19There may be a potential nonlinearity in the consumption response that is difficult to capture empirically.
Households that are highly leveraged at the time of a
downturn may be unwilling to increase their indebtedness further in order to smooth consumption.
20Recent studies for the United States have attributed
the observed decline in the sensitivity of residential investment to income and mortgage rates to the development
of mortgage markets. See, for example, Peek and Wilcox
(2006); and Dynan, Elmendorf, and Sichel (2006).

Financial Systems and Households, Firms, and Cross-Border Capital Flows

by the fact that the mortgage market in the
United States has attained a high degree of
sophistication and flexibility through the use
of securitization (see Green and Wachter,
2005, for a detailed discussion).­

Impact of Changes in Asset Prices on
Household Spending
While more arm’s length systems may be
conducive to consumption smoothing in the
face of income shocks, this section presents
evidence that they may also be more sensitive
to changes in asset prices—through so-called
“financial accelerator” effects—although both
equity and housing price busts appear to have
been shallower in such systems over the past two
decades (see Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist,
1996, for elaboration on the financial accelerator mechanism).­
In a more arm’s length financial system, the
increased dependence of credit on housing
values could exacerbate the impact of adverse
house price developments, creating a ripple
effect that depresses consumption. A severe
downturn in the housing market could cause
a drop in the value of the collateral, reducing
households’ ability to borrow, curbing their
spending, and exacerbating the initial downturn. This mechanism is more likely to be set in
motion in response to a substantial house price
decline if households’ ability to borrow is more
closely linked to real estate values. Regarding
financial assets, the higher proportion of marketable securities in a household’s portfolio, and
the lower share of bank deposits in a more arm’s
length system also could expose households
to greater wealth shocks from equity market
fluctuations.­
An event analysis was conducted to compare responses of private consumption and
residential investment to equity and housing
downturns in different financial systems. Equity
and housing busts were defined as episodes
in which the associated price declines were in
the top half of all such episodes in the sample,
corresponding to real price declines of at least
26 percent for equity downturns and at least 6

percent for housing declines (Figures 4.9 and
4.10).21
Looking at equity market downturns, differences in the response of private consumption
across countries in the upper and lower halves
of the Financial Index were analyzed over the
past two decades. The results of this event analysis suggest that countries with more arm’s length
financial systems do exhibit a larger median
response of private consumption to equity
market downturns, consistent with what would
be expected given that households are more
exposed to changes in stock market valuations.22
For housing downturns, the responses of
consumption and residential investment have
become stronger since 1985 (the period during
which mortgage markets have been liberalized
in many advanced economies). This finding is consistent with the proposition that the
increased role of housing as collateral has made
household spending more dependent on housing prices. Because of data limitations, the analysis of responses of households was restricted to
more arm’s length systems.23
While these results suggest that asset price
declines can have a larger impact on household
behavior in more arm’s length systems, there is
also evidence suggesting that asset price busts
have been shallower in such systems, consistent
with more continuous adjustments of asset valuations (Figure 4.11). Evidence from the United
States, for example, suggests that the volatility
of real housing activity and errors in the pricing of housing have been reduced through the
expansion of the mortgage finance market (see
Schnure, 2005). Empirical analysis of equity
markets also suggests that more arm’s length
systems incorporate firm-specific information
21See Chapter II of the April 2003 World Economic Outlook and Appendix 4.2 for a more detailed explanation of
the event analysis.
22This is in line with Ludwig and Sløk (2002), who
found that the wealth effect on consumption from stock
prices is larger in market-based systems than in bankbased systems.
23Complete data on house prices were available only
for a limited number of countries in the upper half of the

more efficiently, indicating that stock prices
adjust to underlying fundamentals more quickly
and prevent systematic mispricing.­

The Corporate Sector
Does a financial system with a greater degree
of arm’s length transactions dampen or amplify
investment volatility during business cycles? And
how does such a system perform in the face of
longer-term changes in growth opportunities?
During normal business cycle downturns,
financial systems with a lower degree of arm’s
length transactions (and a higher degree of
relationship-based lending) could be expected
to give greater weight to the longer-term gains
from maintaining an existing relationship with
a borrower by providing short-term assurance
that financing will be available in the event of a
temporary disruption in cash flow, particularly
as the lender’s own balance sheet is on average more exposed to the borrower. Providing
financing to ride out such temporary downturns
may then not only be in the interest of the borrower, but also of the lender.24 A more arm’s
length financial system, on the other hand, may
help smooth firm financing by diversifying the
sources of financing—making them less vulnerable to credit crunches.­
Empirical evidence supports the view that
countries with a higher degree of relationship-based lending may experience shallower
contraction in nonresidential business fixed
investment during cyclical downturns (Figure
4.12, upper panel).25 Evidence from the investment cycle in the aftermath of the bursting of
the equity bubble in 2000 is also consistent with
this view (Figure 4.12, middle and lower panels).
In the United States, firms reduced investment

quality on a bank’s balance sheet.

sharply and relied to a greater degree on internal financing compared with their European
counterparts.26
From a longer-term perspective, an important question is whether a more arm’s length
financial system is better equipped to reallocate resources relatively quickly in response to
developments that necessitate investment in
new areas and by new firms, as such systems are
relatively unfettered by the constraints imposed
by longer-term relationships with a borrower.
One approach to this question is to examine the
differences in the growth of industrial subsectors in response to global growth opportunities.
A more arm’s length system could be expected
to take greater advantage of growth opportunities that lie away from the basic specialization of
existing industry in a country. A more relationship-based system may conversely be expected
to be more successful at taking advantage of
organic growth opportunities—those within the
area of expertise of existing industry, and thus
likely requiring minor modifications of prevailing technologies (Rajan and Zingales, 2003).­
To examine the difference in corporate sector
responses to growth opportunities, this section
looks at two separate measures:
• The correlation between real output growth
in an industry within a country and world
output growth of the same industry.27 This
gives a measure of the ability of an economy
to grasp investment opportunities that emerge
globally (and thus to achieve allocative efficiency).28 A high correlation would indicate
26One

important caveat regarding the smoother
response of European corporates during the most
recent cycle is that, while relying less than their U.S.
counterparts on internal financing, they have been able
to tap into the rapidly growing corporate bond market.
It remains to be seen, however, whether corporates in
Europe will be more successful than in other countries
in accessing bond financing during a downturn once the
market has matured (ECB, 2001).
27 World output growth for an industry is calculated
based on data for the sample of 181 countries covered by
the United Nations Industrial Development database (see
Appendix 4.2).
28A detailed description of the methodology and data
used in the analysis is contained in Appendix 4.2.

Financial Systems and Households, Firms, and Cross-Border Capital Flows

that this country is better able to take advantage of global growth opportunities. To the
extent that more arm’s length systems are in
general more flexible in financing innovations
that require a substantial change in production technology, this correlation should be
positively linked to a country’s score on the
Financial Index.­
• The ability of a country to take advantage of
global growth opportunities in an industry
can generally be expected to be higher if that
country already has a high degree of specialization in that industry. One measure of the
distance between a country’s initial specialization and the one that would maximize growth
based on global growth opportunities is the
correlation between the contribution of an
industry to world growth and the share of
that industry in a country’s value added at
the outset of the period under consideration,
with a higher correlation indicating a smaller
distance. At the same time, a greater degree
of arms’ length financing should be able to
mitigate the disadvantages of being initially
specialized in other industries—that is, at a
greater distance from the optimal industry
mix. Hence, one could expect that the higher
the score in the Financial Index, the lower
the impediment to growth coming from the
distance between the initial industry mix of a
country and the mix that would maximize its
growth potential.­
A formal econometric analysis testing the
above propositions for the manufacturing sector
supports the view that more arm’s length systems allowed domestic industry to adapt better
to a changing global environment.29
• During 1980–2001, countries that scored
higher on the Financial Index were also those
that were better able to seize growth opportunities available worldwide.­
• Those countries that in 1980 had already specialized in the (globally) fast-growing sectors

are robust to the exclusion of the United States from the
sample.

CHAPTER 4   How Do Financial Systems Affect Economic Cycles?

Box 4.1. Financial Leverage and Debt Deflation
Despite their increasing sophistication, modern financial systems still operate under informational and institutional constraints, such as
the limited enforceability of credit contracts
and imperfect information on the creditworthiness of borrowers. “Financial frictions,” such as
constraints on borrowing against collateral and
margin calls when the value of collateral falls,
have provided mechanisms to protect financial
systems from excessive credit risks related to
such constraints. As discussed in the chapter,
however, in more arm’s length financial systems new risk and information-sharing mechanisms have been used to extend the effective
use of collateralization, thus allowing borrowers to acquire higher levels of debt relative to
their assets or income, which are reflected in
higher leverage ratios (see Figure 4.8 in the
main text).­
Under what circumstances does the move to
more arm’s length financial systems, by permitting higher leverage ratios, generate increased
systemic risks or raise macroeconomic vulnerabilities to asset price collapses? This box
examines how asset price declines can damage
the real economy and cause financial distress
in financial systems characterized by different
levels of leverage and collateralization.­
One explanation for the intensity of financial
crises is that asset price declines interact with
increasing restrictions on access to credit to
generate a downward spiral driven by financial
frictions. Thus, a relatively “small” negative shock
hitting a highly leveraged economy induces
a decline in asset and/or goods prices, which
causes financial institutions to cut back on credit
creation as collateral constraints and other forms
of credit limits become increasingly binding.
As a result, borrowers are forced to engage in
fire sales of assets and goods, inducing further
declines in prices, which tighten borrowing
constraints further (effectively increasing the real
values of debts as borrowers rush to pay them).
Irving Fisher labeled this process the “debt-defla-

120

tion” mechanism in his classic analysis of the
Great Depression (Fisher, 1933). As will become
clear below, this mechanism provides a vehicle
for the degree of financial leverage to amplify
the effects of shocks on the real economy.­
The likelihood that countries may run into
collateral constraints and suffer debt-deflation
crises is difficult to gauge because leverage ratios
and effective limits on leverage vary widely across
countries, across industries within countries,
and over time. Recent episodes in which this
phenomenon, however, played a role include the
Asian Crisis of 1997–98 and the bursting of the
bubble in technology stocks of the late 1990s.­
To analyze the impact of asset prices on an
economy through financial leverage, it is useful
first to establish a benchmark case using the
familiar example of a small open economy with
perfect credit markets. This economy can be
viewed as a country that is a small player in
world capital markets, or as a region or industry
within a country that takes domestic interest
rates as given. In this small open economy with
perfect credit markets, real shocks (e.g., to total
factor productivity, the terms of trade, or government expenditures) have no impact on the
economy as long as they are wealth-neutral—
that is, if they induce a reduction in income
at some initial date followed by an exactly
offsetting increase in future income so that the
present value of income is unchanged. Output,
investment, the price of capital (Tobin’s q) and
consumption would be unchanged, as there is

More recent studies that develop similar mechanisms include Kiyotaki and Moore (1997); Aiyagari
and Gertler (1999); Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist
(1999); Mendoza (2005); and Mendoza and Smith
(forthcoming).
As is common in models of the financial accelerator, Fisher’s debt-deflation theory works through
balance sheet effects. The debt-deflation framework
differs in that the spiral of collapsing asset prices and
increasingly tight credit access amplifies the impact
of balance sheet effects. Mendoza (2005) provides an
example showing that the additional amplification due
to the debt-deflation process dwarfs standard balance
sheet effects.

Financial Systems and Households, Firms, and Cross-Border Capital Flows

no credit constraint to prevent households and
firms from borrowing as needed to implement
their pre-shock consumption and investment
plans.
The results are strikingly different when
credit market imperfections are introduced.
Suppose that agents are allowed to borrow only
up to a fraction of the value of their assets. This
can be the case because, for example, legal
institutions or monitoring costs allow lenders to
recover only a fraction of a borrower’s assets in
case of default, or because borrowers are only
able to “securitize” a fraction of their assets as
collateral. What happens if this economy is hit
by the same wealth-neutral shock? As long as the
collateral constraint does not bind, the results
do not change: consumption, output, investment, and Tobin’s q are unchanged because
economic agents can borrow to smooth the
temporary shock to income. For a “sufficiently
large” shock, however, the collateral constraint
becomes binding, and when this happens the
debt-deflation mechanism is set in motion,
triggering declines in consumption, investment,
and output. Moreover, the real effects are persistent because the initial decline in investment
lowers the economy’s future productive capacity.­
To explore the potential quantitative significance of this debt-deflation mechanism, an example was constructed using plausible parameter
values that yields a predicted initial leverage ratio
for the economy of 11 percent (see Mendoza,
2005). Now, suppose there is a wealth-neutral
2Tobin’s q is defined as the ratio of the market value
of a firm’s assets to the replacement cost of these
assets.
3The real interest rate is set at 6 percent, the capital
share in GDP is 34 percent, the intertemporal elasticity
of substitution in consumption is 0.5, and the coefficient of capital adjustment costs is set at 1. The initial
stock of debt is 60 percent of GDP and the initial stock
of physical capital is 50 percent of its long-run value.
The leverage limits in the model pertain to the
aggregate of all net liabilities of households and
corporates as a share of the market value of all the
capital stock (equipment and structures, including
housing and business buildings). Actual measures of
these ratios vary widely across industrial countries.

shock that initially reduces income by 2 percent
of GDP (similar to the standard deviation of real
GDP over the business cycle in many industrial
countries). Agents in the economy would want
to borrow because of the negative shock (to
smooth consumption) and because the capital
stock is low relative to its long-run level. If credit
markets were perfect, the leverage ratio would
rise to almost 15 percent in this example. Hence,
the economy requires sufficiently high access
to leverage (of at least 15 percent of the value
of assets) for consumption and investment to
remain unaffected by the shock. However, if the
degree of financial development is such that it
supports leverage ratios at least as large as 11 percent, but not larger than 15 percent, the shock
would trigger the debt-deflation mechanism. This
does not imply, however, that arm’s length financial systems necessarily make countries more
vulnerable to a debt-deflation crisis just because
they allow leverage to increase. Indeed, since the
potential for leverage (i.e., the leverage limit)
increases when these systems develop and work
efficiently to provide better risk and information
sharing, a higher degree of financial development that increases the scope for borrowing in
response to a shock reduces the effects of a debtdeflation crisis for a real shock of a given size.­
The table shows the real effects of the
debt-deflation mechanism in response to the
2 percent of GDP wealth-neutral shock for a
range of values of the limit on leverage from 11
to 15 percent. Within this range, the effects are
stronger the lower the limit on leverage.­
The effects decline to zero when the leverage
ratio can rise as high as 15 percent because at
that point the ability to leverage is sufficient so
that the wealth-neutral shock does not trigger
the collateral constraint. At the other extreme,
when the limit on leverage is set at 11 percent,
the shock would have a maximum effect on the
For example, the ratio of mortgage liabilities (a proxy
for collateralized debt) to nonfinancial wealth of the
household sector ranges from about 10 percent in
Japan to about 30 percent in the United States (see
Mendoza, Quadrini, and Rios-Rull, 2006).

of the large decline in imports that accompanies
the contraction of domestic demand induced
by the loss of access to credit, which can be as
large as 18 percentage points of GDP.

4Chapter II of the April 2003 and Chapter IV of the
April 2004 issues of the World Economic Outlook provide
empirical evidence on the sharp swings in leverage of

emerging markets crises.

during 1980–2001 were better able to take
advantage of worldwide growth opportunities.­
• However, the strength of this relationship
between existing specialization and subsequent fast growth is weakened by a high score
in the Financial Index—that is, the greater
the degree of arm’s length financing, the
lower the impediment to growth from the
“wrong” initial industry specialization.­
These results provide support to the view that
more arm’s length systems are better equipped
to deal with the reallocation process required
at times of significant innovation and change in
the industrial structure of the global economy.
In other words, they may be better at reallocating resources from declining to growing

122

The above results suggest that for a shock
of a given magnitude, countries that are close
to their financial leverage limits are the most
vulnerable. Hence, economies with higher
potential for leverage can be more resilient
to small shocks than economies with relatively
lower credit access, but they remain vulnerable
if a sufficiently large shock triggers the debtdeflation mechanism. In contrast, the lower use
of collateral as a basis for lending may make
relationship-based financial systems less vulnerable to large swings in asset prices and to the
related risk of a debt-deflation spiral, but at the
same time they leave unexploited the benefits
that can result from financial development.­

at helping smooth temporary business cycle
downturns.­

Financial Systems and Cross-Border Flows
With the rising importance of cross-border financial flows, an issue that has recently
received considerable attention is how differences in financial systems may affect a country’s

flexibility in industry also need to be complemented by
other factors—such as flexible labor markets—in order to
successfully allow industries to restructure.

ability to attract portfolio inflows, and hence
finance its current account deficit. For example,
Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2006) argue
that it is the ability of a country to generate
financial assets from real investments that is
important, while Chinn and Ito (2005) find that
overall financial development seems to matter,
but only in advanced economies. Differences
in the degree of arm’s length transactions may
also be important in influencing cross-border
flows. Foreign investors typically do not have
existing relationships with potential borrowers in a country, making a more arm’s length
system particularly well suited for intermediating
foreign inflows. Moreover, a more arm’s length
system may typically offer a broader array of
financial instruments for savers to meet investment and risk management goals, as well as
greater liquidity and transparency. These factors
can increase the pool of savings to which domestic households and firms have access, potentially supporting a higher level of consumption
and investment. This suggests that aggregate
domestic demand can on average be higher in
countries that have higher scores in the Financial Index, supporting larger current account
deficits in the short run.31
In the United States, for example, the high
degree of securitization of mortgages has played
an important role in attracting foreign investors. More than 10 percent of the $8 trillion
in outstanding U.S. residential mortgages is
now estimated to be financed by foreign investors through their investment in mortgagerelated securities (see Knight, 2006; and IMF,
2006a). Financial systems in the United States
and the United Kingdom, in particular, also
provide investors with a diverse pool of liquid
instruments that can be tailored—by a highly
developed financial services industry—to the
risk-return preferences of individual investors,
increasing their attractiveness to foreign investors (see IMF, 2006b). Of course, other welldocumented factors—including expected
31See the April 2005 World Economic Outlook for more on
the links between globalization and external imbalances.

returns on investment, currency, and tax and
regulatory frameworks—remain important additional driving forces in explaining the global
pattern of cross-border flows.­
More systematic empirical evidence on the
relationship between the extent of arm’s length
financial transactions and cross-border flows
across the broader group of advanced economies is, however, mixed. There is some evidence
of a positive correlation between the extent of
arm’s length transactions and portfolio inflows,
with the United States and the United Kingdom
scoring high on both dimensions, when portfolio inflows are measured as a proportion of
that country’s exports and imports (Figure 4.13,
upper panel). The correlation is less evident
when portfolio inflows or the level of foreign
holdings are measured as a proportion of total
outstanding portfolio securities, with the proportion of domestic securities held by foreigners in
the euro area relatively high despite the area’s
generally less arm’s length financial systems (Figure 4.13, lower panel). However, this high share
may reflect the influence of a common currency
as well as harmonization of regulations. Taken
as a whole, the euro area has a lower share of
foreign-held securities than the United States or
the United Kingdom.­
In an effort to identify more clearly the
relationship between the arm’s length content
of financial systems and private cross-border
portfolio holdings, a gravity model was estimated
using data from the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio
Investment Survey (CPIS). This exercise took
into account the impact of country size and
geographic proximity (as in standard gravity
models) and also the effect of a common currency among euro area economies. The results,
reported in Appendix 4.2, suggest that bilateral
portfolio holdings are positively associated with
the extent of arm’s length financing in the
destination countries.32 Overall, foreign inves-

that cross-border holdings of portfolio securities are positively related to the Financial Index scores of both the
source and destination countries.

tors seem to hold a greater amount of portfolio
securities in countries with a higher degree of
arm’s length transactions. The degree of arm’s
length transactions in the destination country,
however, appears to matter less for cross-border
investments within continental Europe.­

Conclusions
Financial systems in advanced economies
have changed significantly in recent years
as technology has improved and financial
deregulation has proceeded apace. Nevertheless, this chapter suggests that significant differences persist across countries in how funds
are intermediated across household and firm
balance sheets. The variations reflect underlying differences in the degree to which financial transactions are conducted at arm’s length
and the importance of longer-term relationships between borrowers and lenders. The
financial systems of Australia, the Netherlands,
the United States, and the United Kingdom
are increasingly characterized by a relatively
high degree of arm’s length transactions;
those in France, Germany, Italy, and Japan
have moved in the same direction, but remain
relatively more reliant on borrower/lender
relationships.­
The empirical results in this chapter suggest that these differences in financial system
structure may affect household and corporate
behavior over economic cycles. More arm’s
length and more relationship-based systems
each seem to have particular strengths and
weaknesses depending on the specific challenges facing the economy. For example, under
a more arm’s length system, households are
able to access a larger amount of financing and
seem better able to smooth consumption in
the face of temporary changes in their income.
This may have contributed to the reduction
in consumption volatility over the business
cycle. In more arm’s length systems, however,
households appear to be more vulnerable to
swings in asset prices, implying larger effects
on demand from major asset price booms and

Conclusions

busts. This effect, however, may be countered
to some degree by the fact that the amplitude
of swings in asset prices may be lower in more
arm’s length systems.­
Turning to the corporate sector, cyclical
changes in investment seem to be shallower
in more relationship-based systems, perhaps
because such systems provide greater cash
flow support to firms in the face of temporary
changes in demand. Thus, the more closely
aligned incentives of firms and lenders under
these systems may allow for greater smoothing
during economic downturns and less pressure
for drastic balance sheet restructuring. However,
when resources need to be reallocated away
from declining to relatively new sectors and
firms—such as those arising from the emergence of new technology—more arm’s length
systems seem better able to capitalize on these
opportunities, with benefits for productivity
growth and profitability.­
The degree of arm’s length content of financial systems also appears to be a factor affecting
the portfolio allocation decisions of international investors. In addition to well-known
factors such as the size of financial markets,
international portfolio investors appear to place
more assets in the financial systems of advanced
economies with a higher degree of arm’s length
content. Among the advanced economies,
investors in countries with more arm’s length
financial systems also seem to invest more in the
portfolio securities of other countries.­
The results in this chapter support the view
that financial system structure does affect economic behavior and cyclical patterns. It is worth
reiterating, however, that this is a new area of
research, and the results are suggestive rather
than definitive. This is in part due to the limited
time span for observing cyclical behavior in
economies with a high degree of arm’s length
financial transactions, and the need to characterize highly complicated financial systems using
a single index. Further research in this area
could, for example, look at how subcomponents
of the Financial Index interact with cyclical
behavior.­

Looking forward, the move toward more
arm’s length financial systems is likely to
continue as deregulation fosters greater competition in financial markets, globalization
of financial markets and services continues,
information and communications technology
advances, and corporate governance, accounting, and legal standards are enhanced. In such
an environment, competition across financial institutions can be expected to continue
increasing the role of arm’s length transactions intermediated through markets and
reducing—but certainly not eliminating—the
scope for profitable long-term financial relationships based on informational advantages.
The move toward private pension plans is also
likely to further boost the arm’s length content of many financial systems by increasing
the role of nonbank financial intermediaries
and adding depth and liquidity to financial
markets. There will still, however, be niches in
financial systems for relationship-based transactions—such as private equity partnerships—
that seek to exploit specialized knowledge
of sectors and technologies. More generally,
the move toward more arm’s length systems
facilitates the transformation of the nature of
relationships themselves.­
The key question for policymakers is how to
maximize the benefits of this continuing move
toward financial systems that are more reliant
on arm’s length transactions, while minimizing
the downside risks. Financial and regulatory
policies have to adapt to changing financial
systems in order to maintain stability. The
greater speed and flexibility with which transactions can be executed and the higher degree
of leverage in the household sector in more
arm’s length systems could become sources
of financial instability with macroeconomic
consequences, if not adequately monitored (see
Geithner, 2006). Supervisors and regulators
will therefore need to continually assess and
upgrade their policy tools to match financial
systems’ increased sophistication. The effect of
interest rate changes on asset prices will also
likely become an increasingly relevant channel

125

CHAPTER 4   How Do Financial Systems Affect Economic Cycles?

of monetary policy transmission through the
impact on consumption and residential investment. In this environment, wealth effects could
be larger than expected on the basis of historical data, and monetary policymakers will need
to remain flexible, adapting their assessments
of developments to reflect possible changes
in the impact of asset prices on economic
behavior.­
Greater demands will also be placed on firms
to restructure their operations in the face of
business cycle downturns as the temporary insurance provided by relationship-based lenders
diminishes. Complementary reforms would help
to ensure that firms are able to smoothly adjust
all aspects of their operations to business cycle
downturns and to facilitate the reorientation
toward newer growth opportunities. Labor markets, the portability of employee pension plans,
and bankruptcy laws are three key areas where
reforms can support the corporate sector’s ability to respond to the changing environment.
Finally, strong, but well defined, social safety
nets would ensure adequate support for individuals and help in retraining for new employment
opportunities.­

CHAPTER 4   How Do Financial Systems Affect Economic Cycles?

Traditional Banking Intermediation Index
This index is constructed as the simple average
of three subindices (shown in Figure 4.15).33
The first subindex captures the traditional role
of banks in taking deposits and making loans to
firms and consumers. The other two capture the
degree of competition in the banking sector and
the extent to which financial information is publicly available in the economy. While the latter
two variables may be grouped under more than
one index (for example, as part of the new financial intermediation index, and/or of the financial
market index), this grouping reflects the view
that two key factors characterizing the traditional
(relationship-based) banking mode of financing
are the presence of some form of market power
by banks over the borrowers they finance (which
is lower in a more competitive banking system)
and the relative scarcity of publicly available
financial information on these borrowers. Hence,
despite the large volume of funds intermediated by banks, a country would score lower on
this index if there was considerable competition
among banks—making a long-term borrower/
lender relationship less likely—or there was widespread availability of information on borrowers’
capacity to repay loans and service debt (which
means the bank does not benefit from private
information gleaned from its relationship with a
borrower). Each of the three subindices is in turn
obtained as the simple average of a number of
variables, which are described below.34
33In

principle, other aggregation methodologies could
have been used, such as principal components. Djankov
and others (2005), however, show that using principal
components is likely to lead to similar conclusions as
those obtained using simple averages. The methodology
used in the chapter has the advantage of simplicity and
transparency, and avoids imposing implicit weights on the
different components of the indexes.
34Each country was given a score equal to the ratio of
the variable for that country to its maximum value across
the 18 countries. This means that all indices considered
in this chapter are between 0 and 1. An alternative methodology was also utilized, based on a quadratic distance
approach that gives a zero value to the country with the
minimum value, and gave very similar results. It should
also be noted that, in constructing the overall index, the
traditional banking index was included with a “negative”

128

Volume of Funds Intermediated by the
Banking Sector
• Nonfinancial sector assets with banks (percent of
total nonfinancial sector assets)—a measure of
the role of banks in attracting savings. Clearly,
deposits on the asset side of the balance
sheet of the nonfinancial sector (household,
nonfinancial corporates, government, and
rest of the world) correspond to a liability
of the banking sector, and are included in
this variable. For other instruments (such as
“securities other than shares” and “shares and
other equity”), it is difficult to identify the
sector that has issued the claim, as national
accounts do not break down financial assets
by the sector of the issuer (e.g., it is impossible to know what fraction of bonds held by
households has been issued by firms or the
public sector). Hence, financial claims (such
as bonds) are “allocated” to the various sectors according to the sector’s shares of the
total liabilities (bonds) outstanding in that
particular year. The share of nonfinancial sector assets with banks is thus estimated as the
product between the assets of the nonfinancial sector and the banks’ share of total liabilities (for a similar methodology see Schmidt,
Hackethal, and Tyrell, 1999; and Samolyk,
2004). The banking sector includes monetary
financial institutions as defined by the System
of National Accounts (SNA) 93 (it comprises
central banks, commercial banks, “universal”
banks, savings banks, post banks, and credit
unions).35 Source: IMF staff estimates using
data from Eurostat and national statistical
offices.­
• Nonfinancial sector liabilities vis-à-vis banks (percent of nonfinancial sector liabilities)—a measure
of the role of banks in lending to consumers,
firms, and the public sector. As for assets,
sign—that is, the lower the traditional banking content of
the system (the lower the score on this index) the higher
the score on the overall financial index.
35For Japan, the Trust Fund Bureau (a public, nondepository, financial institution) was included in the
banking sector, given the strong linkages between this
institution and postal savings.

Appendix 4.1. Building the Financial Index

several instruments on the liability side of the
nonfinancial sector balance sheet cannot be
allocated to a particular sector (it is impossible to know the extent to which bond financing for firms has been provided by banks or
nonbank financial institutions). The rule for
assets is also applied to liabilities, namely, they
are allocated to each sector based on that
sector’s share of total assets outstanding in
that particular year. Hence, nonfinancial sector liabilities vis-à-vis banks are estimated from
national financial accounts as the product of
the liabilities of the nonfinancial sector and
the banks’ share of total assets. Source: IMF
staff estimates using data from Eurostat and
national statistical offices.­

Competition in the Banking Sector
• Interest spread. The difference between the
bank lending rate and the money market rate.
The interest spread is a measure of the degree
of market power of banks. Source: International Financial Statistics (IMF).­
• Share of bank assets owned by the three largest
banks—a measure of concentration in the
banking sector. Source: Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt,
and Levine (1999; A New Database on Financial Development and Structure).­
• Percent of bank assets that are foreign owned. A
larger presence of foreign banks is likely to
signal a more open and competitive banking sector. Source: Barth, Caprio, and Nolle
(2004).
• Average number of firms’ relationships with banks.
If firms in a country maintain relationships
with several banks, this is taken to indicate
a more competitive banking system. Source:
Ongena and Smith (2000).­

Disclosure of Financial Information
• Credit Information Index. The index ranges
from 0 to 6, with higher values indicating that
more credit information is available from
either a public registry or a private bureau
to facilitate lending decisions. Source: Doing
Business database (World Bank).­

• Public credit registry coverage (percent of adults).
The number of individuals and firms listed in
the public credit registry with current information on repayment history, unpaid debts,
or credit outstanding. Source: Doing Business

The coverage indicator reports the number of
individuals or firms listed by the private credit
bureau with current information on repayment history, unpaid debts or credit outstanding. Source: Doing Business database (World
Bank).
• Number of reported items in firms’ statements. The
number of selected items that are reported in
the annual balance sheet, income, and cashflow statements for the top 20 companies in
terms of market capitalization for each country. It is a measure of the amount of information communicated by firms to the general
public. Source: De Nicoló, Laeven, and Ueda
(2006).­
• Stock price synchronicity. The fraction of stocks
that move in the same direction in a country (as in Morck, Yeung, and Yu, 2000). It
measures the ability of a national stock market
to communicate firm-specific information to
investors (the larger this fraction, the lower
the firm-level information contained in the
stock market). Source: De Nicoló, Laeven,

New Financial Intermediation Index
This index measures the extent to which
financial intermediation is conducted at arm’s
length in financial systems—by banks as well as
other financial intermediaries. It is constructed
as the simple average of three subindices (shown
in Figure 4.15), which capture (1) the evolution
of banks into new area of financial intermediation (by moving to fee-generating activities and
establishing financial links with other financial
institutions); (2) the relevance of nonbank
financial intermediaries; and (3) the extent to
which a country has embraced financial innovation by developing new types of financial

Financial Markets Index
This index captures key factors determining
the efficiency and depth of financial markets.
It is constructed as the simple average of three
subindices capturing (1) the existence of wellfunctioning mechanisms to enforce contracts
and thus reduce the frictions that may impede
the development of arms’ length relations; (2)
the ability of firms to access markets to finance
their activities; and (3) the liquidity and depth
of stock and bond markets. Each of these
subindices is in turn obtained as the average
of a number of variables, which are described
below.

Clustering Analysis
Evidence on whether the financial systems of
advanced economies have converged over the last
decade can be gauged through a clustering exercise, which statistically groups countries based
on similarities in their financial indicators. The
objective of the cluster analysis is to group countries together based on their “distance” from each
other in terms of their scores on all financial indicators in 1995 and 2004. Agglomerative hierarchical methods have been used, based on a series
of successive mergers of the clusters of countries
(see Johnson and Wichern, 2002). Starting with
each country as a separate entity, successive
iterations added the closest country to a cluster
until finally all countries are grouped as a single
cluster. When large differences persist between
countries, a greater number of iterations are
required to join a cluster. Based on this exercise,
European countries tend to be grouped together
in both years (Figure 4.16), even if some of them
(France, Italy, and Spain) have increasingly differentiated themselves as they moved away from a
relationship-based system in 2004 (when they are
grouped to other European countries at a later
stage of the clustering algorithm). In both 1995
and 2004, the United States was the last country
to join the cluster, suggesting its financial system
remains quite different from that of all the other
advanced economies.­

This appendix describes more fully the empirical evidence presented in the chapter, and in
particular the econometric methodology and
data used in linking the Financial Index to household consumption, residential investment, the
response of national economies to global growth
opportunities, and foreign portfolio inflows.­

Appendix 4.2. Econometric Methodology

Household Sector and the Financial Index
To study how the extent of arm’s length
finance affects the marginal propensity to
consume out of current income, the following
model was estimated using annual data for 18
countries over 1996–2004:
Dcit = ai + bDyit + g[Dyit × FIi] + drit + ht + eit ,
where i indexes countries, t indexes years, c
stands for (log) consumption, y stands for (log)
income, r denotes the real interest rate, and FI
is the Financial Index (α and η are country and
year fixed effects, respectively). Private consumption and disposable income were measured in
real per capita terms. All the data are from the
OECD.­
This formulation is grounded in the literature
on the “excess sensitivity” of consumption (see
Campbell and Mankiw, 1991), but is implemented in a panel setup. To maintain comparability across countries, total consumption
expenditure was used, which includes durables,
in addition to nondurables and services. The
model was estimated without using instrumental variables, hence the coefficients should be
interpreted as correlations only. The negative
coefficient on the interaction term suggests that
the marginal propensity to consume out of current income is smaller for countries with more
arm’s length financial systems (Table 4.1).­
To study how the move toward more arm’s
length finance affects the behavior of residential
investment, a model in which the first difference
of residential investment depends on current
and lagged first differences in residential investment, disposable income, mortgage rate, and
inflation rate was estimated using quarterly data
(three lags of each variable were included). Residential investment and disposable income were
measured in logs in real per capita terms. The
model was estimated using 40-quarter rolling
regressions.36 The results for the United States
suggest that the sensitivities of residential invest-

by Dynan, Elmendorf, and Sichel (2006).

ment to income and to mortgage rates have
declined over the past two decades.37 Analogous
estimations for other countries did not indicate
robust declines in these sensitivities. While some
evidence of declining sensitivities was detected
in Australia, it was not sufficiently clear. It is
worth noting that in several European countries
the estimations were complicated by short data
series on mortgage rates.­

Event Analyses Around Equity and Housing Busts
For this analysis, equity and housing price
cycles were identified using the methodologies
for the identification of business cycle turning
points described in April 2003 World Economic
Outlook. Busts were defined as those episodes
where peak-trough asset price declines were
large enough to fall into the top half of all
declines in the sample, which included 19
countries since 1959 for equity busts and 14
countries since 1970 for housing busts. This
methodology yielded 49 equity busts since 1985
and 34 housing busts throughout the period.38
Responses of macroeconomic variables to asset
price busts (as defined above) were assessed
using median four-quarter growth rates across

37The rates on conventional 30-year mortgages were
taken from the Federal Reserve Board.
38Due to insufficient data, housing busts could not
be identified in Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy,
Japan, and Portugal. Equity busts could not be identified

several subsamples. Countries were assigned to
one of two groups based on whether they were
in the top or bottom half of the sample ranked
by Financial Index scores. For equity busts, the
analysis focused on the recent period of financial liberalization beginning in 1985. During this
period, 26 equity busts occurred in countries in
the top half of the sample while 23 occurred in
the other group. For housing busts, the analyses focused on countries in the top half of the
Financial Index, due to data limitations. The
analysis separated the pre-1985 period (prior
to widespread financial liberalization) from the
subsequent period. Among the countries in the
top half of the Financial Index, 18 housing busts
occurred prior to 1985 and 12 have occurred
since then.­

Resource Allocation and the Financial Index
The sectoral data used were from the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO) database. Based on the three-digit
ISIC standards, the database provides data on 29
industries in the manufacturing sector for 181
countries.­
The econometric methodology consisted of
estimating the following specification:
r1,i,t = aFIi + br2,i,t + g(r2,i,t × FIi),
where:
• r1,i,t is the correlation—at time t and for country i—between real output growth of industry
j (j = 1...29) in country i and the world output
growth of industry j. It is meant to capture the
ability of an economy to grasp growth opportunities available worldwide.
• FIi is the Financial Index for country i (at year
2004). A positive value of the coefficient a
would suggest that countries with more arm’s
length financial systems are better able to
grasp worldwide growth opportunities (as they
tend to have higher correlations r1,i,t)
• r2,i,t is the correlation—at time t and for
country i—between the contribution of industry j (j = 1...29) to world real output growth
and the share of industry j in country i total

Appendix 4.2. Econometric Methodology

output in the first year of the sample. It is
meant to capture the initial distance between
the industry specialization of country i and
the industry specialization that, over the years,
would maximize the country’s growth rate (a
higher value of r2,i,t indicates that the country
specializes in the fast-growing sectors). One
would expect the coefficient of r2,i,t(b) to be
positive if countries that specialize initially in
the fast-growing sectors are better positioned
to benefit from world growth opportunities
over the years. However, the coefficient of
the interaction term of this variable with the
Financial Index (γ) should be negative if having an arm’s length financial system makes it
easier for a country with an initial specialization in low-growth industries to reallocate
resources toward fast-growing sectors.
The world growth of real output in industry
j was estimated as the GDP-weighted average
of the real output growth of industry j in the
181 countries covered by the database. Every
year the GDP weights were recalculated so as to
exclude the countries for which output was missing or where a change in industrial classification
was detected. Real output growth was estimated
as the log-difference of nominal output in U.S.
dollars deflated by the U.S. industrial producer
price indices for each sector (base year 1982).
Yearly log-output changes in the top 5 percent
and bottom 5 percent of the distribution were
excluded to reduce the influence of outliers.
The contribution of industry j to world real output growth at time t was estimated as follows:
yi,j
Dyi,j –––
yw,j
∑ –––––––––– ,
Dyw,j
i=1
181

( )

where yi,j is (log) real output of industry j in
country I and yw,j is (log) real world output of
industry j.­
Table 4.2 shows the results of the estimation
for the panel of 18 advanced economies considered in the chapter over the 1980–2001 period.
All the coefficients have the expected sign, and
are significant at the 1 percent level. Including
year dummies and estimating cross-sections on

the averages of the correlations across different
time periods gave broadly consistent results, but
yielded less precise estimates of the coefficient
of the interaction term.­

Cross-Border Flows and the Financial Index
To examine whether the nature of the financial system affects cross-border capital flows
among advanced economies, the following
gravity model was estimated using 2004 data on
bilateral portfolio holdings from the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS):
lnPij = a
 + b1lnYi + b2lnYj + b3lnDij +
b4Euro + b5FIi + b6FIj + eij ,
where i denotes the source country and j stands
for the destination country. P is total bilateral
portfolio investment of country i in country j
(in millions of U.S. dollars), Y measures market
size of, respectively, country i and country j (in
millions of U.S. dollars), D stands for the great
circle distance between countries i and j (based
on the CIA World Factbook), Euro is a dummy
variable for country pairs in the euro area, and,
finally, FIi and FIj refer to the Financial Index of
countries i and j, respectively. The market size is
measured by GDP (using total equity and bond
market capitalization produced similar results).­
The regression was estimated on three different
samples. The first included all source countries
for which portfolio data are reported in the CPIS,
while destination countries were limited to those
for which the Financial Index has been computed.
In order to assess the effect of the financial system
of the source country on portfolio holdings, the
second sample included only those industrial

countries for which the Financial Index is available. Finally, the third sample focused on crossborder flows within continental Europe.­
The regressions explain a large share of the
variation in bilateral portfolio holdings (Table
4.3). The results show that countries with larger
domestic markets both invest more abroad and
receive more foreign investment and that crossborder portfolio holdings are negatively correlated with distance.39 The results also reflect
the fact that cross-border portfolio holdings
are higher within the euro area. The findings
suggest that the extent of arm’s length finance
matters for cross-border portfolio holdings.
Bilateral investment depends positively on the
extent of arm’s length finance in the destination country, as well as in the source country in
the sample of advanced economies, as reflected
by the coefficient on the Financial Index. In
other words, more arm’s length economies tend
to both invest more in foreign stock and bond
markets and receive more portfolio investments
from abroad. The extent of arm’s length finance
in the destination economy does not seem to
matter, however, for cross-border portfolio holdings within continental Europe, which appear to
be dominated by other factors.­

39Similar findings are reported and discussed in
Faruqee, Li, and Yan (2004); and Portes and Rey (2005).

The Boom in Nonfuel Commodity Prices: Can It Last?

O

ver the past four years, fuel and
nonfuel commodity prices have
risen significantly. Developments
in fuel markets (especially oil) have
dominated the attention of policymakers so far,
although the increase in nonfuel commodity
prices has also had considerable consequences
for trade balances and growth in many countries.
Nonfuel commodities have a higher share in
world trade (about 14 percent during 2000–04)
than fuel commodities (7 percent). As in the
case of oil, many developing countries are
highly dependent on nonfuel commodities as a
source of export earnings—36 countries have a
ratio of nonfuel commodity exports to GDP of
over 10 percent, and in 92 countries the ratio
is over 5 percent (Figure 5.1). Indeed, in many
low-income countries, a large share of export
receipts are generated by just a few commodities
(see Table 5.1 for selected examples). Moreover, prices of some nonfuel commodities have
increased more than oil prices—for example,
the IMF metals index has risen by 180 percent in
real terms since 2002, while oil prices increased
by 157 percent.
Given the significant exposure of many
countries to fluctuations in nonfuel commodity prices, the future dynamics of commodity
markets have important policy implications.
Some observers have suggested that the rise of
China and other large emerging markets may
have led to a fundamental change in long-term
price trends, and that the world has now entered
a period of sustained high prices, particularly of
metals (see Barclays Capital, 2006a). In contrast, others believe that speculative forces have
largely decoupled metals prices from market
fundamentals (Societe Generale, 2006), and
The main author of this chapter is Martin Sommer

that prices will inevitably fall back and continue
to decline gradually in real terms, as during
most of the past century.
This chapter examines these issues by:
• identifying the underlying causes of the
recent increases in nonfuel commodity prices
and putting them in historical perspective;
• assessing the roles of rising commodity
demand from large emerging market countries (especially China) and of financial investors in pushing up prices; and
• evaluating whether the current high price
levels are likely to be temporary or lasting.

Long-Term Trends in Commodity Prices
and Volatility
Despite recent increases, the prices of most
nonfuel commodities remain below their historical peaks in real terms. Over the past five
decades, commodity prices have fallen relative
to consumer prices at the rate of about 1.6 percent a year (Figure 5.2). This downward trend
is usually attributed to large productivity gains
in the agricultural and metals sectors relative
to other parts of the economy. Compared with
the prices of manufactures, however, commodity
prices stopped falling in the 1990s as the growing globalization of the manufacturing sector
slowed producer price inflation.
This long-term trend has been apparent for most of the
past century and was highlighted by Prebisch (1950) and
others in the 1950s. See Cashin and McDermott (2002);
Deaton and Laroque (2003); Grilli and Yang (1988); and
Borensztein and others (1994) for a detailed discussion.

share the view that real commodity prices are falling—see

Figure 5.2. Long-Term Price Trends1
Prices of many nonfuel commodities have been falling in real terms relative to the
consumer price index (CPI) for at least the last 50 years. Globalization has slowed
price increases in the manufacturing sector and as a result commodity prices
stopped declining relative to the prices of manufactures in the early 1990s. However,
commodity prices exhibit significant volatility and prices can deviate from trend for
long periods.

On a year-to-year basis, commodity prices can
significantly deviate from the long-term downward trend, as price volatility is much higher
than the average real price decline (one standard deviation of annual price changes is about
11.5 percent, compared with the long-term price
decline of 1.6 percent a year; see Figure 5.3).
The current volatility in nonfuel commodity
markets is not unusual by historical standards.
In fact, the volatility of food and raw agricultural material prices seems to have fallen on
average over the past couple of decades, as growing geographical diversification of production
and technological advances have reduced the
sensitivity of prices to supply shocks, such as bad
weather or natural disasters (FAO, 2004b).

example, the emergence of major new exporters of coffee such as Vietnam has helped to reduce the

changes of two randomly selected food commodities is
15 percent, compared with 33 percent for metals. See

Nonfuel commodity prices—especially
­metals—have a strong business-cycle component
(Figure 5.4). The correlation between world
growth and annual changes in real metals prices
is about 50 percent. Moreover, almost all periods
of large upward movements in metals prices
have been associated with strong world growth.
Prices of agricultural commodities also tend to
rise during cyclical upturns, but their response
is much more muted than in the case of metals because of more flexible supply and the low
income elasticity of demand.

Assessment of Recent Developments
Over the past four years, commodity prices
have evolved very differently across various
subgroups of the nonfuel index (Figure 5.5).
Metals prices have risen sharply since 2002
to the present (by 180 percent in real terms),
while food and agricultural raw materials prices
have increased much less (by 20 and 4 percent,
respectively). As a result, metals contributed
almost 90 percent to the cumulative 60 percent
real increase in the IMF nonfuel commodity
index since 2002 (Table 5.2).
The current price dynamics of food and
agricultural raw material prices are similar to
earlier cyclical episodes (Figure 5.6). In fact,
some of the increase in food prices accumulated
since 2001 can be attributed to the depreciation
of U.S. dollar—real food prices expressed in
the IMF’s special drawing rights (SDRs) are now
only 9 percent higher than four years ago, and
the SDR prices of agricultural raw materials are
lower than their 2002 level.
Until recently, metals prices have also tracked
historical patterns —but the continued run-up
in metals prices this year has made the cumulative price increase significantly larger than
usual. A part of the unusually strong run-up in
metals prices can be attributed to low invest-

ment in the metals sector in the late 1990s and
the early 2000s that followed a period of earlier
price declines. Some analysts have also suggested that the intensity of the price upswing
in this cycle has been amplified by new factors—the increasing weight of rapidly growing
emerging markets (especially China) in the
world economy and investment activity of financial investors in commodity markets. All these
potential explanations are further examined

Role of Emerging Markets
China has become a key driver of price
dynamics in the metals markets. During
2002–05, China contributed almost all of the
increase in the world consumption of nickel and
tin (Table 5.3). In the cases of lead and zinc,
China’s contribution even exceeded net world
consumption growth. For the two most widely
traded base metals (aluminum and copper) and
for steel, the contribution of China to world consumption growth was about 50 percent. These

figures exceed China’s 29 percent contribution
to world PPP-adjusted GDP growth and are
much higher than the current 15 percent share
of China in world output. Compared with the
last decade, the relative contribution of China to
global demand for commodities has increased
considerably, as a result of both its rising weight
in the world economy and its particularly rapid
industrial production growth—including
industrial exports—which is closely linked to
the demand for metals. Other emerging market
countries have also contributed significantly to
demand in specific metals markets but, overall,
their contribution was not as broad-based as
China’s (Table 5.3).
Is the strength of Chinese demand for metals
temporary or permanent? Historical patterns
suggest that consumption of metals typically grows together with income until about
$15,000–$20,000 per capita (in purchasing
power parity, or PPP, adjusted dollars) as countries go through a period of industrialization
and infrastructure building (Figure 5.7). At
higher incomes, growth typically becomes more
services-driven and, therefore, the use of metals
per capita starts to stagnate.10 So far, China (with
its current PPP-adjusted real income of about
$6,400 per capita) has generally tracked the
patterns of Japan and Korea during their initial
development phase. For some metals, China’s
per capita consumption at a given income level
is higher than in the other emerging markets,
partly because it has a much greater share of
industry in its gross domestic product than is
 China

has become the largest consumer of several
key metals, generating about one-quarter of the total
world demand for aluminum, copper, and steel. For
comparison, China contributes 8–25 percent of the world
industrial value added, depending on whether current
or PPP-adjusted exchange rates are used for currency
conversion.
 For example, Russia accounted for 25 percent
of the increase in world copper demand during
2002–05, but only 0.5 percent of the rise in aluminum
consumption.
10Demand for metals can continue to rise even at
higher income levels if metal-intensive industrial sectors continue to grow strongly (such as, for example, in
Korea).

144

Role of Emerging Markets

typical for other countries at a similar stage of
development (Figure 5.8; see also Chapter 3).
This outcome reflects historical antecedents11 as
well as the strong competitiveness of the Chinese economy and relocation of manufacturing
production from advanced economies and other
emerging markets to China.
Looking ahead, rapid industrial output
growth, construction activity, and infrastructure needs could sustain the growth of demand
of emerging markets for metals at high rates
in the medium term. That said, some of the
current demand strength could be temporary—
­especially as the Chinese government is aiming
at a rebalancing of growth from investment to
consumption over the medium term. Moreover,
China’s size and heavy concentration in industry make it somewhat a special case. India’s
industrial sector, for example, has a considerably lower share in the economy, and India’s
continued rapid growth would in the medium
term have a less pronounced impact on metals
markets than growth in China.
The impact of emerging markets on agricultural prices is less clear-cut. China and other
fast-developing countries have often contributed
significantly to world demand growth (e.g., in
the cases of cotton and beef; see Table 5.4).12
However, this has not necessarily led to rising
prices—the price of cotton, for example, fell by
almost 20 percent during 2004–05. Generally,
food consumption in developing countries shifts
gradually toward high-protein commodities
such as meats, dairy products, and oils (FAO,
2004b). But this type of substitution has started
at a much lower level of income in China and
other countries—for example, meat consumption growth was particularly fast in China when
its per capita income was below $3,000 in PPP

Figure 5.6. Perspective on the Recent Price

Developments, 1957–2006
(Bottom of the cycle at time t = 100)
The current dynamics of real food and agricultural raw materials prices expressed in
U.S. dollars are similar to earlier cyclical episodes. After accounting for exchange rate
changes, both food and raw materials prices are very close to their levels from four
years ago. Until recently, metals prices have also tracked historical patterns, but the
continued run-up in metals prices this year has made the cumulative price increase
significantly larger than usual.

terms. The contribution of China to consumption growth in some key commodity markets
such as bananas, beef, corn, and cotton was
higher than its population share during much
of the past decade without any noticeable break
in the trend of falling real prices (Table 5.4 and
Figure 5.5). A similar point can also be made
about India and other major emerging market
countries.

Will the Recent Run-Up in Metals Prices
Be Sustained?
A central question, especially for metalexporting countries, is whether the recent
run-up in prices will prove lasting, or whether
the longer-term downward price trend discussed
earlier will eventually reassert itself.
Commodities futures markets suggest that
the current high prices may not be sustained
in the medium term.13 Over the next five

of future spot prices, they nevertheless reflect current

146

years, the futures prices of metals retain only
about one-half of the increase accumulated
since 2002 (in real terms, metals prices fall by
45 percent from current levels; see Figure 5.9).
This decline contrasts with oil futures prices,
which remain very close to the current spot
price. There are differences within the group of
metals—for example, aluminum futures prices
decline less over time (by 31 percent) than copper futures prices (49 percent in real terms).
Against this background, Box 5.1 examines
the role of financial investors in determining
commodity prices. The analysis suggests that
while the investors may have played a role in
providing liquidity to the markets, there is little
evidence that speculative investments have been
a significant driver of nonfuel commodity price
movements.

beliefs of market participants about forthcoming price
developments. Bowman and Husain (2004) find that
futures-prices-based models produce more accurate
forecasts than the models based on historical data or
judgment, especially at long horizons.

Will the Recent Run-Up in Metals Prices Be Sustained?

14 According

to Alcan (2006) and Alcoa (2004), energy
costs account for about 30 percent of the cost structure
of refined aluminum.

Figure 5.7. Consumption of Base Metals and Steel,
1960–2005
Per capita consumption of base metals and steel generally rises with income. Some
countries reach saturation in their per capita consumption at income levels between
15,000–20,000 purchasing-power-parity (PPP) adjusted U.S. dollars. Demand for
metals, however, can continue to grow even at higher income levels if industrial
production and construction contribute significantly to growth.

The market price of base metals is typically close to the production costs of marginal
(i.e., relatively less-efficient) producers—
­especially at the bottom of the cycle (Deutsche
Bank, 2006; see Table 5.5). During booms,
the market price can rise to a multiple of the
production cost, although over the past couple
of decades, the market price has tended to
return to a little above costs within a few years.
For aluminum, copper, and nickel, the current
ratios of market price-to-cost in the range of
1½–2¾ are similar to, or somewhat higher than,
those experienced during the cyclical peak in
the late 1980s. Back then, it took approximately
two years for the market price to come down
from the peak to near the cost level. For aluminum, the market-to-cost price ratio is currently
less elevated than for the other base metals,
supporting the indications from the futures
markets that price declines are likely to be less
pronounced for this metal.
Production costs vary considerably over time,
mainly reflecting energy prices, exchange rate
changes, and cyclical factors, such as availability of skilled personnel and hardware.
During 2002–05, production costs escalated
for all metals reported in the table—by about
20–50 percent for the marginal producers—with
rising energy costs playing a significant part.14
It is clear, however, that the doubling to tripling
of market prices over the past four years cannot
be fully explained by the cost structure of the
industry.
Since demand for metals seems to be rising
due to higher global growth and rapidly increasing income and industrial production in large
countries such as China, the speed and costs of
supply additions will determine whether metals
prices retreat from the current high levels in the
medium term. To bring the demand and supply
factors affecting the metals market together
in a more complete framework, two parallel
models were built for aluminum and copper

At low income levels, countries tend to go through a period of industrialization and
infrastructure building. At incomes of about 15,000 purchasing-power-parity (PPP)
adjusted U.S. dollars per capita, growth becomes more services-driven and the share
of industry in GDP starts to fall. China has an unusually large share of industry in its
economy relative to its peers from the same income group.

that together account for over two-thirds of the
IMF metals price index. Each model consists
of four parts (the full model is described in
Appendix 5.1).
• First, demand for each metal is estimated as
a function of industrial production and the
real price (relative to consumer prices) for
17 country groups that together make up
about 90 percent of world metal consumption. The sample period is 1960–2005 and
the estimated equations include a lagged
endogenous variable.15 By disaggregating
consumption data into many country groups
and using industrial production as an explanatory variable, the model broadly captures
the nonlinearity between metals consumption and income illustrated in Figure 5.7. The
estimated elasticity of demand with respect to
industrial production is somewhat higher for
emerging market and developing countries
than for the advanced economies (for aluminum, 1.2 compared with 1.0; see Table 5.6).
This reflects differences in the industrial
structure and the lower efficiency of production in developing countries. The long-term
price elasticity of demand is estimated at low
levels, which is consistent with earlier studies (see, for example, Ghosh, Gilbert, and
Hughes Hallett, 1987).16
• The second element of the model is a production function that incorporates information
about planned increases in capacity as well
as a price-elasticity term. Given the gestation
lags of several years for building new capacity in the industry, information about the
existing green field and brown field projects
is critical for the assessment of medium-term
supply prospects. The supply projection draws
on the expert assessment of the Australian
Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE, 2006). In the model, the

sample is shorter for some countries due to limited availability of industrial production data.
16 Substitution across metals is modest even in the
medium term and, therefore, is not modeled explicitly.

supply of refined aluminum and copper is
allowed to deviate from the ABARE forecast
whenever the price projection is different
from that assumed by ABARE (see Appendix 5.1 for details).
• Third, a price equation relates the current
real price of metals to the market balance
(the gap between demand and supply), the
exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to SDR (as
the metals prices are denominated in
U.S. dollars), and other variables.
• Finally, for each of the 17 country groups,
equations are estimated to build a link
between industrial production and GDP
growth rates. These equations are needed
since the World Economic Outlook projects real
GDP growth but not industrial production.
The equations are estimated over a shorter
sample, 1990–2005, because the relationship between industrial production and GDP
changes over time (Figure 5.8).
The estimated model is used to prepare
a forecast of demand, supply, and prices in
­a luminum and copper markets during 2006–10.
The main inputs into the model are World Economic Outlook GDP forecasts (in turn, determining future demand for metals) and ABARE
supply projections (which contain information

about forthcoming supply).17 The results suggest that:
• Consumption of aluminum and copper will
continue to grow fast—averaging 5.6 and 4.8
percent a year, respectively—given expected
rapid expansion of industrial production in
emerging markets, with China contributing
about 50 percent to average future demand
growth (Appendix 5.1 provides additional
details on expected market developments).
• The real annual average price of aluminum
and copper will decline from current levels
by 35 and 57 percent, respectively, by 2010.
In other words, rising supply will be able to
meet robust demand growth at falling prices.
The price decline is generated by a combination of factors: (1) recent accumulated
price increases will have some dampening
impact on demand; (2) considerable supply
expansion is projected by ABARE in the next
five years; and (3) some additional supply is
expected to come on stream as the current

17 The

medium-term scenario presented in Chapter 1
of this World Economic Outlook expects continued robust
world economic growth in the range of 4¾ to 5 percent
a year. This represents an increase of ¾–1 percentage
point over the average annual growth during 1995–2005.

Figure 5.9. Base Metal Prices on Futures Markets
(2002 = 100; monthly data in nominal terms)
At present, futures markets expect the price of metals to fall gradually to the middle
of the range between the current prices and the trough of 2002 (in nominal terms).
The expected price decline is smaller in the aluminum industry where the gap
between market prices and production costs has been narrower than for the other
metals.

metals prices are higher than in the ABARE
projections. In addition, the price forecast
reflects the unwinding of the models’ error
terms, since the recent run-up in prices has
been greater than the models would have
predicted based on their explanatory variables.18 Naturally, there is significant uncertainty around these central price projections,
reflecting uncertainties about global growth,
the speed of supply additions, and the econometric models (Figure 5.10).
• The price of copper is forecast to fall relatively
more than the price of aluminum. This is
consistent with prices in the futures markets
and the fact that the market-price-to-cost ratio
is currently much higher for copper than for
aluminum (Table 5.5).
Considering price developments beyond 2010,
the key issue is whether metals supply would be
able to meet rising demand in an environment of
continued strong growth. In this regard, several
features of the metals markets are important:
• In contrast to hydrocarbons, overall reserves
of base metals are practically unlimited
(Tilton, 2003).19
• While output concentration is high (the top
three producing countries account for about
46 percent of refined aluminum production
and 41 percent of refined copper production),
market structures are competitive and there
is currently no formal attempt by producers
to control prices. This stands in contrast with
the oil industry, where the majority of reserves
18 The model on average explains 80–90 percent of
variability in real prices of aluminum and copper. However, it does not fully capture the price behavior during
cyclical peaks. See Appendix 5.1 for details.
19Base metals are abundant—for example, aluminum
and iron account for over 8 and 5 percent, respectively,
of the earth’s crust. The resource base for many metals
could therefore last hundreds of years, although only
a fraction of these supplies can be extracted profitably
using the current technology (Tilton, 2003). Moreover,
the metals are not destroyed when processed and used,
and can be recycled, which would further increase the
estimates of reserves life expectancy. For comparison,
the International Energy Agency (2004) estimates that
the remaining oil resources could cover 70 years of
annual average consumption between 2003 and 2030.

These supply-side factors tilt the long-term

differentiate the metals sector from the oil market where prices are expected to remain high in

oil prices from returning to the average levels of the
1990s. These include, among other factors, the limited
potential for production growth in the non-OPEC region
and the lack of incentives for OPEC countries to increase
long-term output sufficiently to help lower oil prices to
the levels typical during the previous decade.

impact on price trends for agricultural commodities. Prices of food and raw materials are also
much less sensitive to cyclical conditions than
metals. Clearly, the speed of supply response
is significantly faster in the agricultural sector than in metals—for example, crops can
be switched from harvest to harvest relatively
quickly in response to price signals. Moreover,
the demand for agricultural commodities is less
cyclical and therefore more predictable.
Given these factors, long-term agricultural
prices will mostly be determined by productivity gains, which are expected to continue
in the future due to technological progress
(FAO, 2004b). Prices of some agricultural commodities will be influenced—like metals—by rising input costs, especially fertilizers whose price
is linked to oil. Baffes (2006) estimates that the
average pass-through from higher oil prices
to agricultural prices is about 0.18. This factor (together with exchange rate changes) can
explain why the current food price cycle—while
very benign—has exhibited some persistence
(Figure 5.6). However, as the example of cotton
illustrates, weather-related supply shocks are the
main source of price volatility in the agricultural sector and year-to-year fluctuations in the
harvest size can dominate the impact of higher
input costs for specific commodities.
For a narrow group of commodities, the price
pressures from higher energy costs may be more
substantial. These are the commodities that
have a particularly large exposure to the oil market—such as sugar (through ethanol production for flex-fuel cars in Brazil), natural rubber
(substitute for synthetic rubber produced from
oil), and possibly also corn (fuel for flex-fuel cars
in the United States).
In the future, agricultural prices could also
be affected by shifts in the agricultural support
system in the advanced economies. Production subsidies and import tariffs in advanced
economies have served to systematically lower
world prices for agricultural products, and
successful completion of a multilateral agreement to reduce this support system would be
expected to raise prices of certain key commodi-

Outlook for Food and Other Agricultural Commodities

Box 5.1. Has Speculation Contributed to Higher Commodity Prices?
Investor interest in commodity futures as assets
has increased significantly in recent years. For
example, participation in the NYMEX oil futures
market—as measured by the number of contracts reported by the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC)—has risen almost
fourfold since 1995 (first figure). Furthermore,
the share of noncommercial contracts (long
plus short—or total open positions) has steadily
increased over this period—from 9 percent to
16 percent of the total. A similar trend can be
observed in other commodity markets. The value
of noncommercial contracts, however, is not
large relative to total transactions in the physical
market over a comparable period.
The increased investor interest has led some
private analysts to suggest that speculative activity
has been a major contributor to the recent surge
in crude oil and metals prices and may have
even caused a bubble (see, for example, Societe
Generale, 2006). They argue that speculation has
magnified the impact of changes in the fundamental determinants of supply and demand
(which have been supportive of higher prices)
to an extent that in some cases prices have risen
far in excess of levels justified by fundamentals.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) has also suggested that while
geopolitical uncertainties have been a major force
behind higher prices, speculation has also been a
significant factor, given the organization’s accommodative supply policies and the historically high
level of inventories in OECD countries. Despite

CHAPTER 5   the boom in nonfuel commodity prices: can it last?

Box 5.1 (continued)
the attractiveness of some of these arguments,
however, the supporting evidence has often
focused on correlations rather than tests of causality, and has tended to be anecdotal or circumstantial—based on, for example, the increased hedge
fund activity accompanying the rise in prices or
the deviation of prices from long-run marginal
costs. The lack of solid evidence in part reflects
data and definitional problems associated with
defining and measuring speculation.
A price bubble is certainly a theoretical possibility and a periodic occurrence in financial
and housing markets. Excessive speculation
in the commodity futures market could, in
principle, push up futures prices and (through
arbitrage opportunities) spot prices above levels
justified by fundamentals. However, an alternative view is that increased investor activity,
by providing the necessary liquidity, is simply
a vehicle to translate changing views about
fundamentals into changing prices. In this case,
higher prices would be the cause (rather than
the effect) of increased investor participation.
In the intermediate case, there could be a twoway causality between prices and speculation, so
that higher prices induce an increase in speculation, which in turn pushes prices up further
until a new equilibrium is achieved.
Note also that the supposed impact of
speculation is sometimes confused with the
so-called “security premium,” which essentially
reflects concerns about future fundamentals
(e.g., potential shortages because of geopolitical developments). The security premium, in
contrast to speculation, results from a genuine
desire by consumers to hedge against risks.
Such a precautionary desire could push up
prices—for example, by raising demand for
inventories—as has happened in the oil market
where global inventories are at record levels,
likely because of concerns about future supply (leading to higher precautionary demand)
rather than (as argued by some commentators)
genuine excess supply in the spot market.
To assess the empirical validity of the speculation hypothesis, this box provides an econometric assessment of the direction of causality

154

between movements in spot and futures prices,
and changes in speculative positions in a sample
of major commodities, comprising crude oil,
copper, sugar, coffee, and cotton (Appendix 5.2
provides details of the approach taken). The
objective is to test for the presence of a set of relationships between these three variables that goes
beyond anecdotal evidence or one-off events.
A related issue of interest is whether speculation stabilizes or destabilizes prices—that is,
whether speculation reduces or increases the
amplitude of price fluctuations around equilibrium. While this issue is not the focus of this
box, the causality tests carried out in the box
can throw some light on the matter. Specifically,
to the extent that the presence of stabilizing or
destabilizing effects requires speculators to systematically influence price changes (as opposed
to broader measures of volatility), the absence of
causality from speculation to price levels could
be taken to suggest that speculators are neutral
as far as price fluctuations are concerned.
Two caveats/clarifications are in order before
describing the results. First, a thorough analysis
of price formation in the commodity markets
would require a more complete model incorporating the role of current fundamentals (supply
and demand factors) and perceptions about
future fundamentals (including the fear factor).
Such an exercise, however, is constrained by the
lack of high-frequency data on most fundamental factors and given that the relationship
between speculation and prices is most important in the short term.
Second, empirical analysis is hampered by
definitional problems related to information on
types of trader. The CFTC reports on a weekly
basis the number of contracts for two categories
of traders: commercial and noncommercial.
Commercial traders are defined as those who
use futures contracts for the purpose of hedging (e.g., oil producers, merchants, and major
consumers, such as airlines). Other participants
 One-year ahead futures prices are used since
activity is the largest in this market. The results were
broadly similar for longer-dated maturities.

Outlook for Food and Other Agricultural Commodities

are treated as noncommercial traders. Noncommercial traders are clearly speculators, as they
take positions in the market to bet on price
changes. However, some of the traders classified as commercial may also be engaged in
speculative activity. For example, commodity
index traders, who are classified as commercial,
may take market positions that are driven by
speculative motives from the clients’ perspective. Since the CFTC only reports the data in
an aggregated form, one cannot distinguish
amongst trader types within the commercial
category and isolate those that may potentially
qualify as speculators. Nevertheless, a recent
CFTC study using disaggregated unpublished
data collected by the Commission suggests that,
among commercial traders, the main groups
that may potentially be involved in speculation
(namely, managed money traders, including
hedge funds) do not appear to impact price
volatility and act largely as providers of liquidity
(see Haigh, Hranaiova, and Overdahl, 2005).
Note also that since data is weekly (measuring
the activity on the Tuesday of each week), it is
not possible to capture the impact of withinthe-week activity, which could be significant. 
Finally, CFTC data do not distinguish the contracts by maturity. Therefore, it is not possible
to study the relationship between speculation
and futures prices of different maturities. Subject to the above limitations and considerations,
this box uses the number of net long noncommercial positions as a proxy for speculation.
The second figure shows the behavior of spot
prices and the number of speculative positions

Note

that in the following analysis, average weekly
prices (Tuesday to Monday) are used to partly overcome this problem. Using prices for each Tuesday
produced qualitatively similar results.
Note that since each contract comprises a fixed
volume, using the number of positions is equivalent
to using volumes. Note also that the alternative of
total open noncommercial positions (i.e., the sum of
short and long positions) would not be a suitable measure because a rise in this variable could result from a
rise in short or long positions, which have potentially
opposite impacts on prices.

CHAPTER 5   the boom in nonfuel commodity prices: can it last?

Box 5.1 (concluded)
for various commodities. This figure suggests
two generalizations. First, prices appear less
volatile than speculative positions across commodities, with no discernible common trend
between prices and speculation. For example,
in the crude oil market there has been no
persistent pickup in net long noncommercial
positions in recent years when oil prices have
had a strong upward trend. More strikingly, in
the copper market, net positions have actually
fallen steadily over the past year, during which
prices have reached record highs, suggesting
that contrary to common perceptions, speculation may not have played a major role in the
recent price run-up. Second, while the series do
not appear to be correlated over the long run,
for most commodities some correlation appears
to be present over subperiods, as peaks and
turning points seem to occur around the same
time across the two series. The key question
then concerns the direction of causality.
The visual analysis suggests the relevance of
distinguishing short- and long-run causality. To
this end, and to account for the nonstationarity of the price and speculative positions series,
a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) is
employed (see Appendix 5.2 for details). Furthermore, given that the relationships have varied over time, and to enhance the reliability of
the results, the parameters are estimated using
rolling regressions. This approach will, in particular, allow us to assess whether speculation
has played a major role in the recent episode of
rising prices.
The results from the regressions for the five
commodities—summarized in Table 5.11 in
Appendix 5.2—indicate that the short-run
causality generally runs from spot and futures
prices to speculation, and not vice versa. This is

true even when the long-run (error-correction)
term is removed from the estimation. This
finding is rather consistent across commodities.
For crude oil, speculation appears to have had
a significant but very small effect on futures
prices. However, this has not been translated
into a causal impact on spot prices. This finding
is consistent with previous work by IMF staff on
the oil market (which tested for causality in the
frequency rather than time domain and used
longer-dated futures prices).10
Turning to the long run, while the estimated
parameters vary considerably over time, the
three series are mostly cointegrated, permitting an analysis of causality. The results suggest
that whenever there is cointegration, causality
is from prices to speculative activity, and not
vice versa. In the case of cotton, there is some
evidence of two-way causality—although the
absence of short-run causality from speculation
to prices weakens the importance of this result.
Finally, based on measured correlation coefficients, the model explains a much larger part of
variations in speculation than variations in spot
or futures prices.
All in all—and subject to the data limitations stressed at the outset—the results for the
five commodities in the sample provide little
­support for the hypothesis that speculative
activity (as measured by net long noncommercial positions) affects either price levels
over the long run or price swings in the short
run. In contrast, there is evidence (both across
commodities and over time) that speculative
positions follow price movements. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that
speculators play a role in providing liquidity
to the markets and may benefit from price
movements, but do not have a systematic causal
influence on prices.

 For

clarity, futures prices are omitted from the
figure, but these generalizations apply equally well to
the relationship between speculative positions and
futures prices.
 Similar results are reported—using a different
approach and sample—for energy futures markets by
Sanders, Boris, and Manfredo (2004).

156

 The reason for this additional robustness check
is that in the absence of cointegration, the short-run
causality tests in the VECM may not be valid since the
error-correction terms would be I(1).

Economic Outlook.

ties. As discussed in Box 5.2, such agricultural
reforms would have important implications for
income in many developing countries, although
the impact on world food prices is likely to be
smaller than the year-to-year volatility from
weather-related shocks.

Conclusion
Most of the recent increase in nonfuel commodity indices is due to metals. The current
upturn in their prices has been amplified by
rapid growth in emerging market economies,
particularly in China. Over the medium term,
however, metals prices are expected to retreat
from recent highs as new capacity comes on
stream, although probably not falling back to
earlier levels—in part because higher energy
prices have increased production costs. That
said, the timing and the speed of the price
reversal is uncertain, because with current high
capacity utilization rates and low inventories,
markets are very sensitive to even small changes
in supply and demand.
This assessment has a number of implications for exporters of metals. Policymakers in
exporting countries will need to ensure that
the current income windfall is either largely
saved—such as in the case of Chile—or used in
a way that supports future growth in noncommodity sectors, for example, through investment
in education, health, and infrastructure. Fiscal
transparency should help to ensure that the
most is made from any additional budget revenues. Governments, however, must be prepared
for a decline in prices in the future and ensure
that spending does not increase above sustainable levels in hard-to-reverse areas such as public
sector wages.
The prices of agricultural commodities have
increased much less than metals prices and
for exporters of these commodities, the main
policy question remains how to manage yearto-year volatility. Generally, governments of
both exporting and importing countries should
approach the volatility in commodity prices—
including metals prices—from a “risk manage-

ment” perspective and incorporate market
information about prices and volatility into their
fiscal planning and budgetary process. More
broadly, governments in commodity-exporting
countries should continue to aim at diversifying
their economies to help reduce vulnerabilities
to commodity price shocks. The IMF also stands
ready to provide assistance in cases of extremely
large and negative impacts of market volatility
on external balances.22

The assistance takes the form of short-term quickdisbursing concessional loans to meet immediate balance of payments needs. Alternatively, loans can also be
provided under the Compensatory Financing Facility
(CFF), which assists countries experiencing either a
sudden shortfall in export earnings or an increase in
the cost of cereal imports due to fluctuating world commodity prices.

CHAPTER 5   the boom in nonfuel commodity prices: can it last?

Box 5.2. Agricultural Trade Liberalization and Commodity Prices
Rich countries provide hefty support to their
agricultural producers in a variety of forms,
which tends to raise domestic prices for these
products and depress international prices. Such
support—including import tariffs, production,
and export subsidies, and direct payments to
farmers—averages about 30 percent of farm
receipts in OECD countries, and is particularly
high for rice, sugar, milk, and grains (first
table). Low- and middle-income countries also
provide support to agricultural producers,
mainly through import barriers.
A number of researchers have sought to
estimate the magnitude of the increases in
world prices of agricultural commodities that
would result from cuts in rich-country agricultural support (second table). The estimates
vary widely, reflecting differences in modeling
approaches, the time frame considered, and
the degree of liberalization (e.g., full versus
partial reform). As shown, the magnitude of
the price increases could be as large as 35 percent for some commodities, although the
average percentage price increases are more
modest: wheat (5.1), maize (4.6), beef (5.1),
sugar (5.8), and rice (5.5). The world price of
cotton, a key export of some poor countries in
West Africa, is estimated to increase by between
2.3 and 35 percent, with an average estimate of
about 13.5 percent. It is worth noting that the
average size of the estimated price increases is
less than the average year-to-year variation in
prices.
These estimated price increases can be
thought of as the short-run impact of liberalization. In the long run, the distribution
of production and exports would shift across
countries. In many OECD countries, liberalization would make it less attractive for farmers
to undertake investment and expand production capacity, while agricultural land would be
diverted to other uses. In contrast, producers
in countries with a comparative advantage in
agriculture (e.g., Australia, New Zealand, and

Brazil) would expand production following the
rise in world prices. It is even possible that the
increases in commodity prices could cause some
countries that are now importers of agricultural
­commodities to become exporters. Research
has shown that the elimination of agricultural

Appendix 5.1. Model of Aluminum and Copper Markets

Box 5.2 (concluded)
support policies could also reduce the variability of international food prices. For example,
Tyers and Anderson (1992) showed that the
coefficient of variation in world food prices
could be reduced by two-thirds if all countries
ceased to insulate their domestic markets. This
is because agricultural policies in rich countries are designed to prevent domestic prices
from changing rapidly. Domestic supply shocks,
such as droughts, are therefore offset through
changes in trade volumes in order to keep
domestic prices fairly stable. These changes in
trade volumes tend to cause international prices
to fluctuate to a much greater degree than they
would in the absence of agricultural support
policies.
Since liberalization of agricultural trade
would raise world prices, the import bills of net
food-importing countries would likely increase.
The estimated price changes suggest that as a

States CPI is used as a deflator); and εi,t is a
residual. This model is similar to the specification used by Gilbert (1995).
The model is estimated with ordinary least
squares (OLS) using annual data for 17 country
groups over 1960–2005. The demand equations
do not impose any restrictions on the country­specific coefficients c, α, b, w, and g to allow for
cross-country heterogeneity (Robertson and
Symons, 1992). Consumption of metals is tightly
linked to industrial production and the relationship is approximately linear (Figure 5.11).
Given evidence provided by Chow tests on a
time change in the elasticity of consumption
with respect to industrial production for a few
countries (such a parameter break may occur
due to changes in the industrial structure),
the model also contains a slope dummy that
takes a value of one during 2000–05, and zero
otherwise. The estimated coefficient on the
slope dummy is small on average, but statistically significant for some countries—the
dummy is therefore included in the model. The

group, import bills would rise from between
$300 million to $1¼ billion, depending on the
degree of liberalization. While these magnitudes are small in aggregate—they represent
less than 1 percent of total imports for these
countries—a number of low-income countries
could experience substantial increases in their
import bills, and could require additional
assistance to adjust to the higher international
prices. For this purpose, in 2004, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) introduced the
trade integration mechanism (TIM) to support
countries that experience an adverse shift in
their terms of trade as a consequence of multilateral trade liberalization, by making resources
more predictably available under existing IMF
arrangements. Of course, countries could also
mitigate at least some of the impact of higher
world food prices by reducing their import
tariffs.

average estimated coefficients are reported in
Table 5.7.23
The consumption data used in the model are
for primary refined consumption—secondary
consumption of recycled metals is therefore
not modeled explicitly. This approach is taken
due to the lack of country-level data on secondary consumption. However, accounting for the
secondary consumption and production would
not materially change the price forecasts in Figure 5.10 (Ghosh, Gilbert, and Hughes Hallett,
1987).
The estimated parameter values are relatively
robust with respect to a change in the sample
period and alternative specifications of the real
price term. The estimated price elasticity is
similar when producer prices are used instead
of consumer prices, or when the price term also

23Tests confirmed existence of a cointegrating relationship between consumption of metals and industrial
production for most countries, which helps achieve consistency of estimates.

contains a country-specific real exchange rate. In
the reported specification, only United States CPI
is used to deflate metals prices to simplify forecasting. The impact of this simplifying assumption on the forecast of global metal consumption
is very small given the low estimated price elasticity and—in the case of the missing exchange rate
term—the tendency for the errors to offset each
other across countries. In line with the literature,
the equations for metal demand do not include
prices of other metals, as substitution across metals is almost negligible in the short term and only
modest in the medium term.24

The supply of metals is based on the expert
assessment of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE, 2006)
and a price elasticity term. For each metal,
ABARE reports its supply projection taking into
account the pipeline of existing supply expansion projects. This supply path is adjusted as follows whenever the simulated price differs from
that used by ABARE:

In this equation, St stands for the metal supply at time t, and Pt is the metal price. Variables

of the Australian Bureau. This specification
was initially used by Gately (2004) and a similar
approach was also used in the IMF’s study of the
oil market in Chapter IV of the April 2005 World
Economic Outlook. Given the considerable uncertainty about the price elasticity of metal supply,
24 Product

specifications are embedded into production techniques and metals cannot be changed in most
uses except at significant cost. In the long term, substitution may be considerable as relative price changes lead
to purchases of new tools, retooling, and research and
development activity (Ghosh, Gilbert, and Hughes Hallett, 1987). However, the fit and statistical properties of
the estimated equations are very satisfactory, and any
substitution across metals resulting from the recent price
developments is not likely to be important over the forecast horizon considered in this study.

and logCt – logSt reflects the market balance
(i.e., the difference between world consumption
and production). The model is estimated with
OLS using annual data over 1960–2005. The
fit of the estimated equations for aluminum
and copper is high (Table 5.8). That said, the
model does not fully capture the price behavior
during cyclical peaks, which suggests that at
low inventory levels, prices respond to fundamentals in a nonlinear fashion.27 In 2005, the
price of aluminum and copper were above their
values fitted by the model by 7 and 14 percent,
respectively, and in 2006, the deviations were 32
and 58 percent. While large, these deviations
are comparable with those experienced during
earlier cycles (Box 5.1 finds little evidence that
speculative investments have been a significant
driver of nonfuel commodity price movements).
This uncertainty about the link between actual
price movements and the model’s explanatory
variables is explicitly taken into account when
generating the price forecast in Figure 5.10 in
the main text.

Finally, for each of the 17 country groups,

instead of the real exchange rate—U.S. consumer prices

elasticities of consumption with respect to industrial production were estimated for a few countries at unsustainably high levels of 2.5–5 (Argentina, Indonesia, Mexico,

forecasted values of industrial production, metal
demand, and price in each year. In the equations for metal demand and industrial production, the residuals are drawn jointly across all 17
country groups to preserve the contemporaneous cross-country correlation structure. In general, the uncertainty about the future price path
also reflects the uncertainty about future global
growth and the speed of supply additions. Additional randomization is therefore performed
as follows: (1) the world GDP growth rates are
assumed to be two-piece uniformly distributed
around the WEO baseline, with the maximum
global growth rate exceeding the baseline by
½ percentage point and the minimum growth
rate underperforming the baseline by 1 percentage point; (2) the actual metal supply growth
(net of price changes) is assumed to deviate
from projected ABARE supply growth by up to
1 percent every year; and (3) the medium-term
elasticity of metal supply with respect to prices
is assumed to be uniformly distributed between
0.16 and 0.26.

the commodity groups with codes 0, 1, 2, 4,
67, and 68. Precious metals and stones are
excluded from the analysis.
• Country coverage. The econometric analysis is
based on data for 14 countries and 3 country
groups. The individual countries are Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Indonesia,
Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, South Africa,
Thailand, Turkey, and the United States. The
country groups are EUR-12 (Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy,
the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom); EUR-4E
(Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain); and
Oceania (Australia and New Zealand).
• Commodity prices. Price data are primarily from
the IMF’s Commodity Price System database
(CPS).30 In general, the CPS commodity data
are available since 1957. Data from Cashin,
Liang, and McDermott (2000) were used to
extend the coverage of CPS as necessary.31
The data for 2006 are generally an average of
January–June prices. Figure 5.2 presents the
Grilli and Yang (1988) measures of long-term
commodity prices over 1900–87. Due to definitional changes, the Grilli and Yang indices
are not directly comparable with the data
from CPS and Cashin, Liang, and McDermott
(2000), and are therefore presented without
any transformations or updates. Prices of
metal futures were obtained from Bloomberg Financial Markets, LP (London Metal
Exchange data as of August 28, 2006) and the
July 19 and August 23 and 29, 2006 Commodity
Daily Briefings from Barclays Capital.
• General price indexes. The historical data (since
1900) on the United States consumer price
index are available from the Federal Reserve
Bank of Minneapolis.32 The United Nations’

• Commodity exports. The data on commodity
exports are from the World Bank’s World Integrated Trade Solution database.34 In Figure
5.1, the total exports of nonfuel primary
commodities are expressed in percent of
gross domestic product (GDP). Dependence
on commodity exports is assessed using the
average export-to-GDP ratio during the most
recent five years of available data. A total
of 171 countries are classified, of which 12
countries have the ratio of nonfuel commodity exports to GDP greater than 20 percent; 24
countries have the ratio between 10–20 percent; 56 countries between 5–10 percent; 39
countries between 2½–5 percent; 25 countries
between 1–2½ percent; and 15 countries have
the ratio below 1 percent.
• Consumption and production of metals. Data on
metal consumption and production are from
the World Bureau of Metal Statistics’ World
Metal Statistics Yearbook (1991, 1995, 2000, and
2005) and Metal Statistics (1970, 1975, 1980,
1985, and 1995). The data sets from the various editions were compiled together to create
a time series for metal consumption and production for period 1960–2005. In the case of
steel, the data were compiled using the same
method using The International Iron and
Steel Institute’s Steel Statistical Yearbook (1983,
1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2004). Finally,
data on iron ore mining are from the British
Geological Survey’s World Mineral Statistics
1998/2002 (2004) and World Mineral Production
2000–04 (2006).

databases were used to extend the coverage
of WDI data: where available, data from the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development’s databases, 38 and otherwise,
World Economic Outlook database. The industrial production data were gathered from
Haver Analytics, Global Insight, and national
statistical agencies. The share of industrial

Appendix 5.2. Modeling the Relationship Between Speculation and Commodity Prices

Methodology
A Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) is
used to test for causality, given that both spot
and futures prices, and speculative positions
contain unit roots. The VECM allows the examination of both short- and long-run causality: the
former is determined by the significance of the
coefficients on the first difference terms and
the latter by the significance of the coefficient
on the error-correction term when a long-run
cointegrating relation in levels exists.40 The following model is estimated:
           L–1
Dyt = a(b ′yt–1 + m + rt) + Gi  Dyt–i + g + et ,

S
i=1

where yt = (st , ft , nt )′; and st , ft , and nt are, respectively, the logarithms of spot and one-year ahead
futures prices, and the level of net long noncommercial positions; cointegration rank is 1; the
number of VAR lags L is 3; a is a 3 × 1 vector of
adjustment coefficients; b is a 3 × 1 cointegrating
L –1
vector; {Gi } i=1 are 3 × 3 matrices of VAR coefficients; and t is a linear time trend.
We test the null hypothesis of speculative positions causing spot and futures prices.41 Average
weekly data (Tuesday to Monday) are used for
commodity prices (from Bloomberg) and weekly
data for speculative positions for every Tuesday (proxied by net noncommercial positions
from the CFTC—defined as positions taken by
investors who do not use futures contracts for
the purpose of hedging). The estimation period
is September 1995 to June 2006. The model is
estimated using rolling regressions, using the
window length of 4.5 years (234 weeks), as a
reasonable duration for a business cycle and to
40More specifically, for any two variables x and y, y
is said to cause x in the short run if Δy Granger-causes
Δx—that is, given the past values of Δx, past values of Δy
are useful in predicting Δx. Furthermore, if the adjustment coefficient in the equation for x is significant, then
y is said to cause x in the long run.
41We do not carry out a joint test of significance for
the first and second lags. Instead, we look at the p-values
of individual coefficients and the explanatory power
the equations (R 2). Note, however, that if one of the two
lags is significant then they are likely significant jointly
too.

cover the time length of the recent run-up in
prices. Shorter windows were also tried and the
results were qualitatively similar. The results
were also quite robust to changes in the number
of lags (from 3 to 12), the trend specification,
and the assumed number of cointegrating equations (from 0 to 2). Finally, given that in the
absence of cointegration the short-run causality tests may not be valid, we also estimated the
models by focusing only on the relationship
between first differences. The results on shortrun causality did not change.

Estimation Results
We first discuss the results for crude oil, using
charts of the rolling estimates of parameters and
confidence bands—to illustrate what the raw
results of the exercise may look like—and then
present all the results in a simple and summary
fashion.

Crude Oil
Figure 5.12 depicts the evolution of the longrun coefficients (left panels) and adjustment
coefficients (right panels), and their confidence
bands. The relationship is clearly unstable over
time. However, the rolling values of the cointegration rank suggest that cointegration mostly
exists, thus permitting the broad examination
of long-run causality based on the significance
of the adjustment coefficients. The results
interestingly suggest that while the estimated
adjustment coefficient in the speculative position equation is significantly different from zero
for most of the period (zero lies mostly outside
the 90 percent confidence band), the opposite
is true for the spot and futures price equations.
This means that when a long-run relationship
holds, causality is from spot and futures prices
to speculative positions.
The three panels in Figure 5.13 show the evolution of the short-run coefficients. Specifically,
each figure shows the confidence bands around
the estimates of the first or the second lag of the
first difference of a variable in the equation for
another. The results are surprisingly conclusive.

In the equation for the spot price (top panel),
neither lags of futures prices and speculative
positions are significantly different from zero for
any reasonable length of time (i.e., confidence
bands almost always include zero). In the equation for futures prices (middle panel) the second
lag of speculation is often significant, but other
variables are not. The magnitude of the impact
of speculation on futures prices, however, is very
small. Finally, in the equation for speculative

positions (bottom panel) the first lags of spot
and futures prices are almost always significant.
Furthermore, the R 2 for this relationship is
36 percent, compared with 6–8 percent for the
other two equations.

Other Commodities
Having examined the results for crude oil in
detail, this section summarizes and compares
the results for all commodities (Table 5.11).

CHAPTER 5   the boom in nonfuel commodity prices: can it last?

We call a variable significant in the short-run
relationship for another if at least one of its lags
is significant at 5 percent. We then describe in
the table the frequency of observing significance
using the following terms (with the degree of
significance in percent terms in parentheses):
always significant (above 90 percent), mostly significant (60–90 percent), sometimes significant
(40–60 percent), rarely significant (10–40 percent), and never significant (below 10 percent).
As for the long-run relationship, we report the
frequency of cointegration, the stability of the
relationship, and the significance of the adjustment coefficient (using the rule in the previous
paragraph), as well as the average value of the
R 2s of the regressions. The results are discussed
in Box 5.1.

The following remarks by the Acting Chair were made at the conclusion of the Executive
Board’s discussion of the World Economic Outlook on August 23, 2006.

E

xecutive Directors welcomed the continued strong, broad-based global expansion. They noted that during the first
half of 2006, activity in most regions met
or exceeded expectations. Among the advanced
economies, growth was particularly strong in the
United States in the first quarter, activity in the
euro area gathered momentum, and the expansion in Japan remained on track. Directors were
pleased that growth performance in emerging market and other developing countries
remained robust despite more testing conditions
in global financial markets.
Looking forward, Directors considered that
the strong global expansion is likely to continue
in 2007, with a better balanced composition of
demand across the major advanced economies.
Directors saw some upside potential to the
outlook from even more rapid growth in emerging market economies, notably China, and the
possibility of stronger-than-expected investment
in a number of advanced economies. Overall,
however, Directors felt that the risks to the forecast are clearly tilted to the downside, with the
weight of such risks having risen compared to
the World Economic Outlook in April 2006.
Directors identified a number of downside
risks facing the global economy going forward.
These include the possibility that a continued
buildup of inflationary pressures in advanced
economies might require a more aggressive
monetary policy response; the continued potential for supply-side shocks in the oil and nonfuel
commodity markets; the risk of a more abrupt
slowdown in housing markets in advanced
economies, notably the United States; and the
possibility of weaker-than-expected growth in

private consumption in Europe and Japan, due
to slow productivity growth and labor market
rigidities. Directors believed that a smooth,
market-led unwinding of the large global imbalances remains the most likely outcome, but that
the risk of a more disorderly resolution of these
imbalances cannot be ruled out.

Advanced Economies
Directors noted that the pace of expansion in
the United States has moderated after exceptionally strong growth in the first quarter of
2006. Risks to the outlook appear to be slanted
to the downside, with a more abrupt cooling of
the housing market being a particular concern.
Directors observed that the Federal Reserve
is faced by the difficult situation of rising core
inflation and inflation expectations in the
context of a slowing economy. In light of this,
the policy stance going forward should depend
on the evolving balance between the competing
risks to growth and inflation; given the importance of keeping inflation expectations in check,
further interest rate increases should not be
ruled out. The better-than-expected fiscal performance in FY2006 is encouraging, although
the permanence of the recent unexpected
revenue buoyancy is not yet established. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to halve
the Federal deficit a year ahead of schedule,
by FY2008, while observing that a more ambitious deficit reduction path would provide a
firmer basis for the United States to face future
demographic pressures, put the budget in a
stronger position to respond to future economic
downturns, and help reduce global imbalances.

Action to ensure fiscal sustainability should
include measures to contain growth in entitlement spending, notably Social Security and
Medicare/Medicaid.
Directors welcomed the acceleration in real
GDP growth in the euro area in the first half
of the year, and noted that prospects for a
sustained, more robust, expansion have consolidated. They considered the risks to the
outlook to be broadly balanced, with the upside
potential arising from strong corporate positions
offsetting the downside risks related to higher
energy prices, elevated house prices in a number of countries, and the possibility of a sharp
appreciation of the euro against the background
of the large global imbalances. Directors anticipated a need for some further monetary policy
tightening in the euro area if the expansion
develops as expected but felt that—with inflation pressures broadly contained for now—interest rate increases could be gradual, especially in
view of the downside risks. Directors emphasized
that, given the importance of ensuring that
the current cyclical upswing is translated into a
sustained and long-lasting expansion, priority
should be given to further reforms to promote
greater competition in goods and service markets, more flexible labor markets, and increased
cross-border financial sector integration. The
need for further reductions in fiscal deficits
was also underscored. Directors stressed that
the credibility of medium-term budget targets
would be strengthened by welfare, pension, and
healthcare reforms, as well as reductions in the
government wage bill that would provide much
needed room to cut taxes on labor.
Directors welcomed the ongoing expansion
in Japan, noting that final domestic demand is
being supported by buoyant investment underpinned by robust profits and a turnaround in
bank credit. They viewed the normalization of
monetary policy as the key near-term macroeconomic policy challenge. They considered
that—with the risk of accelerating inflation low
and the costs of a reemergence of deflation
high—further interest rate increases should
be gradual. Directors underscored that further

172

substantial fiscal adjustment is needed to ensure
sustainable public finances and meet pressures
from an aging population. Given this, while current budget plans aim to eliminate the primary
deficit by 2011, some additional adjustment
would be warranted to stabilize net government
debt by the end of this period.
Directors welcomed staff’s analysis of how
differences across financial systems might affect
economic cycles in advanced countries, while
emphasizing that the findings should be seen
as tentative. Directors broadly agreed that the
recent trend away from bank- and relationship-based systems toward more arm’s length
financial systems, where securities markets play a
greater role, is likely to continue given technological innovations and the removal of regulatory barriers. At the same time, they noted that
important differences in financial systems across
countries remain. They concurred that in more
arm’s length systems, households may be able
to better smooth consumption in response to
changes in income, but that their spending may
be more sensitive to changes in asset prices.
Corporate investment appears to react more
smoothly to cyclical downturns in relationshipbased systems, but arm’s length systems seem
better at reallocating resources in response
to structural changes. They emphasized that
supervisory and regulatory policies will need to
keep up with the changes, while macroeconomic
policy management will need to adapt to variations in cyclical behavior.

Emerging Market and Other
Developing Countries
Directors agreed that the most immediate
policy priority for emerging market and developing economies is the continued implementation
of policies to reduce vulnerabilities and sustain
the current strong growth momentum. They
noted that emerging market economies remain
susceptible to rising interest rates and reduced
liquidity in global financial markets. Countries
at risk include those with weak public sector
balance sheets, large current account deficits,

IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK, AUGUST 2006

and less well anchored inflation expectations.
In this regard, Directors viewed the increasing
reliance by a number of emerging European
countries on private debt flows to finance large
current account deficits as a source of concern.
They also emphasized that emerging market
and developing economies should continue to
advance market-oriented reforms, particularly
by reducing barriers to competition, in order to
create the climate for vigorous private sector-led
growth.
Directors observed that sharply rising prices
of nonfuel commodities, particularly metals, had
underpinned strong growth in many emerging
market and other developing countries. Most
Directors noted staff findings that speculative
activity had not been a significant driver leading
commodity price movements. Looking forward,
Directors advised that current revenue windfalls
should be saved or invested to support future
growth in noncommodity sectors, rather than be
used to increase spending in areas that would be
difficult to reverse later.
Directors welcomed the strong growth performance of the economies in emerging Asia,
noting that much of the momentum is due to
vibrant expansions in China and India. Nevertheless, some Directors expressed concern that
the exceptionally rapid growth in fixed investment in China could lead to overheating of the
economy and a boom-bust cycle. While most
countries have succeeded in restraining core
inflation with quite small increases in nominal policy rates, Directors noted the need to
stand ready to increase policy rates further, if
needed. Directors observed that, while increased
exchange rate flexibility in some countries had
helped to achieve a better balance between
domestically and externally led growth, China’s
current account surplus continued to rise in
2005 and the first half of 2006. Most Directors
called for greater flexibility of the renminbi,
which would help to relieve overheating concerns and encourage a more balanced composition of demand. The move toward greater
exchange rate flexibility should be supported by
a continuation of complementary financial sec-

tor reforms, which, together with reforms to the
pension, health, and education systems, would
also help to foster a shift toward consumption.
Directors broadly agreed that the remarkable
growth performance of many countries in Asia
holds important lessons for less advanced developing countries. They welcomed staff’s analysis of growth in Asia, and concurred with the
finding that the favorable policy environment
in the region has been the key to strong total
factor productivity growth and rapid accumulation of physical and human capital. Directors
considered that prospects for sustaining strong
growth in Asia in the future will be strengthened
by continued progress in trade liberalization,
improving access to education, and steps to
promote financial development and encourage
entrepreneurship. These would facilitate the
ongoing shift of resources out of agriculture
and into industry and services. Efforts to boost
productivity growth and increase competition
in industry, and particularly the relatively more
sheltered services sector, will also pay important
dividends.
The economic expansion in Latin America
gathered momentum in the first half of this
year, underpinned by high prices for key commodities, declining interest rates, and a pick
up in public spending, while inflation largely
remained subdued. Directors expressed satisfaction that the region’s expansionary momentum
was largely unaffected by the increased financial
market volatility during the spring of 2006, as
higher reserve cushions, more flexible exchange
rate management, and improved fiscal indicators reduced vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, they
advised countries in the region to continue
preparing for the possibility of more testing
financial market conditions, with disciplined
fiscal policy at the core of such efforts. Directors
noted that the region remains the slowest growing among the emerging market and developing countries, and emphasized the importance
of unlocking Latin America’s growth potential.
This will depend on extending market-based
reforms, while taking steps to ensure that benefits of growth are broadly shared.

173

annex   IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK, AUGUST 2006

The economic expansion remains robust in
emerging Europe, mainly driven by buoyant
domestic demand, underpinned by increasing
net capital inflows and credit growth. Directors
expected continued solid growth in the region
but were concerned by the heavy reliance on
foreign savings and the substantial fraction of
bank lending that is in foreign currency, while
recognizing that generally large current account
deficits reflect, in part, favorable investment
opportunities in the context of EU accession
and integration. Against this background, they
agreed that growth opportunities provided
by foreign savings must be carefully balanced
against risks, and that reducing vulnerabilities is
a broad priority in the region. With most countries in the region aiming for euro adoption
in the medium term, adequate preparation is
needed for the loss of monetary policy autonomy and to establish the capacity to achieve
external adjustment in the absence of nominal
exchange rate flexibility.
Directors observed that activity in the Commonwealth of Independent States has been
buoyant, given high commodity prices and
support from capital inflows, and that growth
prospects are generally positive. Directors noted
that care should be taken to avoid undue further increases in consumption and to preserve
competitiveness. Inflationary pressures might
become entrenched, particularly in countries
with limited possibilities for sterilization. Directors suggested that the real effective appreciation would better be achieved by allowing the
nominal exchange rate to appreciate. They also
stressed the importance of structural reforms to
improve the investment climate and avoid the
emergence or aggravation of supply bottlenecks.
Directors welcomed sub-Saharan Africa’s
strongest economic expansion since the early
1970s. While growth is expected to remain high,
the persistence of elevated oil prices could have
a detrimental impact on growth in oil-importing
countries, particularly if combined with a sharp
decline in non-oil commodity prices. Against
such risks, the challenge is to continue adjusting to high oil prices, including by passing on

174

increases in international oil prices to domestic
energy prices. Directors emphasized that subSaharan Africa’s growth performance, while
improved, still falls short of the 7 percent annual
growth needed to meet the Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty by 2015. Continued support from the international community,
including through debt relief, making good on
recent commitments to further boost aid, and
bold market opening initiatives, will accordingly
be crucial to promoting private sector investment and employment.
Oil revenues in the Middle East rose further in the first half of 2006, and oil-exporting
countries continued to enjoy robust growth,
combined with rising external current account
and fiscal surpluses. Looking forward, Directors
expected the outlook for the region to remain
favorable, given prospects for high oil prices,
although geopolitical risks remain a concern.
Directors observed that most oil exporting
countries have appropriately begun to use the
opportunity provided by higher revenues to
increase spending to address long-standing
structural problems. They felt that, at the current juncture, there is scope for this buildup of
spending, given high unemployment in many
countries and still low inflation. Nevertheless,
they cautioned that with credit growing rapidly,
the risks of overheating need to be carefully
monitored, and underscored that higher expenditures should be accompanied by determined
efforts at capacity-enhancing reforms to ensure
the proper use of funds and lasting supply-side
benefits. Directors emphasized that policymakers throughout the region should be mindful
of prudential risks in the financial sector, given
rapid credit growth, rising financial sector exposure to asset price corrections, and a possible
deterioration in credit quality.

Multilateral Issues
Against the background of important downside risks to the global outlook, Directors underscored that policymakers across the world share a
responsibility for maintaining the foundations for

IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK, AUGUST 2006

strong global growth. In this regard, they emphasized that the risks of a disorderly adjustment
of the existing large global imbalances will be
considerably reduced by sustained policy actions
across the major economies, particularly steps to
boost national saving in the United States, including through fiscal consolidation; greater progress on structural reforms in Europe and Japan;
reforms to boost domestic demand in emerging
Asia (consumption in China, investment elsewhere) together with greater exchange rate flexibility; and increased spending in oil-producing
countries, particularly in the Middle East where
a large buildup is already in train, consistent
with absorptive capacity constraints and cyclical
considerations. Directors noted that a multilateral
approach will enhance the prospect that possible
risks associated with individual actions will be
alleviated by simultaneous policy initiatives else-

where. In this respect, Directors considered that
the present multilateral consultation by the Fund
could contribute to this process.
Directors expressed disappointment about
the apparent deadlock in the Doha Round,
and emphasized that trade liberalization on a
nondiscriminatory basis remains the best way
to open up new global growth opportunities.
The threat of protectionist pressures will need
to be firmly resisted, with all member countries
stepping up efforts to reinvigorate the process
of multilateral trade liberalization. Directors
considered that high and volatile prices in world
energy markets remain a major concern that
will require sustained efforts from all sides to
address. Increased investment is needed to build
up adequate production and refining capacity, while appropriate incentives for consumers
would encourage improved energy conservation.

T

he statistical appendix presents historical data, as well as projections. It comprises five sections: Assumptions, What’s
New, Data and Conventions, Classification of Countries, and Statistical Tables.­
The assumptions underlying the estimates and
projections for 2006–07 and the medium-term
scenario for 2008–11 are summarized in the
first section. The second section presents a brief
description of changes to the database and statistical tables. The third section provides a general
description of the data, and of the conventions
used for calculating country group composites.
The classification of countries in the various
groups presented in the World Economic Outlook is
summarized in the fourth section.­
The last, and main, section comprises the
statistical tables. Data in these tables have been
compiled on the basis of information available
through end-August 2006. The figures for 2006
and beyond are shown with the same degree of
precision as the historical figures solely for convenience; since they are projections, the same
degree of accuracy is not to be inferred.­

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced
economies are assumed to remain constant at
their average levels during the period July 5
to August 2, 2006. For 2006 and 2007, these
assumptions imply average U.S. dollar/SDR
conversion rates of 1.468 and 1.485, U.S. ­dollar/
euro conversion rate of 1.25 and 1.28, and yen/
U.S. dollar conversion rates of 115.6 and 115.1,
respectively.­
It is assumed that the price of oil will average
$69.20 a barrel in 2006 and $75.50 a barrel in
2007.­
Established policies of national authorities are
assumed to be maintained. The more specific
policy assumptions underlying the projections

for selected advanced economies are described
in Box A1.­
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that
the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on
six-month U.S. dollar deposits will average 5.4
percent in 2006 and 5.5 percent in 2007, that
three-month euro deposits will average 3.1 percent in 2006 and 3.7 percent in 2007, and that
six-month Japanese yen deposits will average 0.5
percent in 2006 and 1.1 percent in 2007.­
With respect to introduction of the euro, on
December 31, 1998, the Council of the European Union decided that, effective January 1,
1999, the irrevocably fixed conversion rates
between the euro and currencies of the member
states adopting the euro are as follows.­

Statistical Appendix

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions Underlying the Projections for Selected Advanced Economies
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in
the World Economic Outlook are based on officially
announced budgets, adjusted for differences
between the national authorities and the IMF
staff regarding macroeconomic assumptions and
projected fiscal outturns. The medium-term fiscal
projections incorporate policy measures that are
judged likely to be implemented. In cases where
the IMF staff has insufficient information to assess
the authorities’ budget intentions and prospects
for policy implementation, an unchanged structural primary balance is assumed, unless otherwise
indicated. Specific assumptions used in some of the
advanced economies follow (see also Tables 12–14
in the Statistical Appendix for data on fiscal and
structural balances).
United States. The fiscal projections are based on
the Administration’s FY2007 mid-session review
(July 11, 2006), adjusted to take into account
differences in macroeconomic projections as well
as staff assumptions about (1) additional defense
spending based on analysis by the Congressional Budget Office; (2) slower compression in
the growth rate of discretionary spending; and
(3) continued AMT relief beyond FY2007. The
projections also assume that personal retirement
accounts are not introduced.­
Japan. The medium-term fiscal projections
assume that expenditure and revenue of the
general government (excluding social security)

The output gap is actual less potential output, as
a percent of potential output. Structural balances are
expressed as a percent of potential output. The structural
budget balance is the budgetary position that would be
observed if the level of actual output coincided with
potential output. Changes in the structural budget balance consequently include effects of temporary fiscal
measures, the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and
debt-service costs, and other noncyclical fluctuations in
the budget balance. The computations of structural budget balances are based on IMF staff estimates of potential
GDP and revenue and expenditure elasticities (see the
October 1993 World Economic Outlook, Annex I). Net debt
is defined as gross debt less financial assets of the general
government, which include assets held by the social security insurance system. Estimates of the output gap and of
the structural balance are subject to significant margins
of uncertainty.­

178

are adjusted in line with the current government
target to achieve primary fiscal balance by the early
2010s.­
Germany. For 2006–2011, the projections reflect
the measures announced in the new government’s
coalition agreement. These aim to reduce the
overall fiscal balance to below 3 percent of GDP
in 2007. Projections do not include health care
financing or corporate tax reforms because of the
lack of specific information about their content.­
France. The projections for 2006 are based on the
initial budget adjusted for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions. For 2007–09, the projections are based on the 2007–09 Stability Program
Update, adjusted for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions and different assumptions
about nontax revenue and spending growth (less
deceleration). For 2010–11, the IMF staff assumes
unchanged tax policies and real expenditure
growth as in the 2009 projection.­
Italy. Fiscal projections from 2007 assume a
constant primary structural balance net of one-off
measures. They include the estimated structural
impact of the correction package announced on
June 30, 2006.­
United Kingdom. The fiscal projections are based
on information provided in the 2006 Budget
Report. Additionally, the projections incorporate
the most recent statistical releases from the Office
for National Statistics, including provisional budgetary outturns through 2006:Q1.­
Canada. Projections are based on the 2006
Budget and IMF staff estimates, and incorporate
the most recent data releases from the Statistics
Canada, including provincial and territorial budgetary outturns through 2006Q1.­
Australia. The fiscal projections through the
fiscal year 2010/11 are based on the 2006–07
budget published in May 2006. For the remainder
of the projection period, the IMF staff assumes
unchanged policies.­
Austria. Fiscal figures for 2005 are based on the
authorities’ estimated outturn. Projections for 2006
are based on this year’s budget. Projections for
2007–08 are based on the Austrian Stability Program. For 2009–11, projections assume the same
overall and structural balances as in 2008.­

Statistical Appendix

Belgium. The projections for 2006 are based
on the 2006 budget, adjusted for the IMF staff’s
­macroeconomic assumptions and an assumed
lower yield of some specific revenues. For 2007–11,
the projections assume unchanged tax policies
and real primary expenditure growth as in the
recent past.­
Denmark. Projections for 2006 are aligned with
the latest official projections and budget, adjusted
for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions.
For 2007–11, the projections incorporate the June
2006 welfare agreement as well as key features of
the prior medium-term fiscal plan. The projections
imply continued budget surpluses in line with the
authorities’ objectives of long-term fiscal sustainability and debt reduction.­
Greece. Projections are based on the 2006 budget,
adjusted for IMF staff’s assumptions for economic
growth. For 2007 and beyond, tax revenues as a
percent of GDP are assumed to be constant, while
social insurance contributions are assumed to
continue their trend increase and EU transfers are
assumed to decline. Total expenditure is assumed
to remain broadly constant as a percent of GDP.­
Hong Kong SAR. The fiscal projections are based
on the authorities’ medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy that was announced in October 2003.­
Korea. Projections for 2006 are based on the
authorities’ budget, with some adjustment for IMF
staff assumptions. For 2007–11, projections are in
line with the authorities’ budget plans.­
Netherlands. The fiscal projections build on
the 2006 budget, the latest Stability Program,
and other forecasts provided by the authorities, adjusted for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic
assumptions.­
New Zealand. The fiscal projections through
the fiscal year 2009/10 are based on the 2006/07
budget of May 2006. For the remainder of the projection period, the IMF staff assumes unchanged
policies.­
Portugal. Fiscal projections for 2006 build on
the authorities’ budget. Projections for 2007 and
beyond are based on the current Stability and
Growth Program of the authorities.­
Singapore. For the 2006/07 fiscal year, budget projections on the expenditure side are mostly based

on the authorities’ budget and fiscal projections,
while revenues grow in line with economic activity.
Thereafter, the projections assume a constant budget balance (in percent of GDP).­
Spain. Fiscal projections through 2008 are
based on the policies outlined in the authorities’
updated Stability Program of June 2006, adjusted
for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions,
information from recent statistical releases, and
official announcements. In subsequent years, the
fiscal projections assume unchanged policies.­
Sweden. The fiscal projections are based on
information provided in the budget presented on
April 18, 2006. Additionally, the projections incorporate the most recent statistical releases from
Statistics Sweden, including provisional budgetary
outturns through December 2005.­
Switzerland. Estimates for 2005 and projections
for 2006–11 are based on IMF staff calculations,
which incorporate measures to restore balance in
the Federal accounts and strengthen social security finances.­
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the
established policy framework in each country.
In most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative
stance over the business cycle: official interest
rates will therefore increase when economic
­indicators suggest that prospective inflation
will rise above its acceptable rate or range, and
they will decrease when indicators suggest that
prospective inflation will not exceed the acceptable rate or range, that prospective output
growth is below its potential rate, and that the
margin of slack in the economy is significant. On
this basis, the LIBOR on six-month U.S. dollar
deposits is assumed to average 5.4 percent in
2006 and 5.5 percent in 2007. The projected path
for U.S. ­dollar short-term interest rates reflects
the assumption implicit in prevailing forward
rates. The rate on three-month euro deposits is
assumed to average 3.1 percent in 2006 and 3.7
percent in 2007. The interest rate on six-month
Japanese yen deposits is assumed to average 0.5
percent in 2006 and 1.1 percent in 2007. Changes
in interest rate assumptions compared with the
April 2006 World Economic Outlook are summarized in Table 1.1

independent state; and data for Liberia are now

Data and Conventions
Data and projections for 183 countries form
the statistical basis for the World Economic Outlook (the World Economic Outlook database).
The data are maintained jointly by the IMF’s
Research Department and area departments,
with the latter regularly updating country projections based on consistent global assumptions.­
Although national statistical agencies are the
ultimate providers of historical data and definitions, international organizations are also involved
in statistical issues, with the objective of harmonizing methodologies for the national compilation
of statistics, including the analytical frameworks,
concepts, definitions, classifications, and valuation
procedures used in the production of economic
statistics. The World Economic Outlook database
reflects information from both national source
agencies and international organizations.­
The comprehensive revision of the standardized System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA), the
IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition
(BPM5), the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual (MFSM), and the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) represented
important improvements in the standards of
economic statistics and analysis. The IMF was
actively involved in all these projects, particularly
the Balance of Payments, Monetary and Financial
Statistics, and Government Finance Statistics manuals, which reflects the IMF’s special interest in
Commission of the European Communities, International Monetary Fund, Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, United Nations, and
World Bank, System of National Accounts 1993 (Brussels/
Luxembourg, New York, Paris, and Washington, 1993);
International Monetary Fund, Balance of Payments Manual,
Fifth Edition (Washington, 1993); International Monetary
Fund, Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (Washington, 2000); and International Monetary Fund, Government
Finance Statistics Manual (Washington, 2001).­

countries’ external positions, financial sector
stability, and public sector fiscal positions. The
process of adapting country data to the new
definitions began in earnest when the manuals
were released. However, full concordance with
the manuals is ultimately dependent on the provision by national statistical compilers of revised
country data, and hence the World Economic
Outlook estimates are still only partially adapted
to these manuals.­
In line with recent improvements in standards
of reporting economic statistics, several countries have phased out their traditional fixed-baseyear method of calculating real macroeconomic
variables levels and growth by switching to a
chain-weighted method of computing aggregate
growth. Recent dramatic changes in the structure of these economies have obliged these
countries to revise the way in which they measure real GDP levels and growth. Switching to
the chain-weighted method of computing aggregate growth, which uses current price information, allows countries to measure GDP growth
more accurately by eliminating upward biases
in new data. Currently, real macroeconomic
data for Albania, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan,
Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, euro area,
Finland, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Lithuania,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the
United States are based on chain-weighted methodology. However, data before 1996 (Albania),
1995 (Czech Republic), 1990 (Denmark), 1995
(euro area), 1991 (Germany), 1995 (Greece),
1990 (Iceland), 1994 (Japan), 1995 (Luxembourg), 1995 (Russia), 1995 (Slovenia), and
1995 (Spain) are based on unrevised national
accounts and subject to revision in the future.­
The members of the European Union have
adopted a harmonized system for the compila-

Approach to Measuring GDP,” Current Issues in Economics and Finance (Federal Reserve Bank of New York), Vol.

tion of the national accounts, referred to as
ESA 1995. All national accounts data from 1995
onward are presented on the basis of the new
system. Revision by national authorities of data
prior to 1995 to conform to the new system has
progressed, but has in some cases not been completed. In such cases, historical World Economic
Outlook data have been carefully adjusted to
avoid breaks in the series. Users of EU national
accounts data prior to 1995 should nevertheless
exercise caution until such time as the revision

has been fully completed. See Box 1.2, “Revisions in National Accounts Methodologies,” in
the May 2000 World Economic Outlook.­
Composite data for country groups in the
World Economic Outlook are either sums or
weighted averages of data for individual countries. Unless otherwise indicated, multiyear averages of growth rates are expressed as compound
annual rates of change. Arithmetically weighted
averages are used for all data except inflation
and money growth for the other emerging market and developing country group, for which
geometric averages are used. The following
conventions apply.­
• Country group composites for exchange
rates, interest rates, and the growth rates of
monetary aggregates are weighted by GDP
converted to U.S. dollars at market exchange
rates (averaged over the preceding three
years) as a share of group GDP.­
• Composites for other data relating to the
domestic economy, whether growth rates or
ratios, are weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities (PPPs) as a share of total
world or group GDP.
Averages for real GDP and its components, employment, per capita GDP, inflation, factor productivity, trades,
and commodity prices are calculated based on compound
annual rate of change except for the unemployment rate,
which is based on simple arithmetic average.­
See Box A2 of the April 2004 World Economic Outlook for
a summary of the revised PPP-based weights and Annex IV
of the May 1993 World Economic Outlook. See also AnneMarie Gulde and Marianne Schulze-Ghattas, “Purchasing
Power Parity Based Weights for the World Economic Outlook,”
in Staff Studies for the World Economic Outlook (International
Monetary Fund, December 1993), pp. 106–23.­

• Composites for data relating to the domestic economy for the euro area (12 member
countries throughout the entire period unless
otherwise noted) are aggregates of national
source data using weights based on 1995 ECU
exchange rates.­
• Composite unemployment rates and employment growth are weighted by labor force as a
share of group labor force.­
• Composites relating to the external economy
are sums of individual country data after
conversion to U.S. dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated for
balance of payments data and at end-of-year
market exchange rates for debt denominated
in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes
and prices, however, are arithmetic averages
of percentage changes for individual countries weighted by the U.S. dollar value of
exports or imports as a share of total world or
group exports or imports (in the preceding
year).­
For central and eastern European countries,
external transactions in nonconvertible currencies (through 1990) are converted to U.S.
dollars at the implicit U.S. dollar/ruble conversion rates obtained from each country’s national
currency exchange rate for the U.S. dollar and
for the ruble.­
All data refer to calendar years, except for the
following countries, which refer to fiscal years:
Australia (July/June); Bangladesh (July/June);
Egypt (July/June); Iran, I.R. of (March/February); Mauritius (July/June); Myanmar (April/
March); Nepal (July/June); Netherlands Antilles
(February/January); New Zealand (July/June);
Pakistan (July/June); Samoa (July/June); and
Tonga (July/June).­

e­ merging market and developing countries.
Rather than being based on strict criteria,
economic or otherwise, this classification has
evolved over time with the objective of facilitating analysis by providing a reasonably meaningful organization of data. Table A provides
an overview of these standard groups in the
World Economic Outlook, showing the number
of countries in each group and the average
2005 shares of groups in aggregate PPP-valued
GDP, total exports of goods and services, and
population.­
A few countries are presently not included in
these groups, either because they are not IMF
members and their economies are not monitored by the IMF, or because databases have
not yet been fully developed. Because of data
limitations, group composites do not reflect
the following countries: The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Brunei Darussalam, Eritrea, Iraq, Liberia,
Serbia, Somalia, and Timor-Leste. Cuba, the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and
Montenegro are examples of countries that are
not IMF members, whereas San Marino, among
the advanced economies, and Aruba, Marshall
Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and
As used here, the term “country” does not in all cases
refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood
by international law and practice. It also covers some
territorial entities that are not states, but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent
basis.­

Palau among the developing countries, are
examples of economies for which databases
have not been completed.­

General Features and Composition of
Groups in the World Economic Outlook
Classification
Advanced Economies
The 29 advanced economies are listed in
Table B. The seven largest in terms of GDP—
the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy, the United Kingdom, and ­Canada—
­constitute the subgroup of major advanced
economies, often referred to as the Group of
Seven (G-7) countries. The 12 members of
the euro area and the four newly industrialized Asian economies are also distinguished as
subgroups. Composite data shown in the tables
for the euro area cover the current members
for all years, even though the membership has
increased over time.­
In 1991 and subsequent years, data for
Germany refer to west Germany and the eastern
Länder (i.e., the former German Democratic
Republic). Before 1991, economic data are
not available on a unified basis or in a consistent manner. Hence, in tables featuring data
expressed as annual percent change, these
apply to west Germany in years up to and
including 1991, but to unified Germany from
1992 onward. In general, data on national

accounts and domestic economic and financial

whereas data for the central government and
balance of payments apply to west Germany
through June 1990 and to unified Germany
thereafter.­
Table C lists the member countries of the
European Union, not all of which are classified
as advanced economies in the World Economic
Outlook.­

Other Emerging Market and
Developing Countries
The group of other emerging market and
developing countries (145 countries) includes
all countries that are not classified as advanced
economies.­
The regional breakdowns of other emerging market and developing countries—Africa,
central and eastern Europe, Commonwealth of
Independent States, developing Asia, Middle East,
and Western Hemisphere—largely conform to the
regional breakdowns in the IMF’s International
Financial Statistics. In both classifications, Egypt
and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya are included
in the Middle East region rather than in Africa.
In addition, the World Economic Outlook sometimes refers to the regional group of Middle
East and North Africa countries, also referred

Other emerging market and developing
countries are also classified according to
analytical criteria. The analytical criteria reflect
countries’ composition of export earnings
and other income from abroad, exchange
­rate arrangements, a distinction between net
creditor and net debtor countries, and, for the

on external financing source and experience
with external debt servicing. The detailed
­composition of other emerging market and
developing countries in the regional and
­a nalytical groups is shown in Tables E and F.­
The analytical criterion, by source of export
earnings, distinguishes between categories: fuel
(Standard International Trade ­Classification—
SITC 3) and nonfuel and then focuses on nonfuel primary products (SITC 0, 1, 2, 4, and 68).­
The financial criteria focus on net creditor, net debtor countries, and heavily indebted
poor ­countries (HIPCs). Net debtor countries
are further differentiated on the basis of two
­additional financial criteria: by official external

186

financing and by experience with debt servicing.
The HIPC group comprises the countries
considered by the IMF and the World Bank for
their debt initiative, known as the HIPC Initiative, with the aim of reducing the external debt
burdens of all the eligible HIPCs to a “sustainable” level in a reasonably short period of time.
During 1999–2003, 56 countries incurred external payments arrears or entered into official or commercial bank
debt-rescheduling agreements. This group of countries
is referred to as countries with arrears and/or rescheduling
during 1999–2003.­

1For

many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. Data for some countries are for fiscal years.
percent changes in 2002 are calculated over a period of 18 months, reflecting a change in the fiscal year cycle (from July–June to January–December).
3Data for some countries refer to real net material product (NMP) or are estimates based on NMP. For many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. The
figures should be interpreted only as indicative of broad orders of magnitude because reliable, comparable data are not generally available. In particular, the growth of output of
new private enterprises of the informal economy is not fully reflected in the recent figures.
4Mongolia, which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.

1In accordance with standard practice in the World Economic Outlook, movements in consumer prices are indicated as annual averages rather than as December/December
changes during the year, as is the practice in some countries. For many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. Data for some countries are for fiscal years.
2The percent changes in 2002 are calculated over a period of 18 months, reflecting a change in the fiscal year cycle (from July–June to January–December).
3For many countries, inflation for the earlier years is measured on the basis of a retail price index. Consumer price indices with a broader and more up-to-date coverage are
typically used for more recent years.
4Mongolia, which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.

Structural balance

1On

a national income accounts basis. The structural budget position is defined as the actual budget deficit (or surplus) less the effects of cyclical deviations of output from
potential output. Because of the margin of uncertainty that attaches to estimates of cyclical gaps and to tax and expenditure elasticities with respect to national income, indicators of structural budget positions should be interpreted as broad orders of magnitude. Moreover, it is important to note that changes in structural budget balances are not
necessarily attributable to policy changes but may reflect the built-in momentum of existing expenditure programs. In the period beyond that for which specific consolidation
programs exist, it is assumed that the structural deficit remains unchanged.
2Excludes one-off receipts from the sale of mobile telephone licenses equivalent to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2000 for Germany, 0.1 percent of GDP in 2001 and 2002 for France,
1.2 percent of GDP in 2000 for Italy, 0.1 percent of GDP in 2000 for Spain, 0.7 percent of GDP in 2000 for the Netherlands, and 0.2 percent of GDP in 2001 for Belgium, 0.4
percent of GDP in 2000 for Austria, 0.3 percent of GDP in 2000 for Portugal, and 0.2 percent of GDP in 2002 for Ireland. Also excludes one-off receipts from sizable asset transactions, in particular 0.5 percent of GDP for France in 2005.
3Excludes Luxembourg.
4Excludes commonwealth government privatization receipts.
5Excludes oil.
6Government balance is revenue minus expenditure plus balance of state-owned enterprises, excluding privatization receipts.

capital transfers—including debt forgiveness—and acquisition/disposal of nonproduced, nonfinancial assets.
net direct investment, net portfolio investment, and other long- and short-term net investment flows, including official and private borrowing. In the standard balance of payments presentation above, total net capital flows are equal to the balance on financial account minus the change in reserve assets.
4Because of limitations on the data coverage for net official flows, the residually derived data for net private flows may include some official flows.
5As defined in the World Economic Outlook (see footnote 6). It should be noted that there is no generally accepted standard definition of external financing.
6Defined as the sum of—with opposite sign—the goods and services balance, net income and current transfers, direct investment abroad, the change in reserve assets, the
net acquisition of other assets (such as recorded private portfolio assets, export credit, and the collateral for debt-reduction operations), and the net errors and omissions. Thus,
net external financing, according to the definition adopted in the World Economic Outlook, measures the total amount required to finance the current account, direct investment
outflows, net reserve transactions (often at the discretion of the monetary authorities), the net acquisition of nonreserve external assets, and the net transactions underlying the
errors and omissions (not infrequently reflecting capital flight).
7Including other transactions on capital account.
8Debt-creating foreign direct investment liabilities are not included.
9Net disbursement of long- and short-term credits, including exceptional financing, by both official and private creditors.
10Changes in liabilities.
11Comprise use of IMF resources under the General Resources Account, Trust Fund, and Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). For further detail, see Table 36.
12This is often referred to as the "resource balance" and, with opposite sign, the "net resource transfer."
13Net external financing plus amortization due on external debt.
14Net external borrowing plus amortization due on external debt.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries' national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum
of the U.S dollar values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier World Economic Outlooks, where the composites
were weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities (PPPs) as a share of total world GDP. For many countries, the estimates of national saving are built up from national
accounts data on gross domestic investment and from balance-of-payments-based data on net foreign investment. The latter, which is equivalent to the current account balance, comprises three components: current transfers, net factor income, and the resource balance. The mixing of data source, which is dictated by availability, implies that the
estimates for national saving that are derived incorporate the statistical discrepancies. Furthermore, error omissions and asymmetries in balance of payments statistics affect the
estimates for net lending; at the global level, net lending, which in theory would be zero, equals the world current account discrepancy. Notwithstanding these statistical shortcomings, flow of funds estimates, such as those presented in these tables, provide a useful framework for analyzing development in saving and investment, both over time and
across regions and countries.
1Calculated from the data of individual euro area countries.
2Mongolia, which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.
