The State of

2008

High food prices
and food security –
threats and opportunities

About this report

he State of Food Insecurity in
the World 2008 represents
FAO’s ninth progress report on
world hunger since the 1996 World
Food Summit (WFS). In previous
editions, FAO has expressed deep
concern over the lack of progress in
reducing the number of hungry
people in the world, which has
remained persistently high.
This year’s report focuses on
high food prices, which are having a

T

serious impact on the poorest
populations in the world,
drastically reducing their already
low purchasing power. High
food prices have increased
levels of food deprivation, while
placing tremendous pressure on
achieving internationally
agreed goals on hunger by 2015.
This report also examines
how high food prices present
an opportunity to relaunch

smallholder agriculture in the
developing world.
As discussed in the report,
FAO’s undernourishment
estimates for the period 1990–92
to 2003–05 have been revised on
the basis of new standards for
human energy requirements
established by the United Nations
(UN) and 2006 revisions of UN
population data.

World hunger is increasing. The World Food Summit (WFS)
goal of halving the number of undernourished people in the
world by 2015 is becoming more difficult to reach for many
countries. FAO’s most recent estimates put the number of
hungry people at 923 million in 2007, an increase of more
than 80 million since the 1990–92 base period. Long-term
estimates (available up to 2003–05) show that some
countries were well on track towards reaching the WFS and
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets before the
period of high food prices; however, even these countries
may have suffered setbacks.
High food prices share much of the blame. The most rapid
increase in chronic hunger experienced in recent years
occurred between 2003–05 and 2007. FAO’s provisional
estimates show that, in 2007, 75 million more people were
added to the total number of undernourished relative to
2003–05. While several factors are responsible, high food
prices are driving millions of people into food insecurity,
worsening conditions for many who were already
food-insecure, and threatening long-term global food
security.
The poorest, landless and female-headed households
are the hardest hit. The vast majority of urban and rural
households in the developing world rely on food
purchases for most of their food and stand to lose from
high food prices. High food prices reduce real income and
worsen the prevalence of food insecurity and malnutrition
among the poor by reducing the quantity and quality of
food consumed.

Initial governmental policy responses have had limited
effect. To contain the negative effects of high food prices,
governments have introduced various measures, such as
price controls and export restrictions. While
understandable from an immediate social welfare
perspective, many of these actions have been ad hoc and
are likely to be ineffective and unsustainable. Some have
had damaging effects on world price levels and stability.

5

High food prices are also an opportunity. In the long run,
high food prices represent an opportunity for agriculture
(including smallholder farmers) throughout the developing
world, but they will have to be accompanied by the provision
of essential public goods. Smallholder gains could fuel
broader economic and rural development. Farming
households can see immediate gains; other rural
households may benefit in the longer run if higher prices
turn into opportunities for increasing output and creating
employment.

6

A comprehensive twin-track approach is required.
Governments, donors, the United Nations, nongovernmental organizations, civil society and the private
sector must immediately combine their efforts in a
strategic, twin-track approach to address the impact of high
food prices on hunger. This should include: (i) measures to
enable the agriculture sector, especially smallholders in
developing countries, to respond to the high prices; and (ii)
carefully targeted safety nets and social protection
programmes for the most food-insecure and vulnerable.
This is a global challenge requiring a global response.

oaring food prices have
triggered worldwide concern
about threats to global food
security, shaking the unjustified
complacency created by many years
of low commodity prices. From 3 to
5 June 2008, representatives of 180
countries plus the European Union,
including many Heads of State and
Government, met in Rome to express
their conviction “that the
international community needs to
take urgent and coordinated action to
combat the negative impacts of
soaring food prices on the world’s
most vulnerable countries and
populations”. At the G8 Summit in
Japan in July 2008, the leaders of the
world’s most industrialized nations
voiced their deep concern “that the
steep rise in global food prices,
coupled with availability problems in
a number of developing countries, is
threatening global food security”.

Summit and Millennium Summit
hunger reduction targets is
measured. Early gains in hunger
reduction achieved in a number of
developing regions by the mid-1990s
have not been sustained. Hunger has
increased as the world has grown
richer and produced more food than
ever in the last decade. As this report
has pointed out many times, this
disappointing outcome reflects the
lack of concerted action to combat
hunger despite global commitments.
Soaring food prices have reversed
some of the gains and successes in
hunger reduction, making the
mission of achieving the
internationally agreed goals on
hunger reduction more difficult. The
task of reducing the number of
hungry people by 500 million in the
remaining seven years to 2015 will
require an enormous and resolute
global effort and concrete actions.

signal the desperation caused by
soaring food and fuel prices for
millions of poor and also middleclass households. Analysis in this
report shows that high food prices
have a particularly devastating effect
on the poorest in both urban and
rural areas, the landless and femaleheaded households. Unless urgent
measures are taken, high food prices
may have detrimental long-term
effects on human development as
households, in their effort to deal
with rising food bills, either reduce
the quantity and quality of food
consumed, cut expenditure on health
and education or sell productive
assets. Children, pregnant women
and lactating mothers are at highest
risk. Past experience with high food
prices fully justifies such fears.

Moving away from
hunger reduction goals

Poorest and most vulnerable
worst hit

The concerns of the international
community are well founded. For the
first time since FAO started
monitoring undernourishment
trends, the number of chronically
hungry people is higher in the most
recent period relative to the base
period. FAO estimates that, mainly as
a result of high food prices, the
number of chronically hungry people
in the world rose by 75 million in
2007 to reach 923 million.
The devastating effects of high
food prices on the number of hungry
people compound already worrisome
long-term trends. Our analysis
shows that in 2003–05, before the
recent rise in food prices, there were
6 million more chronically hungry
people in the world than in 1990–92,
the baseline period against which
progress towards the World Food

Food price increases have
exacerbated the situation for many
countries already in need of
emergency interventions and food
assistance due to other factors such
as severe weather and conflict.
Countries already afflicted by
emergencies have to deal with the
added burden of high food prices on
food security, while others become
more vulnerable to food insecurity
because of high prices. Developing
countries, especially the poorest,
face difficult choices between
maintaining macroeconomic stability
and putting in place policies and
programmes to deal with the
negative impact of high food and fuel
prices on their people.
Riots and civil disturbances, which
have taken place in many low- and
middle-income developing countries,

The food crisis brought about by
soaring food prices in many
developing countries needs an
urgent and concrete response. At the
same time, it should be recognized
that high food prices are the result of
a delicate balance between food
supply and demand. These two facts
show that, more than ever before,
the twin-track approach to hunger
reduction advocated by FAO and its
development partners is key to
addressing not only the threats to
food security caused by high food
prices but also the opportunities that
arise. In the immediate term,
carefully targeted safety nets and
social protection programmes are
urgently required in order to ensure
that everyone is able to access the
food they need for a healthy life. In
parallel, the focus should be on
helping producers, especially smallscale farmers, to boost food
production, mainly by facilitating

A strategic response:
the twin-track approach

their access to seeds, fertilizers,
animal feed and other inputs. This
should improve food supplies and
lower prices in local markets.
In the medium-to-long term, the
focus should be on strengthening the
agriculture sectors of developing
countries to enable them to respond
to growth in demand. Expanding food
production in poor countries through
enhanced productivity must
constitute the cornerstone of
policies, strategies and programmes
seeking to attain a sustainable
solution for food security. High food
prices and the incentives they
provide can be harnessed to
relaunch agriculture in the
developing world. This is essential
not only to face the current crisis,
but also to respond to the increasing
demand for food, feed and biofuel
production and to prevent the
recurrence of such crises in the
future.
Relaunching agriculture in
developing countries is also critical
for the achievement of meaningful
results in poverty and hunger
reduction and to reverse the current
worrisome trends. This will entail
empowering large numbers of
small-scale farmers worldwide to
expand agricultural output. Turning
agricultural growth into an engine
for poverty reduction means
addressing the structural constraints
facing agriculture, particularly for
the millions of smallholder
producers in agriculture-based
economies. This calls for expanded
public investment in rural
infrastructure and essential
services – in roads, irrigation
facilities, water harvesting, storage,
slaughterhouses, fishing ports and
credit, as well as electricity, schools
and health services – in order to
create favourable conditions for
private investment in rural areas.

At the same time, increased
resources must be devoted to more
sustainable technologies that
support more-intensive agriculture
and that assist farmers to increase
the resilience of their food
production systems and to cope with
climate change.
A coherent and coordinated strategy
is vital
Many developing countries have
taken unilateral action in efforts to
contain the negative effects of
high food prices, including the
imposition of price controls and
export restrictions. Such responses
may not be sustainable and would
actually contribute to further rises in
world price levels and instability.
To face threats and exploit
opportunities posed by high food
prices effectively and efficiently,
strategies must be based on a
comprehensive and coordinated
multilateral response.
Urgent, broad-based and largescale investments are needed in
order to address in a sustainable
manner the growing food-insecurity
problems affecting the poor and
hungry. No single country or
institution will be able to resolve this
crisis on its own. Governments of
developing and developed countries,

donors, United Nations agencies,
international institutions, civil society
and the private sector all have
important roles to play in the global
fight against hunger.
It is vital that the international
community share a common vision of
how best to assist governments in
eradicating chronic hunger, and that
all parties work together to translate
this vision into reality on the scale
required. The situation cannot wait
any longer.
The resolve of world leaders at the
June 2008 Summit on World Food
Security in Rome and the fact that
the G8 Summit placed concerns
surrounding high food and fuel
prices at the top of its agenda
demonstrates a growing political will
to address hunger. Moreover,
substantial commitments have been
made for increased financial support
to developing countries to address
the food security threats caused by
high food prices. Nevertheless,
unless this political will and donor
pledges are turned into urgent and
real actions, millions more will fall
into deep poverty and chronic
hunger.
The need for concerted action to
combat hunger and malnutrition has
never been stronger. I am hopeful
that the global community will rise to
the challenge.

Undernourishment around the world
High food prices: another 75 million hungry

H

igher food prices have
triggered an increase in
hunger worldwide. Provisional
FAO estimates show that the number
of chronically hungry people in 2007
increased by 75 million over and
above FAO’s estimate of 848 million
undernourished in 2003–05, with
much of the increase attributed to
high food prices (details in Table 1,
page 48). This brought the number
of undernourished worldwide to
923 million in 2007. Given the
continued and drastic price rises in
staple cereals and oil crops well into
the first quarter of 2008, the number
of people suffering from chronic
hunger is likely to have increased
further.
At 923 million people, the number
of undernourished in 2007 was more
than 80 million higher than in
1990–92, the base period for the
World Food Summit (WFS) hunger
reduction target. This makes the task
of bringing the number of
undernourished to 420 million by
2015 more difficult, especially in an
environment of high food prices and
uncertain global economic
prospects.
The impact of rising food prices on
the proportion of undernourished
people (the Millennium Development
Goal [MDG] 1 hunger indicator) is
worrisome. Good progress in
reducing the share of hungry people
in the developing world had been
achieved – down from almost
20 percent in 1990–92 to less than
18 percent in 1995–97 and just above
16 percent in 2003–05. The estimates
show that rising food prices have
thrown that progress into reverse,
with the proportion of
undernourished people worldwide
moving back towards 17 percent.
Hence, amid soaring food prices,
progress towards achieving
internationally agreed hunger

serious setback in terms of both the
number of undernourished and the
prevalence of hunger.
The estimated impact of high food
prices on the global estimates of

undernourishment is confirmed by
an analysis of household-level data
(pages 22–27). The analysis confirms
a negative impact of soaring food
prices, especially on the poor and
most vulnerable.

Price surge halts
progress
At the regional level, the largest
increases in the number of
undernourished people in 2007
occurred in Asia and the Pacific
and in sub-Saharan Africa, the
two regions that together
accounted for 750 million
(89 percent) of the hungry people
in the world in 2003–05. FAO
estimates that rising prices have
plunged an additional 41 million
people in Asia and the Pacific and
24 million in sub-Saharan Africa
into hunger.
Together, Africa and Asia account
for more than three-quarters of the
developing world’s low-income
food-deficit countries (LIFDCs).
Africa is also home to 15 of the
16 countries where the prevalence
of hunger already exceeded
35 percent, making them
particularly vulnerable to higher
food prices.
While the numbers affected are
smaller, Latin America and the

How FAO estimated the impact on undernourishment
The most recent complete estimates
of undernourishment at the country
level are those for the three-year
period 2003–05. These provide the basis
for FAO’s regular monitoring and
analysis on progress towards hunger
reduction targets, and they are
presented in the section “Taking stock of
world hunger”.
Responding to growing concerns
about the implications of soaring food
prices for world food security, FAO
developed a methodology to estimate the
impact of high food prices on
undernourishment in 2007, based on
partial data for 2006–08. Trends in
dietary energy supply derived from
two different databases maintained by
FAO were used, namely: (i) detailed
“supply utilization accounts” from FAO’s
core database (FAOSTAT) covering
hundreds of commodities per country;
and (ii) more recent data covering
cereals, oils and meats available for

human consumption (accounting for
about 80 percent of dietary energy
supply). Combining the two was
necessary as FAO’s core database
includes complete data only up to 2005;
the second database, while less
complete, includes estimates up to 2008,
hence capturing much of the period in
which food prices were rising rapidly.
A relationship between the historical
data contained in the two databases was
established in order to extrapolate the
core database to 2007.
The 2007 estimates capturing the
impact of food prices on hunger were
generated at the global and regional
levels only, and are not available at the
country level. As such, and given the way
the 2007 data were computed, the
estimates should be considered
provisional.

worldwide in 2007 validate concerns
about a global food security crisis
following high food prices, at least in
the short term.

Are FAO estimates conservative?
The box on page 7 describes how FAO produced estimates on world
hunger for 2007. Partly as a result of the updated parameters, the
calculation of the number of undernourished is based on the
assumption that the distribution of dietary energy intake within a
country or region remained unchanged between periods of “low”
and “high” food prices. On the other hand, the household-level
analysis (pages 22–27) shows that, as a result of higher food prices,
the poor are proportionately worse off than the rich in the short run.
In-depth analysis of eight countries has shown that the
distribution of per person dietary energy supply among
households deteriorates following drastic increases in food
prices. Thus, FAO’s estimate of the global impact of high food
prices on hunger may well be an underestimate. Therefore, it can
safely be stated that high food prices have resulted in at least a
further 75 million hungry people – people being deprived of access
to sufficient food on a daily basis.

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008

Using a different methodology, the United States Department
of Agriculture (USDA) estimates that the impact of high food
prices has resulted in an increase in the number of
undernourished of 133 million people in 70 countries analysed.1
A key distinction between the two approaches for estimating
hunger relates to the way in which inequality in the distribution
of food available for human consumption is calculated.
Compared with FAO, USDA uses a higher (and constant)
cut-off point for determining the hunger threshold. It uses a
value of 2 100 kilocalories per person per day while FAO values
depend on the age and gender distribution in each country,
typically ranging from as low as 1 600 to 2 000 kilocalories per
person per day.

Driving forces of high food prices

A

s agricultural commodity
prices rose sharply in 2006
and 2007 and continued to rise
even further in early 2008, the forces
behind soaring food prices were
examined from various perspectives
in an effort to design response
options. This section lists some of
the main drivers behind soaring food
prices.1 Medium-term projections
indicate that, while food prices
should stabilize in 2008–09 and
subsequently fall, they will remain
above their pre-2004 trend level for
the foreseeable future.2
The FAO index of nominal food
prices doubled between 2002 and
2008. In real terms, the increase was
less pronounced but still dramatic.
The real food price index began
rising in 2002, after four decades of
predominantly declining trends, and
spiked sharply upwards in 2006 and
2007. By mid-2008, real food prices
were 64 percent above their 2002
levels. The only other period of
significantly rising real food prices
since this data series began
occurred in the early 1970s in the
wake of the first international oil
crisis.
Be they policy measures,
investment decisions or emergency
interventions, appropriate actions to
address the human and economic
impacts of soaring food prices
require a thorough understanding of
the underlying driving forces.
These driving forces are many and
complex, and they include both
supply-side and demand-side
factors. Long-term structural trends
underlying growth in demand for
food have coincided with short-term
cyclical or temporary factors
adversely affecting food supply,
thus resulting in a situation where
growth in demand for food
commodities continues to outstrip
growth in their supply.

Several of the world’s major cereal

One result has been significantly

Undernourishment around the world

Food prices: from world to domestic markets
Analysis of country data suggests an
incomplete transmission of world prices
denominated in US dollars to domestic
prices (expressed in local currency). Even
before the price hikes of 2008, world
cereal prices had risen substantially
between 2002 and 2007. In this period,
world market prices for rice, wheat and
maize increased by 50, 49 and 43 percent,
respectively, in real US dollar terms.
However, the transmission to domestic
prices was usually less than complete,
with prices in local currency terms not
rising as much as the international
market prices – as was the case with rice
in various Asian countries.
Several factors contributed to this
dampening of the transmission of world
to domestic prices. The US dollar has
been depreciating for several years
against a range of currencies, including
those of many developing countries.
From 2002 to 2007, low-income countries

experienced an average real appreciation
of 20 percent against the US dollar
(compared with 18 percent for highincome countries). Exchange rate
appreciation nullified some of the
increase in world market prices
(expressed in US dollars) for both food
importers and exporters into 2007. Some
trade policy and other commodityspecific measures further limited price
transmission.
While domestic policies and exchange
rate movements mitigated the impact of
world price increases for some time,
domestic prices eventually increased
substantially in many countries in late
2007 and early 2008.

in three decades. Lower stock levels
contribute to higher price volatility in
world markets because of
uncertainties about the adequacy of
supplies in times of production
shortfalls.
Production shortfalls. Extreme
weather events in 2005–07, including
drought and floods, affected major
cereal-producing countries. World
cereal production fell by 3.6 percent
in 2005 and 6.9 percent in 2006
before recovering in 2007. Two
successive years of lower crop yields
in a context of already low stock
levels resulted in a worrisome supply
situation in world markets. Growing
concern over the potential effect of
climate change on future
availabilities of food supplies
aggravated these fears.
Petroleum prices. Until mid-2008,
the increase in energy prices had
been very rapid and steep, with one
major commodity price index (the
Reuters-CRB Energy Index) more
than tripling since 2003. Petroleum
and food prices are highly correlated.
The rapid rise in petroleum prices
exerted upward pressure on food
prices as fertilizer prices nearly
tripled and transport costs doubled
in 2006–08. High fertilizer prices
have direct adverse effects on the
cost of production and fertilizer use
by producers, especially small-scale
farmers.

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008

Biofuel demand. The emerging
biofuel market is a significant
source of demand for some
agricultural commodities, such as
sugar, maize, cassava, oilseeds
and palm oil. The stronger demand
for these commodities caused a
surge in their prices in world

markets, which in turn has led to
higher food prices. While biofuel
production and consumption is
supported by government policies in
a number of countries, rapid
increases in crude oil prices have
further contributed to growing
demand for agricultural
commodities for biofuel feedstock.
Biofuel production will utilize an
estimated 100 million tonnes of
cereals (4.7 percent of global cereal
production) in 2007–08.
Consumption patterns. The first
decade of this century has seen rapid
and sustained economic growth and
increased urbanization in a number
of developing countries, most
remarkably in large emerging
economies such as China and India.
These two countries alone account
for more than 40 percent of the
world’s population. As the
purchasing power of hundreds of
millions of people has increased, so
has their overall demand for food.
This new wealth has also led to
changes in diet, especially to greater
consumption of meat and dairy
products, which are heavily
dependent on cereal inputs.
However, the recent high
commodity prices do not appear to
have originated in these emerging
markets. Cereal imports by China
and India have declined from an
average of about 14 million tonnes in
the early 1980s to roughly
6 million tonnes in the past three
years, suggesting that changes in
consumption patterns have largely
been met through domestic
production. While continued strong
economic development in China and
India may increasingly affect food
prices, this has not yet been an
exceptional factor.

Other factors
Trade policies. In an attempt to
minimize the impacts of higher food
prices on vulnerable population
groups within countries, a number of
governments and private-sector
actors have taken measures that
have at times exacerbated the effects
of the above-mentioned underlying
trends on food prices in international
markets. The adoption of export
restrictions and bans by some
countries has reduced global
supply, aggravated shortages and
eroded trust among trading
partners. In some countries, such
actions have also reduced farmers’
incentives to respond to higher
international prices. Speculative
re-stocking or pre-stocking by large
importers with relatively strong cash
positions has also contributed to
higher prices.
Financial markets. The recent
turmoil in traditional asset markets
has had an impact on food prices, as
new types of investors have become
involved in derivates markets based
on agricultural commodities in the
hope of achieving better returns than
those available on traditional assets.
Global trading activity in futures and
options combined has more than
doubled in the last five years. In the
first nine months of 2007, it grew by
30 percent over the previous year.
This high level of speculative
activity in agricultural commodity
markets has led some analysts to
indicate increased speculation as a
significant factor in soaring food
prices. However, it is not clear
whether speculation is driving prices
higher or whether this behaviour is
the result of prices that are rising in
any case. Either way, large inflows of
funds could partly account for the
persistence of high food prices and

their increased volatility. Further
research is needed. The role of
financial investors in influencing food
prices and whether there is a need
for appropriate regulations to limit
the impact of speculative bubbles on
food prices are increasingly issues of
concern.
Will high prices persist?
Cereal production has recovered,
increasing by 4.7 percent in 2007 and
a projected 2.8 percent in 2008.
However, although food prices may
fall from current high levels as some
of the short-term factors behind the
high prices subside, real prices of
food commodities for the next
decade are expected to remain above
those of the previous ten years.
Three main assumptions underlie
this expectation. First, economic
growth in the developing world,
particularly in large emerging
economies, is expected to continue
at about 6 percent per year, further
raising the purchasing power and
changing the dietary preferences of
hundreds of millions of consumers.
Second, biofuel demand is likely to
continue its rapid growth, partly
driven by high oil prices and
government policies and partly by
slow developments in widespread
adoption of second-generation
biofuels and technologies. According
to the International Energy Agency,
the share of the world’s arable land
devoted to growing biomass for
liquid biofuels could triple in the next
20 years.3 Third, in addition to land
and water constraints, increasing
costs of production, including higher
fertilizer prices and rising
transportation costs resulting from
high petroleum prices, are likely to
affect food production adversely,
compounding the challenge of
meeting global food demand.4

Undernourishment around the world
Taking stock of world hunger: revised estimates

Global overview

with large populations would
obviously have an important impact
on the overall reduction of hunger in
the world. Among these, China
has made significant progress in
reducing undernourishment
following years of rapid economic
growth.
The proportion of people who
suffer from hunger in the total
population remains highest in subSaharan Africa, where one in three
people is chronically hungry. Latin
America and the Caribbean were
continuing to make good progress in
hunger reduction before the
dramatic increase in food prices;
together with East Asia and the Near
East and North Africa, these regions
maintain some of the lowest levels of
undernourishment in the developing
world (Table 1, page 48).

F

AO’s long-term estimates of
undernourishment at the
regional and country levels for
the period from 1990–92 to 2003–05
(using the FAOSTAT database)
confirm insufficient progress
towards the WFS and MDG hunger
reduction targets even before the
negative impact of soaring food
prices. Worldwide, 848 million people
suffered from chronic hunger in
2003–05, the most recent period for
which individual country data are
available. This number is slightly
higher than the 842 million people
who were undernourished in
1990–92, the WFS and MDG baseline
period.
The vast majority of the world’s
undernourished people live in
developing countries, which were
home to 832 million chronically
hungry people in 2003–05. Of these
people, 65 percent live in only seven
countries: India, China, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and
Ethiopia. Progress in these countries

sub-Saharan Africa did achieve some
progress in reducing the proportion
of people suffering from chronic
hunger (down from 34 to 30 percent).
Most of the increase in the
number of hungry people in subSaharan Africa occurred in a single

product (GDP) has grown steadily. A
recent World Bank study found that
more than twice as many Ghanaians
are moving back into agriculture as
are leaving it.
In the 14 African countries on
track to reach the MDG target of
reducing the prevalence of hunger by
half by 2015, the agriculture sector
has achieved steady and relatively
rapid growth, characterized by gains
in agricultural value added, food
production, cereal production and
cereal yields. This is in marked
contrast to the 14 African countries
that either have failed to reduce the
prevalence of undernourishment or
have seen it increase since 1990–92.
In these countries, food production
has fallen sharply, while agricultural
value added has edged up at less
than one-quarter of the rate
achieved by the more successful
group. Importantly, countries that
have scored successes include
several that emerged from decades
of civil war and conflict, offering
striking evidence of the importance
of peace and political stability for
hunger reduction.

Compared with estimates presented in
the 2006 edition of this report, data for
both the 1990–92 baseline and
subsequent periods have been revised
on the basis of the most recent
standards for human energy
requirements and of new United Nations
population statistics incorporated into
FAO’s undernourishment estimates. The
Technical Annex presents the overall
impact of the changes in these key
parameters, and how they have

the Congo. Fuelled by widespread
and persistent conflict, the number
of its chronically hungry shot up from
11 million to 43 million and the
proportion of undernourished rose
from 29 to 76 percent. The number of
undernourished has risen in another
25 countries in the region since
1990–92, presenting it with a major
challenge in moving more rapidly
towards the WFS and MDG hunger
reduction targets.
At the same time, several of the
countries that have achieved the
steepest reductions in the proportion
of undernourished are also located
in sub-Saharan Africa. They include
Ghana, the Congo, Nigeria,
Mozambique and Malawi, with Ghana
being the only country to have
reached both the WFS and MDG
targets. Key to Ghana’s success has
been robust growth, both in the
economy at large and in the
agriculture sector in particular.

Countries in the Near East and North
Africa region generally experience the
lowest levels of undernourishment in
the developing world. However, for
the Near East as a whole, conflict

has had an important impact, with
the total number of undernourished
people nearly doubling from
15 million in 1990–92 to 28 million in
2003–05. This has largely been due
to conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq,
where the numbers of
undernourished people have
increased by 4.9 and 4.1 million,
respectively. The number of
undernourished has also increased
in Yemen, where one in three
(6.5 million people) suffers from
chronic hunger.
For North Africa, FAO estimates
that about 3 percent of the overall
population were still chronically
hungry in 2003–05 (4.6 million people
as against slightly more than
4 million in 1990–92). While the
prevalence of undernourishment is
generally low, the entire Near East
and North Africa region would have
to reduce the number of chronically
hungry people from the 33 million in
2003–05 to fewer than 10 million by
2015 for the WFS target to be
reached.
Asia and the Pacific
Like other regions in the world,
the Asia and Pacific region shows
a mixed picture of success stories
and setbacks in hunger reduction.
Asia has recorded modest progress
in reducing the prevalence of
hunger (from 20 to 16 percent) and
a moderate reduction in the number
of hungry people (from 582 million
to 542 million people). However,
with a very large population and
relatively slow progress in hunger
reduction, nearly two-thirds of the
world’s hungry people still live in
Asia. Among the subregions, South
Asia and Central Asia have suffered
setbacks in hunger reduction after
achieving initial progress in some
countries with large populations

has stalled since about 1995–97. The
high proportion of undernourished in
India in the base period (24 percent)
combined with a high population
growth rate means that India has
had a challenging task in reducing
the number of undernourished
(Table 1, page 48).
The increase in the number of
undernourished in India can be
traced to a slowing in the growth
(even a slight decline) in per capita
dietary energy supply for human
consumption since 1995–97. On the
demand side, life expectancy in India
has increased from 59 to 63 years
since 1990–92. This has had an
important impact on the overall
change in population structure, with
the result that in 2003–05 the growth
in minimum dietary energy
requirements had outpaced that of
dietary energy supply.
The combination of the declining
per capita growth rate in total dietary
energy supply and higher per capita
dietary energy requirements resulted
in an estimated 24 million more
undernourished people in India in
2003–05 compared with the base
period. The increased food needs of

the ageing population amount to
about 6.5 million tonnes per year in
cereal equivalent. Nevertheless,
the prevalence of hunger in India
decreased from 24 percent in
1990–92 to 21 percent in 2003–05,
marking progress towards meeting
the MDG hunger reduction target.
Progress and setbacks
by country
With the number of chronically
hungry people in the world in
2003–05 at about the same level as
in 1990–92 and rising steeply with
soaring food prices, the WFS target
of halving that number by 2015 has
become much more challenging.
Barely one-third of the developing
countries included in FAO’s
estimates have succeeded in
reducing the number of
undernourished people at all since
1990–92. Of those, only 25 were on
track in 2003–05, before the onset of
high food prices, to achieve the WFS
target. The challenge will be all the
greater if high food prices persist,
placing an even larger burden on
fighting hunger.

Key monitoring ratios
Both the WFS and the MDG targets
aim to “halve hunger” by 2015. The
1996 World Food Summit called for
the number of hungry people to be
reduced by 50 percent by 2015, while
under MDG 1, countries have
committed themselves to “halve,
between 1990 and 2015, the
proportion of people who suffer from
hunger”. To measure progress or
setbacks in terms of achieving these
targets, FAO calculates a simple set
of ratios for each country, dividing
the estimate of the most recent
number or proportion of hungry
people by the corresponding figure in
the base period 1990–92. A value of
0.5 (one-half) means that the target
of “halving hunger” has been
reached. A value lower than 1.0
means that progress has been
achieved, while a value higher than
1.0 implies a setback. Figure 15
presents the values for the WFS and
the MDG hunger reduction targets
separately for each country (data
listed in Table 1 on page 48).

Undernourishment around the world
Hotspots and emergencies

T

he above analysis of long-term
trends in undernourishment
highlights the marked
prevalence of chronic hunger in
countries that have experienced food
crises over several consecutive
years. Food crises can emerge at any
time and anywhere in the world as a
consequence of severe adverse
weather conditions, natural
disasters, economic shocks, conflicts
or a combination of these factors. In
support of timely action to mitigate
– and with the desire to prevent –
a further deterioration in the food
security situation of affected
countries, the FAO Global
Information and Early Warning
System (GIEWS) continuously

monitors the situation on all
continents and maintains a list of
countries that are in crisis. Many
such countries remain on the GIEWS
list for a long time, or appear
frequently, and are regarded as
having “hunger hotspots” – areas
where a significant proportion of
people are severely affected by
persistent or recurring hunger and
malnutrition. Figure 17 shows a map
of countries in crisis that require
external assistance (33 countries as
of August 2008).
A retrospective analysis of the
nature and underlying causes of past
and ongoing food crises is crucial to
the framing of appropriate
emergency interventions and policy

measures to address hunger
hotspots. This analysis provides a
basis for assessing the impact of
the sharp rise in agricultural
commodity, food and fuel prices on
countries already in crisis (and on
many others highly vulnerable to
these price shocks). Given the
uncertain impact of soaring food
and fuel prices on countries,
households and individuals around
the world, the distinction between
countries already “in crisis” and
others “at risk” has become much
less clear, and this presents a
series of challenges for monitoring
and for timely and appropriate
early warning of impending food
crises.

Trends in crises
In 2007, a record number of
countries (47) faced food crises
requiring emergency assistance,
with 27 of these countries in Africa,
10 in Asia and the remaining 10 in
other parts of the world. In the
period 1993–2000, an average of
15 African countries faced food
crises annually; that number has
climbed to about 25 countries since
2001. Having faced severe food
insecurity in one season, many
countries remain on the list for
several years owing to the lingering
effects of drought and/or conflict and
low resilience. Others appear on the
list more sporadically and need
careful monitoring.
As the number of countries facing
food crises has risen in the past two
decades, the underlying causes have
become more complex. In many
cases, human-induced disasters

have compounded natural ones,
ushering in complex and long-lasting
crises. In other instances, humaninduced crises have been aggravated
by a natural disaster. Natural
disasters were the primary cause of
food insecurity until the early 1990s,
with human-induced crises
becoming more prominent in the
past decade.
Natural disasters. Natural
disasters can be classified as either
“slow onset” (e.g. drought or
prolonged dry spells) or “sudden
onset” (e.g. floods, cyclones,
hurricanes, earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions). While the
proportion of natural disasters has
generally decreased over time,
FAO/GIEWS data indicate that
sudden-onset disasters – especially
floods – have increased from
14 percent of all natural disasters in
the 1980s to 20 percent in the

1990s and 27 percent since 2000.
Worldwide, flood occurrence has
risen from about 50 floods per year
in the mid-1980s to more than
200 today.5 Conversely, there has
been a decrease in food emergencies
caused by slow-onset natural
disasters. As sudden-onset
emergencies leave much less time
for planning and response than
slow-onset ones, these trends have
important implications for mitigation
measures and the mobilization of
resources needed to prepare for, and
respond to, emergencies in order to
save lives and protect livelihood
systems.

Undernourishment around the world

Socio-economic factors. Humaninduced crises can be divided into
war or conflict-related ones and
disasters induced mostly by socioeconomic shocks. The latter can in
turn stem from internal factors (such
as poor economic or social policies,
conflicts over landownership or a
deteriorating public health situation)
or from external factors. External
factors may include a collapse in a
country’s export commodity prices
resulting in a loss of export earnings
or a sharp increase in the price of
imported food commodities (as in the
last two years). The relative share of
food crises caused by socioeconomic factors has risen in the
past three decades from about
2 percent in the 1980s to 11 percent
in the 1990s and 27 percent since
2000. Although the relative share of
countries with food crises caused by
war and conflicts has declined, the
absolute number of such crises has
risen in the same period, with huge
loss of life, destruction of assets and
displacement of populations.

20

US$121 billion in 2007, a 40-percent
increase. The percentage rise for the
basic grains component of their food
imports is even greater – 50 percent.
By the end of 2008, the food import
bills of LIFDCs could cost four times
as much as in 2000, representing a
tremendous burden on these
countries.
While LIFDCs as a group are
spending considerably more for
basic imported foods, there are large
differences among countries and
population groups. These differences
depend on many factors, including:
the degree of dependency on
imports; food consumption patterns;
the degree of urbanization; the
extent to which international prices
have influenced domestic consumer
and producer prices for basic
commodities (degree of price
transmission); real exchange-rate
movements; and the effectiveness of
policy measures taken by
governments to deal with the crisis.

New dimensions of
vulnerability

Informal cross-border flows

High food prices have affected
countries in various ways, but their
impact has been felt more severely
in countries with a structural deficit
in food production, where incomes
are low, and where most households
spend a high proportion of their
limited budgets on food. Many of
these countries already have high
rates of undernourishment. Most
actually fall within a typology
developed by FAO in the 1970s
(following a previous global food
crisis) known as low-income fooddeficit countries, or LIFDCs.6 In 2008,
a total of 82 LIFDCs are expected
to spend nearly US$169 billion on
food imports compared with

Pakistan provides an illustration of the
complexity of commodity price dynamics
at the national and regional levels.
The country is a relatively large regional
producer and consumer of wheat,
usually in a surplus situation. Wheat
production in 2008 is down just over
6 percent from last year’s record level,
but wheat imports are expected to be
between 2.5 and 3 million tonnes.
Despite the government’s strong
intervention in the domestic wheat
sector, prices have increased sharply
since mid-2007. Indeed, by June 2008,
they had nearly doubled their levels of a
year earlier in deficit provinces. In this
case, a major factor is that wheat prices

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008

For example, if one considers the
nations that import most of their
petroleum products and foodgrain
requirements and also have high
rates of undernourishment, these
would include Eritrea, Haiti, Liberia,
the Niger, Sierra Leone and
Tajikistan.7 Most are in sub-Saharan
Africa and many are already on the
GIEWS list of countries in crisis.
Investment implications
Donor countries and development
agencies are particularly concerned
with the need to prioritize emergency
assistance and investment decisions
in the context of the current global
food crisis, and they are calling for
lists of countries that are at risk.
FAO has recently completed an
analysis of key factors determining
the degree to which countries are
vulnerable to high food prices, taking
into account the extent to which they
are net importers of energy products

in Pakistan are still much lower than in
neighbouring countries, particularly
Afghanistan (which has been struggling
with a combination of unfavourable
weather and insecurity). The large price
differentials between the two countries
have resulted in substantial informal
cross-border flows and in Pakistan
importing wheat from international
markets. At the same time, a reduced
capacity to subsidize fertilizer has
resulted in a 60-percent increase in
di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer
prices at the producer level, which has
led to a sharp drop in its use and affected
yields adversely.

and of cereals (weighted by the
proportion of cereals in dietary
energy intake), relative levels of
poverty and the prevalence of
undernourishment. Results indicate
that, in addition to countries already
in crisis and requiring external
assistance (some of which are listed
on the left in the table), many others
have been severely affected by high
commodity prices, in particular of
basic energy and food products.
These include countries listed on the
right in the table.8
Importantly, some countries not
featuring on a list today may still fall
into a food security crisis tomorrow,
possibly owing to a sudden natural
disaster, an outbreak of civil unrest,
a financial crisis or a combination of
factors. Bangladesh is one such
example; the country still features in
the GIEWS list of countries
experiencing “severe localized food
insecurity” following past flooding
and the impact of cyclone Sydr in

late 2007, but with a clear indication
that the food security situation is
improving. Bangladesh also
features on the list of countries
severely affected by high food
prices, which calls for continued
close monitoring of the situation. In
other instances, food price
increases in a given country are
strongly influenced by the situation
across its borders, as is the case of
wheat prices in Pakistan.
Implications for
early warning

precarious position or worsen the
situation in other countries to the
extent that they become countries in
crisis.
GIEWS monitors food production,
maintains supply and demand
balances at the national level and
produces global aggregates. In
addition, it regularly monitors,
analyses and reports on the world
commodity markets and trade
situation (including food prices) and
provides prospects for the overall
food situation. In order to strengthen
these functions, while also providing
policy advice and technical
assistance to countries in a context
of high food prices, GIEWS has been
reinforcing its data collection and
analysis capacity in three main
areas:
• monitoring international and
domestic commodity/food prices,
including at the subnational level;
• monitoring policy measures taken
by countries in response to high
food prices;
• analysing the impact of high food
prices on urban and rural
households, taking into account
the variables mentioned above.
In keeping its finger on the pulse
of a continuously changing global
food situation and in monitoring the
many risk factors that make
countries vulnerable to a possible
sudden deterioration in their food
security situation, GIEWS helps keep
the world abreast of the latest
developments.

Given such a highly dynamic global
food situation, the GIEWS concept
of “countries in crisis requiring
external assistance” has had to be
revisited. In addition to crises
induced by natural events and
occasional economic shocks, strong
and sustained impacts of high food
prices will put some countries
already in crisis in a more

High food prices and food security
Poor households worst hit

F

AO global estimates show that
high food prices have increased
world hunger. While stories
abound in the media about affected
individuals, families and
communities, it is important to
understand who ultimately gains and
who loses from high food prices,
especially among the poor, and why.
This knowledge will enable

appropriate policies and programmes
to target those most in need.
FAO has examined the impact of
high food prices on household
welfare. The empirical analysis
described in this section shows that,
in the short term, the vast majority of
poor urban and rural households are
hit hardest by higher prices. Among
the poor, it is the landless and

Philippines: rice price increasing poverty
Soaring rice prices are pushing more
families in the Philippines into poverty,
making it more difficult for the country to
achieve MDG 1 (halving the proportion of
people living on less than US$1 per day by
2015). More than 24 percent of Philippine
families were living in extreme poverty in
1991, and while that rate had declined to
13.5 percent in 2003, it has started rising
again.
Inflation rose by nearly 2 percentage
points to 8.3 percent from March to April
2008 and reached 9.6 percent in May, the
highest level since 1999. Joel Saracho,

National Coordinator of the Global Call to
Action against Poverty in Philippines, said
that “income is barely enough for daily
needs yet there is a decrease in
[household] purchasing power”.
Leonardo Zafra, a security guard in
Manila, said that his household’s only
option was to borrow from moneylenders
at exorbitant interest rates: “Our debts
are piling on top of each other”. His wage
of 260 pesos per day (about US$6.50) was
not enough to pay the bills for utilities,
education and food.

female-headed households that are
most vulnerable to sharp rises in
basic food prices. The relative impact
is not uniform, even among poor
households, and depends on a
number of factors.
Particularly important is the
extent to which households produce
food for their own consumption
compared with what they buy in the
marketplace. A household is defined
as a net food buyer when the value of
food staples it produces is less than
the value of food staples it
consumes. Poor households tend to
be net buyers of food, even in rural
areas where agriculture and staple
food production determine the
principal livelihoods for many.
According to FAO data from nine
developing countries, about threequarters of rural households and
97 percent of urban households are
net food buyers (see table).
Net food buyers stand to lose from
an increase in the price of food
staples. The extent of the impact
depends in part on dietary patterns.
Households that spend a large
proportion of their income on
internationally traded food staples
(such as wheat, rice and maize) are
more likely to suffer a decline in
overall welfare. These include most
urban households. The extent of this
decline depends on the ability of a
household to shift consumption
towards less-expensive foods that do
not generally enter global markets,
such as roots and tubers. In contrast,
households with land and those that
derive some income from the
production and sale of food staples
that are also traded internationally
could benefit from higher world
prices. However, high fuel and
fertilizer prices are likely to offset
some of these gains. In the medium
term, most farmers tend to shift
production towards more profitable

crops. This could enable them to
move from being net buyers to net
sellers of staple foods. Their ability
to change depends on the movement
in relative prices as well as their
access to land, resources and

services needed to facilitate change
(see pages 34–40).
FAO has simulated the short-term
impact of a 10-percent increase in
the price of key internationally
traded staple foods on the income of

different types of households in
urban and rural areas (see box for
methodology). It was not possible to
use actual price changes in each
country as local currency prices do
not always reflect world prices in a

Welfare impacts of a price rise in basic staples
Using representative household survey data from a number of
countries, the likely short-term welfare impact of rising food
prices was calculated for groups of households differentiated by
income, landholdings and livelihood strategies. The welfare
impact in this case is the amount of income needed to restore a
household to its position prior to the income shock of high prices,
and therefore the real income lost to high food prices. This is
illustrated in Figures 20–23 as a percentage change in total
consumption expenditure. This estimate is determined by
comparing how the shares of the main staple products in
household consumption and income vary following a 10-percent
increase in the prices of the main staple products. The
methodology employed is similar to that in Deaton1 and in Minot
and Goletti.2
In each country, the main staples were chosen based on their
importance in the share of total food expenditure as follows:
Albania (wheat, maize and rice); Bangladesh (rice, wheat and
pulses); Ghana (maize and rice); Guatemala (maize, wheat and

beans); Malawi and Nicaragua (maize, rice and beans); Pakistan
and Tajikistan (wheat, rice and beans); and Viet Nam (rice, maize
and beans).
The reported results refer to the short-term impact of high
food prices only. Household responses that involve changes in
production and consumption behaviour over time are not
included. Moreover, it is possible that price increases become
more generalized over time in some countries, eventually
affecting staples that are not internationally traded, e.g. cassava.
In this case, the results may be underestimates for those groups
of households that spend substantial shares of their income on
non-tradable staples. Finally, for simplicity, the simulation
assumes that price changes are transmitted equally to different
types of households, be they urban consumers or smallholder
farmers in remote areas.

consistent manner (see box on page
10) and the increases in staple food
prices vary among locations within
countries. Using a uniform
10-percent increase illustrates how
the effects are distributed among
different household groups and
allows more meaningful crosscountry comparisons. Simulating
the higher price increases occurring
in many countries would yield
higher impacts, but the distribution
among household groups would
remain the same.

In terms of the percentage loss in
income, the results show that the
poorest households are hit hardest
by rising food prices in both urban
and rural areas. This is a cause for
concern because the erosion of their
real income harms not only their
current ability to cover basic needs
but also their prospects of escaping
poverty. In order to cope with the
added stress of high food prices,
poor households may be forced to
sell assets that would reduce their
livelihood base, to reduce the

number and/or the diversity of meals
they consume, or to reduce
expenditure on essential non-food
items, such as health care and
education.
Households tend to be less
affected in countries where the diet
consists largely of food staples that
are not internationally traded. For
example, Ghanaian households
appear to be relatively insulated
from swings in international food
markets because a large share of
their diet is based on local staples

such as cassava and sorghum.
Should the price of these local
staples also increase as demand for
them grows, rising food prices would
have a much stronger impact.
The effects of rising food prices
may also vary substantially among
countries that have similar dietary
patterns but differ in terms of land
distribution and productivity levels.
In Bangladesh and Viet Nam, rice is
the major food staple and also the
main food crop grown by small
farmers. Viet Nam has a fairly

egalitarian distribution of land, with
most farmers participating in the
production and sale of rice. With
impressive gains in smallholder
productivity in recent decades, the
country has become one of the
world’s leading rice exporters. In
contrast, most farmers in
Bangladesh have limited access to
land, often only through tenure
arrangements such as
sharecropping. Given the different
land tenure arrangements and, thus,
the importance of agriculture in

household income, high rice prices
have a substantially different impact
on rural welfare in the two countries.
In Viet Nam, even the poorer rural
households gain from rising prices.
In Bangladesh, the impact is largely
negative across income groups, and
it is particularly high for the poorest
and landless households.
Access to key productive assets,
especially land, influences the extent
to which households, even at similar
levels of income, are affected
positively or negatively by higher

High food prices and food security

Can high food prices help the poor?
By their very nature, poor households
seldom produce enough to feed
themselves, let alone produce a surplus
for sale, thus making them net food
buyers. In the short run, high food prices
usually hurt net food buyers, rich or poor;
but the impact can be devastating for the
poorest of the poor. That said, in certain
circumstances, high food prices can help
the poor even in the short run. If the
poorest of the poor are net food sellers,
as is the case for rice in Viet Nam, higher
prices will help reduce poverty (the fact
that Viet Nam exports a large share of its
production also helps). However,
available evidence suggests that this
situation does not occur in many
countries. In general, although there may
be some exceptions, higher food prices
do hurt the poor.
In the medium term, higher food
prices provide an incentive to increase
production. Increased food production
implies higher demand for agricultural
labour and an increase in agricultural
wages. Agricultural wages are an
important source of income for the rural
poor. Wage rises may more than offset

the welfare losses of the poor caused by
higher food prices. However, the speed
and extent of agricultural wage growth is
important. Research suggests that higher
wages eventually did compensate for
higher food prices in Bangladesh in the
1950s and 1960s, but only after a lag of
several years.1 The matter warrants
further research.
Finally, there is strong evidence that
productivity-based agricultural growth,
especially by small producers, has an
overall positive economic impact on rural
areas. Higher agricultural productivity
and incomes translate into increased
demand for non-agricultural goods and
services produced in rural areas. This in
turn leads to higher employment, wages
and rural incomes. The issue, then, is the
extent to which the incentives related to
high food prices translate into production
and productivity increases, and the time
lag before agricultural growth translates
into overall rural development.

food prices. Across the board, high
food prices hit landless households
hardest. Landowners, especially the
wealthier ones, are in a favourable
position to gain from price increases
in internationally traded staple foods.
Household livelihood strategies
are another important factor in
determining the impact of increased
food prices on household welfare.
Agriculture-based households (those

The Horn of Africa:
poor urban population hurt
The urban poor in the Horn of Africa
are the new face of hunger in a region
where up to 14.6 million people now
require humanitarian assistance owing
to poor rains, high food and fuel prices,
conflict, animal disease, inflation and
poverty. According to the World Food
Programme, the situation of the urban
poor has worsened, as they continue
to be adversely affected by rising food
prices. Others have called for
immediate action to prevent hunger
from spiralling out of control in
the region, while emphasizing that
the urban poor are among those at
greatest risk.
As of today, some 20 million people
live in slums across the Horn of Africa,
and they are at the mercy of huge
fluctuations in the price of basic family
foodstuffs that strip their purchasing
power and deplete their savings. Bellatu
Bakane, a 38-year-old mother of three
living in Addis Ababa, can’t help but feel
frustrated: “I get angry because every
time I go [to the market] food prices are
higher” ... “because food prices are
increasing, we are eating less”. Many
Ethiopians are skipping meals and
cutting out "luxuries" such as
vegetables and eggs.

deriving more than 75 percent of
their income from farming) stand to
gain from the price increase, or at
least lose less, depending on the
extent of staple crop production. In
Pakistan and Viet Nam, and even in
Bangladesh, agricultural households
gain substantially from higher food
prices, with benefits accruing even to
some of the poorer households.
More surprisingly perhaps, wealthier
agriculture-based households may
not always gain most from price
increases in staple foods as they may
be producing other commodities
whose prices may not necessarily be
rising, such as high-value or nonfood crops (e.g. tobacco in Malawi),
or livestock.
The welfare impact of a
10-percent rise in staple food prices
also varies by gender. Among urban
households (which are primarily net
buyers of food), female-headed
households suffer a larger
proportional drop in welfare than
male-headed households. The most
important exception found in the
countries analysed is in Pakistan,
where female-headed households
represent a larger proportion among
the wealthier income groups. Among
rural households, female-headed
households face considerably higher
welfare losses in all countries.
Overall, at the national level,
female-headed households are more
vulnerable to food price shocks for
two reasons. First, they tend to
spend proportionally more on food
than male-headed households;
hence, they are hit harder by higher
food prices. Second, they face a
variety of gender-specific obstacles
that limit their ability to produce
more food and, thus, to benefit from
an increase in food prices. Chief
among these constraints are
differences in access to inputs and
services, particularly land and credit.

High prices and undernourishment – household-level analysis
Going beyond the household welfare
effects, it is important to understand how
price changes translate into calorie
intake and, eventually, into country-level
undernourishment estimates. To this
end, the effect of a 10-percent increase in
the price of the main staple cereal on
dietary energy intake was analysed using
household information from seven
different countries. The staples
considered were rice in Bangladesh,
Nepal and Viet Nam; maize in Guatemala
and Malawi; and wheat in Peru and
Tajikistan. While small in number, this
group of countries offers great variety in
terms of patterns of food consumption,
income sources and food production.
Identifying households that are
most vulnerable to increased
undernourishment as a result of food
price shocks is not straightforward.
This is because dietary energy intake
is determined by factors that vary
substantially within and across countries.
First, the drop in purchasing power is
greater for those households that spend

more on food, which are typically the
poorest households. However, rising food
prices also increase the incomes of those
households that produce food, which
could be overrepresented either among
poorer or richer households. Preferences
are also important as they determine
food substitution patterns and how food
consumption responds to income
changes.
Compared with the welfare analysis,
the results are not as clear-cut. Looking
at urban and rural households together,
those countries with a large share of the
main staple in total dietary energy
(Bangladesh, Malawi and Tajikistan)
suffer the greatest impact and the drop in
calorie consumption is relatively higher
among the poor. However, in Viet Nam,
where the primary staple provides
60 percent of total dietary energy, the
effect of increased income from rice
production mitigates the negative impact
of higher food prices and the impact of
the increased income is relatively higher
among poorer households.

High food prices and food security
Coping and nutritional outcomes

T

he previous section described
how rising staple food prices
could reduce household
welfare, which is important in
determining access to food,
especially for the poorest. In the
short term, households have few
choices or none as to how to cope
with high food prices, which often
leads to a reduction in daily diets.
However, in the medium-to-longer
term, households may employ
different strategies to cope with the
drop in purchasing power caused by
higher food prices.
Depending on the severity,
frequency and duration of food price
increases, household coping
strategies could be food-based, non-

food-based or a combination of both.
In countries where people have
access to a more diversified diet,
households will respond to a sudden
and dramatic increase in food prices
by first reducing the number of foods
consumed from different food groups
while leaving overall consumption of
staples unchanged.
High prices of internationally
traded commodities, such as staple
grains and vegetable oils, are
expected to increase the prevalence
of malnutrition among both urban
and rural households, with a greater
impact in countries with already low
levels of dietary diversity. The links
between high staple food prices and
nutritional outcomes are complex

and subject to contextual factors,
including the geographical
distribution of the food price
increases, the number of
commodities affected in any one
country and the choices made at the
household level that affect food,
health and care practices. Figure 24
illustrates possible household
response options and the impact that
various coping strategies may have on
the nutritional status of individuals.
In general, in analysing the
possible nutrition impacts of
household and individual behaviour
in response to high food prices,
coping strategies can be classified as
being either food-based or non-foodbased. Among the food-based coping

strategies, a sudden loss in
purchasing power may result in
changes in the quantity, quality and/
or diversity of food items consumed.
For example, an increase in the price
of imported rice in West Africa might
force households to switch to
cheaper domestic rice or other
starchy staples, such as locally
produced sorghum or millet. Lowincome households with little or no
choice to reduce the diversity of their
diets will respond by simply eating
fewer meals per day and by reducing
non-food expenditure. Non-foodbased coping strategies may involve
a reduction in expenditure on health
care and education, in addition to
seeking other sources of income to
offset the loss in purchasing power.
Importantly, the extent to which
households and individuals are
affected depends considerably on
their consumption behaviour and
income status before the price shock
took place.
Nutrition impacts vary
The proportion of income spent on
food in any one country tends to
decrease with higher levels of per
capita income. On average, this
proportion may range from about
60 percent for some of the lowestincome countries to 15 percent or
less for high-income countries.
Households in low-income countries
generally derive a larger share of
total energy intake from cereals.
Therefore, the relative impact of high
food prices, particularly of high
cereal prices, will be largest in lowincome countries. This effect is
magnified in countries where a large
share of the population is already
undernourished and where diets
among the poor are less diversified.
In these countries, households have
little choice but to reduce the

number of meals and/or the portion
size, resulting in reduced energy
intake and increased levels of
undernourishment. In countries
where people have access to a more
diversified diet, the nutritional
concern associated with a price
shock centres on increased risk of
deficiencies in essential
micronutrients, such as iron and
vitamin A, as households are forced
to consume fewer foods.
Dietary diversity
and nutrition
The strong influence that income
exerts on food choices can be seen in
country-level data from food balance
sheets. The share of dietary energy
from animal foods, vegetable oils,
sugar, fruits and vegetables
increases with higher per capita
income levels, while that from roots,
tubers and pulses tends to decrease.
As a result, diets in low-income
countries are typically rich in
cereals, roots and tubers, while the
poor consume less meat and fewer
dairy products, smaller amounts of

oils and fats, and fewer fruits and
vegetables (included in “Others” in
Figure 25). These foods are usually
the most expensive, but they are also
the most concentrated sources of
many nutrients. Meat and dairy
products are rich in high-quality
proteins and micronutrients, such as
iron, zinc and vitamin A. Fruits and
vegetables contain vitamin A
precursors. Oils are rich in dietary
energy. Thus, the poor in developing
countries usually suffer
disproportionately from malnutrition
in part because diverse, nutritionally
well-balanced diets are unaffordable.
Households first respond to high
food prices by buying less food or
switching to relatively cheaper foods.
After the African Financial
Community franc (CFA franc) was
devalued in 1994, the price of
imported rice increased, but many
urban households in Côte d’Ivoire,
Mali and Senegal continued to
consume the same amounts of rice.
The strain on food budgets
resulted in less diverse diets for
the poorest households in these
areas. In Dakar (Senegal) and

Indonesia: price rises mean
greater malnutrition
Although the Indonesian economy is
growing at about 6 percent a year, some
100 million Indonesians live on less
than US$1 a day. UNICEF data show
that child malnutrition is rising. Dozens
of children under five died of
malnutrition in the first six months of
2008. In the same period, the cost of
staple soybean-based products such as
tofu and tempe, a source of vital
protein, rose by about 50 percent owing
to soaring commodity prices on the

among rural infants whose mothers
had been pregnant at the time of the
price increases.
During the drought and financial
crisis of 1997/98 in Indonesia,
mothers of poor families responded
by reducing their own dietary energy
intake in order to feed their children
better, resulting in increased
maternal undernutrition.10 Children
were also at greater risk of being
given up for adoption by their
families in order to reduce the
number of mouths to feed.
Household purchases of more
nutritious protein-rich foods were
reduced in order to afford the main
staple (rice), leading to an increased
prevalence of anaemia in both
mothers and children. The effects
were particularly severe for infants
conceived and weaned during the
crisis. These examples demonstrate
the long-term and intergenerational
effects of rising food prices on the
growth and development of children.
As explained in an earlier section,
the actual impact of high staple food
prices, in particular of tradable
cereals, also depends on prevailing
cultural food norms and habits in
different countries.

-%

It has been shown above that higher
staple food prices are likely to lead to
increased undernourishment
(following reduced dietary energy
intake). A general association
between levels of undernourishment
and prevalence of undernutrition in
children under five years of age is
apparent in Figure 27. Thus, it is
reasonable to conclude that when
levels of undernourishment in the
total population increase, child
undernutrition increases as well.
Particularly critical levels of
undernutrition occur when

undernourishment exceeds
10 percent in the total population.
Based on this association, it is
expected that undernutrition in
children under five years of age will
increase, especially if prices remain
high and no preventive measures are
taken.
Non-food coping
strategies
Having examined the short-term
impacts of high food prices on
undernourishment levels, it is also
necessary to consider the longerterm negative effects on nutritional
levels and their consequences as
households attempt to cope by
decreasing non-food expenditure
and/or by increasing their income.
Reduced expenditure on health,
already often low among poor

With the increase in food prices in Côte
d’Ivoire, poorer urban people are seeking
to cut down on essential non-food items,
such as medicines. An example is Drissa
Kone, a man with a severe respiratory
infection and a prescription for medicines
that would cost CFA franc 35 000 (US$83)
at official prices. Drissa Kone has no
hope of raising enough money to buy the
medicines. His solution is to buy
counterfeit medicines at Abidjan’s
Adjame market, where he can find an
illegal reproduction of the original drug
at a fraction of the price. He said “I can
buy the same medicines at the market by
the individual tablet not the packet, and
pay just CFA franc 150 [US$0.35] per pill.
For CFA franc 500 [US$1.19], I can get
enough medicine to last me three days!”
The downside, however, concerns the

populations, and education means
that health conditions deteriorate
and children will have less schooling,
thus adversely affecting their future
income-earning opportunities and
overall development prospects.
Households may attempt to
engage in new income-generating
activities. Time constraints among
women with small children may have
negative health and nutrition-related
consequences for children. Disease
and malnutrition are closely related.
Infections increase the likelihood of
various types of malnutrition due to
reduced utilization by the body of
essential nutrients. For example,
routine health activities, such as
child growth monitoring and
immunizations, declined in
Brazzaville after the 1994 CFA franc
devaluation, partly because of
mothers’ decreased capacity or

quality of the medicines as they are
usually less effective than the originals –
a serious problem when treating
potentially deadly illnesses like malaria.
Fake medicines sometimes contain a mix
of chemicals that further harms health.
Dr Ambroise Kouadio, a doctor in
Abidjan, says that, although the risks of
using counterfeit medicines are fairly
well understood, the number of people
like Kone who are turning to them is
increasing. “The state has built many
more health centres and hospitals, but
the people are still poor. They have to
choose between health care and eating,
and they usually choose to eat,” said
Dr Kouadio.

willingness to take their children to
health centres. The prevalence of
child stunting and wasting rose and
the nutritional quality of infant
complementary foods declined.11
Increased female employment
may lead to less or lower-quality
child care at home. It may interfere
with breastfeeding, home-based food
preparation, sanitation practices and
seeking medical assistance when
children are sick. Older siblings may
have to take over from mothers in
providing child care, while being less
equipped to do so. Increased child
labour at home or outside may have
further negative nutritional
consequences for children and
interfere with their education.

Towards the Summit commitments
Policy responses: effective and sustainable?

T

he sudden rise in global food
prices has triggered a wide
variety of policy responses
around the world. Initial action has
focused on guaranteeing an adequate
food supply locally, keeping
consumer prices low and providing
support for the most vulnerable.
Policy measures have included an
easing of import taxes and the
imposing of export restrictions to
maintain domestic food availability;
applying price controls and subsidies
to keep food affordable; and stock
drawdowns to stabilize supplies and
prices. There has been less
emphasis, at least initially, on
fostering an agricultural supply
response. However, the governments
of a number of developing countries
have taken action to provide farmers
with the support needed to boost
domestic food production.
A survey of policy responses in
77 countries revealed that in 2007 and
early 2008 about half of the countries
reduced cereal import taxes and more
than half applied price controls or
consumer subsidies in an attempt to
keep domestic food prices below
world prices.12 One-quarter of the
governments imposed some type of
export restriction, and roughly the
same proportion took action to
increase domestic supply by drawing
on foodgrain stocks. Only 16 percent
of the countries surveyed had not
employed any policy response to
mitigate the impact of soaring food
prices. Policy responses varied
considerably by region, with subSaharan Africa and Latin America and
the Caribbean showing the lowest
number of policy interventions.
The impact, effectiveness and
sustainability of some of the policy
measures are not always clear. First,
by maintaining farmgate prices at
artificially low levels, policies may be
discouraging the much-needed

32

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008

supply response and potential
productivity increases. Second,
export restrictions lower food
supplies in international markets,
pushing prices higher and
aggravating the global situation.
Third, higher subsidies and/or lower
taxes and tariffs increase the
pressure on national budgets and
reduce the fiscal resources available
for much-needed public investment
and other development expenditure.
In summary, some of the policy
measures employed tend to hurt
producers and trade partners and
actually contribute to volatility of
world prices. Experience has shown
that price controls rarely succeed in
controlling prices for long. Moreover,
they place a heavy fiscal burden on
governments and create
disincentives for supply responses by
farmers. In a number of countries
applying export controls (or outright
bans on exports), some farmers have
reduced plantings of cereals because
of artificially low domestic prices for
their products coupled with high
prices for inputs such as fuel, seeds

and fertilizers. As the box shows, the
ability of government policies to
insulate domestic economies from
the external price shock has been
very limited.
The way forward:
the twin-track approach
The initial policy responses to the
dramatic increase in food prices
concentrated on improving local food
supplies and alleviating the
immediate impact on consumers.
However, it has become clear that in
order to deal with the short- and
long-term challenges posed by high
food prices and reinforce the
opportunities they present, both
national governments and the
international community require
coherent policies and actions. The
sustainable solution to the problem
of food insecurity in the world lies in
increasing production and
productivity in the developing world,
especially in LIFDCs, and in ensuring
that the poor and vulnerable have
access to the food they need.

Policy trade-offs
Developing countries face difficult
macroeconomic choices as a result of
high food and fuel prices.
Inflation has been rising throughout
the world, with food price inflation
generally outpacing that for other goods
and services, especially in developing
countries (where food tends to account
for a much larger share of the
consumption basket).
Management of inflation presents
difficult policy trade-offs with important
implications for food security. Raising
interest rates will help to reduce
inflationary pressures but tend to reduce
investment and cause the exchange rate
to appreciate, with adverse effects on
exports, growth and employment. This
may reduce the incomes of the poor and,
hence, their access to food. On the other
hand, continued rapid price increases will
erode the value of real wages and the
purchasing power of wage earners, with
adverse effects on food security.
Attempts by governments to shield
consumers from rising food prices
through general subsidies or the
establishment of safety nets are costly
and cause budgetary constraints for

low-income countries. If domestic prices
rise in line with world prices, procuring
food domestically for resale to targeted
groups will entail increased budgetary
outlays. Restricting exports in order to
maintain domestic consumption will
result in lost export revenue and foreignexchange earnings. Some countries may
be able to finance budget deficits for a
limited period, but others with
rudimentary financial systems may need
substantial external assistance to deal
with macroeconomic imbalances. LIFDCs
will be particularly hard pressed as they
may need to reduce development budgets
and divert foreign exchange away from
other essential imports in order to secure
adequate and affordable food supplies.
In conclusion, higher food prices
present governments with difficult tradeoffs. They can: (i) reduce subsidies and
risk an immediate deterioration in food
security; (ii) reduce investment in public
goods, such as health, education and
infrastructure, and risk slowing the pace
of longer-term growth and development;
or (iii) do neither and risk substantial
macroeconomic imbalances that also
threaten long-term growth and welfare.

In line with this, FAO has
advocated for the twin-track
approach as an overall strategic
framework for fighting hunger. Now
widely adopted by the development
community, it addresses both shortand long-term challenges to food
security and is highly relevant in the
current context of high food prices.
One track aims to promote the
supply response of the agriculture
sector and the development of the
rural areas through appropriate
incentives and investments in public
goods. The objective is to increase
food supplies and to enhance the
income-generating capacity of
agriculture and the rural economy as
a means of promoting overall rural
development. In order for policies to
reduce poverty significantly, a strong
focus on the productive capacity of
smallholder farmers is crucial. The
other track of this approach aims to
ensure immediate access to food for
the poor and vulnerable in both rural
and urban areas through the
provision of safety nets and social
protection measures.
Both components of the twintrack approach are crucial and
mutually supportive. Developing
agriculture and the rural economy
provides opportunities for the poor to
improve their livelihoods, a
necessary condition for a sustainable
reduction in food insecurity.
Improving direct access to food and
nutrition enhances human capacity
and the productive potential of those
at risk of nutritional deficiencies. It
also allows them to take fuller
advantage of the opportunities
offered by development. Given that
75 percent of the poor live in rural
areas, focusing on agriculture and
rural development is crucial to
achieving a substantial and
sustainable reduction in hunger and
poverty.

ncreased food production would
help to restore the supply–
demand balance at a lower price
level. High food prices and the
increased incentives they provide
present an opportunity for
agricultural producers to increase
investment and expand production.
Initial signs indicate that the
agriculture sector has responded to
these greater incentives with
increased plantings and production.
However, the need to increase
food production should not only be
seen in the context of the current
supply and demand “imbalances”.
Increases in food and agricultural
production and productivity will be
essential for meeting further
increases in effective demand in
the years to come. Demand for
food and feed will continue to grow
as a result of urbanization,
economic growth and rising incomes,
all of which cause a shift in diets
towards higher-value products,
including meat and dairy. Projected
population and socio-economic
growth will double current food
demand by 2050.
In order to meet this challenge in
developing countries, cereal yields
will need to increase by 40 percent
and net irrigation water
requirements will rise by 40–50
percent. Moreover, some 100–200
million hectares of additional land
may be needed, mainly in subSaharan Africa and Latin America.13
An estimated 80 percent of the
increase in global food production
must come from growth in crop
yields. To this, the new demands for
feedstock for an expanding bioenergy
sector should be added.
Going beyond simple balances
between global food needs and

34

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008

availability, a question that is central
for food security concerns relates to
who participates in the short- and
long-term response of agriculture to
high food prices and in meeting
future food needs. In other words,
increasing food production is a
necessary but not a sufficient
condition to address the recent
increase in food insecurity caused by
high food prices (represented by an
additional 75 million people now
hungry) as well as the long-term
structural insecurity represented by
the close to 850 million people who
were suffering from hunger even
before the recent price rises.
Why smallholder farmers?
In order to ensure that increased
food production enhances food
security, developing countries must
be able to exploit their potential to
increase agricultural production and
productivity through a more
conducive policy framework and
increased investment in agriculture
and rural development by both

national governments and
international donors involved in
agriculture and rural development.14
The magnitude of hunger in the
world and the difficulties in reducing
it even when food supplies are high
and prices low highlight a
fundamental problem of access to
food. Even low food prices will not
fully address the problem of
inadequate access to food, which is
also affected by the ability of the
poor to produce enough food or
generate sufficient income to buy it.
On the other hand, as most poor
rural households rely on agricultural
production for a significant share of
their income, increasing agricultural
productivity is closely related to
reducing rural poverty. It follows that
increasing food production and
productivity should go beyond the
objective of reducing prices in global
markets – providing an opportunity
for reducing rural poverty and
hunger.
Realizing the potential of food and
agricultural production to reduce
poverty and hunger depends largely

inputs. However, the prices of many
agricultural inputs, such as
fertilizer, pesticides and
transportation, are closely linked to
fossil fuel prices. From January 2007
to April 2008, input prices (fertilizers
and crude oil) outpaced food prices,
dampening the positive production
incentive of the food price increases.
To the extent that input costs
constitute a sizeable part of the total
variable cost of farming, this trend
diminishes the extent to which
higher food prices will stimulate
production response.

on the degree to which smallholder
farmers, representing 90 percent of
the rural poor, are able to participate
in productive and remunerative
farming and off-farm activities.15
About two-thirds of the
3 billion rural people in the world live
off the income generated by farmers
managing some 500 million small
farms of less than 2 hectares each.
Hence, efforts to boost agricultural
production must focus largely on
increasing smallholder productivity.
Small-scale farming constitutes
about 80 percent of African
agriculture, producing largely staple
foods.16 Failure to include
smallholders in future strategies will
result in further marginalization,
increased rural poverty and rising
migration of the rural poor to urban
areas.
Broad-based agricultural growth
that includes smallholders can have
a large impact on poverty reduction.
In addition to boosting food
availability and lowering food prices,
improved smallholder productivity

HdjgXZ/;6D#

generates higher incomes and
demand for locally produced goods
and services, resulting in broadbased socio-economic development
in rural areas. This dynamic process
is a primary reason why agricultural
growth is up to four times more
effective in reducing poverty
compared with growth in other
sectors.17
Moreover, the potential for
increased productivity is often larger
on smaller farms because of their
efficient use of family labour. Policies
promoting smallholders and more
equitable land distribution were at
the heart of country success stories
during the green revolution in
several Asian countries (e.g. China,
India and Indonesia).
Input prices constrain incentives
A productivity-led response centred
around smallholders requires
incentives that reach farmers in the
form of higher output prices and
improved access to affordable

Structural constraints
Broad-based agricultural growth
requires significant and systematic
efforts to address the diverse
constraints affecting smallholders.
Such efforts will enable
smallholders to increase farm
productivity and meet new, more
stringent demands regarding food
safety and quality.
Technology. Access to a regular
stream of technologies adapted to
specific conditions contributes to
increasing productivity, particularly
in the context of limited land
resources, and, thus, it is important
for small-scale producers. For
example, in arid zones, investments
in improved irrigation technology and
drought-tolerant crops help reduce
price and income variability by
mitigating the impact of droughts.
Low levels of publicly funded
agricultural research and
development have severely impeded
small farmers’ access to
productivity-enhancing technologies.
Only a few smallholder farmers
participate in contractual
arrangements with buyers (such as
agricultural commodity value chains
or outgrower schemes) that facilitate

access to improved seeds, inputs and
mechanization.
Market access. Access to functioning
markets for both staples and highvalue commodities is a key
prerequisite for agricultural

development and improved
productivity. Market access differs
among developing regions, with
sub-Saharan Africa having the
lowest level of access, particularly
for smallholders. In many
developing countries, smallholder

participation is often constrained by:
(i) a lack of infrastructure and
transport; (ii) poor market
information; (iii) inadequate and
poorly enforced grades and
standards; and (iv) poor farmer
organization for bulk marketing.

Fertilizer use in sub-Saharan Africa: are subsidies the answer?
Fertilizer consumption in sub-Saharan
Africa was only 8 kilograms per hectare in
2002, just 1 kilogram more than in 1982
and 7 kilograms more than in 1962. This
level of fertilizer use is less than
10 percent of that in most other developing
regions. Perhaps as a result, cereal yields
increased by just 50 percent in subSaharan Africa from 1962 to 2002,
compared with a near tripling in the rest of
the developing world in the same period.
Furthermore, as a result of the low
intensity of fertilizer use, Africa’s soils are
at risk of being mined of nutrients.
The factors responsible for Africa’s low
level of fertilizer use include poor
infrastructure, which increases the costs
of fertilizer and reduces availability; high
risk owing to price volatility and a lack of
irrigation; lack of credit; and a poor
business environment shaped by

regulations, taxes and rents that diverts
fertilizer provision from the private to the
public sector (which tends to allocate
supplies inefficiently).
With fertilizer prices outpacing
agricultural commodity prices (so
undermining the increased production
incentives), small farmers who are net
food buyers may be particularly hurt, as
the high food prices also reduce the funds
they have available to purchase fertilizers.
Many poor African countries may see a
decline in fertilizer use in the short run
that could threaten even current levels of
production, which are already too low.
The rapid rise in fertilizer prices has
brought the issue of fertilizer subsidies to
the fore. Such subsidies may be warranted
where there is a clear prospect of
significant productivity gains, where they
are a cheaper form of income transfer

than alternatives (such as food aid ) and
where they do not affect market
mechanisms adversely. “Market-smart”
subsidies include the use of vouchers
redeemable through commercial dealers,
demonstration packs to stimulate demand
and credit guarantees to encourage
importers to offer credit to their dealers.
If input subsidies are to be used to
promote a supply response, several
constraining factors need to be
considered. In some locations, adequate
supplies may not be available and a
subsidy will merely lead to local price
inflation. Subsidies are expensive and can
put stress on government budgets,
causing reductions in spending in other
important areas such as education and
health (international donors may have a
role to play in alleviating these
constraints). If efforts to target are made
in order to reduce budgetary outlays,
administrative difficulties could prevent
the subsidies from reaching the
beneficiaries most in need. These
considerations suggest that although
fertilizer subsidies can be an effective
short-term response, they are not
sustainable in the long run. Whenever
input subsidies are used, they should
involve the private sector in order to

Assets. Access to, and use of,
physical capital varies considerably
both within and among countries.
Small landholders consistently
employ practices that are less capitalintensive. Similarly, human capital is
strongly related to the level of
wealth – heads of poorer households
are generally less educated than
those of richer households. Ease of
access to assets largely determines
the potential to respond to high food
prices and increase income and
production. As many assets serve as
collateral, households with sufficient
assets can exploit investment and
agricultural expansion opportunities
more effectively.

Credit. A large percentage of
smallholders suffer from insufficient
access to credit. This may reduce
their timely access to and use of
appropriate inputs. Many successful
cash-crop value chains have
effectively overcome the lack of rural
credit by providing input credit
directly to farmers and farmers’
associations, with reimbursement at
the time of product sale.18 To the
extent that higher food prices provide
greater returns to staple food
production, smallholder access to
cash and credit may improve.
Risk. Smallholder agricultural
production in the developing world is
inherently a high-risk activity, but
recent years have seen an increase
in both the level and variability of
food prices on world markets. To the
extent that the greater price
variability is transmitted to domestic
markets, this creates problems for
smallholders and may discourage a
supply response. In addition to price
volatility, smallholders – and indeed
most farmers – lack access to crop
and/or livestock insurance or other
risk-reducing instruments to deal

with production variability. The
unavailability of insurance leads
farmers to adopt more risk-averse
production strategies or to diversify
economic activities away from
agriculture. This constraint limits the
potential intensification of

agricultural production and adoption
of agricultural technology. Recent
innovations in weather insurance
that promise lower administrative
costs should provide an opportunity
for farmers to insure more
effectively.

The incentives offered by soaring
food prices provide a favourable
environment for advancing an
agricultural reform agenda to meet
future food needs at affordable
prices through poverty-reducing
agricultural productivity growth.
Such an agenda puts particular
emphasis on smallholder farmers,
especially in agriculture-based
countries.
Translating this opportunity into
concrete action and measurable
improvement in the livelihoods of
smallholder farmers depends first
and foremost on sustained political
commitment and investment of
governments and development
partners to address the numerous
constraints on small farmers’
incentives and behaviour. Today,
higher prices appear to present
opportunities to intensify production
of certain staple crops and
agricultural commodities that might

Transportation infrastructure for development
Investment in transportation infrastructure is crucial to
sustainable agricultural development. Decentralized small-scale
agricultural production in the developing world needs broad
transportation networks to improve market access, reduce retail
fertilizer prices and increase harvest prices for farmers. For
several African countries, there would be sizeable benefits in
terms of poverty reduction.1
Transportation services help to improve trade, welfare and
agricultural growth and to reduce the gap between producer
and consumer prices. The figure indicates that the difference in
input costs between several countries in Africa and the United
States of America is almost entirely attributable to transportation
costs.

Irrigation in poor regions
The ability to produce more food for a
growing world population has improved
significantly in recent decades as a result
of expansion in irrigated cropland.
Increasing the proportion of irrigated
agricultural land has provided a solid
base for boosting productivity and
reducing the volatility of agricultural
yields. With demand for water rising and
climate change imposing further
restrictions, efficiency in the management
of available water resources becomes a
necessary condition for productivity
increases in agriculture and for food
security.
In about 25 percent of the world’s
irrigated agricultural systems, the rate of
water withdrawal exceeds that of
renewal. Even more worrisome are
reports that water is becoming scarce in
several regions. Open access or loose

property rights on water resources and
irrigation systems lead to the
overexploitation of aquifers and
unsustainable irrigation practices that
exhaust, contaminate or at the very least
increase irrigation costs. Land
degradation is also an outcome of
inefficient use of water resources and
inadequate irrigation management
practices, resulting in productivity
reductions and increasing losses of
cropland. Small-scale farmers are most
affected by these practices as they lack
the capacity to secure their rights to
water as well as the resources to invest in
more expensive but more effective
pumping tools.
In Africa, less than 5 percent of
cropland is irrigated. Large benefits could
accrue to small farmers by expansion of
irrigated land to increase and stabilize the

level of production, while also minimizing
the role of rainfall uncertainty in
agriculture. Irrigation investment projects
have high rates of return, estimated as
exceeding 15 percent and even reaching
30 percent in sub-Saharan Africa.1
Significant gains in terms of welfare
improvements are also expected from
expanding irrigation investment.
Increasing investment in irrigation by
1 percent has been estimated as having
reduced poverty by nearly 5 percent in
Kenya.2

formerly have been available
only for higher-value export crops.
This change is positive given the
large poverty-reduction effect
achieved by growth in food staples
relative to growth in high-value
exports.19 Assessing the lessons
learned from years of experience
with programmes and projects
aimed at promoting smallholder
productivity is the first step to
scaling up what holds the promise of
a high payoff.
While some of the constraints
facing smallholders in various
contexts are similar, priorities may
differ among countries and physical
environments. In agriculture-based
countries in Africa, the emphasis is
likely to be on improving the
productivity of staple products and
increasing farmers’ access to larger
markets. Research and development
for staples in the diverse agroecological environments and
improvements in marketing
infrastructure will be priorities for
public policy and resource
mobilization.
However, in higher-potential areas
with good access to markets, linking
smallholder farmers to the emerging
high-value product chains and larger
retail outlets offers a considerable
payoff potential provided that
farmers can manage the increased
emphasis on product branding,
grading and standardization.
Increased access to international
markets (less than one-quarter of
total production in Africa is exported)
and local market development will
increase returns given smallholders’
cost advantage in the production of
primary crops.20
Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya and
Zambia provide successful examples
of enterprises producing and trading
new products, such as tropical fruits
and cut flowers.

FAO Initiative on Soaring Food Prices
In response to the rapidly rising food
prices, FAO launched (in December 2007)
the Initiative on Soaring Food Prices
(ISFP) with the immediate aim of rapidly
increasing food production during the
2008 and 2009 agricultural seasons,
mainly by supporting direct access to
inputs for smallholders. FAO appealed to
donors for an immediate investment of
US$1.7 billion in support of this effort.
The main objective of the ISFP is to
boost food production urgently in the
most affected countries so as to improve
local supplies. The initiative aims to
assist governments in formulating
country-specific action plans for food
security interventions to be implemented
along the twin-track approach – boosting
food production while also guaranteeing
access to food for the most vulnerable
population groups affected by higher and
more volatile food prices.
FAO’s assistance has taken the form
of: (i) interventions to increase access by
small-scale farmers to inputs (e.g. seeds,

Understanding market
opportunities, evaluating available
cropping technology, identifying the
binding constraints on production
(e.g. feeder roads, credit and
affordable inputs), and marketing
represent concrete first steps in
revitalizing support to smallholders.
One possibility is to organize staple
food production and marketing on
the basis of contract farming or
outgrower schemes in order to
improve access to technology and
markets.
Finally, research on food security
issues has highlighted the strong
positive interactions between
cash-crop and food-crop activities

fertilizer, animal feed) and improve
agricultural practices (e.g. water and soil
management, reduction of post-harvest
losses); (ii) policy and technical support;
(iii) measures addressing smallholder
access to markets; and (iv) a strategic
response to cushion the effects of rising
food prices in the short, medium and long
terms through increased and sustainable
investment in agriculture.
The ISFP programme has built a
strong partnership between FAO, the
World Bank, the Rome-based United
Nations Agencies (the International Fund
for Agricultural Development and the
World Food Programme) and other
development partners based on
complementarities and synergies among
partners to respond efficiently and
effectively to both the impacts of high
food prices on food security at the
country level and the corresponding
needs for investment.
Further information on the ISFP is available at
http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/isfp/en

and innovative methods for resolving
many of the constraints facing
smallholders. Higher-value cash
crops produced for international,
regional or national markets often
provide increased access to credit,
equipment and inputs that may
not be feasible with traditional food
crops. Under certain conditions,
they foster higher rates of food
production, generate higher
incomes and lead to greater
capitalization at the farm level.
Diversified farming systems also
contribute to increased resilience
of production systems and more
sustainable livelihoods that are less
vulnerable to shocks.

Ensuring access to food

T

he people most vulnerable to
food price shocks need to be
protected immediately from the
loss of purchasing power caused by
soaring food prices. Such protection
not only saves lives, it can also
strengthen livelihoods and promote
longer-term development. Safety
nets and social protection can
prevent and reduce the malnutrition
that has lifelong consequences. More
secure livelihoods prevent distress
sales of assets, allow investments in
education and health, and keep
households from falling into the
poverty trap.
“Safety net” is an umbrella term
for various types of programmes
aimed at assisting vulnerable
population groups. They include food
distribution programmes, cash
transfer schemes, various feeding
programmes and employment
schemes. Many countries have one
or more safety net programmes, with
varying degrees of coverage.
However, in the context of the
current high food prices, one
problem has been that not all
countries have safety net
programmes in place because of
budgetary costs and administrative
complexity.
Cash transfers include the
distribution of cash or cash
vouchers. They can be unconditional
or conditional on participation in
health, education or public works
programmes. Cash transfers are
appropriate where food markets
work and where improved ability to
purchase food is the objective of the
intervention. Unrestricted cash
transfers allow households to make
decisions as to how to spend the
cash, whether on food, essential
non-food items or on investment
needs. Such interventions can also
foster local market development in
food and other goods by providing

greater incentives to the private
sector to engage in higher-volume,
more-stable marketing channels.
However, where food prices are
increasing rapidly, the value of
transfers will need to be adjusted in
order to maintain purchasing power,
and this can complicate fiscal
planning.
Other approaches to improving
access to food, such as food stamps,
are also appropriate where local food
markets work and lack of access to
food is the root cause of hunger.
Food stamps can foster local market
development, primarily of food
products, and have the advantage of
being more politically acceptable.
They may also be more difficult to
divert to “undesirable” consumption
and may be self-targeting (where
wealthier households are less
interested in vouchers or food
stamps than cash). In addition, food
stamps have lower transaction costs

than direct provision of food aid.
However, they have higher
transaction costs than cash transfers
and may restrict the ability of
households to choose the most
appropriate expenditure. Moreover,
the selling of food stamps in the
shadow economy may undermine
programme goals.
Food-supply-based programmes
provide food or nutritional
supplements directly to individuals
or households. They are most
appropriate where food markets are
not functioning well, so that cash
transfers or other forms of income
support are less effective. For
example, providing cash or food
vouchers in areas where food is not
readily available could disrupt local
markets and drive up prices. Such
conditions typically require direct
food aid or “food for work”
programmes, which constitute the
primary safety net implemented by

the World Food Programme. Other
types of direct food distribution
programmes are warranted where
specific members of the household
are particularly vulnerable to food
insecurity or malnutrition. In these
cases, school lunches or food
supplementation could be necessary.
Direct food-based assistance is
fundamentally different from cash or
food stamps; it is most appropriate
when an insufficient supply of food is
the root cause of hunger. Moreover,
such programmes are often
politically more acceptable, perhaps
because it is more difficult to divert
the aid to undesirable consumption.
Importantly, food aid is often donated
to the receiving country, with the
quantity of food aid available often
reduced when world prices rise.
However, the fact that food aid is
often given free of charge may cause
governments to ignore other more
appropriate and sustainable
solutions.
Given the importance of
agricultural livelihoods for the poor
and food-insecure, especially in
sub-Saharan Africa and particularly
in the context of soaring food prices,
productive safety nets can also play
an important role. In countries such
as Ethiopia and Malawi, traditional
agricultural policy instruments,
including input subsidies, and
innovative approaches to crop
insurance have become part of social
protection. In the short run, the
smallholder supply response to
higher price incentives may be
limited by a lack of access to
essential inputs, such as seeds and
fertilizers. In these cases, social
protection measures, including the
distribution of seeds and fertilizers
either directly or through a system of
vouchers and “smart subsidies”, may
be an appropriate response. If
implemented effectively, such

42

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008

programmes can increase local
production and the incomes of small
producers and may reduce price
increases in local markets, thereby
contributing to improvements in the
nutritional status of net food-buying
families.
While the idea of a safety net in
the context of high food prices may
be conceptually straightforward, the
formulation, design and
implementation of such a
programme are complex. Many
possibilities exist and no specific
programme design is inherently
“better”. A particular design should
depend on local objectives and
conditions, and many safety nets
combine elements of the options
outlined above. Most importantly,
design should be driven by the needs
and circumstances of a particular
country or region and the views of
the beneficiaries rather than by the
needs and priorities of donor
countries and agencies.
Nutritional deficiencies
As nutrition problems among
children and adults are likely to
worsen substantially if high food
prices persist, immediate action
should be taken to mitigate negative
consequences. For appropriate
policy and programme responses to
be implemented, a clear
understanding of the specific country
context is essential, as the
nutritional impact of coping
mechanisms will vary considerably
in different settings and among
different population groups. Foodbased interventions should aim to
maintain or improve dietary diversity
in order to prevent increases in
micronutrient deficiencies.
Policy and programme responses
include direct interventions such as
micronutrient supplementation or

distribution of fortified foods for
highly vulnerable groups, such as
children and pregnant or lactating
women. These stopgap measures
should be complemented by
longer-term measures to ensure
that low-income households have
access to affordable diversified diets.
Examples include supporting
small-scale food industries to
produce weaning foods of good
nutritional quality; supporting and
promoting breastfeeding; providing
adequate nutrition education
messages; and conducting growth
monitoring. Evidence that emerged
from Bangladesh in the 1990s
suggests that macroeconomic food
policies that keep the price of food
staples low can, in combination with
other food and nutrition
interventions, help reduce the
percentage of underweight
children.21 Considering the
importance of women’s status for
child nutrition, effective measures
should aim at eradicating gender
discrimination and reducing power
inequalities between women and
men.

Concluding remarks

Addressing the threats

T

he dramatic rise in global food
prices poses a threat to food
and nutrition security. It also
creates many economic, social,
political and environmental
challenges with knock-on effects for
both development and humanitarian
activities. This food crisis endangers
millions of the world’s most
vulnerable people and threatens to
reverse critical gains made towards
reducing poverty and hunger in the
past decade. Already before the rapid

rise in food prices, close to
850 million people worldwide were
estimated to be undernourished. The
crisis may drive millions more in
both rural and urban areas deeper
into poverty and hunger.
A crisis of this nature and
magnitude requires an urgent
comprehensive, coherent and
coordinated global response to
ensure food and nutrition security,
especially in developing countries, in
a sustainable manner. This response
must address both immediate and
longer-term needs and target both

the urban and rural poor, especially
smallholder rural farmers in
affected countries (whose capacities
to benefit from high food prices are
severely constrained by lack of
inputs, investment, infrastructure
and market access).
A call for urgent coordinated action
On 28 April 2008, the United Nations
Secretary-General established the
High-Level Task Force (HLTF) on the
Global Food Crisis under his
chairmanship. The HLTF brings

Follow-up to the FAO High-Level Conference
When world leaders met in Rome in early
June 2008 for the High-Level Conference
(HLC) on World Food Security, they
reconfirmed that it is “unacceptable that
862 million people are still
undernourished in the world today” and
urged the international community “to
take immediate, urgent and coordinated
action to combat the negative impacts of
soaring food prices”.
It was recognized that immediate lifeand livelihood-saving relief assistance is
needed, combined with an urgent need to
help food-insecure countries expand
agriculture and food production. The HLC
produced a range of recommendations.

mechanisms to support agriculture
and environment;
• increasing smallholder access to
appropriate seeds, fertilizers, animal
feed, technical assistance and other
inputs;
• improving market infrastructure;
• ensuring that food, agricultural trade
and overall trade policies are
conducive to fostering food security for
all through the successful and urgent
completion of the Doha Round of trade
negotiations and minimized use of
restrictive measures that could
increase volatility of international
prices.

The current crisis has highlighted the
fragility of the world’s food systems and

together heads of many of the United

institutions and relevant parts of the
United Nations Secretariat. It has
produced a Comprehensive
Framework for Action (CFA) to guide
global and local actors, both
institutions and governments, and it
is designed to catalyse urgent and
immediate action. FAO has played a
key role in the HLTF and contributed
to the overall strategic and technical
content of the CFA and will play a
major role in its implementation.
The CFA identifies priority actions
for improving global food security
and furthering poverty reduction in
the context of the present food crisis.
Consistent with the Declaration
agreed by world leaders at the FAO
High-Level Conference on World
Food Security in June 2008 (see box)
and with key messages in this report,
the CFA highlights two general sets
of actions in support of a
comprehensive response to the
global food crisis. The first set aims
to meet the immediate needs of
food-insecure populations, while the

44

second set aims to build resilience
and contribute to longer-term global
food and nutrition security. Both
require urgent attention, and both
would benefit from strengthened
coordination, assessments,
monitoring, and surveillance
systems.
Investment in agriculture
is essential
FAO strongly believes that renewed
agricultural investment that is
focused on smallholder farmers and
rural development would turn
agriculture into a vibrant economic
sector with positive effects on
poverty reduction. In order to
succeed, increased agricultural
productivity must be accompanied by
enhanced investment in local and
regional market development and by
comprehensive adjustments to
distorting trade practices. At the
same time, sustainable models of
agricultural production must be
adopted in order to ensure that new
solutions are consistent with longterm environmental needs.

Rising to the challenge
Leadership must play a critical role
in any global response. National
governments should take the lead,
but they require redoubled support
and cooperation from the private
sector, civil society, the
humanitarian community and the
international system. The financial
implications related to the crisis and
the response are enormous, and they
require substantial political and
financial commitments from all
stakeholders. Critical needs vastly
exceed the response witnessed thus
far. Increased allocations should be
additional to current funding levels
and not divert resources away from
other critical social sectors
necessary to achieving the MDGs,
such as education and health.
These actions and outcomes can
only be achieved through partnership
at all levels. FAO will continue to
provide leadership and coordination
in this respect and to assist national
governments and affected
communities in addressing what
constitutes a truly global challenge.

Technical annex
Updated parameters

T

his technical annex describes
the impact of a revision in two
key parameters used in the
FAO methodology for estimating
undernourishment. The revised
parameters were introduced
following new population statistics
from the United Nations Population
Division in 2006 and new human
energy requirements established by
FAO, the United Nations University
(UNU) and the World Health
Organization (WHO) in 2004.22 FAO
utilizes both parameters for deriving
minimum dietary energy
requirements (MDERs) on a per
person basis, which are unique for
each year and country in the world.
The revised parameters were applied
to the 1990–92 benchmark period
and to all subsequent years for
which FAO has produced results. As
a result, undernourishment statistics
and the associated progress and
setbacks in terms of World Food
Summit (WFS) and Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) hunger
reduction targets have changed over
the entire reporting period. At times,
this has resulted in substantial
changes to the estimates presented
on a country-by-country basis in
Table 1 (page 48).
Minimum dietary energy
requirements

Most significant in terms of their
impact on undernourishment
estimates are the new standards of
human energy requirements
released by FAO, the UNU and WHO.
Used for the first time in The State
of Food Insecurity in the World 2008,
these new standards affect the
minimum dietary energy
requirements. The MDER is a crucial
factor in FAO’s undernourishment
methodology as it establishes a cutoff point, or threshold, to estimate

the number and prevalence
(percentage) of the hungry
population in a country. When the
threshold changes, so too may the
number and percentage of people
estimated to be undernourished.
Dietary energy requirements differ
by gender and age. They also vary for
different levels of activity.
Accordingly, MDERs, the amount of
energy needed for light activity and a
minimum acceptable weight for

attained height, vary by country and
from year to year depending on the
gender and age structure of the
population. For an entire population,
the MDER is the weighted average of
the MDERs of the different gender–
age groups in the population. It is
expressed in kilocalories (kcal) per
person per day. Particularly in
countries with a high prevalence of
undernourishment, a large
proportion of the population typically

consumes dietary energy levels close
to the cut-off point, making the
MDER a highly sensitive parameter.
In most countries, the new human
energy requirement standards have
resulted in an overall drop in both
the amount of food required and the
prevalence of undernourishment.
The new standards have meant a
drop in MDERs for children and a
slight increase in those for
adolescents and adults. The
difference has been greatest in those
countries with a relatively high
proportion of children under 12 years
of age. Figure A compares the old
and new standards for boys and
girls. On average, the new standards
have resulted in a drop in MDERs of
88 kcal per person per day in the
world, a decrease in food needs
equivalent to almost 60 million
tonnes of cereals. The effect of these
new standards has been to reduce
the estimated number of
undernourished people in the
developing world by 107 million in
the 1990–92 base period and by
106 million in 2001–03 (the most
recent period that can be used for

comparison), all other factors held
constant (green bars in Figure B).
Revised population estimates
This edition of The State of Food
Insecurity in the World uses revised
population estimates produced by
the United Nations Population
Division in 2006. The 2006 estimates
are provided for the period
1950–2005 and with projections up to
2050. The 2006 revision includes
higher estimates for most
countries, with the result that
population estimates for developing
countries have increased by some
35 million people for the 1990–92
benchmark period, while the revised
population estimates are some
53 million higher than previous
estimates for 2003–05.
Given that estimated country-level
total dietary energy supplies to
calculate undernourishment have
not changed, available food is
shared among more people, thus
reducing the daily energy supply
available per person, and increasing
the prevalence of undernourishment

in most countries owing to changes
in the population.
The 2006 revised population
estimates also updated gender and
age distributions. Most significant
are the changes in long-term trends
for ageing. As countries develop,
population growth rates typically
decline and life expectancy
increases. As the proportion of
adults relative to children increases,
food needs rise, with a
corresponding increase in
undernourishment. Between
1990–92 and 2003–05, the number of
undernourished people in developing
countries increased by some
66 million as a result of an ageing
population, all other factors held
constant.
Population pyramids for China help
illustrate these demographic trends.
As China’s adult population increased
relative to the number of children
between 1990–02 and 2003–05,
MDERs increased by an average of
43 kcal per person per day, resulting
in an increase in the number of
undernourished people of 70 million.
The combined effect of increases in
the number of people and changes to
the gender–age structure together
with food redistribution available for
human consumption based on the
2006 population revision is an
increase in undernourishment
estimates in the developing world of
some 42 million people for 1990–92
and of about 73 million people for
2001–03, all other factors held
constant (yellow bars in Figure B).
The increase is greatest in countries
with large populations and high
population growth rates.

both the numbers and trends in
undernourishment around the world,
as discussed in the main text of this
report.
The combined difference of
new energy requirements and the
2006 population revisions is a
decrease in FAO’s estimates of
undernourishment in the developing
world of 65 million people in 1990–92
and of 33 million people in 2001–03
(brown bars in Figure B).
Other data changes
A number of other changes have
been made to the data that affect the
global undernourishment estimates.
The “developing world” now includes
the countries of the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS), with the

exception of Belarus, Republic of
Moldova, the Russian Federation and
Ukraine (which are now included in
Europe). This has had the effect of
adding 10 million undernourished
people in the developing world in the
base period (1990–92).
Furthermore, new information
obtained by FAO has resulted in
major revisions to the data for China,
Indonesia and Myanmar, adding a
further 50 million undernourished
people in the base period. The
ongoing process of reviewing the
food balance sheets and supply
utilization accounts has also
resulted in small changes to the data
for many countries, with the overall
result of increasing the number of
undernourished in the developing
world in the base period by about

5 million. The combined impact of
these other changes has been an
increase in the number of
undernourished in the developing
world of about 65 million in the
base period and one of 48 million in
2001–03.

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008

Notes for Table 1

Developing countries for which there were insufficient data are not listed in
the table.

1

World Food Summit goal: halve, between 1990–92 and 2015, the number
of undernourished people.
2 Millennium Development Goal 1, target 1C: halve, between 1990
and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. Indicator
1.9: Proportion of population below minimum level of dietary energy
consumption (undernourishment).
3 Latest reported period refers to 2003–05 estimates, and baseline refers
to 1990–92. For countries that did not exist in the baseline period, the
1990–92 proportion of undernourished is based on 1993–95 and the number
of undernourished is based on their 1990–92 population and this proportion.
Countries revise their official statistics regularly for the past as well as the
latest reported period. The same holds for population data of the United
Nations. Whenever this happens, FAO revises its estimates of
undernourishment accordingly. Therefore, users are advised to refer to
changes in estimates over time only within the same The State of Food
Insecurity in the World publication and refrain from comparing data
published in editions for different years.
Figures following country name refer to undernourishment categories
(proportion of the population undernourished in 2003–05):
[1] < 5 percent undernourished
[2] 5–9 percent undernourished
[3] 10–19 percent undernourished
[4] 20–34 percent undernourished
[5] ≥ 35 percent undernourished

*
Ratio current/baseline number of undernourished – ratio for
WFS target = 0.5
** Ratio current/baseline prevalence of undernourished – ratio for MDG
target = 0.5
*** Although not listed separately, provisional estimates for Afghanistan
and Iraq (Near East and North Africa), Papua New Guinea (Asia and the
Pacific) and Somalia (East Africa) have been included in the relevant
regional aggregates. Developed countries have been included in world
estimates.
**** Eritrea and Ethiopia were not separate entities in 1990–92, but
estimates of the number and proportion of undernourished in the former
People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia are included in regional and
subregional aggregates for that period.

Countries are classiﬁed following World Bank country income groups.
For operational and analytical purposes, the World Bank has classiﬁed
countries according to 2007 gross national income per capita, calculated
using the World Bank Atlas method. The groups are: low income – US$935
or less; lower middle income – US$936–3 705; upper middle income –
US$3 706–11 455; and high income – US$11 456 or more.
2 DES = dietary energy supply.
3 Main food groups: C = cereals; RT = roots and tubers; OF = oils and fats:
and AP = animal products, excluding fats. Not shown: other vegetable
products (pulses, nuts, oilseeds, sweeteners, fruits, vegetables and
condiments). “Animal products” includes meat, offal, dairy products, eggs
and ﬁsh.
4 Diet composition as the proportion of energy from nutrients
(carbohydrates [CHO], protein and fat) in total energy available for human
consumption: H = high – proportion above 75, 15 and 30 percent for
carbohydrates, protein and fat, respectively; R = within recommended
range; and L = low – proportion below 55, 10 and 15 percent for
carbohydrates, protein and fat, respectively.

The State of

Food Insecurity in the World
As commodity prices soared in 2007–08, fears of a world food crisis
threatening the livelihoods of millions of people and causing widespread
hunger and poverty triggered high-level meetings to decide on immediate
measures to mitigate the impacts of high prices on the world’s poorest and
most vulnerable populations.

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008 presents the latest statistics
on global undernourishment. It reviews the impact of high food prices and
concludes that chronic hunger in the world has increased rapidly, now
affecting well over 900 million people, and placing tremendous pressure on
achieving hunger reduction targets set for 2015 by the 1996 World Food
Summit and as agreed under the first Millennium Development Goal.
This report finds that high food prices hit the poorest, landless and femaleheaded households hardest, affecting real incomes and raising the
prevalence of food insecurity and malnutrition among the poor by reducing
the quantity and quality of food consumed. Governments worldwide have
adopted measures to contain the negative impacts of high food prices.
However, these have had limited effect, with some proving detrimental to
world price levels and stability.
This report also examines how high food prices present an opportunity to
relaunch smallholder agriculture in the developing world. With appropriate
incentives, farming households could see immediate gains, while other
rural households could benefit in the longer run. The report advocates
FAO’s comprehensive twin-track approach to address the adverse impacts
of high food prices on world hunger. The strategy should include measures
to enable the agriculture sector, especially smallholders in developing
countries, to respond to high food prices, while also implementing targeted
safety nets and social protection programmes for the most food-insecure
and vulnerable.
