Foreword
As part of its mandate to provide authoritative
information about weather, climate and water,
the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
conducts annual assessments of the state of
the global climate. For over two decades, those
assessments have been published in the six
official languages of the United Nations in order
to inform governments, international agencies
and other WMO partners about global climate
trends, and extreme and notable weather and
climate events at the national and regional
levels.
The year 2015 will stand out in the historical
record of the global climate in many ways.
Modern records for heat were broken: 2015 was
a record warm year both globally and in many
individual countries. Heatwaves were extremely
intense in various part of the world, leading
to thousands of deaths in India and Pakistan.
Record extreme precipitation led to flooding
that affected tens of thousands of people across
South America, West Africa and Europe. Dry
conditions in southern Africa and Brazil exacerbated multi-year droughts. The influence of the
strong El Niño that developed in the later part
of 2015 can be discerned in many of the year’s
weather and climate events. While much work
remains to be done, advances in international
collaboration, the near-real-time sharing of data,
and progress in attribution science are starting
to make it possible to disentangle the respective
roles played by El Niño, other natural climate
variations and human-induced climate change.
On a more positive note, the Parties to the
United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change adopted the groundbreaking
Paris Agreement in December. The world’s governments unanimously agreed to take action in
order to reduce global emissions of greenhouse
gases into the atmosphere. They will aim to hold
the increase in the global average temperature
to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels
and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature
increase to 1.5 °C. The Paris Agreement raises
hope that international efforts to safeguard
our planet will be accelerated in order to avoid
reaching a point of no return for the climate
system. However, the warming trend and an
increasing number of disasters are expected to
continue for several decades. That emphasizes
the need to invest in adaptation as well as

mitigation. One of the most powerful ways to
adapt to the consequences of climate change
is to strengthen disaster early warning and
climate services.
WMO is committed to further enhancing weather
and climate services and related research. But
in addition to promoting scientific progress,
WMO recognizes the need to build operational
climate services that support climate resilience
and adaptation. Some 70 countries around the
world do not have the capabilities they need
to generate and apply climate information and
forecasts with the required timeliness and
quality of service. The Global Framework for
Climate Services is assisting least developed
countries, small island developing States and
other vulnerable countries to strengthen their
national climate and meteorological capabilities.
WMO is also working with its partners to help
countries protect themselves from climate
risks through multi-hazard early warning systems, impact-based forecasts and risk-informed
warnings.
I would like to take this opportunity to express
my gratitude to the National Meteorological and
Hydrological Services of the WMO Members,
to international and regional data centres and
institutions, and to climate experts from around
the world: they have all contributed to developing this annual statement according to the
highest scientific standards.
WMO welcomes suggestions from its Members
on how to further improve the Statement on
the Status of the Global Climate, including in
light of new requirements arising from the
Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework for
Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030, and the
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Introduction
The WMO Statement on the Status of the Global
Climate in 2015 covers many aspects of the climate system, including atmospheric and ocean
conditions, El Niño, the cryosphere, greenhouse gas concentrations, regional extremes,
tropical cyclones and ozone depletion. The
Statement draws on in situ and space-based
observations collected through various WMO
and co-sponsored programmes. It also draws
on numerical objective analyses. These observations are the Essential Climate Variables
that have been defined by the Global Climate
Observing System.
The international datasets underpinning this
assessment are maintained by advanced climate
data, monitoring and research centres that collaborate with WMO. In addition, data and climate
information has been collected directly from
WMO Members through a special WMO survey.
The global temperature analysis combines three
international datasets: the first (HadCRUT) is
maintained by the Met Office Hadley Centre in
collaboration with the Climatic Research Unit at
the University of East Anglia (both in the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland);
the second is kept by the National Oceanic and

Atmospheric Administration National Centers
for Environmental Information (United States
of America); and the third is maintained by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
Goddard Institute for Space Studies (United
States). The WMO analysis also incorporates
reanalysis data maintained by the European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
and by the Japanese Meteorological Agency.
Global precipitation information is provided
by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre
(Germany).
The assessment of national temperature anomalies uses data collected directly from Members
through a WMO survey. Data used in this publication relating to socioeconomic impacts are
based on reports provided directly by Members
or are taken from authoritative United Nations
sources. The peer-review process involves international climate experts, regional institutions
dealing with climate products and experts from
the National Meteorological and Hydrological
Services. In some cases, it was necessary to
cross-check with national focal points in order
to validate or update information available from
global sources.

A powerful El Niño combined with rising temperatures is destroying the world’s coral
reefs, causing the longest die-off event on record.

TEMPERATURE
In 2015, global warmth reached record levels as
a result of the long-term rise in global temperatures (caused mostly by humanity’s emissions
of greenhouse gases) combined with the effects
of a developing El Niño.
The global average near-surface temperature
for 2015 was the warmest on record by a clear
margin, according to data sources1 analysed by
WMO (Figure 1). The global average temperature
for the year was about 0.76 ± 0.09 °C above the
1961–1990 average, and approximately 1 °C
above the 1850–1900 average. Uncertainties
relative to the period 1850–1900 are larger and
more difficult to estimate.
These estimates are based on air-temperature
data gathered at meteorological stations over
land, and sea-surface temperatures measured

The estimates are corroborated by an analysis
produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency.
Global average temperatures can also be
estimated using output from reanalyses. In a
reanalysis, historical observations from many
different instruments are combined using a
modern weather forecasting system, in order
to give a comprehensive record of weather
and climate. Two long-term reanalyses were
surveyed: the ERA-Interim reanalysis, produced
by the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts, and the JRA-55 reanalysis,
produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency.
The central estimates for both of those reanalyses indicate that 2015 was the warmest year
on record near the surface.

The global average of temperatures over land
areas shows that 2015 was the joint warmest
year on record over land: 2005, 2007 and 2010
are comparable. The global average temperature over the sea surface in 2015 was equal to
the 2014 record. The combination of high land
and sea temperatures made 2015 a record year
overall.
Significant warmth was recorded over the
majority of observed land areas (Figure 2).
Particularly warm were large areas of South

PRECIPITATION AND SNOW COVER
In a typical year the distribution of precipitation is highly variable at regional and local
scales; 2015 was no exception. Rainfall extremes
affected many regions around the world and in
some cases, led to flooding and drought. The
section below on regional extremes provides
more details on rainfall extremes and related
impacts.

Few land areas experienced significant cold
conditions when averaged over the year.
One notably colder-than-average area was
the Antarctic, where the positive phase of the
Southern Annular Mode (SAM) persisted for
several months. In the positive phase of SAM,
westerly winds strengthen and contract towards
Antarctica. That induces cooling over most of
East Antarctica and warming over the Antarctic
Peninsula. October saw a change to less extreme
values of the SAM index through to the end
of the year and a warming relative to average
over the continent. Some north-eastern areas
of North America were colder than average
during the year.

On the annual scale, there were areas of
unusually high rainfall (Figure 3), including:
southern areas of the United States, Mexico,
Peru, northern Chile, most of the Plurinational
State of Bolivia, Paraguay, southern Brazil and
northern Argentina, northern and South-East

According to the Global Snow Lab at Rutgers
University, the snow extent in the northern
hemisphere during spring was 28.5 million km2.
That is below the long-term average and is the
eighth-lowest on record. North America had its
fourth-lowest spring snow extent on record.
However, in the United States, numerous snow
storms affected the North-East in February.
Massachusetts, Boston and Worcester saw
their all-time snowiest month and snowiest
winter. In Boston, 164.6 cm of snow fell during
February, which is more than normally falls in
the city in an entire season.

OCEANS
Over the oceans, significant warmth was
recorded across large areas. As would be
expected during an El Niño, the tropical
Pacific was much warmer than average and
over 1 °C warmer than average over much
of the central and eastern equatorial Pacific
(Figure 2). The North-East Pacific, much of
the Indian Ocean and areas in the North and
South Atlantic were also significantly warmer.

South-West Atlantic were significantly colder
than average. Other areas of the Southern Ocean
(approximately south of 60°S) were colder than
average, but in many cases there are too few
data in the climatology period (1961–1990) to
reliably estimate the significance of current
anomalies.
In 2015, global ocean heat content reached
record levels through both the upper 700 m
and 2 000 m of the oceans (Figure 4). Routine
measurements of temperatures down to 2 000 m
are now made using Argo floats. For more
details and background on ocean heat content,
see page 22.
Sea level is measured by satellites as well as
by traditional tide gauges. The latest estimates
of the global sea level from satellite altimeters (Figure 5) indicate that the global average
sea level for January to November 2015 was
the highest ever recorded by satellites. In line
with the long-term upward trend in sea level
as estimated by tide gauges, the same period
also saw the highest recorded sea level since
global records began more than a century ago.

other hand, dry areas included Central America
and the Caribbean, north-east South America
including Brazil, parts of central and southern
Europe, parts of South-East Asia, Indonesia, and
southern Africa. Although long-term accumulations are important, they can disguise great
variability in short-term totals.

Even though the global average sea level reached
record levels in 2015, not all areas of the ocean
did. Monthly average sea levels were lower than
normal in the western tropical Pacific, as might
be expected during an El Niño. In the latter half of

phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, El
Niño and La Niña. During an El Niño, sea-surface
temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific rise
above average. This leads to a weakening or
reversal of the prevailing trade winds, which
acts to reinforce surface warming. The El Niño
Southern Oscillation is the leading mode of
year-to-year global climate variability. El Niño
affects the global atmospheric circulation,
altering weather patterns around the world
and temporarily elevating global temperatures.

the year, negative sea-level anomalies of about
–10 cm were reported in the Marshall Islands,
the Federated States of Micronesia and Papua
New Guinea. The anomalies were smaller than
those observed during the 1997/1998 El Niño.
By contrast, sea levels along the Equator east
of the dateline were above average: that is also
symptomatic of an El Niño.

Variations in the temperature of the surface

In 2015, sea-surface temperatures in the EastCentral Pacific increased, exceeding typical El
Niño thresholds during northern hemisphere
spring. Atmospheric indicators were also indicative of a developing El Niño, such as the pressure
difference between Tahiti and Darwin, enhanced
convection near the dateline, and a weakening
or reversal of the trade winds. El Niño continued to strengthen and peaked in December.
At its peak, sea-surface temperatures in some
key areas were comparable to those recorded
during the exceptionally strong El Niño events
of 1997/1998 and 1982/1983, though the location
of the peak sea-surface temperature anomalies
was further to the west in 2015.

precise details of any single El Niño will differ,
certain recurrent patterns might be expected
during a strong El Niño.
El Niño is typically associated with higher global
temperatures both at the surface (Figure 6) and
up through the troposphere. However, there
is a lag between the warming of the tropical
Pacific and its effect on global temperatures.
The lag is longer in the troposphere than it is
at the surface. Global surface temperatures
might have been slightly elevated by the near-El
Niño conditions that prevailed in late 2014.
However, the full effect on global temperature
of the strong 2015 El Niño is likely to continue
after El Niño peaks.
Figure 7 shows a schematic of typical precipitation anomaly patterns that are favoured
during El Niño. Figure 3 shows observed precipitation anomalies for 2015. Rainfall deficits
consistent with El Niño were observed from
Central America to northern Brazil, in southern
parts of Africa, South-East Asia, large areas of
Oceania and eastern Australia. Monsoon rains
in India were also below average. Areas of
above-average precipitation included southern
Brazil and northern Argentina, and southern
areas of the United States.
Moreover, El Niño affects the formation and
development of tropical cyclones. It suppresses
the formation of hurricanes in the North Atlantic
and promotes the formation of hurricanes and
typhoons in the Eastern North Pacific. That is
consistent with observations from 2015 (see
page 19).

CRYOSPHERE
In the northern hemisphere, the seasonal cycle
of Arctic sea-ice extent usually peaks in March
and reaches its minimum in September. Ever
since consistent satellite records began in the
late 1970s, there has been a general decline in
sea-ice extent throughout the seasonal cycle. In
2015, the daily maximum extent, which occurred
on 25 February, was the lowest on record, at
14.54 million km2. That is 1.10 million km2 below
the 1981–2010 average and 0.13 million km2
below the previous record set in 2011. The
minimum sea-ice extent was recorded on
11 September. It measured 4.41 million km2.
That was the fourth-lowest minimum extent in
the satellite record (Figure 8). On 30 December,
unusually warm air moved northward into the
polar region. Consequently, an above-freezing
temperature of +0.7 °C was, albeit briefly,

the North Pole.
In the southern hemisphere, the seasonal cycle
of Antarctic sea-ice extent typically peaks
around September or October and reaches
a minimum in February or March. In 2015, a
daily maximum extent of 18.83 million km2 was
recorded on 6 October. That is the sixteenthhighest maximum extent in the satellite record
and 1.33 million km2 below the 2014 record
maximum. The minimum extent, recorded on
20 February, was 3.58 million km2. That is the
fourth-highest summer minimum extent on
record and 0.17 million km2 below the 2008
record. Compared with the long-term trend,
there is considerable variability in the year-toyear Antarctic sea-ice minimum extent. In the
past five years, both the second-highest (2013)
and the third-lowest (2011) monthly extent have
been recorded. Daily Antarctic sea-ice extent
was at or near record levels early in the year.
But in August, the extent moved close to the
long-term average. There is low confidence in
the scientific understanding of the observed
long-term increase in Antarctic sea-ice extent
since 1979.

context of the past decade. The total extent of
the highest summer melt on record (2012) was
over 300 000 km2 above the 1981–2010 average.
At the Greenland summit station, run by the
Danish Meteorological Institute, winter, spring
and summer temperatures were below average.
On 28 August, a new record low temperature
of –39.6 °C was recorded for that month. On
24 October, the lowest recorded temperature of
–55.2 °C equalled the current record low, which
was reported on 31 October 2007.

GREENHOUSE GASES
The latest analysis of greenhouse gas observations from the WMO Global Atmosphere Watch
programme shows that globally averaged mole
fractions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4)
and nitrous oxide (N2O) reached new highs in
2014 (Figure 9 – the latest information is from
2014 as there is a one-year lag in comprehensive
reporting). In 2014, the globally averaged CO2
mole fraction reached 397.7 ± 0.1 ppm. 2 That
is 143% of the pre-industrial level. The annual
increase from 2013 to 2014 was 1.9 ppm. That
is close to the average annual increase for
the last 10 years and higher than the average
growth rate for the 1990s (about 1.5 ppm/year).

ppm: parts per million; ppb: parts per billion

Atmospheric CH 4 reached a new high of
1833 ± 1 ppb in 2014. That is 254% of the
pre-industrial level and is due to increased anthropogenic emissions. The average global N2O mole
fraction in 2014 reached 327.1 ± 0.1 ppb. That is
1.1 ppb above 2013 and 121% of the pre-industrial
level (270 ppb). The annual increase from 2013
to 2014 was greater than the mean growth rate
over the past 10 years (0.87 ppb/year).

by long-lived greenhouse gases increased by
36%, with CO2 accounting for about 80% of that
increase. The increase in total radiative forcing by all long-lived greenhouse gases since
pre-industrial times reached +2.94 W/m2. The
total radiative forcing by all long-lived greenhouse gases corresponds to a CO2-equivalent
mole fraction of 481 ppm.

High temperatures also affected many places
in northern Africa. In Morocco, new temperature records for the month of May were set at
some stations, and extreme heat in July led to
a nearly 50% reduction in citrus fruit production. In Egypt, maximum temperatures in July
reached 47.6 °C at Luxor. In West Africa, May
was unusually warm in Burkina Faso and Niger,
being 3 °C above average in places.
In February, heavy rain affected North Africa.
At Alhoceima in Morocco, the normal monthly
rainfall is 36 mm. In February, 206 mm of rain
was recorded, of which 88 mm fell in 24 hours on
18 February. Heavy rain also affected the western
coastal region of Libya in September. Flash floods
occurred at Sorman when more than 90 mm of
rain fell in 24 hours: the monthly average is 8 mm.
From September to the end of the year, severe
drought conditions affected Morocco.

The West African monsoon brought significant
flooding. Heavy rain led to flooding in July and
August, affecting about 21 000 people in Burkina
Faso. In Niger, despite total rainfall for the year
that was close to the long-term mean, heavy rain
(more than 100 mm in 24 hours) was recorded
at a number of locations and led to floods that
killed 25 people. Heavy rains and floods also
affected Gambia and Mali (Figure 10).

Ocean, Mauritius had its wettest June since
1976. Total rainfall for the month was 180% of

In South Africa, the season from July 2014 to
June 2015 was, on average, the driest since
1991/1992 and the third-driest since 1932/1933.
By the end of the summer, the prolonged drought

of Karachi and about 200 people in other parts
of Sindh province. Extreme heat is common in
the pre-monsoon season on the Indian subcontinent. But in 2015, the heat extended over a
larger area than normal. It incorporated regions
such as Andhra Pradesh in eastern India and
coastal Pakistan, and was accompanied by very
high humidity in places.
On 31 July, Bandar Mahshahr, a coastal city in
the Islamic Republic of Iran, recorded a temperature of 46 °C combined with a dewpoint
temperature of 32 °C. High temperature combined with high humidity is exceptional. The
Hong Kong Observatory reported its warmest summer since records began in 1884. On

reached 36.3 °C, beating the previous record
of 36.1 °C set in 1990.
A mixture of dry conditions and heavy rainfall
episodes affected the Indian subcontinent in

led to flooding which killed over 200 people,
mainly in West Bengal and Assam. Exceptionally
heavy rain over Tamil Nadu and coastal Andhra
Pradesh in November and early December led
to flooding which killed more than 100 people.
In Pakistan, the summer monsoon was erratic.
Ninety per cent of the seasonal total was concentrated over the first half of the season in
areas which the rain seldom reaches. The station at Mianwali recorded 340 mm of rain in
36 hours on 2 and 3 August; the monthly average
is 115.9 mm. Pakistan also saw unseasonal
weather during March and April, with heavy rain
and late frost damaging crops. A rare tornado
hit the Peshawar valley on 27 April and killed
45 people.
Compared to the past 15 years, China underwent lower levels of weather-related mortality
and fewer areas were affected by extreme
weather. Between May and September, China
experienced 35 heavy rain events. Subsequent
flooding affected 75 million people with estimated economic losses of US$ 25 billion.

seriously affected.
Drought over the European part of the Russian
Federation during the late spring and summer
led to crop failures over more than 1.5 million
hectares, with associated economic losses of
about 9 billion roubles. Particularly affected
were: the Volgograd and Saratov regions along
the Volga river, the Orenburg region to the east
and the Republic of Kalmykia in the southern area
of the European part of the Russian Federation.
In the Asian part of the Russian Federation,
drought was recorded in Buryatia during the

and Transbaikalia experienced forest fires that
burned about 460 000 and 880 000 hectares
respectively.

Temperatures in 2015 were above normal for
most of the continent, with anomalies of up to
2 °C. The highest temperatures were recorded
in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and
Colombia on the Caribbean coast, northern Chile
and south-eastern Brazil. After a remarkably
warm austral autumn and winter, during which
several records were set, Argentina experienced

a long-standing record of 266 mm set in 1889. In
March, there were unusually heavy rains in the
northern part of Chile in the Atacama Region,
which caused flooding and mudslides in cities
such as Copiapó and Chañaral. By contrast, dry
conditions prevailed further south.
In the last quarter of 2015, extreme rainfall was
recorded in several parts of South America,
particularly in Paraguay, northern Argentina
and southern Brazil. About 180 000 people
were af fected by flooding and more than
80 000 people were displaced.

a colder-than-normal spring and its coldest
October on record. However, for the country
as a whole, 2015 was the second-warmest year
on record.
Reduced rainfall over Brazil and northern areas
of South America is common during an El Niño.
Brazil started the year with a drought in its
southern and eastern areas. The drought shifted
north, with scant rainfall during the dry season
over the Amazon (Figure 13). The persistently
dry conditions in Colombia and the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela had a severe impact
on agriculture, raising cattle and hydropower
generation during the last quarter of the year.
In Januar y, Chile was drier than average
throughout the country, with the south of the
country seeing the most extreme deficits. In
some places, it was the driest January in at least
50 years. The stations at Temuco and Valdivia,
situated halfway down the country, recorded no
rainfall for the whole month. In the Patagonia
region of southern Argentina, the above-normal
temperatures and below-normal rainfall at the
beginning of 2015 provided the ideal conditions
for one of the largest wildfires in the history of
Argentina. The fire lasted nearly two months
and affected 41 000 hectares of native forests.
In February and March, heavy rain affected a number of places in South America, including through
flooding. A number of long-running weather
stations in Argentina broke their February precipitation records. The Córdoba Observatory

NORTH AMERICA, CENTRAL
AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN
Western Canada and the United States were
unusually warm. It was the second-warmest year
on record for the contiguous United States, and
four states had their warmest year on record.
Record high winter average temperatures were
also reported along the Pacific coast of Canada.
And although February was the second-coldest
on record for some states of the United States,
December saw record high temperatures in
29 states.
Low annual rainfall, associated with the influence of El Niño, were widespread throughout
Central America and the Caribbean. Rainfall
totals for Puerto Rico were below the long-term
average and led to drought and water rationing
in some areas.
The dry and warm conditions that prevailed
across much of the western United States during
the year provided ideal conditions for wildfires.
In Alaska, over 400 fires burned 728 000 hectares
of land in May, breaking the previous record of
216 fires and 445 000 hectares. Over 700 wildfires
were reported in Alaska during July, and nearly
2 million hectares were burned during the
summer. Large fires burned throughout the
North-West in August. The Okanogan Complex
fire was Washington’s largest on record and
spread over more than 121 000 hectares.
It was the wettest May on record for the contiguous United States and the wettest month
overall in 121 years of record keeping (Figure 14).

Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas each had record
precipitation during the month. The May rains
effectively ended the drought that had affected
the southern plains since 2011. Further west,
however, long-term drought conditions continued. Basins across the West depend on
snowpack as a water resource. On 1 April, the
snow water equivalent was 5% of normal levels
in the West – the lowest since measurements
began in 1950. The previous lowest snow water
equivalent was 25% of normal levels, recorded
in 1977 and 2014.
In early October, as Hurricane Joaquin moved off
the east coast, it interacted with a low pressure
system and pulled tropical air into the Carolinas.
Record five-day rainfall totals of 380–630 mm
were widespread. There was significant flooding across the region, which killed 16 people.
Extreme rainfall and flash flooding, some of
it associated with the remnants of Hurricane
Patricia, also affected parts of Texas. It was
both the wettest and the warmest December

In Indonesia, the low rainfall associated with
El Niño increased the risk and incidence of
wildfires, which in turn led to poor air quality. In
the first half of the year, 40 provinces in upper
Thailand experienced their second-lowest total
rainfall in 64 years.
Australia had its warmest October on record.
The anomaly for October was also the highest
anomaly for any month since records began. A
heatwave early in the month set new records for
early-season warmth in southern Australia. It
was the fifth-warmest year on record as a whole.
Overall, Australia was about 4% drier than
average in 2015. But that encompassed both
areas with much higher-than-average rainfall
and areas which were much drier than average (Figure 15). The El Niño in 2015 likely
contributed to below-average rainfall over
eastern Australia (Figure 7), moderated by
changes of sea-surface temperature in the
Indian Ocean (the Indian Ocean Dipole was
positive between August and November). Since
the end of the most recent La Niña in early
2012, a series of dry years has seen long-term
drought re-emerge in western Victoria, South
Australia and south-west Western Australia.

In New Zealand, annual rainfall totals were
below normal in some areas, such as Kaitaia
and Kerikeri, both of which had their driest year
on record. But rainfall was near normal for the
rest of the country.

EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST
Heatwaves affected Europe from May through
September (Figure 16). Monthly average records
were set in July for Austria and Spain. The heat
was often intense. Kitzingen in Germany set a
new record for the country of 40.3 °C on 5 July.
In May, 42.6 °C was recorded at Lanzarote airport
and Valencia airport in Spain: that exceeded
both their previous highest May temperatures
by 6 °C. In France, Spain and Poland, a number
of stations broke records for their highest
temperatures. The United Kingdom set a new
July temperature record of 36.7 °C on 1 July.
From 1 to 4 August, Jordan saw temperatures
of nearly 8 °C above normal, reaching 47 °C at
Wadi Elrayyan. Seven stations in Bosnia and
Herzegovina reported new September temperature records in the six days from 15 September.
The Republic of Moldova and Serbia both saw
record daily temperatures for September. In
Israel, the minimum temperature at Sedom on
9 September was 36.5 °C. That is the highest
daily minimum temperature ever recorded in
Israel and breaks a record set in Tiberias in 1936
of 36 °C. As far east as Azerbaijan, temperature
records were set at certain stations between
June and September.

In some cases, the heatwaves were unusual in
their duration. In May, the maximum temperature at Beja in Portugal was above 30 °C for
19 days; on average, temperatures exceed that
level in Beja for 5 days. At Slap in the Vipava
valley in Slovenia, temperatures in excess of
30 °C were recorded on 54 days between June
and August. In Spain, a heatwave from 27 June
to 22 July was by far the longest on record.
Between June and August, Slovenia experienced 5 heatwaves. Ljubljana reported a record
run of 21 days with temperatures of above 30 °C.
Hungary had 41 days above 30 °C during the
summer, 22 days more than its average.
November and December were unusually warm
over Europe. December was the warmest on
record for a number of countries including the
United Kingdom, France, Germany and the
Netherlands. In the Central England Temperature
series it was the warmest December since at least
1659. Both Finland and the United Kingdom had
their warmest recorded November days, while
Estonia, Finland and the Republic of Moldova
had their warmest recorded December days.
January was wet throughout large parts of
Northern Europe and Scandinavia. In western
parts of Finland, many weather stations reported
record high precipitation totals for the month.
In Sweden, 134.6 mm of rain fell in Piteå in
January, making it the wettest January since at
least 1860. Widespread heavy rain on Cyprus
caused flooding and landslides. In February,
heavy rain affected countries in southern Europe
with flooding in parts of Albania, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece and
Bulgaria.
In Spain, 300 mm of rain fell in some areas of
Castellón Province between 20 and 24 March.
In May, Sweden was very wet across almost
the entire country. Several stations with rainfall
records going back more than 100 years hit
their monthly records. In Stockholm, it was
the wettest May in 200 years. Finland, Norway
and Denmark had their second-wettest May
on record.
France saw three periods marked by particularly
heavy rainfall. The first was 23–24 August,
when 108.1 mm of rain fell in one hour in
Montpellier, Languedoc region. That is the

highest one-hour total recorded at the site.
From 12 to 13 September, a number of stations
recorded rainfall totals in excess of 200 mm. On
3 October, close to 200 mm of rain fell in two
hours in parts of the Alpes-Maritimes region
and 20 people were killed.
In September, Irish stations in Galway and Mayo
saw record daily rainfall levels of over 100 mm
on 11 and 13 September, which led to flooding. In mid-October, heavy rain in Bosnia and
Herzegovina led to flooding in Mostar and Stolac
City. In December, the United Kingdom had its
highest ever 24-hour rainfall total (341.4 mm
at Honister Pass in Cumbria in the 24 hours to
1800 GMT on 5 December 2015) and its wettest
December on record.
Some areas were particularly dry. In April, there
were very dry conditions in Austria: Klagenfurt
experienced its second-driest April since 1813,
which led to forest fires. Between late May and
mid-August, some western parts of Slovakia
recorded their lowest rainfall totals since 1872.
In July, parts of France experienced record low
monthly precipitation. Large areas of Serbia
experienced extreme drought in July. Estonia
had its driest October since 1961. Austria had
its second-driest December since 1858, and
Hungary its third-driest since 1901.

TROPICAL CYCLONES
Globally, a total of 91 tropical storms formed
during 2015. A named storm is defined as a
tropical storm where the wind speed equals
or exceeds 63 km/h. The figure of 91 storms is
above the 1981–2010 annual average of about
85 storms, and slightly above the seventy-fifth
percentile of 90 storms. The lowest number
of storms in a year in the modern satellite era
was 67 in 2010.
In the North Atlantic basin, there were 11 named
storms, of which 4 became hurricanes; 2 of
these (Danny and Joaquin) were classified as
major hurricanes. This is slightly below the
long-term average of 12 storms, 6 hurricanes
and 3 major hurricanes. Hurricane activity in the
North Atlantic is typically suppressed during
an El Niño. Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE)
is a measure of the combined strength and
duration of tropical storms. In 2015, the ACE
for the Atlantic basin was about 68% of the
long-term average.
In the Eastern North Pacific basin, 18 named
storms formed; 13 of these storms became
hurricanes and 9 became major hurricanes. The
1981–2010 averages for a year are 15 storms,
8 hurricanes and 4 major hurricanes. Hurricane

Patricia (20 –24 October) was the strongest
hurricane on record in either the Atlantic or
eastern North Pacific basins, with maximum
sustained wind speeds of 346 km/h. It made
landfall on the Mexican coast on 24 October
with 241 km/h winds in a sparsely populated
area. The remnants of Patricia contributed to
heavy rainfall and flooding in the southern plains
of the United States and the lower Mississippi
river valley. The ACE for the Eastern North
Pacific was about 44% higher than the long-term
average and was the highest in the basin since
1993. The Central Pacific region experienced
7 named storms in total, 3 of which reached
hurricane strength.
In the Western North Pacific basin, 27 named
storms were recorded. Of these, 18 reached
typhoon strength. The estimated averages for
the whole year are 26 storms and 17 typhoons.
Typhoon Koppu, known locally as Lando, made
landfall in the Philippines in October, affecting
many people and causing widespread damage.
Because of the tracks taken by the storms, no
storm warnings were issued in Hong Kong,
China in August and September for the first
time since 1946. Six typhoons made landfall
over China. Typhoons Chan-hom, Soudelor and
Mujigae led to combined estimated economic
losses of US$ 8 billion.
In the North Indian Ocean, 4 named storms
formed, compared with an annual average of 5.
Komen developed as a tropical depression over
the north-eastern part of the Bay of Bengal near

20

the coast of Bangladesh. It strengthened at
sea before making landfall as a tropical storm.
Rainfall associated with the storm and monsoon rains led to severe flooding and landslides
in Myanmar. Bangladesh also suffered from
flash floods and landslides. The storm came
after an earlier period of heavy rains from 24
June. Tropical cyclone Chapala made landfall
in Yemen and led to substantial flooding. This
was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall
in Yemen at hurricane strength during the satellite era. Socotra Island was affected by both
cyclones Megh and Chapala. Megh developed
shortly after Chapala made landfall. Chapala
was a Category 3 storm when it passed to
the north of Socotra Island, while Megh was
Category 2.
In the South-West Indian Ocean, 10 named
storms developed during the 2014/2015 season,
slightly above the long-term average of 9. Of
these, 4 reached tropical cyclone strength and
2 became intense tropical cyclones. In the
calendar year 2015, which contains the end of
one season and the start of another, 11 named
storms formed.
In the Australian basin, the 2014/2015 season saw 9 named storms develop. There were
7 named storms during 2015, comprising the
end of one season and the start of another. That
was slightly below the long-term average of 10.
Cyclone Marcia was the most intense cyclone
to make landfall that has been observed so far
south on the east coast, at least in the modern
satellite era. It was unusual that Raquel occurred
at the end of June. Such a late storm in the
eastern Australian region has not previously
been recorded in the satellite era. The only
previously recorded winter cyclone was in
early June 1972.
There were 11 named storms in the SouthWest Pacific. The annual average is 6. Tropical
cyclone Pam made landfall over Vanuatu as a
Category 5 cyclone on 13 March and destroyed
many homes. The Government of Tuvalu
declared a state of emergency on 13 March
after severe inundations from the storm surge
and sea swell. Kiribati reported severe damage
on its three southern islands. The Solomon
Islands were also affected. There were 8 named
storms during the 2014/2015 season.

OZONE-DEPLETING SUBSTANCES
Due to the success of the Montreal Protocol on
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, the
use of halons and chlorofluorocarbons has been
discontinued. However, these compounds will
remain in the atmosphere for many decades
because of their long lifetime. There is still
more than enough chlorine and bromine in the
atmosphere to cause the complete destruction
of ozone at certain altitudes in Antarctica from
August to December. As a result, the size of the
ozone hole from one year to the next is mostly
governed by meteorological conditions.
During the austral winter and spring of 2015,
temperatures in the stratosphere were colder
than the long-term average (1979–2014). The
southern polar vortex was particularly stable
and concentric around the South Pole. The area
encircled by the vortex was larger than usual,
and the average for October was the largest on
record, according to ERA Interim data from the
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather

Forecasts. Consequently, the onset of ozone
depletion was delayed.
However, once ozone depletion started in
mid-August, it proceeded rapidly. The area of
the ozone hole reached its seasonal maximum
of 28.2 million km2 on 2 October, according to
analysis by NASA (Figure 17). An analysis carried
out at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological
Institute (KNMI) shows that the 2015 ozone hole
area reached a maximum of 27.1 million km2
on 9 October. Thus the ozone hole was either
the fourth- or fifth-largest on record after 2000,
2003 and 2006 in both analyses, as well as 1998
in the KNMI analysis.
Data from NASA indicate that, for the 60 consecutive days in 2015 when the ozone hole was
at its largest, the average area of the hole was
25.6 million km2. By that measure, the 2015 ozone
hole was the largest on record. In the KNMI
analysis, the equivalent area was 24.2 million km2.
That makes the 2015 ozone hole the joint second
largest, equal with 1998 and behind 2006.

Ocean heat content increase reveals
unabated global warming
Matthew D. Palmer, 3 Susan Wijffels, 4
John A. Church 4
In a stable climate, the amount of energy that
the Earth system absorbs from the Sun is balanced by the amount of energy emitted back
to space by the Earth as thermal infrared radiation. However, increases in greenhouse gas
concentrations have created an imbalance by
reducing the emitted radiation and causing
energy to accumulate in the Earth system over
time. The rate of energy increase in the climate
system – Earth’s energy imbalance – is the
most fundamental metric that defines the rate
of global climate change.
On timescales longer than about a year, the
vast majority (more than 90%) of Earth’s energy
imbalance goes into heating the oceans. Thus
tracking ocean temperatures and associated
changes in ocean heat content (OHC) allow us to
monitor variations in Earth’s energy imbalance
over time. Observations of OHC have been pivotal for the assessment of climate models and
the detection and attribution of human climate
change. They are also essential to “anchor”
satellite-based estimates of changes in Earth’s
energy imbalance.
As the oceans warm, they expand, resulting
in both global and regional sea-level rise.
Increased OHC accounts for about 40% of the
observed global sea-level increase over the
past 60 years and is expected to make a similar contribution to future sea-level rise. The
warming of ocean waters adjacent to the ice
sheets can also affect the flow of ice into the
ocean, which is another key component of
sea-level rise. Therefore, monitoring global
and regional OHC, along with tide gauges and
satellite measurements of sea level and ocean
mass, is essential for understanding historical
and future sea-level change.
In the past, one of the challenges for estimating
the rate of OHC change has been the historical
sparseness of the ocean observing system.

Ocean subsurface temperature measurements
have mostly relied on ship-based instruments,
which often sample only the upper few hundred
metres. As a result, many historical estimates
of global OHC change are limited to about the
upper 700 m, with large uncertainties prior to
the 1970s, when widespread ocean sampling
became possible through more affordable
observing technologies.
The early 2000s saw a revolution in our ability
to monitor global OHC and freshwater content
through the inception of the Argo array of
autonomous profiling floats. This array reached
maturity in 2006 with approximately 3 000 floats
distributed around most of the globe; they
measure temperature and salt content over
the upper 2 km of the oceans every 10 days.
The Argo observations usher in a new era of
monitoring Earth’s energy imbalance and the
various factors that shape its evolution over
time.
While ocean temperatures below 300 m
(Figure 18 b, c and d) show a relatively steady
increase over the period 2006–2015, ocean surface temperatures (Figure 18 a) show additional
multi-year variability primarily due to variation
in the tropical Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean
associated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation.
Most of these near-surface oscillations are balanced by deeper, opposing changes between
100 m and 300 m, and the 0–2 000-metre OHC
rises steadily across this period. Land-surface
temperatures show more variability again, with
particularly large variations from year to year.
According to estimates shown in Figure 18 e,
between 75% and 99% of the warming occurs
in the southern hemisphere, predominantly
between 30°S and 50°S.
The obser ved OHC increase implies that
Earth’s energy imbalance is nearly constant
at 0.65–0.80 W/m2, expressed as an average
value over the surface area of the planet.
About 75%– 80% of this value comes from
the upper 2 000 m, as illustrated in Figure 18,
with the remaining 20%–25% coming from the
deeper ocean. The observed energy imbalance
inferred by OHC change is within the range of
0.6–1.0 W/m2 projected for the 2006–2015 period
using climate models.

becomes apparent at ever greater depth in the
global oceans.

Monitoring OHC enables us to better track the
underlying rate of climate change on decadal
and shorter timescales and to better quantify the
effect of other climatic factors on Earth’s energy
imbalance, such as changes in man-made and
volcanic aerosols. While Argo observations are
currently limited to the upper 2 000 m of ocean
depths, the technology now exists to profile
over nearly the full ocean depth (up to 6 km).
These new observations will become essential
for monitoring climate and sea-level change
as the impact of Earth’s energy imbalance
