Foreword
The dramatic impact of climate variability and
climate change continued to be felt all over the
world throughout 2013. The WMO Statement
on the Status of the Global Climate in 2013 provides a snapshot of global and regional trends
in weather and climate over the past year and
highlights some of the year’s most significant
extreme events.
The year 2013 tied with 2007 as the sixth warmest since global records began in 1850. Although
the climate varies naturally from year to year,
it is clear that the planet is experiencing an
overall warming trend. Thirteen of the fourteen
warmest years on record have all occurred in
the twenty-first century, and each of the past
three decades has been warmer than the last,
culminating with 2001–2010 as the warmest
decade on record. As highlighted by the Fifth
Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, this steady warming
is caused by rising levels of anthropogenic
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
We now have a better understanding of humaninduced climate change, and climate scientists
can increasingly determine how large-scale
pressure and temperature patterns influence
the weather. The best known of these is the
El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the
Pacific Ocean, which affects weather patterns
around the world through “teleconnections”. In
addition to ENSO, the North Atlantic Oscillation,
the Arctic Oscillation, jet streams and other
recurring patterns also of ten explain why
weather conditions are wetter, drier, warmer,
cooler or stormier than average.

Weather forecasting, including the prediction of
storms and other hazards, has greatly evolved
in recent years. In October 2013, the events surrounding Cyclone Phailin, the second strongest
tropical cyclone to strike India since modern
records began, showed how improved forecasting, combined with government action to
build national resilience and provide shelters,
greatly reduces the loss of life. Nevertheless,
extreme events can still cause fatalities and
destroy property, so we must continue enhancing preparedness, strengthening early warning
systems and implementing a multi-hazard
approach to disaster risk reduction.
The Statement draws on input from leading
research institutions and from the National
Meteorological and Hydrological Services of
WMO Members. This summary has been published in all six official WMO languages in order
to reach the broadest possible readership.
However, I also strongly encourage interested
readers to examine the more detailed underlying
report, which is available on the WMO website.

Preface
This Statement is based on datasets and information that were made available by WMO
Members and partners for 2013 and assessed in
their global and regional geographical context.
Comparisons were made with climatological
averages and records (historical background)
whenever possible and appropriate.
The global temperature assessment is based on
three independent datasets that are maintained
by the Met Office Hadley Centre and the Climatic
Research Unit of the University of East Anglia
(HadCRU), both in the United Kingdom; the
National Climatic Data Center of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NCDC–NOAA), based in the United States;
and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies
(GISS) operated by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA), also in the
United States. The HadCRU dataset extends
back to 1850, and the NCDC and GISS datasets
(and hence the combined dataset) extend back
to 1880. Other datasets have also been used
for additional analysis.
The content was developed and peer-reviewed
by several experts affiliated with international
and regional climate institutions, centres and
programmes, and by the world’s National
Meteorological and Hydrological Services
(NMHSs), the main providers of the underlying observations and climate information.
More than 50 NMHSs provided direct input

to the Statement following the WMO call for
contributions. Many others made their data
and climate reports available on their websites,
and these were accessed when necessary.
When doubts arose as to facts and figures,
WMO communicated with the relevant national
source in order to verify the information before
its inclusion in the Statement. The definition
of the Regions is based on the WMO regional
structure, as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Africa (Region I)
Asia (Region II)
South America (Region III)
North America, Central America and the
Caribbean (Region IV)
South-West Pacific (Region V)
Europe (Region VI)

WMO Climate System Monitoring uses Essential
Climate Variables (ECVs) as defined by the
Global Climate Observing System. Some 50
ECVs have been identified as fundamental for
global observation. This Statement incorporates
assessments of the status of the global climate
and observed extremes detected using ECV
data and products, including air temperature,
precipitation, stratospheric ozone and long-lived
greenhouse gases (atmospheric ECVs); snow
cover, ice sheets and soil moisture (terrestrial
ECVs); as well as sea ice, sea level rise, sea
surface temperature and ocean acidification
(oceanographic ECVs).

TEMPERATURES
The year 2013 tied with 2007 as the sixth warmest since global records began in 1850. The
global average surface temperature was 0.50°C
±0.10°C (0.90°F ±0.18°F) above the 1961–1990
average and 0.03°C (0.05°F) above the 2001–2010
average. The past year was also warmer than
both 2011 and 2012, which, though marked by
cooling La Niña conditions, were 0.43°C and
0.46°C above average, respectively.
Warming El Niño and cooling La Niña events
are major drivers of natural variability in the
climate system. Neither condition was present
during 2013, which was among the four warmest

ENSO-neutral years on record. Thirteen of the
fourteen warmest years on record, including
2013, have all occurred in the twenty-first century. The warmest on record are 2010 and 2005,
followed by 1998. El Niño conditions dominated
the early months of 2010 and 1998, and weak
El Niño-type conditions extended from 2004
to the first half of 2005.
To arrive at these figures, WMO takes an average
of the three main global temperature datasets,
which are managed separately and use different methodologies. Other datasets produce
similar but slightly different results. A separate
temperature analysis conducted by the Japan
Meteorological Agency, for example, estimates
that 2013 was the second warmest year on
record. According to reanalysis data from the
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts, 2013 tied with 1998 as the fourth
warmest since 1958.
Because the capacity for heat absorption differs
over land and over sea, the air over the land
tends to warm up faster. Across the world’s
land surfaces, the 2013 global air temperature
was 0.85°C ±0.17°C above the 1961−1990 average and 0.06°C above the 2001−2010 average,
the fourth highest on record. A very warm
November–December period that ranked second
behind 2006 contributed to this high temperature anomaly. Over the global ocean, the surface
temperature for 2013 tied with 2004 and 2006 as

Australia. Exceptional warm conditions were
also present during the winter, with New Zealand
experiencing its warmest winter on record. The

Temperature anomaly (°C)

The northern hemisphere’s weather patterns
during early 2013 were largely influenced by
the Arctic Oscillation. This brought coolerthan-average spring temperatures to much
of Europe, the south-eastern United States,
north-western Russian Federation and parts
of Japan. The Arctic region, meanwhile, was
considerably warmer than average, along with
much of central and northern Africa, the eastern
Mediterranean, southern Russian Federation
and much of China. This so-called warm Arctic,
cold continents pattern is characteristic of the
Arctic Oscillation’s negative phase. The year
2013 saw the most negative Arctic Oscillation
on record for the month of March. A similar
pattern with high pressure over Greenland and
low pressure to the south re-emerged in late
spring, once again causing cold Arctic air to
surge into western and central Europe.

throughout the year across parts of the southern
hemisphere, 2013 was the warmest year on
record in Australia, second warmest in Argentina
and third warmest in New Zealand. Modelling
experiments have indicated that the odds of the
record Australian hot summer occurring were
increased fivefold by human-induced climate
change (see page 20 and accompanying figure).

the regional level, however, varied significantly.
For example, wetter-than-average conditions
were seen across most of Greenland, the
southern Arabian Peninsula, central India and
western China. Drier-than-average conditions
were present over the western United States,
much of northern Canada, northern Siberia and
the eastern inland of Australia.
Winter snow cover in North America has varied widely over the past few years. During
the 2012/2013 winter, snow cover extent was
500 000 km 2 above the 1981–2010 average,
resulting in the fourteenth largest winter extent
for the continent since records began in 1966.
During the spring, North American snow cover
was 830 000 km2 above average, making it the
tenth largest spring extent for the continent
and the largest since 1997.
During the same period, snow cover extent across
the Eurasian continent was 1.71 million km2 above
the 1981–2010 average, the third largest winter
extent on record for this region and the largest
since 2003. In the spring, the continent’s snow
cover contracted significantly to 430 000 km2
below average, resulting in the fourteenth smallest extent on record for the season. In May,

Eurasian snow cover dipped to 7.3 million km2,
setting a new record low for that month.
As further evidence of the rapid response of
the Arctic cryosphere to increasing air temperatures, the northern hemisphere June snow
cover is currently decreasing at a faster rate
than Arctic summer minimum sea-ice extent,
and at rates that exceed the projection of climate models. June 2013 snow cover across the
hemisphere was the second lowest, greater
only than the record low of 2012.
Soil moisture is a key variable for monitoring the climate system because it strongly
influences the exchange of water and energy
bet ween the land sur face and the atmosphere. Very wet soil conditions resulting from
hydrometeorological events were noticeable
and had an impact on floods in a number of
regions including eastern parts of the Russian
Federation, north-eastern China, India, the
Philippines and central Europe. On the other
hand, annual soil moisture anomalies indicated
dryness in the southern hemisphere, where
Australia, South America and southern Africa
experienced severe drought conditions during
the first part of the year.

Another way to assess the state of the Arctic
sea ice is to estimate the age of the ice, given
that first-year ice is the thinnest and most susceptible to melting. Ice that was four years of
age and older decreased from 18 per cent of
the ice cover in March 1984 to 2 per cent in
March 2012. It increased slightly to 3 per cent
in 2013. In March 1984, 56 per cent of the ice
pack was composed of first-year ice, while in
March 2013 first-year ice comprised 78 per cent
of total ice cover at its peak.
The Arctic reached its annual minimum seaice cover on 13 September, at 5.10 million km2
or 18 per cent below the 1981–2010 average
minimum, making it the sixth smallest annual
minimum on record. All seven of the lowest
Arctic sea-ice extents in the satellite record
have occurred in the last seven years, beginning
with 2007. September Arctic sea-ice extent has
decreased at an average rate of 13.7 per cent
per decade. The total minimum sea-ice volume,
which combines measures of ice extent and
model simulations of ice thickness, was higher in
2013 than in 2010, 2011 and 2012, but lower than
in 2007 and well below the 1979−2012 average.
February marked the end of the Antarctic seaice melt season in 2013. The annual minimum
extent of sea ice was reached on 20 February
at 3.68 million km2. This was the second largest
annual minimum sea-ice extent for Antarctica.
In addition, Antarctic sea-ice extent reached a
record maximum for the second year in a row.
On 1 October, it was 19.57 million km2, 2.7 per
cent higher than the 1981−2010 average.
September Antarctic sea-ice extent has increased
at an average rate of 1.1 per cent per decade.

Extent (millions of square kilometres)

Arctic sea-ice extent reached its annual maximum on 15 March at 15.13 million km2. This
was approximately 0.5 million km2 below the
average 1981–2010 annual maximum, making
it the sixth smallest maximum sea-ice extent
since satellite records began in 1979. During
the 2012/2013 growth season, Arctic sea-ice
extent grew by 11.72 million km2, the largest
seasonal increase on record; this growth can
be explained by the record small sea-ice extent
of September 2012. Arctic maximum sea-ice
extent in March has decreased at an average
rate of 2.6 per cent per decade.

Scientists believe that changes in atmospheric
circulation over the past three decades, which
have weakened the prevailing winds that circle
Antarctica, may be a factor. The increasing extent
of the ice may also be linked to changing ocean
circulation and a build-up of cold freshwater
on the surface of the Southern Ocean due to
increasing precipitation and melting land-based
ice shelves.

Melting at the surface of the Greenland ice sheet
was much less dramatic in 2013 than in the
record year of 2012. It peaked in late July, when
satellites detected melting over 44 per cent of
the surface. This coincided with record warmth
in south-western Greenland (30 July saw a
temperature of 25.9°C in Maniitsoq, the highest temperature ever recorded in Greenland).
The last decade has experienced accelerated
melting of the sea-ice cover and mass loss of
the Greenland ice sheet.

OCEANS
The ocean acts as an effective buffer for the
climate system by absorbing and storing a large
amount of excess carbon and heat from the
atmosphere. It has absorbed approximately one
quarter of all the carbon dioxide (CO2) released
into the atmosphere by humans since the start
of the industrial revolution. This absorbed CO2
forms a weak carbonic acid, which causes ocean

acidification. As a result, the pH of the ocean
has decreased by 0.11, which corresponds
approximately to a 30 per cent increase in
acidity. Ocean acidification is already harming
corals, shellfish and other marine life.
While the rate at which surface air temperatures
are rising has slowed in recent years, heat
continues to be trapped in the Earth system,
mostly as increased ocean heat content. About
93 per cent of the excess heat trapped in the
Earth system between 1971 and 2010 was taken
up by the ocean. From around 1980 to 2000,
the ocean gained about 50 zettajoules (10 21
joules) of heat. Between 2000 and 2013, it added
about three times that amount. Prior to 2000,
most of the heat was trapped between the
sea surface and a depth of 700 m. Since then,
most of the heat has been stored at depths of
700 m to 2 000 m. The increased uptake in this
region may be due to changes in atmospheric
and ocean circulation patterns in the tropical
Pacific and to interactions with large-scale
climate patterns such as ENSO and the Pacific
Decadal Oscillation.
Globally, sea level has risen by 19 cm since the
start of the twentieth century, mostly because
of the thermal expansion of the oceans and the
melting of glaciers and ice caps. Since measurements began in 1993, sea level has been
rising at about 2.9–3.2 mm/yr (based on two
separate estimates, each with an uncertainty of
±0.4 mm/yr), with some year-to-year variability.

Preliminary analyses indicate that the global
average sea level reached a new record high in
March. Some regions of the globe are experiencing greater sea-level rise than others (some
are even experiencing declining sea levels) due
to local variations in currents, land movements
and ocean warming. The region of the Pacific
Ocean near the Philippines has observed some
of the highest rising sea-level rates over the past
half century. This contributed to the enormous
devastation in parts of the Philippine islands,
when Typhoon Haiyan struck in November and
caused a massive storm surge.

2.2°C and 4°C above average, respectively,
contributed to one of the 10 warmest years
in the country since 1950.
Above-average precipitation occurred in
northern Mali and adjacent areas in Algeria.
Below-average precipitation was recorded
along the Gulf of Guinea, from Côte d’Ivoire
to Nigeria and over the southernmost parts of
Ghana, Benin and Togo.
Following nearly three decades of low seasonal
rainfall and a second consecutive year of failed
rains, Angola and Namibia suffered one of the
worst droughts of the past 30 years. An estimated 1.5 million people in southern Angola
faced food insecurity, as did nearly 800 000
in Namibia. Historic drought conditions also
affected La Réunion from May to September.
In Mozambique, severe flooding that killed at
least 113 people and displaced 185 000 occurred
in January. Heavy rainfall between March and
April led to flooding that damaged crops and
displaced thousands of people throughout
parts of southern Somalia and eastern Kenya.
Heavy rains also fell in Sudan in August, causing

some 500 000. Bamako, Mali, and Marrakech,
Morocco were also affected by floods.

ASIA
Summer was extremely hot in many parts of Asia.
Japan, for example, had its hottest summer on
record, including a national record high of 41°C
in Shimanto, Kochi Prefecture, on 12 August.
Many daily maximum temperature records were
broken in Hong Kong, China, in March and April,
with some locations exceeding 40°C.
China saw its fourth warmest year since national
records began in 1961. The most severe heatwave since 1951 occurred in southern China
between July and August, with temperatures
over 40°C. The region also experienced severe
drought conditions. Approximately 78 million
people and over 8 million hectares of farmland
were affected, with direct economic losses
estimated at US$ 7.7 billion.
In India, Nagpur recorded its all-time high temperature of 47.9°C on 22 May, while Amritsar

On 2 April, La Plata, Argentina, received about
300 mm of rainfall in just three hours. The
torrential downpour led to flash floods that
resulted in more than 50 fatalities, making
this one of the worst weather disasters in the
history of Argentina. Many states in Brazil also
had extremely heavy rainfall during December,
with at least seven cities setting new precipitation records. In south-eastern Brazil, the city
of Aimores received more than four times its

Mexico experienced a record warm July and
August and a warm autumn.

NORTH AMERICA, CENTRAL AMERICA AND
THE CARIBBEAN

In Canada, 2013 was the thirteenth driest year
on record. Nevertheless, torrential downpours
overwhelmed Calgary and vast areas of southern Alberta in June, forcing 100 000 people
to evacuate their homes and causing close
to US$ 6 billion in damage. The contiguous
United States was wetter than average for the
year, with some geographical variations. Two
states, Michigan and North Dakota, experienced
record wet conditions. Alaska observed its third
wettest year on record and the wettest in the
past 50 years.

Temperatures across most of North America
were above average during 2013, but were
more moderate overall than in 2012. Winter was
warmer than average in Canada and the United
States, although spring in the contiguous United
States was the coolest since 1996. Temperatures
in the United States rebounded during the summer, and the warmth continued into September.

A major drought that encompassed large parts

In Australia, 2013 was the warmest year since
national records began in 1910, at 1.20°C above
average and 0.17°C higher than the previous
record in 2005. January was the hottest month
ever observed in the country. The summer
(December–February) and spring (September–
November) were both the hottest on record,
and the winter (June–August) was the third
warmest. On 7 January, a new national average

daily maximum temperature of 40.30°C was set.
The temperature in Moomba, South Australia,
reached 49.6°C, the highest recorded in the state
since 1960. Hobart recorded its all-time high
observed temperature of 41.8°C on 4 January,
while the temperature in Sydney reached 45.8°C
on 18 January, the hottest since records began.
During the same month, a tropical low caused
major flooding along much of the east coast of
Queensland and northern New South Wales. In
Queensland, five people were killed and 8 000
residents were forced to evacuate as floods
reached record heights.
New Zealand experienced its warmest winter on
record and its third warmest year overall since
national records began in 1909. The northern
and eastern parts of the country had their
driest year on record and suffered drought,
while other parts experienced near-record high
annual rainfall.
Drier-than-normal weather conditions since late
2012 resulted in severe drought conditions in
the northern Marshall Islands. This led to critical
shortages of drinking water, damaged food
crops and the declaration of a national state
of disaster. Abundant rain fell in June over the
south of Atuona in the Marquesas Islands of
French Polynesia. On 5 June, the region received
66.1 mm of precipitation in one hour. Heavy
rains following an extra-tropical depression fell
on New Caledonia during 1–3 July. A total of
714 mm of rain fell in a 24-hour period, setting

400 mm of rain fell in some localized areas
during 29 May–3 June. Austria observed its
wettest May–June period since records began
in 1858. Some rivers reached historical record
heights; in Germany, Passau saw its highest
water level since 1501.

Summer was very hot for many European countries. Portugal endured one of its worst July
heatwaves since 1941. The extended August
heatwave in Austria set a new national record
high of 40.5°C. On 8 August, many stations in
Slovenia observed their highest temperatures
on record, with several exceeding 40°C. On
the same day in Slovakia, the temperature in
Bratislava reached 39.4°C, the highest since
observations began in 1850.

During 10–15 December, a rare snowstorm hit
parts of the Middle East. In Egypt, snow fell in
Cairo for the first time in 112 years. The Syrian
Arab Republic, Jordan and Israel also received
unprecedented amounts of snow. Cold weather
accompanied the storm. On 15 December, the
temperature in Shoubak, Jordan, plummeted
to –16°C, the lowest temperature ever recorded
in the country.

The beginning of autumn was also anomalously
warm over Europe. Unusual warmth settled
over the Russian Federation towards the end of
2013. Following its record warmest November of
5.3°C above the 1961–1990 average, the country
observed its record warmest December, at 4.6°C
above average. Moscow and Saint Petersburg
broke their daily maximum temperature records
on 25 December by 0.4°C and 1.4°C, respectively.
Extreme precipitation in the Alpine region and
in Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Poland
and Switzerland caused the most intense and
extended flooding in the Danube and Elbe river

An extra-tropical cyclone struck the United
Kingdom on 28 October, the strongest autumn
storm to hit the region since 2002. During
4–7 December, an extra-tropical cyclone moved
from west to east across northern Europe; the
resulting storm surges, including in the United
Kingdom and the Netherlands, were the worst
in the past six decades. In Germany, the storm
surge reached 4–6 m above mean sea level, but
dykes were 8 m tall.

TROPICAL CYCLONES
Globally, there were 94 storms during 2013
(wind speeds equal to or greater than 63 km/h).

The number of storms was higher than in
2012 (84 storms), 2011 (74 storms) and 2010
(67 storms, the lowest number in the modern
satellite era). It should be noted that the total
number of storms does not necessarily correlate
with the number of storms that affect inhabited
land areas.
The Atlantic Ocean basin experienced 13 named
storms, just above the 1981–2010 average of
12 storms, but below the recent decade of
2001–2010, which saw an average of 15 storms
per year. No storms attained major intensity
(wind speed of 178 km/h). The intensity and
duration of the season’s hurricanes were measured as 33 per cent of the average, the lowest
value since 1994.

The Eastern North Pacific basin had above-average hurricane activity in 2013. There were
a total of 20 storms, 9 of which intensified to
hurricane status and 1 of which (Raymond )
became a major hurricane. Two hurricanes from
two separate basins (Ingrid in the North Atlantic
and Manuel in the Eastern North Pacific) struck
Mexico nearly simultaneously on 15 September.
This unusual event, which had not occurred

since 1958, displaced tens of thousands of
residents and damaged some 22 000 homes
in Guerrero state.
The Wes tern Nor th Pacific Ocean basin
recorded a total of 31 storms, above the
1981−2010 average of 26 and well above the
most recent decadal average (2001–2010) of
23, making this the most active season since
2004. Of these storms, 13 strengthened into
typhoons. Typhoon Usagi (Odette) was one
of the strongest cyclones globally to have
formed in 2013, with 10-minute wind speeds
reaching 204 km/h. In November, Typhoon
Haiyan (named Yolanda in the Philippines)
became one of the strongest storms on record
to ever make landfall anywhere on the globe,
with maximum 10-minute wind speeds reaching 230 km/h prior to landfall. Haiyan caused
significant damage across South-East Asia, and
the Philippines bore the brunt of the devastation. Storm surges of 5–6 m were reported in
heavily populated low-lying areas of Tacloban
and in the islands of Samar and Leyte. Damage
caused by immediate surge and following
inundation was the worst in the past several
decades, with more than 6 200 deaths and

below average, with 5 named tropical storms
compared with the 1981–2010 average of 12 and
the 2001–2010 decadal average of 10. Four of
these storms attained severe tropical cyclone
status, similar to the 1981–2010 average. Severe
Tropical Cyclone Evan was the strongest storm
in the basin during the season, killing 10 people
and causing damages of over US$ 300 million
in Samoa and Fiji alone.

The North Indian Ocean basin recorded a
slightly above-average season with five storms
compared with the 1981–2010 average of four;
three of these storms (Phailin, Lehar and Madi)
evolved into very severe cyclonic storms.
Phailin forced 1.1 million residents in Odisha
and Andhra Pradesh states to be evacuated
ahead of the storm, one of the largest such
evacuations in the history of India.

GREENHOUSE GASES AND OZONEDEPLETING SUBSTANCES
The WMO Global Atmosphere Watch Programme
reports that atmospheric levels of CO2, methane
(CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) reached new highs
in 2012. Data for 2013 have not yet been compiled. Globally averaged levels of CO2 reached
393.1±0.13 parts per million (ppm), 41 per cent
above pre-industrial levels (before 1750). In May
2013, for the first time since observations began,
daily average CO2 levels at several stations
outside the Arctic exceeded the symbolic threshold of 400 ppm. (CO2 levels reach a seasonal
maximum in the northern hemisphere spring,
before vegetation growth and other processes
start to absorb the CO2.)

Ten tropical storms were observed in the SouthWest Indian Ocean basin during the 2012/2013
tropical cyclone season. This is close to the
long-term 1981–2010 average and the 2001–2010
average of nine tropical storms. Seven of these
storms reached tropical cyclone status, which
is well above the average of four.
The Australian basin recorded a near-average
2012/2013 cyclone season, with 10 tropical
storms compared with the 1981–2010 average
of 11 and the most recent decadal average of 9.
Four of these storms became severe tropical
cyclones. The strongest cyclone of the season
was Rusty, with a financial impact likely exceeding US$ 100 million.

As a result, the NOAA Annual Greenhouse Gas
Index for 2012 was 1.32, representing a 32 per
cent increase in total radiative forcing (relative
to 1750) by all long-lived greenhouse gases
since 1990. Rising concentrations of greenhouse
gases are the main driver of climate change.
While chlorofluorocarbons, halons and other
harmful chemicals have been phased out
under the Montreal Protocol on Substances

that Deplete the Ozone Layer, these gases can
remain in the atmosphere for many years.
They deplete the stratospheric ozone layer
that protects life on Ear th. The resulting
Antarctic ozone hole contributes to changes
in wind patterns and the regional climate in
Antarctica. The Antarctic ozone hole reached a
maximum of 23.1 million km2 on 15 September
and 24 million km2 on 16 September. This is
more than the seasonal maxima observed in
2010 and 2012, but somewhat less than the
24.4 million km2 seasonal maximum reached
in 2011.

Explaining the summer 2012/2013 and annual
2013 record warmth in Australia

University of Melbourne, Australia

THE IMPORTANCE OF ATTRIBUTION SCIENCE
In 2012, the World Climate Research Programme
(WCRP), which is sponsored by WMO, the
Intergovernmental Oceanic Commission of
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization and the International
Council for Science, identified six grand challenges within the climate science community.
The prediction and attribution of extreme events
is one of these grand challenges. Extreme climate events that have large impacts on society,
both physically and economically, are increasingly requiring prompt and credible scientific
explanations.
Today, there is a growing ability within the climate
science community to untangle the complexities
of understanding the natural and human-induced
factors contributing to specific extreme weather
and climate events. Recent analyses of various
events show that the effects of natural weather
and climate fluctuations played a key role in the
intensity and evolution of many extreme events.
However, for some events, the analyses revealed
compelling evidence that human-caused climate
change, due to the emission of heat-trapping
gases, also contributed. Understanding the
influences on such events helps us to better
understand how and why extreme events are
changing. In addition, calculating how the odds
of a particular extreme event have changed provides a way to quantify the influence of climate
change on these events.
The Australia summer 2012/2013 area-averaged
surface air temperature was the hottest since
national records began in 1910. In addition to
the summer, temperature records were also
broken on daily and monthly timescales. Later
in 2013, new national 12-month period temperature records were set in three consecutive
months: for the period ending in August, then
in September and once again in October. Lastly,
a new calendar-year record was set at the end
of 2013.
Contributing fac tors to these record
2013 Australian temperatures, including

20

human-induced climate change and natural
variability associated with El Niño-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO), were investigated using
a suite of climate model simulations. Using
nine state-of-the-art global climate models
that participated in the WCRP Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 5, changes in
the probability of extreme Australian summer temperatures due to human influences
were investigated. These nine models simulate well the observed probability distribution
of Australian average summer and 12-month
average temperatures since 1910.
The probability of hot Australian summers was
calculated for model experiments incorporating
human influences (changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, aerosols and
ozone in the atmosphere) and natural causes
(solar radiation changes and emissions from
volcanic eruptions), and this was compared
with the results from a parallel set of experiments that included only natural causes. The
comparison shows that human-induced climate
change substantially increased the likelihood
of the record-breaking Australian summer of
2013; when human influences were included in
model simulations, the probability of very hot
summer temperatures across Australia, such
as in 2013, increased at least fivefold. These
types of extreme Australian summers become
even more frequent in simulations of the future
under further global warming.
The recent record Australian summer was also
notable because it occurred when ENSO conditions were neutral to weak La Niña; these
conditions typically produce cooler temperatures across Australia. Prior to 2013, six of the
eight hottest Australian summers occurred
during El Niño years, but natural ENSO variations are very unlikely to explain the record
2013 Australian heat.
Using the same modelling approach, preliminary analysis of the Australian area-average
temperature record for the calendar year
2013 indicates that human-induced causes
vastly increased the odds of setting a new

temperature record. In the model experiments,
it is virtually impossible to reach such a high
temperature due to natural climate variations
alone. In simulations with only natural causes
considered, none of the 13 000 model years
analysed exceed the previous hottest year
in Australia, which was observed in 2005.
Conversely, in simulations for the period
2006 –2020 that include both natural and
human-induced causes, such records occur
approximately once every 10 years.
In summary, comparing climate model simulations with and without human factors shows that
the record hot Australian summer of 2012/2013
was about five times as likely as a result of
human-induced influence on climate and that

the record hot calendar year of 2013 would
have been virtually impossible without human
contributions of heat-trapping gases, illustrating
that some extreme events are becoming much
more likely due to climate change.
