issues, the ways they interconnect and
their potential negative impacts – are
more relevant than ever. The shared
understanding of challenges is needed
as a base for multistakeholder
collaboration, which has seen
increasing recognition as the most
effective way to address global risks and
build resilience against them. To further
inspire action, in this year’s report we
include a new section sharing examples
of risk mitigation and resilience
practices.

This 10th edition of the Global Risks
report is published at a time of profound
transformations to our global context.
Ongoing political, economic, social,
environmental and technological
developments are challenging many of
our underlying assumptions. Across
every sector of society, decision-makers
are struggling to cope with heightened
complexity and uncertainty resulting
from the world’s highly interconnected
nature and the increasing speed of
change.
Faster communication systems, closer
trade and investment links, increasing
physical mobility and enhanced access
to information have combined to bind
countries, economies and businesses
more tightly together. In the coming
decade – the time horizon of this report
– our lives will be even more intensely
shaped by transformative forces that are
under way already. The effects of
climate change are accelerating and the
uncertainty about the global geopolitical
context and the effects it will have on
international collaboration will remain. At
the same time, societies are increasingly
under pressure from economic, political
and social developments including
rising income inequality, but also
increasing national sentiment. Last but
not least, new technologies, such as the
Internet or emerging innovations will not
bear fruit if regulatory mechanisms at
the international and national levels
cannot be agreed upon.
In a world where risks transcend
borders and sectors, the motivations
underlying the Global Risks report at its
inception in 2005 – to shed light on
global risks and help create a shared
understanding of the most pressing
6

Global Risks 2015

As in previous years, the report is based
on the annual Global Risks Perception
Survey, completed by almost 900
members of the World Economic
Forum’s global multistakeholder
community. This year’s report
introduces a new distinction between
risks and trends, which allows the
highlighting of trends as an enlarged
solution space to many possible risks.
The report also presents deep-dive
discussions of the risks posed by a
resurgence of interlinked economic and
geopolitical power plays, the rapid
urbanization of the developing world
and the exciting realm of emerging
technologies, from synthetic biology to
artificial intelligence.
The coming year offers unprecedented
opportunities for much-needed
collective action to address key global
risks, such as the Sendai world
conference on disaster risk reduction
and the 2015 United Nations Climate
Change Conference in Paris. As we
mark the 10th anniversary of the report
and highlight progress that has been
achieved over the past decade, my
hope remains that this work will
contribute to the debate on how we
think about global risks, mitigate them
and strengthen resilience.

Collaboration across countries, areas of
expertise and stakeholder groups is
necessary to effectively address global
risks. As one of the flagship reports of
the World Economic Forum, the Global
Risks report has been a collaborative
effort since its first edition in 2006.
Produced within the World Economic
Forum’s forward looking networked
think tank, the Centre for Global
Strategies, the report is able to draw on
unique expertise available within the
different communities and the
knowledge networks of the World
Economic Forum as well as within the
organization as a whole.
The 2015 edition has established a
Steering Board to provide strategic
guidance as well as a high-level
multistakeholder Advisory Board for
advising on the methodology and the
content of the report. The report’s
corporate partners, academic advisors,
and members of the Advisory Board
contributed greatly to this endeavour. It
also strongly builds on ongoing
research, projects, debates and
initiatives within the World Economic
Forum. The insights presented here are
the result of numerous discussions,
consultations, and workshops and
reflect the views of leaders from our
various communities through the Global
Risks Perception Survey.

Executive
Summary

The 2015 edition of the Global Risks
report completes a decade of
highlighting the most significant
long-term risks worldwide, drawing on
the perspectives of experts and global
decision-makers. Over that time,
analysis has moved from risk
identification to thinking through risk
interconnections and the potentially
cascading effects that result. Taking
this effort one step further, this year’s
report underscores potential causes as
well as solutions to global risks. Not
only do we set out a view on 28 global
risks in the report’s traditional
categories (economic, environmental,
societal, geopolitical and technological)
but also we consider the drivers of
those risks in the form of 13 trends. In
addition, we have selected initiatives for
addressing significant challenges,
which we hope will inspire collaboration
among business, government and civil
society communities.

A global risk is an uncertain
event or condition that, if it
occurs, can cause significant
negative impact for several
countries or industries within
the next 10 years.
A trend is defined as a longterm pattern that is currently
taking place and that could
amplify global risks and/or
alter the relationship between
them.

Mapping Global Risks in
2015
The Global Risks Landscape, a map of
the most likely and impactful global
risks, puts forward that, 25 years after
the fall of the Berlin Wall, “interstate
conflict” is once again a foremost
concern (see Table 1). However, 2015
differs markedly from the past, with
rising technological risks, notably cyber
attacks, and new economic realities,
which remind us that geopolitical
tensions present themselves in a very
different world from before. Information
flows instantly around the globe and
8

emerging technologies have boosted
the influence of new players and new
types of warfare. At the same time,
past warnings of potential
environmental catastrophes have
begun to be borne out, yet insufficient
progress has been made – as reflected
in the high concerns about failure of
climate-change adaptation and
looming water crises in this year’s
report.
These multiple cross-cutting
challenges can threaten social stability,
perceived to be the issue most
interconnected with other risks in 2015,
and additionally aggravated by the
legacy of the global economic crisis in
the form of strained public finances and
persistent unemployment. The central
theme of profound social instability
highlights an important paradox that
has been smouldering since the crisis
but surfaces prominently in this year’s
report. Global risks transcend borders
and spheres of influence and require
stakeholders to work together, yet
these risks also threaten to undermine
the trust and collaboration needed to
adapt to the challenges of the new
global context.
The world is, however, insufficiently
prepared for an increasingly complex
risk environment. For the first time, the
report provides insights on this at the
regional level: social instability features
among the three global risks that
Europe, Latin America and the
Caribbean, and the Middle East and
North Africa are least prepared for.
Other societal risks, ranging from the
failure of urban planning in South Asia
to water crises in the Middle East and
North Africa, are also prominent. And
capacity to tackle persistent
unemployment – an important risk
connected with social instability – is a
major concern in Europe and subSaharan Africa.
As in previous years, Part 2 explores
three risk constellations that bear on
the survey findings. In 2015, these are:
Interplay between geopolitics and
economics: The interconnections
between geopolitics and economics
are intensifying because states are
making greater use of economic tools,
from regional integration and trade
treaties to protectionist policies and

cross-border investments, to establish
relative geopolitical power. This
threatens to undermine the logic of
global economic cooperation and
potentially the entire international
rule-based system.
Urbanization in developing
countries: The world is in the middle of
a major transition from predominantly
rural to urban living, with cities growing
most rapidly in Asia and Africa. If
managed well, this will help to incubate
innovation and drive economic growth.
However, our ability to address a range
of global risks – including climate
change, pandemics, social unrest,
cyber threats and infrastructure
development – will largely be
determined by how well cities are
governed.
Governance of emerging
technologies: The pace of
technological change is faster than
ever. Disciplines such as synthetic
biology and artificial intelligence are
creating new fundamental capabilities,
which offer tremendous potential for
solving the world’s most pressing
problems. At the same time, they
present hard-to-foresee risks.
Oversight mechanisms need to more
effectively balance likely benefits and
commercial demands with a deeper
consideration of ethical questions and

medium to long-term risks – ranging
from economic to environmental and
societal.
Mitigating, preparing for and building
resilience against global risks is long
and complex, something often
recognized in theory but difficult in
practice. Against this backdrop, Part 3
features three proven or promising
initiatives that were instituted in
response to extreme weather events
and climate-change adaptation. The
modelling of the Murray-Darling Basin
river system in Australia has pioneered
innovative methods of water
management that are now being
adapted for use elsewhere in the world.
The Resilient America Roundtable is
currently helping selected local
communities across the United States

to understand how they might be
affected by different risks and then
design resilience strategies. ZÜRS
Public, part of an extensive flood
management programme in Germany,
is a public-private collaboration that for
several years now has been a tool for
communicating with homeowners and
businesses about their exposure to
flood risk.
Over the past 10 years, the Global
Risks report has raised awareness of
the dangers from the interconnected
nature of global risks and has
persistently called for multistakeholder
collaboration to address them. By
offering a broad-ranging overview from
risk identification and evaluation to
practices – from the “what” to the
“how” – this year’s report aims to
provide the most comprehensive set of
insights yet for decision-makers in its
decade-long history.

Introduction

For the past decade, the Global
Risks report – now in its 10th edition
– has been calling attention to global
risks and providing tools to support
decision-makers in their efforts to
mitigate or prevent global risks or
strengthen resilience against them.
Since its inception, the report has
raised awareness that the world
is increasingly interconnected and
that global risks cannot be seen in
isolation. On the contrary, they can
have far-reaching cascading effects
as demonstrated by the financial
crisis in 2008 and its socio-economic
consequences. The year 2014 alone
witnessed several such risks with
potentially broad implications in the
years to come if history serves as a
benchmark: the frozen relationship
between Russia and the West –
unfathomable to most just one year
ago – seems to be transporting the
world back to a time when geopolitics
took primacy. The conflict in Syria and
the spread of the Islamic State in the
region have set off unprecedented
migration flows into neighbouring
countries and Europe, which could
impact social cohesion if poorly
managed. Revelations about data
fraud and leaks and cyber espionage
have critically undermined global trust,
running the risk of complicating the
search for solutions to other global
governance challenges as well.
Successfully addressing these complex
and interconnected issues necessitates
greater multistakeholder cooperation
to increase the capacity to foresee,
manage and mitigate global risks and
to strengthen society’s preparedness
and resilience to them. The report
takes the first step towards establishing
comprehensive collaboration by
fostering a shared understanding of the
issues at hand.

10 Years of Risk
Awareness Building
Over the past decade, the Global Risks
report has seen both its readership
and its impact increase significantly.
The report has become a useful tool
for many governments and businesses
to assess their exposure to global risks
(see Box 1). It has also successfully
raised awareness on key risks, such as
the threat of increasing resistance to
10

Global Risks 2015

antibiotics, which was featured in 2013,
or important IT-related risks, which
are now at the forefront of business
concerns.
After 10 years, the World Economic
Forum is now also in a position to
revisit the first Global Risks report,
an endeavour that illustrates both
the difficulty and the necessity of
attempting to think 10 years ahead.
The economic risk given most attention
in 2007 was the possibility of an asset
price bubble, which set off a major
financial crisis in the same year. The
subsequent years were primarily
defined by potential risks related to the
stability of financial systems in many
countries and the threat of sovereign
default, resulting in an economic
meltdown the world is still recovering
from. The interconnected nature of the
global economy today and the scale of
the global financial crisis show the need
to look beyond the obvious for risk
interconnections.
Importantly, this 10th edition also
reflects a decade of learning and
methodological improvements.
Fundamentally, the report’s approach
remains the same – to identify global
risks and their interactions, and to
assess them on two dimensions:
their perceived likelihood and impact.
However, over the years, a number of
refinements have been made to the
methodology, reflecting the lessons
learned from 10 years’ experience in
this field. This year’s edition features
an updated methodology based
on input from the members of the
newly established Advisory Board
(the list of members appears in the
Acknowledgements section at the end
of this report).
The uncertainty associated with
risks, their interconnected nature and
often the absence of data make it
difficult to accurately quantify a range
of risks – for example social unrest,
cyber attacks or oil price shocks. A
survey is therefore a suitable tool to
get a sense of the order of magnitude
of the impact and likelihood of risks.
The qualitative, perceptions-based
approach embodied in the Global
Risks Perception Survey has been
the base of the World Economic
Forum’s work in this area since 2011,
capturing the views of decision-makers

from the Forum’s multistakeholder
constituencies on the perceived
impact and probability of risks
and the interconnections between
them. Perceptions allow us to better
understand decision-makers’ priorities,
which in turn influence their decisions.
Over the years, the reports have
put increasing emphasis on the
interconnected nature of global risks
and the potential spillover effects of
systemic risks, putting this aspect
of risks on the agenda. The resulting
complexities underscore the difficulties
stakeholders face when addressing
risks and are reflected in this edition’s
introduction of trends as drivers of
risks. As a result, there is increased
emphasis on going beyond the analysis
of global risks to include suggestions
on what stakeholder alliances can do
about them. The focus on solutions
in this edition is the strongest yet,
with a new section on practices and
a stronger focus in the survey on
preparedness and progress.

The Structure of this
Report
Part 1 of this report explores the
results of the Global Risks Perception
Survey 2014. It explains the distinction
between risks and trends, visualizes the
likelihood of interconnections between
risks, and analyses the difference in
risk perceptions over different time
horizons. Figures 1, 2 and 3 are shown
on the inside cover flaps.
Part 2 deep-dives into three topics
that emerged strongly from the
interconnections between risks
and trends: the interplay between
geopolitics and economics, rapid
urbanization in developing countries,
and emerging technologies.
Part 3 discusses risk management
and risk resilience: it presents
survey respondents’ views on which
risks have most successfully been
addressed over the past 10 years,
and shares practices from the public
and private sectors that offer ways
forward to address global risks. The full
methodology for the survey is shared in
Appendix B. The complete set of data

Introduction

Part 3

The Global Risks 2015 report comes
at a time when various manifestations
of global risks brought into sharp
relief that the world is not equipped
to deal with these events or similar
occurrences in the future. For the
past decade, the Global Risks
report has been calling attention to
global risks and providing a base for
multistakeholder action. Over this
period, the evolution in understanding
how global risks are thought about
and assessed has been significant.
This has led the Forum to update the
methodology it has used to assess
global risks for the 10th edition of
the report, based on input from the
members of the newly established
Advisory Board.
Building on this evolution, in this report
a global risk is defined as an uncertain
event or condition that, if it occurs,
can cause significant negative impact
for several countries or industries
within the next 10 years. Based on
this refined definition, 28 global risks
were identified and grouped into the
five customary categories: economic
risks, environmental risks, geopolitical
risks, societal risks and technological
risks. A description of the risks and the
methodology employed can be found
in Appendix A and Appendix B.
A further development in the 2015
report is the delineation of risks and
trends. This distinction allows a better
understanding of the underlying drivers
of global risks. A trend is defined as
a long-term pattern that is currently
taking place and that could contribute
to amplifying global risks and/or altering
the relationship between them. The
focus on trends can contribute to risk
mitigation; for example, better planned
urbanization can help alleviate certain
risks that concentrate in urban areas.
Moreover, the differentiation between
trends and risks emphasizes the fact
that trends, unlike risks, are occurring
with certainty and can have both
positive and negative consequences.
Trends are long-term, ongoing
processes that can alter the future
evolution of risks or the interrelations
among them, without necessarily
becoming risks themselves.

Global Risks 2015

Part 1

The Global Risks Landscape, as
defined by the survey, highlights five
global risks that stand out as both
highly likely and highly potentially
impactful (upper right quadrant
of Figure 1). Interstate conflict
has significantly leaped up both
dimensions since 2014, arguably
reflecting recent geopolitical conflicts
that are fuelling geopolitical and social
instability. As last year, concerns about
environmental and economic risks
remain, in particular around failure of
climate-change adaptation, water
crises1 and unemployment and
underemployment reflecting concern
about how little tangible action has
been taken to address them. At the
same time, cyber attacks remain
among the most likely high-impact
risks.

In the geopolitical risks category,
respondents identified weapons of
mass destruction (WMDs), which
include weapons containing nuclear,
chemical, biological and radiological
technologies, as the third most
impactful risk, albeit as the second
least likely risk. If deployed, they would
create an international crisis with
huge human and economic costs. In
the coming decades, technological
advancements, greater access to
scientific knowledge and the increased
vulnerability of classified information
to cyber threats enhance the risk
of WMDs proliferation, particularly in
fragile areas. This highlights the need
for greater international collaboration to
control the proliferation of WMDs.

shown in Figure 1.1. In the short term,
respondents are more concerned
about global risks related to recent
events and human action, including
interstate conflict, state collapse,
failure of national governance and
large-scale terrorist attacks. The
list for the longer term is dominated
by risks related to physical and
environmental trends that have been
less prominent in recent headlines,
such as water crises, failure of climatechange adaptation and food crises.
Interestingly, the risk of social
instability scores high in both the
short and long term. This trend
towards social fragility is one of five
threads that stand out from the 2015
survey – along with growing concern
about geopolitics, the possible
overshadowing of economic risks by
other more imminent risks, concern
about unaddressed environmental
risks, and persisting vulnerabilities in
cyberspace – which are explored in
more depth below.

Part 3

The results provide a snapshot of
current perceptions on global risks
and highlight priorities for action from
three complementary angles: (1) the
Global Risks Landscape, in which risks
are assessed according to likelihood
and impact, allowing a comparison of
how perceptions have evolved over the
years (Figure 1); (2) the Interconnections
Maps of Risks (Figure 2) and of Risks
and Trends (Figure 3); and (3) the level
of concern in the short and long terms
(Figure 1.1).

Respondents also underscored the
potentially devastating impact of
the rapid and massive spread of
infectious diseases, which reflects the
need for a higher level of preparedness
for major pandemics at both the
country and international levels to
address this important risk (see Box 2.4
in Part 2).

Among the economic risks, fiscal
crises and unemployment are
perceived as close to equally impactful
and likely as in last year’s report,
yet other risk categories take centre
stage this year (see Figure 1.4). While
the world has made progress in
addressing and preventing financial
crises, and small improvements in fiscal
issues and unemployment have been
achieved, the danger of complacency
compared to other risks exists: experts
remain concerned about significant
residual risks, which may have been
overshadowed by other risks in the
survey.2
The prominence of risks dominating
recent headlines in our assessments
raises questions about the role of
the “availability heuristic” – risks that
have manifested themselves recently
may be uppermost in people’s minds,
even if their recent occurrence does
not necessarily increase their impact
or likelihood over a 10-year time
horizon. To reveal more about the
psychology behind the responses, the
survey this year asked respondents
to nominate risks of highest concern
over two time horizons: 10 years, as
usual, and 18 months. The results are
Global Risks 2015

Part 2

As in previous years, risks are assessed
based on the perception of leaders and
decision-makers obtained through the
Global Risks Perception Survey. The
survey captures the views of the World
Economic Forum’s multistakeholder
communities across different areas
of expertise, geographies and age
groups. It was conducted between
July and September 2014 and
gathered the perceptions of almost
900 leading decision-makers from
business, academia and the public
sector. A more detailed description
of the sample and the survey’s
methodology is presented in Appendix
B. Complementary to the Global
Risks Perception Survey data, the
views of business executives were
also collected on the risks of highest
concern for doing business in their
country, presented in more detail in
Appendix C.

Part 1

Box 1.1: The evolution of the risks of highest impact/likelihood

Part 2

As the report’s 10th anniversary approaches, the evolution of the perceived top five global risks can be viewed in terms
of impact and likelihood as documented in the Global Risks reports from 2007 to 2015. As Table 1.1.1 shows, economic
risks largely dominated from 2007 to 2014, with the risk of an asset-price collapse heading the list in the run-up to the
financial crisis, giving way to concerns about the more immediate but slow-burning consequences of constrained fiscal
finances, a major systemic financial failure in the immediate post-crisis years, and income disparity. This year features a
radical departure from the past decade; for the first time in the report’s history, economic risks feature only marginally in
the top five. In the 25th year after the fall of the Berlin Wall, geopolitical risks are back on the agenda. The dispute over
Crimea in March 2014 serves as a forceful reminder of the consequences of interstate conflicts with regional
consequences that seemed long forgotten and unfathomable, as further explored in this report. Similarly, together with
other events in 2014, such as the prominent rise of the Islamic State, it has brought state collapse and the failure of
national governance back into public consciousness. At the same time, health-related risks, such as pandemics – last
considered impactful in 2008 – have made it back into the unglamorous top, following the unprecedented spread of
Ebola.

Part 3

On a higher level, Table 1.1.1 also indicates a shift over past years away from economic risks in general to environmental
risks – ranging from climate change to water crises. While this highlights a recognition of the importance of these
slow-burning issues, strikingly little progress has been made to address them in light of their far-reaching and
detrimental consequences for this and future generations.

Note: Global risks may not be strictly comparable across years, as definitions and the set of global risks have evolved with new issues emerging on the 10-year horizon.
For example, cyber attacks, income disparity and unemployment entered the set of global risks in 2012. Some global risks were reclassified: water crises and rising
income disparity were recategorized as societal risks and as a trend, respectively, in 2015. The 2006 edition of the Global Risks report did not have a risks landscape.

Fragile Societies under
Pressure
The fragility of societies is of increasing
concern, fuelled by underlying
economic, societal and environmental
developments (Figure 3 and Figure
1.2). A major driver of social fragility is
rising socio-economic inequality
within countries, although it is
diminishing between countries. Among
the members of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), the average
income of the richest 10% has now
grown to about nine times that of the
poorest 10%. In other countries, the
ratio is even higher: for example, more
than 25 times in Mexico.3
Income inequality is widening quickly
in large emerging markets. The
People’s Republic of China has seen
its Gini Index rise from about 30 in
the 1980s to over 50 in 2010.4,5 While
extreme poverty (less than $1.25 per
day) was reduced from afflicting over
50% of the world’s population in 1990
to 22% in 2010, the same reduction
did not take place in those earning
under $3 per day.6 The story is of

people escaping extreme poverty,
yet remaining poor. Widening income
inequality is associated with lower and
more fragile economic growth, which
reduces the scope to meet rising social
expectations in emerging markets.7
Rising structural unemployment
drives both inequality and social
pressures. Lower economic growth
and technological change are likely
to keep unemployment high in the
future, also in developing countries.
The spread of connectivity enables
protest movements to mount more
quickly, increasing the risk of unrest
and violence that could easily spill
over from individual countries to affect
the global economy. While inequality
and unemployment contribute to
social instability, social instability in
turn impacts negatively on equality,
employment and wealth creation.
The multidirectional cause-and-effect
relationship makes it harder to address
the related risks.
Underlying social fragility is also the
accelerating pace of change, growing
complexity and the deepening extent
of global interdependence, which
together reduce people’s feeling

of control over their immediate
environment and hence their sense
of stability and security. A common
psychological response to insecurity
and perceived loss of control is the
desire to turn inwards towards smaller
groups that have a stronger sense of
identity. At the same time, increased
global connectivity allows people
to make their voices heard and to
convene with like-minded individuals.
The growing risks of social extremism
and isolationism are brought to
light through the rising influence of
religious groups and in the separatist
movements in Catalonia and Scotland.
The effects associated with climate
change will put further pressure on
societies. Its expected impact on
the ability to grow food and access
water could prompt sudden and
uncontrolled population migrations,
putting additional pressure on
receiving countries.8 Already in 2014,
the number of refugees worldwide
from environmental or conflict-related
causes reached its highest level since
World War II.9

As societies become less homogenous
and less bound by common values,
and more polarized into the haves and
have-nots, they will become harder to
govern effectively. This in turn increases
the risk of prolonged economic
stagnation, creating the potential for
a self-reinforcing downward spiral
into social chaos. States will need to
mitigate this risk through policies to
make growth more inclusive: providing
public goods and services such as
social protection, hospitals, schools,
transport and telecommunications
infrastructure.

Growing Worries about
Conflict
Having not featured prominently
in previous editions of the report,
interstate conflict is this year
considered the most likely high-impact
risk over the next 10 years, or indeed
perhaps even sooner. As already
discussed, respondents are even more
concerned about geopolitical risks in
the short term than in the long term
(Figure 1.1)
Many observers believe that the world
is entering a new era of strategic
competition among global powers.
Disillusion about globalization is leading
to more self-interested foreign policies
in combination with a rise in national
sentiment (Figure 3) fuelled in part by
the social pressures described above.
Growing nationalism is evident around
the world: in Russia, as seen in the
Crimea crisis; in India, with the rising
popularity of nationalist politicians;
and in Europe, with the rise of far-right,
nationalistic and Eurosceptic parties in
a number of countries.
Growth and employment creation are
currently expected to remain below
pre-crisis levels in both emerging
markets and advanced economies,
suggesting that the drivers of
nationalism will remain strong, and
raising the possibility of more frequent
and impactful conflicts among states.
Importantly, as can be seen in Figure 2,
interstate conflict is no longer physical
but uses economic means and cyber
warfare to attack people’s privacy as
well as intangible assets.
Geopolitical risks can have cascading
impacts on other risks. As state
structures are challenged by conflict,
the risk of the failure of national
governance and state collapse or crisis
can increase in areas where current
state boundaries do not necessarily
reflect popular self-identification. A
recent example is Iraq and Syria,
where ISIS has claimed control of
territory and attracted 20,000 to
30,000 fighters from a near standing
start.10 The rapid rise and brutality of
ISIS as well as the response of the
international community may underlie
the increased likelihood and impact
attributed by respondents to the
risk of the deployment of weapons

16

Global Risks 2015

of mass destruction and the higher
potential impact than in previous years
associated with large-scale terrorist
attacks (Figure 1.3).
Failure of national governance features
strongly this year, as the third most
likely risk across the global risks
landscape. This risk area captures a
number of important elements around
the inability to efficiently govern as
a result of corruption, illicit trade,
organized crime, the presence of
impunity and generally weak rule of
law. Over past years, the links between
many forms of global crime and
corruption and their impact on global
security, extremism, terrorism and
fragile states have only grown stronger,
and it is critical to acknowledge and
address them through more effective
policies that curb illegal financial
flows, foster transparent governance
and build capacity around anti-crime
efforts at the national and local levels.
Absent a stronger response from both
the public and private sectors, the risk
is of undoing hard-earned gains in
economic and political stability, and
further eroding trust in leadership.
In a number of countries, such as
India, Indonesia and Romania, new
leaders have been elected in large
part due to their public commitment to
more transparent and corruption-free
governance models, underscoring an
ongoing shift in public expectations.
The growing interconnectedness of
the global economy increases the
economic effects of any geopolitical
conflict. Supply chains that run
across countries in conflict could be
interrupted, leading to disruptions in
the availability of goods or energy.
Survey respondents considered the
risk of an energy price shock to the
global economy as more impactful
and more likely than in previous years,
despite the increasing availability of
shale gas or alternative energy sources.
The interplay between economic and
geopolitical forces is further explored in
Part 2 of this report.

Part 1

The phenomenon is not without precedent: the Provisional Revolutionary
Government in South Vietnam did much the same in the late 1960s and early
1970s, without the self-glorification of atrocity and terror. And it is not without
parallel today. The Taliban have effective control over parts of Afghanistan and
was effectively the state in the late 1990s, until the US-led offensive overthrew
it in October 2001. Among other examples, for a long time FARC has been in
control of large areas of Colombia, while the Seleka militia is in charge of
northern areas of Central African Republic. Having withdrawn from Bangui in
January 2014 under heavy international pressure, they are recuperating by
systematically taxing gold and diamond mining, livestock and other economic
activities – behaving in part like a nascent state. Some groups have not based
themselves outside the territory over which they are fighting, but have waged
warfare that is not territorially limited. In the Al Qaeda mode, they have fought
what they perceive to be a global enemy. Today, perhaps the trend is in the
opposite direction: re-entry into an era of the non-state state.

But what really marks ISIS out is that it has claimed statehood and with that
has established some of the machinery of state management. ISIS has not
only proclaimed the new Caliphate, the rule of the successors of the Prophet
Muhammad – not that it has any theological credibility to do so – but also
administers the area of northern Iraq and eastern Syria where it holds sway. It
handles law and order, some social services on a selective basis, and has an
intelligence service and system of informers set up for it by former officials of
the overthrown Ba’athist regime of Saddam Hussein. Adding to the lavish
funds it has raised from the Gulf region, it has also taken over and emptied the
central bank in Mosul, making it the richest non-state armed force in the world
and equipping it to be a non-state state.

Geopolitical Risks

Part 2

The group known as ISIS, ISIL or the Islamic State has gained global notoriety
through its taste for video-recorded executions and large-scale atrocity, with a
background of further human rights abuse that includes arbitrary
imprisonment and sexual enslavement. While its thirst for violence, blood and
misery – and especially the way it glories in these crimes – mark it out from
other non-state armed forces of our age, this is really only a quantitative
distinction. Other groups – many of them part of the global Al Qaeda franchise
– do the same, only less. Al Nusra in Syria, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb
and the Nigerian group known in the West as Boko Haram all do some of what
ISIS does on a somewhat smaller scale.

Rising nationalist sentiment and
declining trust among global players
are contributing to a weakening
of international governance,
undermining the international
community’s ability to act decisively
on issues such as conflict resolution,
Internet governance, climate change
and the management of oceans.
Failure to collaborate and implement
common solutions in these areas could
significantly undermine future global
growth.

Part 1
Part 2

The global economy is returning to
growth, albeit sluggishly, and there is
a feeling that significant progress has
been made in reducing the likelihood of
another financial crisis (as explored in
Box 1.4). This may reflect a false sense
of control, as history shows that people
do not always learn from past failures
and are often taken by surprise by the
same risks.

Part 3

The global unemployment rate is
expected to remain at current levels
until 2018, reflecting a growing
problem of structural unemployment
in advanced economies.11 This will
likely keep wages low, maintaining
deflationary pressures; in the Eurozone,
inflation fell as low as 0.66% in 2014.
As past years have seen a build-up
of debt in many major economies –
notably China, where the corporate
debt-to-GDP ratio went from 92%
in 2003-2007 to 110% in 2013 – the
possible risk is that deflation could
reduce debtors’ ability to repay,
threatening the future stability of the
financial system.12
Conversely, low interest rates have
also fuelled the risk of asset bubbles.
Since the financial crisis, the use of
expansionary monetary policy – such
as quantitative easing and zero interest
rates – has not had the expected
impact of significantly increasing credit
availability in the real economy, instead
leading to a reflation of asset prices.
Credit booms and asset bubbles have
historically resulted in bank bailouts
and recession in the real economy (see
Box 1.3).
The risks of a failure of a major
financial mechanism or institution
and fiscal crises are perceived as
equally impactful and likely as in last
year’s report (Figure 1.4), yet other risks,
such as water crises, interstate conflict
and the failure of climate-change
adaptation, have taken centre stage.
This runs the risk of diverting decisionmakers’ attention away from continuing
economic reforms. Despite recent
efforts (see Box 1.4), either deflationary
pressures or the bursting of an assetprice bubble could still cause the failure
of a major financial mechanism or
18

Global Risks 2015

institution – especially as the shadow
banking sector is less regulated yet
increasingly important.13 Likewise, in
many countries public debt levels are
still worryingly high so that the related
risks are likely to persist over many
years.
Decision-makers’ focus on other
risks could lead to inaction at a time
when continued progress in structural
reform is most necessary; The Global
Competitiveness Report 2014-2015
outlines some priorities.14 Maintaining
the momentum of both financial and
fiscal reforms will be crucial to avoid
another major economic crisis.

Box 1.3: Asset bubbles – a new old risk?
The evidence of frothiness is increasing in a number of housing markets in
both advanced and emerging economies – including Canada, the United
Kingdom, Switzerland, France, Sweden, Norway, China, Hong Kong SAR and
Singapore – as well as in a number of credit and equity markets across the
world.
The traditional goal of central banks has been economic stability: keeping
inflation low while achieving robust growth. The current realization is that
central banks must also seek to preserve financial stability – which means,
among other things, avoiding risky bubbles. The current theory is that macroprudential regulation and supervision of the financial system will avoid bubbles
and achieve financial stability. However, bubbles are very hard to identify (price
increases could also reflect market movements), and macro-prudential
regulation has not historically been effective and excludes the unregulated
shadow banking system.
If macro-prudential regulation fails again, central banks will be left with only
one tool – monetary policy – to pursue both goals of economic and financial
stability. This may prove impossible. Trying to prick bubbles by using monetary
policy risks causing a bond market rout and a hard landing for the real
economy. However, keeping monetary policy loose in a bid to help the real
economy risks inflating asset bubbles that will, inevitably, eventually burst and
also damage the real economy. Loose monetary policy is the mother of all
bubbles. Attempting to walk this tightrope will be a difficult issue for central
banks in both advanced and emerging markets in the years to come.

Part 1

Box 1.4: Recent advances in the global regulation of the financial system

Part 2

The global financial system is undergoing massive structural change as a result not only of the crisis but of the regulatory
changes in its wake. The very fact that the whole post-crisis regulatory overhaul has been spearheaded by the Financial
Stability Board and G20, i.e. with explicit political backing by a global set of policy-makers, is very innovative and has not
been the case in setting international regulatory standards before. The past five years have witnessed a profound change
of international regulatory standards for banks and non-banks alike.

♦ Banks’ regulatory rules have been revised (usually subsumed under the Basel III heading), resulting in stronger capital

Part 3

requirements, the first-ever globally agreed liquidity standards (for a short-term liquidity and a structural funding
measure), and new standards for constraining large exposures and improving risk management. Also, supervisory
standards are being raised and the international standard setter (Basel Committee) has launched a programme to
assess national implementation, which exerts peer pressure on jurisdictions to implement the reforms in a consistent
manner.

♦ Cross-border resolution difficulties witnessed in the crisis are reflected in the new set of expectations with regard to

effective resolution regimes and a process of recovery and resolution planning for the largest banks, complete with
setting up cross-border crisis management groups composed of authorities from the (most prominent) jurisdictions
where these banks operate.

♦ Regarding non-banks, the international community is finalizing a basic solvency requirement for global insurers who

are systemically important – to date there has been no global solvency standard; over-the-counter derivatives
markets are undergoing major overhaul with measures aimed at mandating and/or incentivizing central clearing and
trading on organized platforms with reporting to trade repositories of all contracts. In terms of insurance regulation,
many countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia are adopting variants of the Solvency II regime. New insurance
regulation has a strong emphasis on corporate governance, disclosure and accountability. These measures are
relevant as they aim to change the broader corporate behaviour.

♦ International accounting standards are being changed, in particular to make loss recognition more forward-looking
(newly issued IFRS9).

♦ Some supervisory authority over the financial sector has been relocated to central banks, most notably in Europe,
where the European Central Bank has taken on additional responsibilities.

Still, of course, challenges remain. Addressing the issue of “too-big-to-fail” remains a key issue. Efforts are needed to: (i)
finalize living wills and identify and remove barriers to firms’ resolvability; (ii) reach consensus on banks’ loss-absorbing
capacity to ensure that they can be resolved; (iii) address obstacles to cross-border cooperation and recognition of
resolution measures; (iv) ensure recovery and resolution of non-banks; and (v) promote better regulation of the shadow
banking sector. Cross-border challenges persist also in over-the-counter derivatives reform. As regulatory regimes
developed in parallel in the two largest markets (European Union and United States), they resulted in a framework that
overlaps and is not completely consistent. Regulatory decisions allowing reliance on home regulatory regimes (known as
“deference”) are urgently needed. Trade reporting requirements have been adopted in key countries but legal barriers
frustrate implementation. Progress on trading standardized contracts on exchanges and electronic trading platforms
continues to slip. Political commitment is needed to advance reforms in all these areas.

Note: In addition to the current regulatory reforms described above, some experts believe that profound changes in the corporate culture and incentive systems in the
financial sector are needed to reduce excessive risk-taking.

The world has more to lose than ever before from massive failure of critical
infrastructure. To improve efficiency and lower cost, various systems have
been allowed to become hyperdependent on one another. The failure of one
weak link – whether from natural disaster, human error or terrorism – can
create ripple effects across multiple systems and over wide geographical
areas.

Part 3

Large-scale power outages might be the most visible illustration. The initiating
event in the August 2003 power failures in the United States occurred in Ohio
but the worst consequences were felt by 55 million people in the north-eastern
part of the United States and Canada. The July 2012 India blackout was the
largest in history, affecting 670 million people, about 10% of the world
population, and was partially triggered by high demand during a heat wave.
In many countries, infrastructure has not been maintained well enough to
withstand the kinds of catastrophes that could spark such cascading effects.
This is often the result of procrastination, the perception that the risk is so
small that it is not worth considering or crowding out by other priorities, and
the fact that investing in preparedness is rarely immediately rewarded in the
electoral process. The challenge is financial, and incentives are misaligned. For
example, in the United States, over 80% of infrastructure is owned or
managed by private sector firms, which are not responsible for the negative
externalities that failure of their part of the infrastructure could have
elsewhere.1 To increase investment in infrastructure, a coordinated, global,
long-term and multistakeholder approach is required. Upgrading infrastructure
is essential, in recognition that resilient infrastructure has become the
backbone of a competitive economy.

Over the past decade, awareness has
grown regarding the threats posed
by environmental change to social,
political and economic security. As the
Global Risks Perception Survey 2014
highlights, three of the top 10 risks in
terms of impact over the next 10 years
are environmental risks: water crises,
at the top of the table, and failure of
climate-change adaptation as well as
biodiversity loss (see Figure 1).15

Both water crises and failure of
climate-change adaptation are also
perceived as more likely and impactful
than average (upper right quadrant
of Figure 1 and Figure 1.5). Global
water requirements are projected to
be pushed beyond sustainable water
supplies by 40% by 2030.16 Agriculture
already accounts for on average
70% of total water consumption and,
according to the World Bank, food
production will need to increase by
50% by 2030 as the population grows
and dietary habits change.17,18 The
International Energy Agency further
projects water consumption to meet
the needs of energy generation and
production to increase by 85% by
2035.19

Decision-makers will be forced to
make tough choices about allocations
of water that will impact users across
the economy (Part 3 of this report
highlights an approach developed in
Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin, for
addressing this issue). The situation
will worsen further if more man-made
environmental catastrophes causing
shocks to the system happen: more
recent examples include the Fukushima
power plant disaster threatening to
contaminate both freshwater and
seawater, or the Deepwater Horizon
oil spill contaminating large sections of
coast along the Gulf of Mexico.
Overfishing, deforestation and the
inadequate management of sensitive
ecosystems such as coral reefs are
increasing the stress on food and water
systems. Major biodiversity loss and
ecosystem collapse was assessed
as high impact by respondents, but
below average in terms of likelihood
(see Figure 1); the latter seems to reflect
a misperception. The World Bank
estimates that 75% of the world’s poor,
or 870 million people, make a living
from ecosystems, including tourism
and the goods they produce, while 350
million are affected by the loss of coral
reefs.22 Increasingly, decision-makers
are realizing that biodiversity loss is not
a second-order issue but is intricately
linked to economic development, food
challenges and water security.
The urgency of coordinated global
action on climate change was
reinforced in April and November
2014 by the Intergovernmental Panel

businesses often remain woefully
underprepared, as illustrated by
respondents’ perceptions that relatively
little progress has been made on
these risks in the last decade (see
Figure 3.1). At the heart of the problem
is a risk-management approach
based on responsive measures that
assume things go back to normal
after a crisis – an approach that falls
short with complex or slowly evolving
environmental risks such as climate
change. Stakeholders have been slow
to address the underlying causes
of environmental risks or to address
their economic, social, political and
humanitarian consequences.

Even though all of these risks are
well known, governments and

Box 1.6: The road to Paris – is 2015 make or break for climate
change?
In 2015 the international community has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to
align the climate change and development agenda. A series of global summits on
climate change, disaster risk reduction, financing for development and sustainable
development goals could embed into the post-2015 global governance
architecture a coherent agenda for tackling interlocking environmental risks.
Convergence among governments on these decisions could kick-start the next
generation of sustainable growth and poverty reduction – through catalysing
private finance and scaling low-carbon, climate-resilient investment, especially but
not only in developing countries. However, the opportunity will be missed if
governments continue to value narrow short-term concerns above the prospect of
longer-term global prosperity and environmental security. More vulnerable
populations will be consigned to the negative spiral of poverty and environmental
degradation.
Until recently, the expectation was that governments would struggle to finalize a
strong global climate accord in time for the Paris climate conference in December
2015. But is the tide beginning to turn? At the United Nations Secretary-General’s
Climate Summit in September 2014, over 1,000 businesses and investors signalled
their support for global carbon pricing. So did some 73 countries, covering 52% of
global GDP and 54% of global emissions.
Major consumer companies and financial institutions see the need to reduce global
climate risks and have mobilized action along their supply chains, for example
through the New York Declaration on Forests and the move towards climatefriendly coolants. The Oil & Gas Climate Initiative signalled refreshed engagement
from major energy producers.
The hope is that these coalitions of committed businesses could both inject
concrete solutions and create a more positive global atmosphere for governments
to collectively make decisions in 2015. A positive signal is the agreement between
China and the United States in November 2014. A strong set of clear policy signals
to the wider business community is needed from the world’s governments on their
ambition to tackle environmental risks. The year 2015 is not an opportunity the
world can afford to miss.

The nexus of food, water, energy and

the US National Intelligence Council as
one of four overarching mega trends

on Climate Change’s release of its
Fifth Assessment Report and the
associated update. It reconfirms that
warming is unequivocally happening
and it is “extremely likely” that human
influence has been the dominant
cause. Atmospheric concentrations
of three major greenhouse gases
(carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous
oxide) are at their highest level in
800,000 years. Strong evidence of the
effects of climate change is already
apparent, in terms of sea level rise,
shrinking glaciers, warmer oceans and
the increasing frequency of weather
extremes.

Part 2

The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change notes that weather
extremes in food-producing regions
are already causing price increases
and suggests that the impact of climate
change on weather patterns and rainfall
– causing either floods or droughts –
could cut crop yields by up to 25%.20

The risk of large-scale cyber attacks

sophistication of cyber attacks and
the rise of hyperconnectivity, with
a growing number of physical objects
connected to the Internet and more
and more sensitive personal data –
including about health and finances
– being stored by companies in the
cloud. In the United States alone, cyber
crime already costs an estimated $100
billion each year.23

While the “Internet of Things” (IoT) will
deliver innovations, it will also entail new
risks. Analytics on large and disparate
data sources can drive breakthrough
insights but also raise questions about
expectations of privacy and the fair
and appropriate use of data about
individuals. Security risks are also
intensified. There are more devices to
secure against hackers, and bigger
downsides from failure: hacking the
location data on a car is merely an
invasion of privacy, whereas hacking
the control system of a car would be
a threat to life. The current Internet
infrastructure was not developed with
such security concerns in mind.
22

Global Risks 2015

The IoT is likely to disrupt business
models and ecosystems across a
range of industries. While this will
deliver innovation, the prospect of
many large players across multiple
industries being forced to change
so radically at the same time raises
potential systemic risks such as largescale disruption in labour markets
and volatility in financial markets. A
major public security failure could also
prevent the IoT from becoming truly
widespread.
An important characteristic of global
risks, which transpires across the
cases included in this report, is their

interconnectedness, shown in the
Interconnections Map in Figure 2. It is
important to stress that risks cannot
be seen in isolation. The feedback
loops between risks and the fact that
they are also driven by underlying
trends (Figure 3) raise their complexity
and make it more difficult to control
individual risks. Over past years, the
speed of transmission and the strength
of interconnections have increased.
The complexity of addressing risks,
their likelihood and their potential
consequences raise the question of
preparedness, on the global, regional,
national and local levels.

Box 1.7: Governing the Internet — the need for mechanisms to
maintain a unified and resilient network
The pace of innovation and the highly distributed nature of the Internet require a
new approach to global Internet governance and cooperation. As more people
rely on the Internet, the question of Internet governance becomes increasingly
important. Two kinds of issues exist: technical matters, to make sure all the
infrastructure and devices that constitute the Internet can talk to each other; and
overarching matters, to address cyber crime, Net neutrality, privacy and freedom
of expression.
Responsibility for the technical infrastructure of the Internet is dispersed among
several organizations, including the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), the
root servers’ operators, and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers (ICANN). The solutions they propose – policy models, standards,
specifications or best practices – spread through voluntary adoption or ad hoc
conventions, regulations, directives, contracts or other agreements.
No such systems exist for developing and implementing solutions to the
overarching issues. Consequently, governments are feeling pressure to enact
national measures to deal with their citizens’ data and privacy concerns. While
laws that force the “localization” of infrastructure may be easier short-term
solutions than collaborating to define global mechanisms for addressing the
issues, the risk is that “data nationalism” could endanger the network effects that
underlie the Internet’s ability to drive innovation and create social and economic
value.
To advance the conversation, identify possible solutions and contribute to open,
resilient and inclusive Internet governance, the World Economic Forum is
embarking on a multiyear strategic initiative to bring together leaders from the
public and private sectors with civil society leaders and the technical community
to address these issues in an impartial, high-level dialogue. This effort will
complement the expert-level discussions taking place at the Internet Governance
Forum and various other grassroots and government-led initiatives.

Conclusion

Endnotes

Drawing on the perceptions of almost
900 survey respondents, this chapter
focuses on the threats of social fragility
and short-term worries about conflict.
Rising socio-economic inequality, weak
economic growth, food price volatility
and food insecurity, unemployment,
large-scale migration and the growing
heterogeneity and interdependence
of societies are among the key
drivers of social fragility. Growing
social polarization, isolationism and
nationalism in turn have the potential to
trigger geopolitical conflicts.

The section highlights the
interconnections between global risks
and trends. A better understanding of
global risks and the interconnections
between them is key to prompting
discussion about how to prepare,
mitigate and prevent them. Part 2 of
this report analyses in detail selected
clusters of interconnected risks and
how they could evolve – the interplay
between geopolitical and economic
risks, challenges related to urbanization
in developing countries and emerging
technologies.

The risk of water crises is classified as a societal risk for the purpose of this report. However, it has an important
environmental dimension.

Part 2:
Risks in Focus

2.1 Introduction

Part 3

This section of the Global Risks 2015
report presents deep-dives into
three “risks in focus” – the interplay
between geopolitics and economics,
rapid and unplanned urbanization in
developing countries, and emerging
technologies – that emerged from the
Risks Interconnections Map and the
Risks-Trends Interconnections Map (see
Figures 2 and 3). These provide good
illustrations of the links between different
global risks. The analysis in the following
pages is based on follow-up research
and interviews with experts.
As discussed in Part 1, geopolitical risks
are back, as evident from the central
node of the failure of national governance
in the interconnections maps, and the
strong linkages to interstate conflict
and profound social instability, among
others. With economies tied together
on an unprecedented scale by financial
and trade flows, many analysts are
concerned about the resurgence of the
trend towards the interplay between
geopolitics and economics. While
national governments in the past
also made use of economic tools to
increase their relative power, today’s
strong economic ties arguably make
this interplay more complex and
therefore more difficult to navigate.
This resurgence could have profound
implications for the effectiveness of
global governance mechanisms in other
areas, from combating climate change
to reaching an international solution for
Internet governance.
Even as nation states step up their
efforts to maintain or expand power,
urbanization is slowly but surely
rebalancing the locus of power from
national to city governments. The
data gathered for this report suggest
that urbanization is a critical driver
of profound social instability, failure
of critical infrastructure, water crises,
and the spread of infectious diseases
(see Figure 3). This will only be further
exacerbated by an unprecedented
transition from rural to urban areas:
by 2050, two-thirds of the world’s
population – an estimated 6.3 billion
people – will live in cities, with 80% in
less developed regions.1 Rapid and
unplanned urbanization in these regions
has the potential to drive many risks.
How effectively the world addresses
global risks, ranging from climate

Part 1

In many cases, by addressing the
trends underlying most of the risks, the
vulnerability to risks can be reduced
significantly. In addition, understanding
the context and possible trajectories of a
significant nexus of risks and trends can
help to clarify ways to address them and
to capitalize on opportunities presented
by the trends. That is the aim of the
analysis that follows.

Geopolitics traditionally focuses
on military might, resources and
demographics as measures of national
influence, while economics focuses on
growth, productivity and prosperity.
However, geopolitics and economics
have been intertwined through history –
for example in the rise of British political
power on the back of the “economic”
Industrial Revolution, the era of British
and French colonialism, or the Cold
War, when a deep geopolitical divide
separated economies. When the Cold
War ended, an era of common norms
ushered in a global economy; now,
more than 25 years after the fall of the
Berlin Wall, strategic competition is
returning. The world is grappling with
a seemingly accelerating dynamic
between geopolitics and economics.
Today’s realpolitik is not ideologically
driven, includes new players and takes
place in the context of deep economic
integration.
Will the global economy, the efficiency of
the international system and the winwin logic of commerce be undermined
by geopolitics? How will economic
decisions and spheres of influence
impact the global balance of power?
What global risks could emerge when
countries use economic rather than
military tools to advance their ends?
These questions have been brought
into focus by trends including the
recent heightened tensions in East
Asia, the acceleration of regional
integration in South-East Asia and the
rise of preferential and regional trade
agreements more generally, the shale
gas and oil revolution in the United
States, turbulence in the Middle East
and Ukraine, competing integration
mechanisms in Latin America, China’s
assertion of leadership in the global
economy, and acts of terrorism and
violent strife that are redrawing borders
and sending economies backwards.
Global interconnectedness and the rising
speed of information transmission have
reinforced the interdependence between
geopolitics and economics, with
cyberspace representing an important

new front in the geopolitical equation as
cyber attacks have the growing potential
to inflict economic damage. This makes
it difficult for decision-makers to predict
the development of such situations
as sanctions and other instruments
of economic coercion, thus raising
the risk of unintended consequences.
The interplay between geopolitics and
economics can create, reinforce and
alter the nature of the interconnections
between global risks, affecting many
areas of public policy and international
cooperation.
Governments and businesses alike
need to conduct “geopolitical due
diligence” to not be caught off guard.
The focus below is on three areas where
direct effects are likely – disruptions to
international trade, and threats to political
cooperation and the international rulesbased system.

How Is this Situation Manifested?
In a retreat from the prevailing logic
of globalization that characterized
the 1990s and early 2000s, today’s
international environment is in large
part marked by self-interested nation
states trying to gain relative power over
others, even at the expense of economic
considerations. Rising unemployment
and more difficult fiscal situations
are contributing to the more inward
orientation of economies. The growth
of trade along global value chains and
intensifying financial linkages have
increased the economic cost of rising
protectionist policies, such as tariffs,
sanctions and trade wars, as described
in Box 2.1.
As states turn inwards, their international
economic policies tend to focus on
collaboration with smaller groups of likeminded countries that would allow them
to better pursue their economic goals.
Countries have always sought to achieve
both geopolitical and economic aims
through regional economic integration
– the European Economic Community,
for example, was established to stabilize
relations and raise the stakes in case
of war as well as to increase market
size and economic opportunities. Many
regional groupings are established as
they allow countries to gain relative
power over others. This type of thinking
is currently why the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is
seeking to create a unified market by

Global Risks 2015

A driver of the intensifying interplay
between economics and geopolitics
is the growing direct role of the state in
the world economy, which is affecting
traditional trade and investment flows
and potentially enabling countries to
exert geopolitical influence through
economic dependency. This trend
is manifested in increasing stateled investments in other countries’
infrastructure, such as in the case
of Chinese investment in Africa or
Latin America; strategic investments
by sovereign wealth funds and
state-owned enterprises in land and
businesses in other countries, as
seen in the case of Gulf economies’
investments in Africa, and government
purchases of other governments’ debt.
In August 2014, China and Japan held
7.2% and 7% of US debt, respectively.

To strengthen their geopolitical
position, countries have also reverted
to measures that control access
to economically important national
resources or the prices of commodities
over which they exert monopoly
power to undermine other economies’
performance. These potential ways to
leverage power over other countries
through economic links are increasingly
becoming an explicit part of foreign
policy thinking.
In today’s interdependent global
economy, whenever countries focus
on their domestic market – even if
the decisions are taken by central
banks rather than politicians – there
is potential for unintended effects on
other countries to spill over into the
geopolitical sphere. For instance, one
side effect of Japan’s expansionary
monetary policies to restart its domestic

Opinion polls show that the public in
countries such as Japan, Germany
and the United States are increasingly
sceptical about the benefits of trade
and foreign investment, even as their
governments push for increased
liberalization. Despite progress on the
trade facilitation agreement, the larger
Doha Round of trade negotiations has
stalled, costing an estimated $180
billion per year at the global level.
Negotiations of regional agreements
are also being questioned (one example
is TTIP in Germany). Although growing
again, global flows of foreign direct
investment remain down by more than
a quarter from their 2007 peak, and
international trade growth has slowed
since 2012. It has yet to be determined,
however, whether this is merely a
cyclical or structural phenomenon
heralding a phase of de-globalization
in which globalized markets give way
to regional groupings and to a rise in
protectionist measures.2
When confronted with political and
economic volatility at home, countries
often revert to protectionism under the
guise of policies to reduce risk. A recent
OECD report shows that despite their
professed commitment to free trade,
G20 economies have increasingly
reverted to protective measures since
growth slowed in 2012 in the wake of
the global financial crisis.3 Protectionism
can take different forms. It can be
related, for example, to the protection
of strategic sectors, local content
requirements in the case of external
investment, or state bailouts.
Economic sanctions are another type
of punitive geo-economic measure,
such as the tit-for-tat engaged in by
Russia and the West, which indicates
that some countries are ready to
countenance a long period of economic
hardship and diplomatic woe to achieve
their political goals. The risk is thus
significant that if the use of punitive

The Increasing Risk to the
Architecture of Global Governance
Much of the interplay between
economic and geopolitical interests
plays out not in the trade arena but
in the Bretton Woods institutions.
Countries’ inability to agree on an
institutionalized, closer coordination
of macroeconomic policies to reduce
global imbalances provides an
interesting example. Some observers
see the failure to mitigate these
imbalances, combined with the return
of strategic competition in an era
defined by an erosion of trust, as raising
a tail-risk possibility of undermining the
Bretton Woods institutions themselves
and the international rule-based system
more generally.
These developments are reflected in
the recent alternative structures being
established by selected countries.
Brazil, Russia, India and China in 2014
set up the New Development Bank,
the so-called BRICs Bank, which
is intended to lend up to $34 billion
globally, particularly for infrastructure
projects. In the same year, together
with 20 other countries, China created
the Asian Infrastructure Investment
Bank for the Asia-Pacific region. Much
as a retreat from global multilateralism
is worrisome, stronger regional
multilateralism is not necessarily a bad
thing, as regional solutions to regional
problems can be consistent with global
governance structures. As already
noted, although economic integration
is not often explicitly targeted, it binds
nations more closely together politically.

more widespread, a growing number
of countries may revert to protecting
national producers and supply chains,
which could considerably impact global
trade flows. The economic effects of
sanctions can include slow growth,
unemployment and fiscal pressures.
Taken together, the slowdown in
globalization, the rise in protectionism
and the increasing prevalence of
sanctions could give rise to a scenario
of slower growth in advanced and
emerging economies. Slower growth
in emerging economies could translate
into social unrest and political instability

Some observers also see the TPP and
TTIP as the last chance for the United

developing countries into alignment
with a liberal economic institutional
framework by creating a domestic
market big enough to be able to set
the rules in the global economy – an
implicit recognition that current global
governance institutions are no longer
functioning effectively enough to
achieve this goal. Yet, increasingly,
negotiating countries question the
benefits of these mega regional
agreements.

Any weakening of global governance
could weaken collective resilience to
global risks, which respect no national
borders and require multilateral
responses. These include climate
change, where an inability to agree
on carbon reductions could result in
rising sea levels, more frequent storms
and stress to water supplies; migration
flows, where pressures on societies
and resources could result in conflict;
and Internet governance, where a
tendency towards fragmentation can
already be observed through some
large economies’ efforts to put into
place measures to protect their national
networks. Should a global governance
solution to the Internet not be found,
further fragmentation could significantly
reduce the benefits of communication
and information networks that the
world has come to take for granted.
What Can Be Done?

At a time of highly interconnected
challenges that can only be addressed
through global cooperation,

Box 2.2: The World Economic Forum’s work on geo-economics
The World Economic Forum is developing a clearer understanding of the
interaction between geopolitics and economics with the support of its
Network of Global Agenda Councils. The Global Agenda Council on Geoeconomics aims to become the world’s leading network of thinkers on the
impact of geopolitics on the global economy and vice versa – launching a
vital global discussion that links leaders from the worlds of politics,
economics and business in a debate about the major trends that are
changing the world. The Council will publish an annual brief identifying the
main geo-economic issues on the horizon and delve into the implications of
emerging developments, such as the use of sanctions or low oil prices for
different regions, actors and sectors. Issues that will be examined in more
depth include the next phase of economic warfare, the next wave of state
capitalism (including the rise of central banks as drivers of geo-economics
and the rise of strategic sectors), the idea of gated globalization, the role of
infrastructure in building alliances, and the weakening of peripheral countries
by regional agreements. The Forum’s work will also include an assessment of
impact on selected industries. It will be developed over the coming years and
the findings will be integrated into the work of the Forum and its communities.

is therefore key to ensuring effective
collaboration at a time when strategic
competition dominates international
relations. Without trust, no decisions
at the international level will be taken.
However, the responsibility extends
beyond the political level: multinational
companies and consumers also have a
role to play to strengthen the argument
in favour of global collaboration in the
face of growing pressures to prioritize
national economic self-interest.
Conclusion

Faced with competing strategic pivots
and governments’ growing tendency
to look inwards and prioritize their
domestic producers and economies,
and with an increased reliance on
economic levers as a means to gain
geopolitical influence, the coming years
could see competitive relationships
between the major powers develop
into trade and currency wars, requiring
economic diplomacy.
While regional institutions and
alternative structures have a role, global
institutions must respond to pressure
to better reflect the rising wealth and
power of emerging economies. They
remain the most promising means for

competing powers to build strategic
trust, which could minimize the
detrimental effects of geo-economic
competition on growth and prosperity.

One of the main factors driving rapid
urbanization in emerging economies
is rural-urban migration motivated by
the prospect of greater employment
opportunities and the hope of a better
life in cities. Indeed, when a certain
critical mass of population is reached,
it is economically viable to deliver
many infrastructure projects, such
as public transportation. However, a
higher population density also creates
negative externalities, especially when
urbanization is rapid, poorly-planned

and occurs in a context of widespread
poverty.8 Estimates suggest that 40%
of the world’s urban expansion is taking
place in slums, exacerbating socioeconomic disparities and creating
unsanitary conditions that facilitate the
spread of disease.9 The example of the
1994 outbreak of pneumonic plague in
the Indian city of Surat suggests how,
in a worst-case scenario, poverty and
a pandemic in a large-scale informal
settlement could potentially lead to a
breakdown in urban order.10
Rapid urbanization can alter the nature
of almost every global risk considered
in this report by influencing its likelihood
and impact. In addition, cities are points
of convergence of many risks, which

make them particularly vulnerable
to chain reactions and amplify the
interconnection between global risks.
Better knowledge of how such risks
interconnect in their materialization at
the city level is the first step towards
helping cities build resilience. Three
regions – South Asia, East Asia and
the Pacific, and Latin America and the
Caribbean – have identified this risk
as among those for which they are

If managed well, urbanization can bring
important benefits for development.
Cities are an efficient way of organizing
people’s lives: they enable economies
of scale and network effects, and
reduce the need for transportation,
thereby making economic activity more
environmentally friendly. The proximity
and diversity of people can spark
innovation and create employment
as exchanging ideas breeds new
ideas. The diversity of cities can also
inculcate social tolerance and provide
opportunities for civic engagement.
Already today, the linkages between
cities form the backbone of global
trade, and cities overall generate a large
majority of the world’s GDP.

The world is experiencing a historically
unprecedented transition from
predominantly rural to urban living.
In 1950, one-third of the world’s
population lived in cities; today the
number has already reached more
than one-half, and in 2050 city
dwellers are expected to account for
more than two-thirds of the world’s
population (see Figure 2.1).4 This rapid
rise will mainly take place in developing
countries (see Figure 2.2).5 Africa and
Asia – both still comparatively less
urbanized than other regions – will
be the fastest urbanizing regions with
the urban population projected to
reach 56% in Africa and 64% in Asia
by 2050 (currently at 40% and 48%,
respectively).6 These developments
imply an unprecedented shift of the
urban world away from the north-west
to the south and east.7

of Rapid and Unplanned
Urbanization in Developing
Countries

The Infrastructure Challenge

Part 2
Part 3

The quality of a city’s infrastructure
– its housing, electricity, roads,
airports, public transport, drinking
water, sanitation, waste management,
flood defences, telecommunications,
hospitals, schools and so forth – largely
determines its residents’ quality of
life, social inclusion and economic
opportunities. It also largely determines
the city’s resilience to a number of
global risks, in particular environmental,
social and health-related risks,
but also economic risks, such as
unemployment. Indeed, the availability
and quality of infrastructure are at
the core of many of the challenges
faced by rapidly urbanizing cities
in developing countries, which are
developed further in this section of the
report.
As cities in developing countries
are expanding rapidly, it is likely
that infrastructure will not be able
to keep pace with their growth nor
the increased expectations of their
populations. Action to close the
infrastructure gap is urgently needed
and will strongly influence the potential
of risks to have catastrophic cascading
effects.
To provide adequate global
infrastructure for electricity, road and
rail transport, the OECD estimates that
telecommunications and water will cost
approximately $71 trillion by 2030 – an
enormous challenge as it represents
about 3.5% of forecasted global GDP.12
Most of this investment will be needed
in emerging economies. For instance,
the Programme for Infrastructure
Development in Africa estimates that
Africa will need to invest up to $93
billion annually until 2020 for both
capital investment and maintenance;
currently only $45 billion is financed,
which leaves an infrastructure gap of
$48 billion per year to be financed.13
In addition to the provision of
infrastructure, it is critical to consider
its location as risks can emerge if
developed in the wrong location relative
to the needs of the population.
Where will the money come from?
Most governments are under tight
budget constraints and many
developing countries already spend
a large proportion of their national
32

income to meet the basic needs of their
population.14 Consequently, cities are
looking for public-private collaboration
to involve the private sector in the
design, construction and maintenance
of infrastructure. However, to promote
successful public-private collaboration,
corruption must be tackled, as it is
a traditional problem in construction

projects and dissuades investors. In
addition, the key enablers of publicprivate collaboration at the city level
include factors such as transparency
(in such matters as partner selection
and contract execution) and the
availability of accurate data to allow
risk assessments. Public-private
collaboration is a way for cities to

Box 2.3: Life in the city – how smart is smart?
Like industry, cities are increasingly investing in information technology-based
systems to address the challenges of managing large enterprises and enabling
service innovations. While these investments often deliver rapid improvements in
efficiency and operational continuity, they also create unexpected new risks:
bugs and brittleness.
The growing amount of software used to manage urban infrastructure increases
the likelihood of coding errors that can cause catastrophic failures, especially in
highly-centralized control systems. For instance, in 2006, San Francisco’s Bay
Area Rapid Transit network was laid low for days when initial efforts to fix a bug
inadvertently triggered a larger and longer outage.
Smart city systems also rely on many underlying technology platforms that are
surprisingly brittle. For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) is not only
relied on for navigation services but also serves an irreplaceable time
synchronization function. Likewise, thousands of smart city apps and websites
rely for their core computational capability on the cloud computing infrastructure
of companies such as Amazon, which have experienced several major outages
in recent years.
The brittleness of mobile cellular networks presents a special challenge to
resilience for large cities. Unlike the Internet – which, at least in theory,
possesses significant resilience through its multiple, redundant linkages –
cellular networks have several choke points. Cell sites themselves can be
damaged physically. More importantly, the supporting wired infrastructures for
electrical power and “backhaul” connections to the communications grid can
fail: both the Japanese tsunami in 2011 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012 caused
damage to cellular networks that took weeks to repair. The most dangerous
failure mode for cellular networks is due to congestion – during crises, panic
dialling frequently overwhelms the carefully-managed wireless spectrum these
networks depend on.
All levels of government will need to be more assertive in auditing and stresstesting vital digital infrastructures. The sudden and unexpected failure of these
systems during crises has crippling knock-on effects across official and civilian
response and relief efforts. Even during peacetime, the economic and social
effects of bugs and brittleness can be devastating, with potential for long-lasting
impacts. Assessments must go beyond cybersecurity, as the risks are not just
about external threats but also about the fundamentally unstable dynamics of
digital infrastructures and the complex, chaotic and unpredictable ways they
can interact with civic, social and economic systems.

component. Indeed, if technology
developed for smart cities does not
embrace universal design to ensure
use by all (including the disabled
and the elderly), its benefits could be
controversial.

Part 2

Much discussion revolves around the
potential for technology to increase
the efficiency with which urban
infrastructure can be managed.
The use of big data, the Internet of
Things and ubiquitous smartphones
promise to revolutionize aspects

of city management, from keeping
traffic flowing to reducing electricity
outages, tackling crime and preparing
for emergencies. Developing countries
have the opportunity to leapfrog by
avoiding the mistakes made by more
advanced countries and applying the
lessons learned from the development
of smart city infrastructure. However,
while “smart cities” should work better,
they may also be more vulnerable
to cyber error or terror (see Box
2.3). When discussing “smart cities”
it is important to note the human

Part 3

Box 2.4: Health in cities – robust plans are needed to face the threat of pandemics
Dense urban living facilitates the spread of infectious diseases. Particular vulnerabilities exist in countries where rapid
urbanization results in informal settlements that make it difficult to control transmission and can therefore increase the risks of
mosquito-transmitted epidemics, such as malaria, tuberculosis, dengue and yellow fever.
Various examples highlight the impact of urbanization on pandemics. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 83% of
people with tuberculosis live in cities1 (around 40% of the population lives in urban areas).2 In 2009, Mexico City shut down
schools, libraries, museums and nightclubs to halt the spread of H1N1 flu. A 2009 cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe heavily
affected Harare city, Chitungwiza and Kadoma, also stressing the influence of slums and the lack of urban infrastructure as
key igniting factors for the speed and severity of disease outbreaks.3
In today’s hyperconnected world, it is easier for pathogens to be carried from one city to another and quickly scale up the
impact of most outbreaks. The presumed introduction of the virus to the informal settlements of Kenema and Freetown in
Sierra Leone has undoubtedly augmented its spread. Sierra Leone is urbanizing at a rate of 3% each year, and in 2005 more
than 97% of its urban population lived in slums.4 The economic impact of Ebola is enormous for the affected countries and
their neighbouring countries. The estimated economic cost is $32 billion in the worst-case scenario.5
Another aggravating factor to the 2014 Ebola crisis was the lack of a governance mechanism that would allow an effective link
between what was being observed at the country and city levels and the alert mechanisms necessary to trigger an
emergency response. Looking into the future for an adequate response across geographies, the existence of such a
governance mechanism would: (i) allow collaboration between local and national governments, civil society and the private
sector across borders; (ii) coordinate the surveillance, collection, sharing and analysis of infectious disease data in real time;
(iii) incentivize the private sector to develop and scale up the production and distribution of affordable drugs, vaccines and
diagnostics; (iv) establish a network of centres for research into microbial threats; and (v) promote international standards for
best laboratory, regulatory and ethical practice.6
The vulnerability of urban centres to pandemics points to the need for strong public-private coordination involving
organizations beyond the traditional healthcare sector. The ability to mobilize a response from sectors as diverse as food
production, telecommunications and corporate supply chains will determine how epidemics are fought in the future. Local,
national and cross-border government agencies need to build bridges with all stakeholders and learn from what worked in
the past to shape systems with the capacity to respond to pandemics and build the resilience to bounce back afterwards.
Coordinating responses and developing global governance mechanisms are critical to contain future outbreaks, which will
inevitably occur.

One excellent case study is the city
of Surat in India. Hitting rock bottom
due to a public health disaster in 1994,
it introduced measures to drastically
raise hygienic standards, making it one
of the cleanest cities in India today.16
However, when urbanization is rapid
and unplanned, a combination of high
population density, poverty and lack
of infrastructure – especially water and
waste management – can create the
conditions for communicable diseases
to flourish.

Part 3

Almost 700 million urban dwellers
currently lack adequate sanitation.17
The problem is particularly acute
in Sub-Saharan Africa and southcentral Asia, where 62% and 43%,
respectively, of the urban population
live in slums.18 Such conditions create
increased risks of illnesses, worm
infections, cholera and diarrhoea – a
leading cause of preventable death in
children – and help spread emerging
infectious diseases, such as Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
and H1N1 influenza.19 With the
projected huge increase of populations
living in slums and the growing
sophistication of transport networks
between cities, the spread of infectious
diseases could happen extremely
quickly and could be difficult to contain,
creating the risk of global disease
outbreaks.
In addition to communicable diseases,
rapid and unplanned urbanization is a
key driver in the increased prevalence
of non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
and their key risk factors, such as
unhealthy diets, physical inactivity,
tobacco consumption, harmful use of
alcohol and pollution.20 NCDs, including
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes,
cancer and chronic respiratory
diseases, are the leading cause
of death globally. These diseases
affect high-, middle- and low-income
countries. Every year 38 million people
die from NCDs; over 14 million die
prematurely – before they reach the
age of 70 and 85% are in low- and
middle-income countries.21
The prevalence of diabetes in emerging
economies is rising: in China, it is
already comparable to that in the
United States: in 2013, the figures
were 9% and 9.2%, respectively. In
Kuwait, diabetes prevalence has been
34

Global Risks 2015

as high as 23%; even in a low-income
country such as Burundi, it reached
4.5%.22 Although a formal link between
diabetes and urbanization has not
been established, the number of urban
dwellers with diabetes in low- and
middle-income countries is projected
to almost double from 181 million today
to 347 million people in 2035.23 In
India for example, diabetes prevalence
is close to epidemic proportion and
is attributed - at least partially - to
urbanization.24 This will put huge
pressure on already fragile healthcare
systems, the collapse of which could
have devastating cascading effects
with dramatic economic losses.

The concentration of people, assets,
critical infrastructure and economic
activities in cities exacerbates the
potential of natural catastrophes
to cause unprecedented damage:
heatwaves, extreme rainfall and
drought-related shortages of water and
food will increasingly test the resilience
of infrastructure in these and other
cities. The effects of shortfalls are likely
to be felt mostly by the poor, whose
informal settlements tend to be on land
at especially high risk from extreme
weather.30 Making cities more resilient
to extreme weather events should be a
priority for both local governments and
the private sector.

Addressing non-communicable
diseases will require efforts to tackle
the causes of air pollution, which is
estimated to have caused 7 million
deaths in 2012.25 Air pollution tends to
be more of a problem in developing
than developed countries, in part due
to coal-fired power plants and the use
of biomass for cooking and heating,
but mostly due to private transport
vehicles.26 Over 90% of air pollution in
developing world cities is attributed to
old, poorly-maintained vehicles running
on low-quality fuel and to roads prone
to traffic jams.27 The rapid rise of noncommunicable diseases in low-income
countries could jeopardize poverty
reduction and limit inclusive outcomes
from growth.

Cities not only need to adapt to climate
change, they also have a major role
to play in mitigating its impact. While
established cities with efficient mass
transit systems have relatively low
carbon footprints, the early phases of
urbanization tend to generate massive
greenhouse gas emissions as the
construction of infrastructure uses
concrete and metals that are carbonintensive to manufacture.31 Developing
countries already account for around
two-thirds of annual greenhouse
gas emissions, caused in part by
their economic growth and rapid
urbanization.32 The rapid expansion
of their cities means that mitigation
measures have to be taken today to
help tackle climate change.

Cities and Climate Change

With adequate land-use planning and
in coordination with the private sector,
cities can develop infrastructure in
more sustainable, low-carbon ways –
but this requires governance, technical,
financial and institutional capacities
that are often lacking in developing
countries.33 Leadership within local
governments is at the heart of both
urban mitigation of and adaptation to
climate change.34 Well-governed cities
with universal provision of infrastructure
and services have a strong base for
building resilience to climate change
if processes of planning, design and
allocation of human capital and material
resources are responsive to emerging
climate risks.

In many developing countries,
migration from rural areas to cities is at
least partially driven by the increasing
prevalence of extreme weather, such
as land degradation and desertification,
making agriculture more difficult. For
example, many people are migrating
from dry land areas in north-east Brazil
to favelas in Rio de Janeiro.28 The
rapid, inadequate and poorly planned
expansion of cities in developing
countries can also leave urban
populations highly exposed to the
effects of climate change. For example,
cities tend to be located near the sea
or natural waterways, where they are
more at risk of flooding. Indeed, 15 of
the world’s 20 megacities – those with
over 10 million inhabitants – are located
in coastal zones threatened by sealevel rise and storm surges.29

Social Instability
Cities’ capacity to generate prosperity
already largely determines global
growth: just over half the world’s

Part 1

Rapid urbanization and the related
growing demand for housing are
creating pressure on the housing
market and social tensions are
expected to increase. The shortage of
affordable housing not only contributes
to social exclusion, it can also threaten
to destabilize the wider economy if the
housing price increase fuels property
bubbles. Making housing more
accessible, affordable and adequate
for urban dwellers is therefore of critical
importance. A wide portfolio of policies,
from limiting excessive credit to
optimizing land use and development
activity in cities, is crucial to mitigate
these risks and equitably distribute the
benefits of urban growth.

Urbanization creates opportunities but
also exacerbates risks, and the speed
at which it is happening challenges
our capacity to plan and adapt. This
is particularly true in developing
economies. For rapid urbanization to
provide opportunities to all, carefully
considered urban planning and good
governance with effective regulatory
frameworks are required. However,
governments of rapidly-growing cities
often have little time for adjustment
and learning. As a consequence,
inadequate planning and ineffective
governance can bring significant
economic, social and environmental
costs, threatening the sustainability of
urban development.

Part 3

Many of the risks described above can
lead to social instability. It is the rapid
and unplanned nature of urbanization,
rather than urbanization itself, that is
linked by many researchers to such
risks as urban violence and social
unrest.37 Rapid urbanization in the
developing world can quickly bring
together large numbers of unemployed
youth, a common ingredient of social
unrest. Widening inequalities also tend
to be more starkly visible in urban than
rural areas, with the most wealthy areas
of cities often neighbouring quicklyexpanding slums. The combination
of inequality, competition over scarce
resources such as land, impunity from
the law and weak city governance
increases the risk of violence and
potential breakdowns in law and order.
Some cities in developing countries
are already extremely dangerous,
such as for example San Pedro Sula in
Honduras, with 169 killings per 100,000
residents in 2011.38

Conclusion: The Importance of City
Governance

Part 2

population lives in cities, but they
generate more than 80% of global
GDP. In addition, most future growth
will be generated by midsized cities
and not by megacities, as is commonly
believed.35 Ultimately, new migrants in
cities are expected to create greater
economic value than they would have
in the countryside. However, even
when cities are successful, the process
of absorbing migrants into urban
economies is not necessarily smooth.
While moving to a city offers individuals
more opportunities to improve their
living conditions, the high cost of living
and competition for livelihoods can also
trap people in poverty.36

The inability of governments to provide
appropriate infrastructure and public
services is at the core of many urban
challenges in developing countries,
which range from the incapacity
to contain infectious disease to
the challenges of building climateresilient cities. At the same time, these
challenges have worsened due to
the rapid and chaotic development of
cities. City leaders from government,
civil society and the private sector
are ideally positioned to plan rapid
urbanization and must act to sustain
metropolitan growth.
What is more, as the world continues
to urbanize, power will increasingly
be concentrated in cities. This power
– ranging from economic to social –
not only makes cities the centre of
gravity, but offers greater scope to
find practical solutions to the most
pressing challenges. Indeed, many
observers and organizations are now
focusing on cities and the connections
between them rather than directing
their attention at the national level.
The strength of city-level institutions
in addition to national institutions –
their capacity to be flexible, innovative
and dynamic, and effectively involve
multiple stakeholders in governance
– will largely determine whether
urbanization makes the world more
resilient or more vulnerable in the face
of global risks.

2.4 Engineering the Future:
How Can the Risks and
Rewards of Emerging
Technologies Be
Balanced?

Part 3

From networked medical devices to
the Internet of Things, from droughtresistant crops to bionic prosthetics,
emerging technologies promise to
revolutionize a wide range of sectors
and transform traditional relationships.39
Their impacts will range from the
economic to the societal, cultural,
environmental and geopolitical.
Emerging technologies hold great and
unprecedented opportunities. Some
examples are explored in detail in three
boxes presented in this section:

♦ Synthetic biology could create

bacteria that turn biomass into
diesel (Box 2.6).

♦ Gene drives could assist in the

eradication of insect-borne diseases
such as malaria (Box 2.7).

Box 2.5: Classifying emerging technologies
In general, three broad categories of emerging technologies can be
distinguished: first, those to do with information, the Internet and data transfer,
which include artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and big data; second,
biological technologies, such as the genetic engineering of drought-resistant
crops and biofuel, lab-grown meat, and new therapeutic techniques based on
RNA1, genomics and microbiomes; and third, chemical technologies, those
involved in making stronger materials (such as nanostructure carbon-fibre
composites) and better batteries (through germanium nanowires, for example),
recycling nuclear waste and mining metals from the by-products of water
desalination plants.
However, any attempt to categorize emerging technologies is difficult because
many new advances are interdisciplinary in nature. In particular, information
technology underlies many, if not all, advances in emerging technology. A final
category of cross-over technologies would include smart grids in the electricity
supply industry, brain-computer interfaces and bioinformatics –
the growing capacity to use technology to model and understand biology.
Note:
1
RNA stands for ribonucleic acid; it is one of the three major biological macromolecules that are essential
for all known forms of life (along with DNA and proteins). A central tenet of molecular biology states that the
flow of genetic information in a cell goes from DNA through RNA to proteins: “DNA makes RNA makes
protein”. Proteins are the workhorses of the cell; they play leading roles in the cell as enzymes, as structural
components, and in cell signalling, to name just a few. For more information see the RNA Society at http://
www.rnasociety.org/about/what-is-rna/.

♦ Artificial intelligence is behind

advances from self-driving cars to
personal care robots (Box 2.8).

Discoveries are proceeding quickly in
the laboratory, and once technologies
demonstrate their usefulness in the real
world, they attract significantly more
investments and develop at an even
greater pace.
However, how emerging technologies
evolve is highly uncertain. Their
potential second- or third-order effects
cannot easily be anticipated, such that
designing safeguards against them
is difficult. Even if the ramifications of
technologies could be foreseen as
they emerge, the trade-offs would
still need to be considered. Would
the large-scale use of fossil fuels for
industrial development have proceeded
had it been clear in advance that
it would lift many out of poverty
but introduce the legacy of climate
change? Would the Haber-Bosch
process have been sanctioned had
it been evident it would dramatically
increase agricultural food production
but adversely impact biodiversity?40
A range of currently emerging
technologies could have similar or
even more profound implications for
mankind’s future. Survey respondents
36

Global Risks 2015

highlighted technological risks as highly
connected to man-made environmental
catastrophes.
Emerging technology is a broad and
loose term (see Box 2.5), and debate
about potential risks and benefits is
more vigorous in some areas than in
others. In the examples that follow,
the focus is on technologies that are
considered to have wide benefits and
for which there is strong pressure for
development, as well as high levels
of concern about potential risks and
safeguards.
Causes for Concern
Risks of undesirable impacts of
emerging technologies can be
divided into two categories: the
foreseen and the unforeseen. Some
examples of foreseen risks are
leakage of dangerous substances
through difficulties of containment
(as is sometimes the case with trials
of genetically-modified crops) or
storage errors (as with 2014 security
failures in US disease-control labs
handling lethal viruses);41 the theft or
illegal sale of emerging technologies;
computer viruses, hacker attacks on

human transplants42, or chemical or
biological warfare. The establishment
of new fundamental capabilities, as is
happening for example with synthetic
biology and artificial intelligence,
is especially associated with risks
that cannot be fully assessed in the
laboratory. Once the genie is out of
the bottle, the possibility exists of
undesirable applications or effects that
could not be anticipated at the time of
invention. Some of these risks could
be existential – that is, endangering the
future of human life (see Boxes 2.6 to
2.8).43
Both foreseen and unforeseen risks
are amplified by the accelerating
speed and complexity of technological
development. Exponential growth
in computing power implies the
potential for a tipping point that
could significantly amplify risks, while
hyperconnectivity allows new ideas
and capabilities to be distributed more
quickly around the world. The growing
complexity of new technologies,
combined with a lack of scientific
knowledge about their future evolution
and often a lack of transparency,
makes them harder for both individuals
and regulatory bodies to understand.

Part 1

Box 2.6: Synthetic biology - protecting mother nature

Part 2

For thousands of years, humans have been selectively breeding crops and animals. With the discovery of DNA hybridization in
the early 1970s, it became possible to genetically modify existing organisms. Synthetic biology goes further: it refers to the
creation of entirely new living organisms from standardized building blocks of DNA. The technology has been in development
since the early 2000s, as knowledge and methods for reading, editing and designing genetics have improved, costs of DNA
sequencing and synthesis have decreased, and computer modelling of proposed designs has become more sophisticated.
(see Figure 2.6.1)

Part 3

In 2010 Craig Venter and his team demonstrated that a simple bacterium could be run on entirely artificially-made DNA.1
Applications of synthetic biology that are currently being developed include producing biofuel from E. coli bacteria; designer
organisms that act as sensors for pollutants or explosives; optogenetics, in which nerve cells are made light-sensitive and neural
signals are controlled using lasers, potentially revolutionizing the treatment of neurological disorders; 3D-printed viruses that can
attack cancer;2 and gene drives as a possible solution to insect-borne diseases (as discussed in Box 2.7).
Alongside these vast potential benefits are a range of risks. Yeast has already been used to make morphine;3 it is not hard to
imagine that synthetic biology may allow entirely new pathways for producing illicit drugs. The invention of cheap, synthetic
alternatives to high-value agricultural exports such as vetiver could suddenly destabilize vulnerable economies by removing a
source of income on which farmers rely.4 As technology to read DNA becomes more affordable and widely available, privacy
concerns are raised by the possibility that someone stealing a strand of hair or other genetic material could glean medicallysensitive information or determine paternity.
The risk that most concerns analysts, however, is the possibility of a synthetized organism causing harm in nature, whether by
error or terror. Living organisms are self-replicating and can be robust and invasive. The terror possibility is especially pertinent
because synthetic biology is “small tech” – it does not require large, expensive facilities or easily-tracked resources. Much of its
power comes from sharing information and, once a sequence has been published online, it is nearly impossible to stop it: a
“DIYbio” or “biohacker” community exists, sharing inventions in synthetic biology, while the International Genetically Engineered
Machines competition is a large international student competition in designing organisms, with a commitment to open-sourcing
the biological inventions.
Conceivably, a single rogue individual might one day be able to devise a weapon of mass destruction – a virus as deadly as Ebola
and as contagious as flu. What mechanisms could safeguard against such a possibility? Synthetic biology and affordable
DNA-sequencing also opens up the possibility of designing bespoke viruses as murder weapons: imagine a virus that spreads by
causing flu-like symptoms and is programmed to cause fatal brain damage if it encounters a particular stretch of DNA found only
in one individual.5

Part 1
Part 2

Synthetic biology is currently governed largely as just another form of genetic engineering. Regulations tend to assume large
institutional stakeholders such as industries and universities, not small and medium-sized enterprises or amateurs. The
governance gap is illustrated by the controversy surrounding the very successful 2013 crowdsourcing of bioluminescent plants,
which exploited a legal loophole dependent on the method used to insert genes.6 The Glowing Plants project, which aims
ultimately to make trees function as street lights, was able to promise to distribute 600,000 seeds without any oversight by a
regulatory body other than the discretion of Kickstarter. The project caused concern not only among activists against geneticallymodified organisms, but also among synthetic biology enthusiasts who feared it might cause a backlash against the technology.7

Differences can already be observed in the focus of DIYbio groups in Europe and the United States due to the differing nature of
regulations on genetically-modified organisms in their regions, with European enthusiasts focusing more on “bio-art”.8 The
amateur synthetic biology community is very aware of safety issues and pursuing bottom-up options for self-regulation in various
ways, such as developing voluntary codes of practice.9 However, self-regulation has been criticized as inadequate, including by
a coalition of civil society groups campaigning for strong oversight mechanisms.10 Such mechanisms would need to account for
the cross-border nature of the technology, and inherent uncertainty over its future direction.11

Safeguards and Challenges
As illustrated by the boxes on synthetic
biology, gene drives and artificial
intelligence, governance regimes that
could mitigate the risks associated with
the abuse of emerging technologies –
from formal regulations through private
codes of practice to cultural norms –
present a fundamental challenge that
has the following main aspects.44
The current regulatory framework
is insufficient. Regulations are
comprehensive in some specific
areas of emerging technology, while
weak or non-existent in others, even
if conceptually the areas are similar.
Consider the example of two kinds
of self-flying aeroplane: the use of
autopilot on commercial aeroplanes
has long been tightly regulated,
whereas no satisfactory national and
international policies have yet been
defined for the use of drones.
Spatial issues include where to
regulate, whether at the national
or international level. The latter is
38

Global Risks 2015

further complicated by the need to
translate regulations into rules that
can be implemented nationally to
be fully enforceable. Undesirable
consequences have the scope to cross
borders, but cultural attitudes differ
widely. For example, public attitudes
are more accepting of geneticallymodified produce in the United States
than the European Union; consequently
the EU has institutionalized the
precautionary principle, while
there is more faith in the US that a
“technological fix” will be available
for most challenges.45 Safeguards,
regulations and governance need to
combine consistency across countries
with the strength to address the
worldwide impacts of potential risks
and the flexibility to deal with different
cultural preferences.
The timing issue is that decisions need
to be taken today for technologies that
have a highly uncertain future path,
the consequences of which will be
visible only in the long term. Regulate
too heavily at an early stage and a
technology may thus fail to develop;

adopt a laissez-faire approach for
too long, and rapid developments
may have irrevocable consequences.
Different kinds of regulatory oversight
may be needed at different stages:
when the scientific research is being
conducted, when the technology
is being developed, and when the
technology is being applied. At the
same time, the natural tendency to
think short term in policy-making
needs to be overcome. Compared
with Internet technology, notably
the physical and life sciences have
longer cycles of development and
need governance regimes to take a
long-term approach. History shows
that it can take a long time to reach
international agreements on emerging
threats – 60 years for bioweapons, 80
years for chemical weapons – so it is
never too early to start discussions.46
The question of who regulates
becomes significant when it is
unclear where a new device fits
into the allocation of responsibility
across existing regulatory bodies.
This is an increasingly difficult

Part 1

Box 2.7: Gene drives – promises and regulatory challenges

Part 2

In sexually reproducing organisms, most genes have a 50% chance of being inherited by offspring. However, natural
selection has in some cases favoured certain genes that are inherited more often. For the past decade or so, research has
been exploring how this could be triggered.1 The “gene drives” method “drives” a gene through a population, stimulating a
gene to be preferentially inherited. This gene then can spread through a given population, whose characteristics could thus
be modified by the addition, deletion, editing or even suppression of certain genes.
Gene drives present an unprecedented opportunity to cure some of the most devastating risks to health and the
environment. Applications are foreseen in the fight against malaria and other insect-borne diseases, which the
reprogramming of mosquito genomes could potentially eliminate from entire regions. They are also foreseen in combating
herbicide and pesticide resistance, and in eradicating invasive species that threaten the biodiversity of ecosystems.

Part 3

Technical challenges remain, relating mainly to the difficulty of editing genomes for programming drives in a way that is
precise (with only the targeted gene affected) and reversible (to prevent and overwrite possible unwanted changes). A team
at Harvard University, MIT and the University of California at Berkeley is making huge progress, such that the development
of purpose-built, engineered gene drives is expected in the next few years.2
However, gene drives carry potential risks to wild organisms, crops and livestock: unintentional damage could possibly be
triggered and cascade through other connected ecosystems. No clear regulatory framework to deal with gene drives
currently exists. The US Food and Drug Administration would consider them as veterinary medicines, requiring the
developers to demonstrate they are safe for animals that need to be protected. So how are they defined? Both the US policy
on Dual Use Research of Concern, which oversees research that has clear security concerns, and the Australia Group
Guidelines, a form of private regulations on transfers of biological material, rely on lists of infectious bacterial and viral
agents.3 They do not have the functional approach that would be needed, for example, to regulate genetic modifications to
sexually reproducing plants and animals.
Scientists and regulators need to work together from an early stage to understand the challenges, opportunities and risks
associated with gene drives, and agree in advance to a governance regime that would govern research, testing and release.
Acting now would allow time for research into areas of uncertainty, public discussion of security and environmental
concerns, and the development and testing of safety features. Governance standards or regulatory regimes need to be
developed proactively and flexibly to adapt to the fast-moving development of the science.4

issue as innovations become more
interdisciplinary and technologies
converge. Examples include
Google Glass, autonomous cars
and M-healthcare: while all rely on
Internet standards, they also have
ramifications in other spheres. Often no
mechanism exists for deciding which
existing regulatory body, if any, should
take responsibility for an emerging
technology.
Striking a balance between precaution
and innovation is an overall dilemma.
Often potentially-beneficial innovations
cannot be tested without some degree

of risk. For example, a new organism
may escape into the environment
and cause damage. Weighing risks
against benefits involves attempting
to anticipate the issues of tomorrow
and deciding how to allocate scarce
regulatory resources among highly
technical fields.
When a gap in governance exists,
it may create a vacuum of power
that could be filled by religious
movements and action groups
exerting more influence and potentially
stifling innovation. With that risk in
mind, industry players in emerging

technologies where institutions are
weak or non-existent may seek to
respond to a governance gap by
demonstrating their responsibility
through self-regulating – as the
“biohacker” community is attempting in
synthetic biology. Another example of a
private player highlighting a governance
gap is the way Facebook effectively
exerts regulatory power in online
identity management and censorship,
through policies such as forcing
users to display their real names and
removing images that it believes the
majority of users might find offensive.

Box 2.8: Artificial intelligence – rise of the machines

Part 2

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the discipline that studies how to create software and systems that behave intelligently. AI scientists
build systems that can solve reasoning tasks, learn from data, make decisions and plans, play games, perceive their
environments, move autonomously, manipulate objects, respond to queries expressed in human languages, translate between
languages, and more.
AI has captured the public imagination for decades, especially in the form of anthropomorphized robots, and recent advances
have pushed AI into popular awareness and use: IBM’s “Watson” computer beat the best human Jeopardy! players; statistical
approaches have significantly improved Google’s automatic translation services and digital personal assistants such as Apple’s
Siri; semi-autonomous drones monitor and strike military targets around the world; and Google’s self-driving car has driven
hundreds of thousands of miles on public roads.

Part 3

This represents substantial progress since the 1950s, and yet the original dream of a machine that could substitute for arbitrary
human labour remains elusive. One important lesson has been that, as Hans Moravec wrote in the 1980s, “It is comparatively
easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to
give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility”.1
These and other challenges to AI progress are by now well known within the field, but a recent survey shows that the most-cited
living AI scientists still expect human-level AI to be produced in the latter half of this century, if not sooner, followed (in a few years
or decades) by substantially smarter-than-human AI.2 If they are right, such an advance would likely transform nearly every sector
of human activity.
If this technological transition is handled well, it could lead to enormously higher productivity and standards of living. On the other
hand, if the transition is mishandled, the consequences could be catastrophic.3 How might the transition be mishandled?
Contrary to public perception and Hollywood screenplays, it does not seem likely that advanced AI will suddenly become
conscious and malicious. Instead, according to a co-author of the world’s leading AI textbook, Stuart Russell of the University of
California, Berkeley, the core problem is one of aligning AI goals with human goals. If smarter-than-human AIs are built with goal
specifications that subtly differ from what their inventors intended, it is not clear that it will be possible to stop those AIs from using
all available resources to pursue those goals, any more than chimpanzees can stop humans from doing what they want.4
In the nearer term, however, numerous other social challenges need to be addressed. In the next few decades, AI is anticipated
to partially or fully substitute for human labour in many occupations, and it is not clear whether human workers can be retrained
quickly enough to maintain high levels of employment.5 What is more, while previous waves of technology have also created new
kinds of jobs, this time structural unemployment may be permanent as AI could be better than humans at performing the new
jobs it creates. This may require a complete restructuring of the economy by raising fundamental questions of the nature of
economic transactions and what it is that humans can do for each other. Autonomous vehicles and other cases of human-robot
interaction demand legal solutions fit for the novel combination of automatic decision-making with a capacity for physical harm.6
Autonomous vehicles will encounter situations where they must weigh the risks of injury to passengers against the risks to
pedestrians; what will the legal redress be for parties who believe the vehicle decided wrongly? Several nations are working
towards the development of lethal autonomous weapons systems that can assess information, choose targets and open fire
without human intervention. Such developments raise new challenges for international law and the protection of noncombatants.7 Who will be accountable if they violate international law? The Geneva Conventions are unclear. It is also not clear
when human intervention occurs: before deployment, during deployment? Humans will be involved in programming autonomous
weapons; the question is whether human control of the weapon ceases at the moment of deployment. AI in finance and other
domains has introduced risks associated with the fact that AI programmes can make millions of economically significant
decisions before a human can notice and react, leading for example to a May 2012 trading event that nearly bankrupted Knight
Capital.8,9
In short, proactive and future-oriented work in many fields is needed to counteract “the tendency of technological advance to
outpace the social control of technology”.10

Emerging technologies are developing
rapidly. Their far-reaching societal,
economic, environmental and
geopolitical implications necessitate
a debate today to chart the course
for the future and reap the many
benefits but avoid the risks of emerging

In light of the complexities and
rapidly changing nature of emerging
technologies, governance should be
designed in such a way as to facilitate
dialogue among all stakeholders.
For regulators, to dialogue with
researchers at the cutting edge of
developing these technologies is the
only way to understand the potential
future implications of new and highlytechnical capabilities. For the scientific
community within and across certain
fields, a safe space is needed to
coalesce around a common language
and have an open discussion around
both benefits and risks. At the same
time, given that risks tend to cross
borders, so must the dialogue on how
to respond. And given the power of
public opinion to shape regulatory
responses, the general public must
also be included in an open dialogue
about the risks and opportunities
of emerging technologies through
carefully-managed communication
strategies. Governance will be
more stable and less likely either to
overlook emerging threats or to stifle
innovation unnecessarily, if the various
stakeholders likely to be affected are
involved in the thinking about potential
regulatory regimes and given the
knowledge to enable them to make
informed decisions.

2.5 Conclusion
Although the interplay between
geopolitics and economics,
urbanization and emerging
technologies are three very different
fields of enquiry, two common themes
emerge: the importance of governance
and the need for proactivity.
The analysis of the interplay between
geopolitics and economics focuses
attention on the need to find ways
to minimize incentives for national
governments to engage in negative
tactics, including by making the
mechanisms of global governance
more effective in resolving tensions
among nation states. As this interplay
leads to regional institutions gaining
in significance, proactive attention to
the quality and effectiveness of their
governance also becomes more
important in creating the capacity to
address risks.

Thoughts for the Future

technologies. This is not a trivial task
given the many interdependencies
and uncertainties and the fact that
many challenges transcend the
spheres of decision-makers both
across technologies and borders.
Regulators face the dilemma to
design regulatory systems that are
predictable enough for companies,
investors and scientists to make
rational decisions, but unambiguous
enough to avoid a governance gap that
could jeopardize public consent or give
too much room to non-state actors.
Against this backdrop, evolving and
adaptive regulatory systems should
be designed in a flexible manner to
take into account changing socioeconomic conditions, new scientific
insights and the discovery of unknown
interdependencies.

There is no doubt that urbanization
will continue, so improving the
governance of cities will be relevant
to a broad spectrum of global risks.
An opportunity also exists to be
proactive in fostering more effective
links between city governments around
the world, for mutual learning and
collaboration on risks that affect them.
Emerging technologies promise to
play a leading role in improving the
governance of smart cities, but also
present risks. Proactivity is especially
crucial here given that the risks that
might emerge from entirely new fields
of knowledge are impossible to predict.
Effective governance at all levels, from
industry codes of conduct to national
regulations and global cooperation,
will determine how well risks from
emerging technologies are foreseen
and minimized.

Global Risks 2015

Part 2

A fundamental question pertains
to societal, economic and ethical
implications. While emerging
technologies imply the long-term
possibility of a world of abundance,
many countries are struggling with
unemployment and underemployment,
and even a temporary adjustment due
to technological advancement could
undermine social stability. In ethical
terms, advances in transhumanism,
using technology to enhance human
physiology and intelligence, will require
finding a definition for what people
mean by human dignity: are enhanced
human capabilities a basic human
right, or a privilege for those who can
pay, even if that exacerbates and
entrenches inequalities? At the same
time, governance regimes for emerging
technologies are strongly influenced by
the perceptions, opinions and values
of society – whether people are more
enthusiastic about a technology’s
potential benefits than fearful about its
risks. This is very domain-related, and
not always rational or proportional: it
can lead to some technologies being
over-regulated and others underregulated. Many biological technologies
that touch on beliefs about religion
and human life, for example, are
regulated relatively stringently, as
evidenced by the worldwide prohibition
on human cloning.47 On the other
hand, the human propensity to
anthropomorphize means that robotic
prototypes in some empathic form of
assistive technology (such as Paro, a
baby harp seal lookalike robot assisting
in the care of people with dementia and
other health problems) easily capture
public sympathy, which may ease
safety, ethical or legal concerns.48,49 In
other areas, such as lethal autonomous
weapons, it would probably be easier
to get close to unanimous public
support to prohibit them as has been
the case for landmines. As such, these
societal implications constitute an
important risk in themselves, as it is
difficult to anticipate their impact on the
use and path of emerging technologies.

Part 3:
Good Practices on
Risk Management
and Risk
Resilience

Introduction
Mitigating, preparing for and building
resilience against global risks is a long
and complex process, a necessity
often recognized in theory but difficult
in practice.1 Global risks transcend
borders, meaning that often no single
entity has the capacity and authority
to address them. Multistakeholder
collaboration is required but made
difficult by misaligned incentives and
uncertainties – those with the most to
lose from a risk are often not those with
the most power to address it. And the
highly interconnected nature of global
risks means they need to be addressed
from multiple angles – although this also
means that investments in risk mitigation
and resilience can pay off in multiple
areas.
Analysing and better understanding
global risks is the first step towards
successful efforts to address them.
Risks must be effectively communicated
to the public, government, business
and civil society. Even then, action is
more likely to happen if stakeholders
have examples of good practice on
which to draw. With that in mind, this
year’s Global Risks report shares three
examples of risk management and
resilience practices related to extreme
weather events.
The focus on extreme weather events
is pertinent given that it tied with largescale involuntary migration at the bottom
of the list when respondents to the
Global Risks Perception Survey 2014
were asked to rate what progress had
been made in addressing each global
risk over the past 10 years (see Figure
3.1). Water crises and risks related
to extreme weather events, such as
natural disasters, major biodiversity
loss and ecosystem collapse, are also
in the bottom half of responses. In
addition, water crises is the global risk
that is perceived as the most potentially
impactful in the coming decade (see
Figure 1).
The impact of natural hazards is a
combination of the frequency and
intensity of the hazard with the
vulnerability and exposure of people,
assets and economic activities.
Strengthening resilience is an attempt to
reduce the exposure and ultimately the
potentially catastrophic impact of natural
hazards.

The importance of adequate risk
communication is a recurring theme in
effective risk management practices,
and it is at the heart of the third practice
presented here – on raising public
awareness about flood risks in Saxony,
a region of Germany that is prone to
significant flooding (ZÜRS Public).
The examples showcased here are
not intended to be exhaustive; they
are selected sources of inspiration and
a base for continuing this work in the
future.

Community-level action to build
resilience is the focus of the second
practice outlined below, the newlyestablished Resilient America
Roundtable. This highly promising
initiative is helping selected local
communities in the United States to
understand their risk interconnections
and design resilience strategies against
risks, including extreme weather events.
It is hoped that the lessons learned will
enable many more communities to do
the same.

The first practice presented here
addresses water crises. In the coming
decades, climate change will add to the
pressure that economic growth and
development are already putting on both
groundwater and renewable surface
water resources.2 As water is an issue
that must be managed locally, proven
local initiatives that can be adapted and
replicated elsewhere are needed. The
initiative described here was developed
in Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin and
has been transferred in other regions of
Asia.

Practice 1: Interdisciplinary
Science for Managing
Water Resources and
Improving Long-Term
Water Security
Securing a reliable supply of clean water
has been one of the most important
issues throughout human history. Water
management involves mitigating four
risks: shortages, including droughts;
inadequate quality; flooding; and
harming ecological systems.3 According
to the United Nations:4

Part 3

♦ Water use is growing at twice the

pace of population growth. By 2025,
two-thirds of the world population
will be experiencing water “stress
conditions”.

♦ One in nine people lacks access to

improved sources of drinking water
and one in three lacks improved
sources of water sanitation. This
causes around 3.5 million deaths
each year.

♦ Between 2000 and 2006, droughts,
floods and storm surges killed
almost 300,000 people and caused
an estimated $422 billion worth of
damage.

Climate change will increase the
frequency and severity of droughts
and floods and will lead to overall drier
conditions in some world regions.5 This
may heighten the risk of geopolitical
destabilization and armed conflict:
countries that share rivers have a
statistically higher likelihood of armed
conflict, and dry countries experience
more conflict .6,7 The Jordan, Rio
Grande, Mekong and Nile rivers are all
especially associated with conflict risk.

The complexity of modelling an entire
river system – which requires handling
vast amounts of often incomplete
data from multiple sources of varying
accuracy and reliability – had been
insurmountable until recently. But prior
investments in fields such as hydrology,
mathematics, climate and statistics had
paid off in the shape of advances that
were making such a model possible.
Then-prime minister John Howard
identified it as a national priority and
committed government funding.

The Murray-Darling Basin
Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin
provides water for over 2 million people,
including much of the city of Adelaide,
as well as 40% of Australia’s agriculture.
Unsustainable rates of water extraction
had been decreasing flow volumes: in
2007, the car ferry at the River Murray
mouth was grounded for the first time in
its 71-year history.8
There was a growing sense that
something had to be done to ensure
that the river system was not destroyed.
Policy-makers realized that they
urgently required a model that could
provide credible and robust estimates
of current and future water availability,
to enable them to set equitable and
efficient allocations for competing uses.
However, such a model had not yet been
designed, let alone built.

Figure 3.2: The Murray-Darling Basin in Australia

First, climate patterns as well as
individual models of groundwater and
surface water inflows and outflows had
to be developed, for different parts of
an area larger than France. Then these
individual models had to be brought
together into a single, integrated model.
Starting in 2006, a team of around 100
people from 15 organizations developed
ways to handle the uncertainties and
link the models. The resulting system
incorporated 70 individual ground and
surface water models and over a century
of climate data into a 61,000 gigabyte
database – roughly the size of the US
Library of Congress.
The project combined both blue-sky
and applied research. It involved the
development of new techniques for
hydrological, environmental and climate
modelling, with transparency and expert
review to validate methods and build
stakeholder trust. The project is the first
rigorous attempt worldwide to estimate
the impacts of catchment development,
changing groundwater extraction,
climate variability and anticipated
climate change, on water resources at
a basin-scale, explicitly considering the
connectivity of surface and groundwater
systems.9
Today the Murray-Darling Basin
Authority – a government organization
charged with managing the basin’s
water resources – provides a real-time
interactive website where anyone can
view daily and yearly water levels, salt
loads (electrical conductivity) and water
temperatures at recording stations for
all the basin’s major rivers. This provides
traceability and transparency for critical
decisions relating to water allocation. In
a multistakeholder environment where
allocation decisions can impact people’s
livelihoods, trust in the data is critical for
effective policy.

Next-Generation Models

Another project will see yet more
advanced techniques applied to model
water availability, ecosystems and
livelihoods for the Koshi River Basin,
which stretches from China across
the Himalayas, through Nepal and into
the Ganges in India. In 2013, CSIRO
commenced a collaborative four-year
project with the International Centre for
Integrated Mountain Development to
inform transboundary water reforms.11
Reliable information about how much
water can be safely extracted from a
river system is vital to help countries
reach agreements on long-term water
security.
As the models increase in sophistication,
the challenge is to plug them into realworld decision-making processes.
Building the models is hard, but so too is
convincing policy-makers to act on them
when they point towards the need to
make difficult choices.

Started in January 2014, the Resilient
America Roundtable initiative by
the National Academy of Sciences
aims to work with communities in a
bottom-up way. Over a three-year time
horizon, the purpose of the initiative
is to initiate, nurture and learn from
local efforts to measure and improve
resilience. It emerged from interest
in testing ideas included in the 2012
US National Research Council report
entitled Disaster Resilience: A National
Imperative on reducing vulnerability
to extreme events, decreasing their
costs and mitigating their impacts. The
Resilient America Roundtable has a
strong multistakeholder component:
initiated by nine federal agencies, it
convenes experts from the academic,
public and private sectors. The science
community is represented by the
National Academy of Sciences.
The Resilient America Roundtable has
designed and is currently catalysing
pilot projects in communities in South
Carolina, Seattle/Tacoma and Iowa, thus
offering a geographic representation
by ranging from the west (Seattle/
Tacoma) to the middle (Iowa) to the east
(South Carolina). The communities were
selected based on criteria including their
size, ethnic and economic diversity,
the range and type of natural hazard
risks they face and the presence of
motivated community leadership to own
and maintain the resulting community
resilience strategy in the long term.
The pilot projects are structured
around four pillars: (i) understanding
and communicating risk; (ii) identifying
measures or metrics of resilience,
including baseline conditions, milestones
and definitions of the acceptable
or unacceptable consequences of
the identified risks; (iii) building or

The pilot project initially involves five
steps, the first two of which have been
implemented. First, a Roundtable
subcommittee makes visits to engage
different community groups including
the business community – local corner
stores as well as multinational chains;
local government agencies; emergency
managers and first responders; and
the local chapters of community-based
non-governmental organizations such
as the American Red Cross, the United
Way, Points of Light and the Boys & Girls
Clubs of America. Separate discussions
are held with each about their views
on resilience and what elements of
quality of life must be maintained during
emergency. Around 70-100 people have
participated in these conversations so
far in Iowa and South Carolina.
Second, 70 people are invited to play a
specially-developed “Extreme Events”
game, in which everyone chooses a
role (first responder, individual, elected
official, etc.) in a fictional Coastal City and
makes decisions as a scripted scenario
unfolds that involves a hurricane and
other surprises. The game takes the
players through the efforts of finding,
sharing and distributing resources. Its
purpose is to break the ice and build
trust among the members of each
community. The game will also be made
available online.
Third, a set of interactive table top
exercises will be developed to
understand and map the specific
interdependencies in each community.
The pilots have identified certain
“community priorities” as a basis for
this exercise: in Charleston and Iowa,
economic drivers have emerged as
community priorities; in Charleston,
priorities include cultural identity and
tourism and, in Iowa, the thrust is on
grain production and export.
Fourth, the community participants will
be helped to work through a scenario
of a disrupting event in which critical
infrastructure fails. The goal is to highlight
critical nodes, networks and functions
that act as amplifiers or dampeners as
the effects of a disrupting event cascade
through the system. Finally, the resulting
disruption map will identify the nodes

The science of river basin planning is
also advancing to incorporate social
science alongside the physical sciences
in efforts to improve the resilience of
social, economic and environmental
systems. In a 2010 study with funding
from the Australian overseas aid
agency, the Commonwealth Scientific
and Industrial Research Organisation
(CSIRO) and the Mekong River
Commission developed six scenarios
for the Mekong Basin to the year 2050.
The Mekong Futures Project sought to
understand the complex transboundary
regional dynamics to improve decisionmaking, ensure participatory processes
and develop shared future visions. The
CSIRO team working on the project
had both physical and socio-economic
science backgrounds.10

Floods, hurricanes, wildfires, windstorms
and other natural hazards kill or injure
thousands of people worldwide and
cost billions of dollars in the United
States each year. The factors that make
a community resilient against these
threats – able to protect against, absorb,
mitigate, respond to or recover from
them – differ greatly according to local
circumstances. But many communities
have not even begun to think about how
to assess their resilience, let alone
build it.

strengthening coalitions or partnerships
in building community resilience; and
(iv) sharing information or data related
to better decision-making for building
resilient communities.
Part 2

The general principles of the
technologies pioneered in the MurrayDarling Basin are applicable to other
river systems, although they need to be
adapted to the unique environmental
features of each. This is now happening
for the Mekong River Basin, one of the
largest in the world, which covers China,
Myanmar, Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia
and Vietnam: over 60 million people
depend on the Mekong for their water
supply, and many hydropower plants are
planned or under construction.

that require hardening or redundancy
and that will be used as a basis to design
the community’s resilience strategy.

Part 2
Part 3

In terms of barriers, the initiative relates
to two overarching objectives: to build
resilience at the community level; and,
at a higher level, to gain insights into
common themes and local variations
on those themes to knit into a national
or a larger-scale picture. Concerning
the latter, the main challenge has,
therefore, been to structure the pilot
projects in such a way as to be able to
glean common elements or themes
from disparate communities. By using
the same basic approach (the four
pillars) in each community and seeing
which elements of the framework play
out, it is possible to understand the
similarities and differences in how to
build resilience and whether there are
enough common issues that could be
used as a basis to transfer the project
to other communities. The big barrier
for transferability would be if one were
to find through the small sample that
each community builds resilience in its
own ways and that few or weak ties bind
communities together.
Project-wise, the experience has shown
so far that one of the main enabling
factors for building community resilience
to all kinds of risks is for the community
to be functional and for the different
pieces of that community to work
together in a productive way. While a
collegial and cooperative approach
prevails in some communities from the
outset, in others more time needs to
be spent to build trust among different
sectors and stakeholders. In addition,
the key to maintaining momentum is
local leadership: having somebody –
whether an individual, an agency or
an organization – take ownership of
the community resilience strategy in a
way that allows it to be resourced and
maintained over time.
The Resilient America website (http://
resilientamerica.nas.edu) facilitates
connections among the three pilot
and other communities and will share
the resulting information and lessons
learned. It is hoped that the Resilient
America Roundtable’s emphasis on
risk communication and inclusive
understanding of resilience will ultimately
spark ideas for similar initiatives in other
communities or countries.

Increasing Awareness of
Flood Risk in Saxony – A
Practice on Risk
Communication12

available in Saxony, Lower Saxony and
Saxony-Anhalt. The GDV is working to
develop it into a standardized tool for all
of Germany. Currently the tool is being
developed in Rhineland-Palatinate and
Bavaria.15 Flood risk calculations are
presented in four groups:

In August 2002, severe floods affected
practically two-thirds of the German
state of Saxony (Figure 3.3 illustrates
the rivers in Saxony, Germany). This
disastrous event led to the development
of the Flood Protection Investment
Programme, which comprises 1,600
individual flood protection measures and
548 flood risk maps for all communities
at risk. A statewide risk awareness
campaign was also launched.

♦ high threat: statistically, floods occur

To better communicate on flood risks, in
collaboration with the Ministry of Saxony,
the German Insurance Association
(GDV) developed an online geographic
information system, ZÜRS Public, where
homeowners, tenants and businesses
can see an exact calculation of the risk
exposure to flooding, backflow, torrential
rain and earthquakes of their individual
address.13 While similar to other systems,
such as Tiris in the Austrian region of
Tyrol, it is innovative in its triangulation of
data from insurers, the government and
some 200 water management agencies
across the federal states.14 The results of
this online risk information tool are easy
to understand and free of charge.

The initiative aligned the interests of
all stakeholders and illustrates the
importance of risk communication.
Citizens benefit by understanding more
about their individual risk exposure.
The insurance industry is incentivized
to participate as the tool encourages
households and businesses to think
about their need for insurance. The
state also benefits from individuals and
businesses taking greater responsibility
for risk prevention, both through private
insurance and investment in physical
prevention measures, as it reduces their
potential liability in the event of disasters.
To raise awareness further, the state
government transparently publishes
information online about applications
for and disbursements of public
compensation for private damages.

Since its establishment in 2001, the
ZÜRS Public online risk assessment
tool has covered some 20 million home
addresses, 200,000 km of rivers, and is

at least once every 10 years

♦ medium threat: statistically, floods
occur once every 10-50 years

♦ low threat: statistically, floods occur
once every 50-200 years

♦ very low threat: statistically, floods

occur less frequently than once every
200 years

Building resilience means finding ways
to change behaviours across sectors
and systems, identifying the barriers that
must be addressed and the enablers
that should be leveraged. Readers of
the Global Risks report are invited to
submit suggestions for practices on
risk management or risk resilience to be
featured in future editions of the report.

Resilience is the ability of households, communities and nations to absorb and recover from shocks, while positively
adapting and transforming their structures and means for living in the face of long-term stresses, change and
uncertainty (Mitchell, 2013).

Part 2

The three practices described in this
section of the report illustrate how risk
mitigation and resilience-building efforts
can be driven by one stakeholder or
can progress through a broad-based
multistakeholder coalition. From an
emphasis on data collection and
analysis in the case of the Murray-Darling
Basin, to community building around
resilience in the United States and risk
communication in Germany, they show
how responses to environmental risks
can be based at the community, regional
or national levels, and highlight the
importance of knowledge and capability
transfer.

Conclusion

Our lives are very different today from
when the first Global Risks report was
published a decade ago. Little did the
world imagine the possibility of the
implosion of global financial markets
that plunged the world into a socioeconomic crisis from which it is still
struggling to emerge. The “real world”
was nowhere near as interconnected
with the virtual one: Twitter did not
exist, Facebook was still a student-only
service, and the iPhone and Android
were still one and two years,
respectively, away from their
commercial release. The power of
interconnectivity has since shown itself
forcefully – be it from the convening
power of the Arab Spring, the revelation
of massive cyber espionage around the
National Security Agency, or fastmoving developments in new disruptive
business models that are
fundamentally changing the global
economic landscape.
While increased interdependencies
have brought the world closer together,
the Global Risks report series
emphasizes the other side of the coin:
as people’s lives are becoming more
complex and more difficult to manage,
businesses, governments and
individuals alike are being forced to
decide upon courses of action in an
environment clouded by multiple layers
of uncertainty. Indeed, understanding
their implications and raising
awareness of the interconnection of
risks are at the basis of the Global Risks
report. On the upside, however, the
world has not stood still: the
importance of risk management and
the need to build resilience has since
become a top issue for decisionmakers who are recognizing that risks
are no longer isolated but inherently
dynamic in nature and crossing many
spheres of influence. Against this
backdrop, the need to collaborate and
learn from each other is clearer than
ever, an aspect that figures prominently
in this year’s report by featuring
initiatives that have demonstrated value
and good practices that can be
replicated elsewhere.
Ten years of “doing risks” has also led
to the recognition that a short-term
vision prevents addressing long-term
issues. Some slower-moving trends
have continued inexorably: the last 10
years have brought conclusive proof
that the earth’s climate is changing and
that human activities are to blame – yet

50

Global Risks 2015

progress to mitigate greenhouse gas
emissions remains frustratingly slow.
This lesson is reflected this year in the
introduction of different time horizons
and the differentiation between risks
and trends. Hopefully these innovations
will help many public and private
organizations around the world
address this aspect of human nature in
mitigating risks and building resilience.
Indeed, our self-perception as homines
economici or rational beings has
faltered in the aftermath of the financial
crisis, whose effects are still unfolding
socially, as persistent unemployment,
ever-rising inequality, unmanaged
migration flows and ideological
polarization are among the factors
stretching societies dangerously close
to the breaking point. Social fragility is
even threatening geopolitical stability,
as breakdowns in cooperation within
states make relations between states
more difficult. And a quarter-century
after the fall of the Berlin Wall, interstate
conflict is once again one of the key
risks in terms of likelihood and impact.
Yet the means through which conflicts
can be pursued are growing more
varied, as this report has explored –
from geo-economic tools, such as
trade sanctions, to cyber attacks on
critical infrastructure, to the potential for
a new arms race in lethal autonomous
weapons systems.
We are not powerless in the face of
these concerns. As highlighted
previously, multistakeholder
collaboration and global governance
are key to building resilience and
mitigating risks. From major intergovernmental conferences in Sendai
and Paris to the finalization of the
Sustainable Development Goals, the
year 2015 presents an unprecedented
range of opportunities to take collective
action to address global risks.

Appendix B: The Global Risks Perception Survey 2014 and
Methodology
As discussed in Part 1, the Global Risks
2015 methodology was reviewed last
year for this edition. A number of
workshops, interviews and discussions
were held with experts and with the
Advisory Board, taking into account
lessons from past editions as well as
developments in the global risks
landscape. The concept of trends was
introduced in both the survey and the
report and some of the global risks
analysed in the past were relabelled
and classified under a different
category or better defined as trends.
The Global Risks Perception Survey
(GRPS or survey) was adjusted
accordingly to capture the main
aspects of both risks and trends and to
assess their interconnectedness and
impact on societies. The following
section describes the survey and
methodology in greater detail.

The Global Risks
Perception Survey
The Global Risks Perception Survey,
discussed in Part 1, is the main
instrument for assessing global risks
and trends in this report. The survey
was conducted between mid-July and
the end of September 2014 among the
World Economic Forum’s
multistakeholder communities of
leaders from business, government,
academia and non-governmental and
international organizations.1
Raw responses were cleaned to
improve overall data quality and
completeness. All questionnaires with a
completion rate of below 50% were
dropped, reducing the number of
available responses from 1,120 to 896.

In 12 cases, the respondent did not
provide any information about gender,
but it was possible to infer this
information from the other records
provided (first and last names).
Similarly, 101 respondents did not
indicate the region in which they are
based and were manually assigned to
one on the basis of their country of
residence. Among the respondents,
43% completed the survey last year.
Details of the sample composition are
reported in Figure B.1.
The graph below shows the profile of
the 896 survey respondents. To
capture the voice of youth, the survey
also targeted the World Economic
Forum’s community of Global
Shapers.2 Those under 30 years of age
accounted for approximately one-fifth
of respondents.

The Global Risks
Landscape 2015 (Figure 1)
Respondents were asked to assess the
likelihood and global impact of each of
the 28 risks. For each risk, they were
asked, “How likely is this risk to occur
globally within the next 10 years?” and
“What is the estimated impact globally if
this risk were to materialize? (Impact is
to be interpreted in a broad sense
beyond just economic consequences)”.
The possible answers ranged from 1
(“very unlikely” and “low” impact,
respectively) to 7 (“very likely” and
“high” impact, respectively).
Respondents were given the possibility
to choose a “Don’t know” option if they
felt unable to provide an informed
answer. For each risk, partial
responses, i.e. those assessing only the
likelihood or only the impact, were
dropped. A simple average for both
likelihood and impact for each of the 28
global risks was calculated on this
basis. Formally, for any given risk i, its
likelihood and impact, denoted as
likelihoodi and impacti, respectively are:
1
likelihoodi =

trends are the most strongly
connected with risks? Please select at
least three pairs and up to six pairs
from the 13 trends below (you can
select the same trend and risk more
than once).” The information thus
obtained was used to construct the
risks-trends interconnections map
included in the inside cover flaps of the
report.
In both cases, a tally was made of the
number of times each pair was cited.
To obtain normalized connection
weights, this value was divided by the
count of the most frequently cited pair
and, in addition, this ratio was squarerooted to dampen the long-tail effect
(i.e. a few very strong links, and many
weak ones) for display and presentation
purposes. Of the 378 possible pairs of
risks, 122, or 32%, were not cited.
Similarly, of the possible 364 trend-risk
combinations, 116, or 32%, were not
cited. Formally, the intensity of the
interconnection between risks i and j (or
between trend i and risk j), denoted as
interconnectionij, corresponds to:
interconnectionij=
with pairmax = maxij (

Ni

impact i,n
n=1

where likelihoodi,n and impacti,n are
respectively the likelihood and impact
assigned by respondent n to risk i and
measured on a scale from 1 to 7. Ni is
the number of respondents for risk i
who assessed both the likelihood and
impact of that risk.

The Global Risks and RisksTrends Interconnections
Maps (Figures 2 and 3)
To draw the global risks
interconnections map presented in Part
1, survey respondents were asked to
answer the following question: “In your
view, which are the most strongly
connected risks? Please select at least
three pairs and up to six pairs from the
28 risks below.”
In addition, respondents were asked to
identify three to six pairs of strongly
connected trends and risks,
disregarding directions of causality.
This question read: “In your view, which

The Risks of Highest
Concern (Figure 1.1)
Although the report generally focuses
on a time horizon of 10 years,
respondents were asked to identify the
risks of highest concern within two
different time frames: 18 months and
10 years. To identify the top 10 global
risks of highest concern, described in
Part 1, respondents answered the
following question: “In this survey, we
are looking at risks within the next 10
years. For this question only, please
select the five global risks that you
believe to be of most concern within
the next 18 months and 10 years,
respectively.” For any given risk i from
the list of 28 risks, the share of total
respondents (N = 896) that declared
being concerned about that risk was
derived as follows:
% concer ni

N

with ci,n equal to 1 if respondent N
selected risk i as a risk of concern and
0 otherwise. The risks with the 10
highest shares were selected as the
risks of most concern.

N
n=1 pairij,n )

where N is the number of respondents.
Variable pairij,n is 1 when respondent n
selected the pair of risks i and j as part
of his/her selection. Otherwise, it is 0.
The value of the interconnection
determines the thickness and
brightness of each connecting line in
the graph, with the most frequently
cited pair having the thickest and
brightest line.

Progress and Preparedness
(Figure 1.7 and Figure 3.1)

In the global risks and risks-trends
interconnections maps (Figures 2 and
3), the area of each node
(corresponding to a risk or a trend) is
scaled according to the number of
times the corresponding risk or trend
was cited as a part of the connection
pair.

For any given risk i from the list of 28
risks, the share of total respondents (N
= 896) who think that most progress
has been made in addressing that risk
was calculated as follows:

The placement of the nodes was
computed using ForceAtlas2, a
force-directed network layout algorithm
implemented in Gephi software, which
minimizes edge lengths and edge
crossings by running a physical particle
simulation.3

with pi,n equal to 1 if respondent N
selected risk i, and 0 otherwise.

Survey respondents were asked to
identify up to three risks for which they
felt most progress to address them has
been made over the past 10 years.
Similarly, they were asked to select up
to three risks which they believed their
region was least prepared for.4

Appendix C: The Executive Opinion Survey and Views of the
Business Community on the Impact of Global
Risks on Their Business
Every year since 1979, the World
Economic Forum conducts the
Executive Opinion Survey (EOS). This
survey captures invaluable information
on a broad range of socio-economic
issues. In the 2014 edition, over 13,000
executives in 144 economies were
surveyed.5
The 2014 edition of the EOS, conducted
between February and May 2014, for
the first time included a question on the
risks of biggest concern. More
specifically, respondents were asked to
select the five global risks that they
were most concerned about for doing
business in their country and to rank
these five risks from 1 (for the one of
highest concern) to 5 (for the one of
lowest concern).
This list of 19 global risks (Table C.1) in
the EOS is different from that used in

For these reasons, the results of the
GRPS and EOS are not strictly
comparable. Instead, the EOS results
provide a complementary perspective
– that of businesses on the impact of
global risks on their businesses.

the present report, although a majority
of risks on the former list do appear on
the latter, albeit slightly reformulated in
some cases. The EOS list was
established before the Global Risks
Perception Survey (GRPS)
methodology was reviewed and a
number of risks were redefined or
excluded and others were introduced.
In addition, whereas the GRPS was
agnostic about the impact of global
risks on a particular group, the EOS
question specifically asked about the
impact on the ability to do business in
the respondent’s country. Furthermore,
the EOS did not specify any time
horizon, unlike the GRPS which
considered a 10-year horizon. Finally,
the size and nature of the two samples
of respondents differed significantly: a
multistakeholder group of experts in the
case of the GRPS and business
executives in the case of the EOS.

To rank the 19 risks based on the level
of concern, each received a score
derived from the rank assigned by
respondents, from 5 for the risk the
respondent ranked first, to 1 for the risk
ranked fifth (all non-cited risks were
assigned a score of zero). As a second
step, for each economy the sum of
points obtained by each risk across all
responses from that economy was
divided by the total of points distributed
across all risks in the economy. The risk
score thus obtained was used to
establish a country-level ranking.6

Note: Only risks that are of highest concern in at least two countries are represented on the map. Other risks of highest concern: Violent interstate conflict (in Armenia),
Breakdown of critical information infrastructure and networks (Cameroon), Escalation of economic and resource nationalization (Lesotho), and Greater incidence of
environmentally-related events (Philippines).

Figure C.2 reports the results at the
global level, as well as for the two main
development status groups, advanced
economies and emerging market and
developing economies.7 Aggregate
scores correspond to the average
scores of each risk across all
economies belonging to the group of
interest.

Table C.1: The Executive Opinion Survey 2014 List of 19 Global Risks

Figure C.1 shows a snapshot of the
data on a map. Based on the results,
fiscal crises is the risk of highest
concern for doing business in 93 (65%)
of the 144 economies covered by the
survey, well ahead of oil price shock
and profound political and social
instability, both of which come first in 13
economies (9%). The map in Figure C.1
is shaded according to the risk of
highest concern. Within a troubled
geopolitical context, a fragile and
uneven recovery in advanced
economies, and a slowdown in many
emerging economies, it is not
surprising that economic risks are
those of most immediate and highest
concern to businesses.

Greater incidence of environmentally related events (weather, natural
catastrophes, man-made catastrophes)**

In advanced economies, concerns
about economic risks are even higher.
Fiscal crises is the risk of highest
concern in 30 of the 35 advanced
economies. In Austria, Germany and
Switzerland, failure of a major financial
mechanism or institution is the one of
highest concern, whereas liquidity
crises is the risk of top concern in
Portugal and Spain.

Massive incident of data fraud/theft*

Among emerging market and
developing economies, fiscal crises is
the risk of highest concern – by far –
but oil price shock comes second,
followed by liquidity crises. Prolonged
neglect of critical infrastructure ranks
fourth; a major obstacle to business
development, economic integration
and trade performance, it is the main
concern in Côte d’Ivoire, Mozambique,
Paraguay and Uganda.

Risks report’s portal at
