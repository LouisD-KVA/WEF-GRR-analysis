The World Economic Outlook (WEO) is a survey by the IMF staff published twice a
year, in the spring and fall. The WEO is prepared by the IMF staff and has benefited
from comments and suggestions by Executive Directors following their discussion of the
report on September 25, 2014. The views expressed in this publication are those of the
IMF staff and do not necessarily represent the views of the IMF’s Executive Directors
or their national authorities.

Editor’s notes:
(October 9, 2014)
In Table 4.5 on page 140, Ireland and Morocco were erroneously placed in the “Asia” grouping in the print
version; they have been moved into the “Europe” and “Africa” groupings, respectively, in the electronic versions.
The final column of Table 4.1.2 on page 147 was inadvertently omitted from the print version. A corrected
version of the table, including the final column, has been substituted in the electronic versions.
The data in Figure 3.16, panel 2, on page 98 were corrected after publication. A revised version of the figure,
including the corrected panel, has been substituted in the electronic versions.
(October 23, 2014)
The data underlying the confidence bands in panel 1 of Figure 1.11 have been corrected.
The text in the first full paragraph on page 148 has been modified to correct a typographical error (changing
“2006–13” to “2007–13” in the fifth line).

ASSUMPTIONS AND CONVENTIONS

A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook (WEO). It
has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during July 30–August 27,
2014, except for those for the currencies participating in the European exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II), which are
assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established policies of national authorities
will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for selected economies, see Box A1 in the
Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $102.76 a barrel in 2014 and $99.36 a barrel in 2015 and will
remain unchanged in real terms over the medium term; that the six-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on
U.S. dollar deposits will average 0.4 percent in 2014 and 0.7 percent in 2015; that the three-month euro deposit rate
will average 0.2 percent in 2014 and 0.1 percent in 2015; and that the six-month Japanese yen deposit rate will yield on
average 0.2 percent in 2014 and 2015. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that would in any event be involved in the projections. The estimates
and projections are based on statistical information available through September 19, 2014.
The following conventions are used throughout the WEO:
. . . to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;
– 	between years or months (for example, 2013–14 or January–June) to indicate the years or months covered, including the beginning and ending years or months;
/
between years or months (for example, 2013/14) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.
“Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
“Basis points” refer to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of 1
percentage point).
Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F in
the Statistical Appendix, which lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and
government finance data for each country.
For some countries, the figures for 2013 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns. Please
refer to Table G in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the national
accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments indicators for each country.
The WEO has adopted the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual
(BPM6). Notable changes include the following: (1) Merchanting has been reclassified from services to exports of
goods. (2) Manufacturing services on physical inputs owned by others (goods for processing in the BPM5) and
maintenance and repair services (repairs on goods in the BPM5) have been reclassified from goods to services.
(3) Migrants’ transfers have been removed from capital transfers in the capital account because a change in ownership is no longer imputed. (4) Reverse investment in direct investment has been reclassified so as to present assets
and liabilities on a gross basis. (5) A separate financial derivatives category is now included in the financial account,
whereas previously it was a subitem under portfolio investment. In addition, the conventional sign for increases in
assets (and liabilities) within the financial account is now positive, and balances are now computed as net acquisition of financial assets minus net incurrence of financial liabilities.
With the adoption of the BPM6, the Statistical Appendix tables of the WEO have also been revised. Table A13,
which previously summarized data on net and private financial flows in emerging market and developing economies, is now a Summary of Financial Account Balances. Table A14 has been deleted because of data constraints.
Table A15, Summary of Sources and Uses of World Savings, is now A14, Summary of Net Lending and Borrowing, and Table A16 has been renumbered as A15. Part B of the Statistical Appendix contains most of the same
tables as previous WEO reports. Tables B16–B21 have been absorbed into a new Table B15, Summary of Current

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

ix

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: LEGACIES, CLOUDS, UNCERTAINTIES

Account Transactions, and into A13, Summary of Financial Account Balances. As a result, the subsequent tables
have been renumbered, so that the former Tables B22 through B27 are now Tables B16 through B21.
Following the recent release of the 2011 International Comparison Program (ICP) survey for new purchasingpower-parity benchmarks, the WEO’s estimates of purchasing-power-parity weights and GDP valued at purchasing
power parity have been updated. For more detail, see “Revised Purchasing Power Parity Weights” in the July 2014
WEO Update (http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/update/02/index.htm).
As in the April 2014 WEO, data for Syria are excluded from 2011 onward because of the uncertain political
situation.
Because of the ongoing IMF program with Pakistan, the series from which the nominal exchange rate assumptions can be calculated are not made public, as the nominal exchange rate is a market-sensitive issue in Pakistan.
As in the April 2014 WEO, the consumer price projections for Argentina are excluded because of a structural
break in the data. Please refer to note 5 in Table A7 of the Statistical Appendix for further details.
Data for Latvia, which were previously excluded from the euro area aggregates because of data constraints, are
now included.
Projections for Ukraine, which were previously excluded because of the crisis, are once again included.
If no source is listed on tables and figures, data are drawn from the WEO database.
When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size.
Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding.
As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is
a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities
that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.
Composite data are provided for various groups of countries organized according to economic characteristics or
region. Unless noted otherwise, country group composites represent calculations based on 90 percent or more of
the weighted group data.
The boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on the maps do not imply, on the
part of the International Monetary Fund, any judgment on the legal status of any territory or any endorsement or
acceptance of such boundaries.

This version of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) is available in full through the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.
imf.org) and the IMF website (www.imf.org). Accompanying the publication on the IMF website is a larger compilation of data from the WEO database than is included in the report itself, including files containing the series
most frequently requested by readers. These files may be downloaded for use in a variety of software packages.
The data appearing in the World Economic Outlook are compiled by the IMF staff at the time of the WEO exercises. The historical data and projections are based on the information gathered by the IMF country desk officers
in the context of their missions to IMF member countries and through their ongoing analysis of the evolving situation in each country. Historical data are updated on a continual basis as more information becomes available, and
structural breaks in data are often adjusted to produce smooth series with the use of splicing and other techniques.
IMF staff estimates continue to serve as proxies for historical series when complete information is unavailable.
As a result, WEO data can differ from those in other sources with official data, including the IMF’s International
Financial Statistics.
The WEO data and metadata provided are “as is” and “as available,” and every effort is made to ensure, but not
guarantee, their timeliness, accuracy, and completeness. When errors are discovered, there is a concerted effort to
correct them as appropriate and feasible. Corrections and revisions made after publication are incorporated into the
electronic editions available from the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.imf.org) and on the IMF website (www.imf.org).

PREFACE

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international financial
markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product of a comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on information the IMF
staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are carried out in particular by
the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific Department, European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere Department—together with the
Strategy, Policy, and Review Department, the Monetary and Capital Markets Department, and the Fiscal Affairs
Department.
The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of Olivier
Blanchard, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti,
Deputy Director, Research Department, and Thomas Helbling, Division Chief, Research Department.

FOREWORD

T

he world economy is in the middle of a
balancing act. On the one hand, countries
must address the legacies of the global
financial crisis, ranging from debt overhangs
to high unemployment. On the other, they face a
cloudy future. Potential growth rates are being revised
downward, and these worsened prospects are in turn
affecting confidence, demand, and growth today.
The interplay of these two forces—the crisis legacies proving tougher to resolve than expected and
potential growth turning lower—has resulted in
several downward revisions to the forecast during the
past three years. The forecast in this edition of the
World Economic Outlook is, unfortunately, no exception. World growth is mediocre and a bit worse than
forecast in July. At the same time, because these two
forces operate to different degrees in various countries,
the evolution of the global economy has become more
differentiated.
Among advanced economies, the United States
and the United Kingdom in particular are leaving the
crisis behind and achieving decent growth—though
even for those two countries, potential growth is now
lower than in the early 2000s. Japan is growing, but
high public debt inherited from the past and very low
potential growth create major macroeconomic and
fiscal challenges. Growth nearly stalled earlier this
year in the euro area, even in the core. Although this
partly reflects temporary factors, the recovery has been
slowed by the crisis legacies, primarily in the south,
and by low potential growth nearly everywhere.
In emerging market economies, lower potential
growth is the dominating factor. For these economies
as a whole, potential growth is now forecast to be 1.5
percent lower than in 2011. Here again, differentiation is the rule. China is sustaining high growth, but
slightly lower growth in the future is seen to be a
healthy development. India has recovered from its relative slump; thanks in part to effective policies and a
renewal of confidence, growth is expected once again
to exceed 5 percent. In contrast, uncertain investment
prospects in Russia had already lowered growth before
the Ukraine crisis, and the crisis has made growth

prospects worse. Uncertain prospects and low investment are also weighing on growth in Brazil.
The downside risks are clear.
First, the long period of low interest rates has led to
some search for yield, and financial markets may be
too complacent about the future. These risks should
not be overplayed, but policymakers clearly must be
on the lookout. Macroprudential tools are the right
instruments to mitigate these risks; whether they are
up to the task, however, is an open question.
Second, geopolitical risks have become more
relevant. So far, the effects of the Ukraine crisis have
not spread beyond the affected countries and their
immediate neighbors. And the turmoil in the Middle
East has not had much effect on the level or volatility of energy prices. But clearly, this could change
in the future, with major implications for the world
economy.
Third, there is a risk that the recovery in the euro
area could stall, that demand could weaken further,
and that low inflation could turn into deflation.
This is not our baseline, because we believe euro area
fundamentals are slowly improving. But should such
a scenario play out, it would be the major issue confronting the world economy.
This takes me to the policy implications.
In advanced economies, policies must deal with
both the crisis legacies and low potential growth. A
major focus has been on improving bank balance
sheets, but debt overhang of firms and households
remains a serious legacy issue in a number of countries. To increase potential growth, as long as demand
remains weak, monetary accommodation and low
interest rates remain of the essence.
The weak recovery in the euro area has triggered a
new debate about the stance of fiscal policy. The low
spreads on sovereign bonds suggest that the fiscal consolidation undertaken during the past few years has
built trust among financial investors that current fiscal
paths are sustainable. This credibility, which has been
acquired at a high price, should not be threatened.
This does not imply that there is no scope to use fiscal
policy to help sustain the recovery. As we argue in

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

xiii

Chapter 3, infrastructure investment, for example,
even when financed by debt, may be justified and
can help spur demand in the short term and supply
in the medium term. And should the recovery stall,
being ready to do more would be important.
Increasing potential output, let alone potential
growth, is a tall order, and expectations should
remain realistic. In most countries, specific structural reforms can help, however. The challenge, for
both advanced and emerging market economies, is
to go beyond the general mantra of “undertaking

xiv

structural reforms” to identify both the reforms that
are most needed and the reforms that are politically feasible. Perhaps more generally, the challenge
for policymakers is to reestablish confidence by
articulating a clear plan to deal with both the legacies of the crisis and the challenges of low potential
growth.

Economic Counsellor

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Despite setbacks, an uneven global recovery continues.
Largely due to weaker-than-expected global activity in
the first half of 2014, the growth forecast for the world
economy has been revised downward to 3.3 percent for this
year, 0.4 percentage point lower than in the April 2014
World Economic Outlook (WEO). The global growth
projection for 2015 was lowered to 3.8 percent.
Downside risks have increased since the spring. Shortterm risks include a worsening of geopolitical tensions and
a reversal of recent risk spread and volatility compression
in financial markets. Medium-term risks include stagnation and low potential growth in advanced economies and
a decline in potential growth in emerging markets.
Given these increased risks, raising actual and
potential growth must remain a priority. In advanced
economies, this will require continued support from monetary policy and fiscal adjustment attuned in pace and
composition to supporting both the recovery and longterm growth. In a number of economies, an increase in
public infrastructure investment can also provide support
to demand in the short term and help boost potential
output in the medium term. In emerging markets, the
scope for macroeconomic policies to support growth if
needed varies across countries and regions, but space is
limited in countries with external vulnerabilities. And
in advanced economies as well as emerging market and
developing economies, there is a general, urgent need for
structural reforms to strengthen growth potential or make
growth more sustainable.
Despite further setbacks this year, an uneven
global recovery continues. In advanced economies,
the legacies of the precrisis boom and the subsequent
crisis (including high private and public debt) still
cast a shadow on the recovery. Emerging markets are
adjusting to rates of economic growth lower than
those reached in the precrisis boom and the postcrisis
recovery. Overall, the pace of recovery is becoming
more country specific.
Other elements are also affecting the outlook.
Financial markets have been optimistic, with high
equity prices, compressed spreads, and very low volatility. However, this has not translated into a pickup

in investment, which—particularly in advanced
economies—has remained subdued. And as discussed
in the October 2014 Global Financial Stability Report,
there are concerns that markets are underpricing risk,
not fully internalizing the uncertainties surrounding
the macroeconomic outlook and their implications for
the pace of withdrawal of monetary stimulus in some
major advanced economies. Geopolitical tensions
have risen. So far their macroeconomic effects appear
mostly confined to the regions involved, but there are
tangible risks of more widespread disruptions. Some
medium-term problems that predate the crisis, such
as the impact of an aging population on the labor
force and weak growth in total factor productivity,
are coming back to the fore and need to be tackled.
These problems show up in low potential growth in
advanced economies—which may be affecting the
pace of recovery today—and a decline in potential
growth in emerging markets. Structural reforms to
boost potential growth are needed in both.
Turning to the specifics of the outlook, global
growth in the first half of 2014 did slow more than
expected at the time of the April 2014 WEO. The
weaker-than-expected growth reflects events in the
United States, the euro area, Japan, and some large
emerging market economies. In the United States,
after a surprisingly dismal first quarter, activity picked
up in the second quarter, and the evidence suggests
that the weakness was mostly temporary. In the euro
area, growth came to a halt in the second quarter,
mainly on account of weak investment and exports,
and uncertainty about the persistence of the growth
slowdown remains. In Japan, the decline in domestic
demand following the increase in the consumption tax
was larger than expected. In Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, the weakness reflects the
impact of geopolitical tensions on foreign investment,
domestic production, and confidence. Lackluster
domestic demand in other emerging market economies has once again proven to be more persistent
than forecast—particularly in Latin America, with a
contraction of GDP in Brazil and negative surprises
to activity in several other countries. In China, after

xv

a weaker-than-expected first quarter, policy measures
supported stronger growth in the second. Overall,
weaker-than-expected growth in some emerging
markets during the first half of the year may be related
to the tightening of financial conditions during the
first quarter, but not generally to the slowdown in the
United States, given that U.S. imports have grown at a
robust pace.
The forecast envisages a rebound in growth for both
advanced economies and emerging markets in the
remainder of 2014 and in 2015, but at a rate that for
both years is below the April 2014 WEO projections.
Specifically, the global growth projection for 2014
has been marked down to 3.3 percent, 0.4 percentage
point below that in April, reflecting both the legacy
of the weak first half of the year, particularly in the
United States, and a less optimistic outlook for several
emerging markets. The projection for 2015 has been
marked down modestly to 3.8 percent. These projections of a growth rebound are predicated on the
assumption that key drivers supporting the recovery
in advanced economies identified in the April 2014
WEO remain in place, notably a moderating of fiscal
consolidation (Japan being one exception) and the
continuation of highly accommodative monetary
policy. They also assume a gradual decline in geopolitical tensions. Among advanced economies, the more
rapid recovery reflects primarily faster growth in the
United States, but also a pickup in activity in the euro
area. For emerging markets, the rebound reflects a
variety of country-specific as well as global factors. The
former include some recovery in countries affected by
geopolitical tensions and/or domestic strife in 2014, or
where growth this year has been much below potential,
and in other countries the gradual lifting of structural impediments to growth. Global factors—easy
global financial conditions and the increase in external demand from advanced economies—should also
support the pickup in emerging market growth. These
global factors are also expected to support growth in
low-income developing countries, which is projected
to exceed 6 percent in both 2014 and 2015—although
the projected easing in nonfuel commodity prices will
induce some deterioration in the terms of trade for net
exporters of commodities.
Downside risks have increased since the spring.
Increased geopolitical tensions could prove persistent,

xvi

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

hampering recovery in the countries directly involved
and taking a toll on confidence elsewhere. And a worsening of such tensions could lead to sharply higher
oil prices, asset price declines, and further economic
distress. Financial market risks include a reversal of
recent risk spread and volatility compression triggered
by a larger-than-expected increase in U.S. long-term
rates—which would also tighten financial conditions for emerging markets. Secular stagnation and
low potential growth in advanced economies remain
important medium-term risks, given the modest and
uneven growth in those economies despite very low
interest rates and the easing of other brakes to the
recovery. In some major emerging market economies,
the negative growth effects of supply-side constraints
could be more protracted.
The pace of the global recovery has disappointed in
recent years. With weaker-than-expected global growth
for the first half of 2014 and increased downside
risks, the projected pickup in growth may again fail to
materialize or fall short of expectations. This further
underscores that in most economies, raising actual
and potential growth must remain a priority. Robust
demand growth in advanced economies has not yet
emerged despite continued very low interest rates and
easing of brakes to the recovery, including from fiscal
consolidation or tight financial conditions. Avoiding
premature monetary policy normalization remains
a priority, as does fiscal adjustment attuned in pace
and composition to supporting both the recovery
and long-term growth. In this context, an increase
in public infrastructure investment, particularly for
advanced economies with clearly identified infrastructure needs and efficient public investment processes,
could provide a boost to demand in the short term
and help raise potential output in the medium term.
And structural reforms to raise potential output are
of the essence. In emerging markets, the scope for
macroeconomic policies to support growth if needed
varies across countries and regions, but space is limited
in countries with external vulnerabilities. And here as
well, there is a general, urgent need for country-specific
structural reforms to strengthen growth potential or
make growth more sustainable.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, PROSPECTS, AND POLICY PRIORITIES

Despite setbacks, an uneven global recovery continues. In advanced economies, the legacies of the precrisis boom and the subsequent crisis, including high
private and public debt, still cast a shadow on the

And there are concerns that markets are underpricing risk,

force and weak growth in total factor productivity, are coming back to the fore and need to be tackled. These problems
show up in low potential growth in advanced economies—
which may be affecting the pace of recovery today—and
a decline in potential growth in emerging markets.
With world growth in the first half of 2014 slower
than expected, global growth for 2014 is projected
at 3.3 percent, 0.4 percentage point lower relative to
the April 2014 World Economic Outlook (WEO).
The growth projection for 2015 is also slightly lower
at 3.8 percent. These projections are predicated on the
assumption that key drivers supporting the recovery
in advanced economies—including moderating fiscal
consolidation (Japan being one exception) and highly
accommodative monetary policy—remain in place.
Projections also assume a decline in geopolitical tensions,
supporting some recovery in stressed economies. Growth
prospects across both advanced economies and emerging
markets exhibit sizable heterogeneity. Among advanced
economies, growth is projected to pick up, but is slower

in the euro area and Japan and generally faster in the
United States and elsewhere. Among major emerging
markets, growth is projected to remain high in emerging
Asia, with a modest slowdown in China and a pickup
in India, but to stay subdued in Brazil and Russia.
The pace of the global recovery has disappointed in
recent years. With weaker-than-expected global growth for
the first half of 2014 and increased downside risks, the
projected pickup in growth may again fail to materialize or fall short of expectations. This further underscores
that in most economies, raising actual and potential

this will require continued support from monetary policy

vulnerabilities. And in advanced economies as well as in
emerging market and developing economies, there is a
general, urgent need for structural reforms to strengthen
growth potential or make growth more sustainable.

Recent Developments and Prospects
The Starting Point: The Global Economy in the First Half
of 2014
Growth in the first half of 2014 was less than the
levels projected in the April 2014 WEO (Figure 1.1),
reflecting a number of negative surprises.
• Weaker U.S. growth (0.8 percent at an annualized
rate), with a surprising decline in activity during the
first quarter of 2014. This weaker growth reflects
factors that appear mostly temporary, including a
harsh winter and an inventory correction, as well as
a large decline in exports after rapid growth in the
fourth quarter of 2013. Growth rebounded in the
second quarter of this year, and labor market conditions continued to improve, with robust employInternational Monetary Fund | October 2014

ment growth. Despite the slowdown, U.S. imports
were stronger than expected during the first half
of the year, suggesting that spillovers from weaker
U.S. activity through trade channels were limited.
•• Weaker activity in Russia and the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS). For the former, this
reflects a sizable decline in investment and large capital outflows following the intensification of tensions
with Ukraine. For the latter, it reflects weakness in
Ukraine and spillovers from the Russian slowdown.
•• Slower growth in Latin America—particularly in
Brazil, where investment remains weak and GDP
contracted in the first and second quarter.
•• Stagnant euro area growth, with an output contraction in Italy, no growth in France, and unexpected
weakness in Germany in the second quarter.
•• Weaker-than-forecast GDP expansion in Japan.
•• Weaker activity in China in the first quarter. In
response, the Chinese authorities have implemented
measures to buttress activity, which have supported
faster growth in the second quarter.
Inflation generally remains below central bank policy
targets in advanced economies, an indication that many
of these economies have substantial output gaps. In
the euro area, inflation has remained below expectations and declined further to 0.4 percent (year over
year) in August (Figure 1.2). In several economies with
unemployment greater than the area-wide average, mild
deflation in consumer prices continues. Inflation in the
United States has risen modestly during the past several
months but still remains below the Federal Reserve’s longer-term objective of 2 percent. In Japan, headline and
core inflation (excluding food and energy) have risen,
to about 1.3 and 0.6 percent in July (year over year),
respectively, excluding the effects of the consumption tax
increase. In emerging market economies, inflation has
remained broadly stable since the spring.
Monetary policy conditions have remained very
accommodative in advanced economies and broadly
unchanged in emerging markets since the spring (Figure 1.3). In the euro area, the European Central Bank
(ECB) has announced a range of actions to tackle
low inflation and address fragmentation, including a
reduction in policy rates, targeted credit easing, and
other measures to boost liquidity. In the United States,
although the monetary stance remains expansionary,
the reduction in the monthly volume of asset purchases
by the Federal Reserve has continued, and purchases
are expected to be wound down by the fall of this year.

(Year-over-year percent change, unless indicated otherwise)
Inﬂation has generally remained below central bank targets in advanced
economies, an indication of continued substantial economic slack. In Japan,
headline inﬂation has risen above 3 percent while core inﬂation has risen above
2 percent. But excluding the effects on the price level of the increase in the
consumption tax rate from 5 to 8 percent in the second quarter of 2014, headline
inﬂation is running at about 1¼ percent, below the Bank of Japan’s inﬂation target. In
emerging market and developing economies, inﬂation has remained broadly stable.

CHAPTER 1

In emerging markets, policy rates have been reduced
in Chile, Mexico, and Peru following disappointing
growth, and in Turkey, where part of the sharp tightening earlier in the year has been unwound. Policy rates
were raised in the first half of the year in Brazil and
Colombia; in Russia, which is facing pressure on the
ruble; and in South Africa.
Geopolitical tensions have increased since the
spring, with a worsening of the Russia-Ukraine situation and continued strife in some countries in the
Middle East. So far the impact of these tensions on
economic activity appears to have been mostly limited
to the countries involved and their closest trading
partners: financial market reaction has been muted,
and commodity prices have actually eased. However, it
is difficult to assess the implications of the worsening
of such tensions since early July.
Financial conditions have eased since the release of
the April 2014 WEO. In particular, long-term interest rates have declined in advanced economies, also
reflecting expectations of a lower neutral policy rate in
the United States over the medium term (Figure 1.4).
Equity prices have generally risen and risk premiums
have generally declined in advanced economies and
emerging markets. Volatility is very low across a wide
range of asset classes, and market concerns about
risks to stressed advanced economies and emerging
markets—as reflected, for example, in interest rate
spreads—have generally decreased (Figure 1.5). As
noted in the October 2014 Global Financial Stability
Report (GFSR), market and liquidity risks have risen,
and valuations in some asset classes (such as highyield corporate bonds) appear stretched. The easing
of financial conditions has been broad based. Capital
flows to emerging market economies have remained
robust despite generally weaker activity, and exchange
rates have stabilized or strengthened in some of these
economies.

The Forecast
Policy assumptions
Fiscal consolidation is projected to moderate in
advanced economies (Figure 1.6), a notable exception
being Japan. In emerging markets, the fiscal policy
stance is projected to remain broadly unchanged—albeit
with marked differences across countries and regions,
as discussed in the October 2014 Fiscal Monitor. On
the monetary policy front, the end of asset purchases

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, PROSPECTS, AND POLICY PRIORITIES

Economies
(Percent, unless indicated otherwise)

Markets expect the Federal Reserve to start increasing the federal funds rate by
mid-2015, with the pace of the increase broadly unchanged compared with the
April 2014 WEO. But longer-term interest rates in advanced economies have
decreased further, likely reﬂecting in part expectations of lower neutral policy
rates. The latter could explain part of the recent increase in equity prices.

Figure 1.5. Financial Market Conditions and Capital Flows in
Emerging Market Economies

Figure 1.6. Fiscal Policies

Mirroring developments in advanced economies, ﬁnancial conditions have also
eased in emerging market economies since April 2014. Equity prices have
declined, longer-term interest rate increases seen in the ﬁrst quarter of 2014 have
typically been more than fully reversed, and risk spreads have broadly declined.
Gross capital inﬂows to emerging markets have also picked up again.

Fiscal consolidation is expected to moderate in advanced economies in 2014–15,
an exception being Japan, where the consumption tax was increased and ﬁscal
stimulus will be unwound. In emerging market economies, ﬁscal policy is expected
to remain broadly unchanged.

in the United States is projected to occur in the fourth
quarter of 2014, with policy rates expected to increase
beginning in the second half of 2015 (see Figure 1.3).
Monetary policy normalization in the United Kingdom
is projected to begin in the first half of 2015. In the
euro area and Japan, very accommodative policy stances
are expected to remain in place. In emerging markets,
policy rates are generally expected to be on hold until
rate increases start in the United States (Figure 1.7).
Other assumptions
Global financial conditions are assumed to remain
accommodative, with some gradual tightening,
reflected in, among other things, rising 10-year yields
on U.S. Treasury bonds as the expected date for liftoff
from the zero bound in the United States approaches.
The process of normalizing monetary policy in the
United States and the United Kingdom is assumed
to proceed smoothly, without large and protracted
increases in financial market volatility and sharp
movements in long-term interest rates. Commodity
prices are projected to ease moderately amid a stillhesitant recovery and new supply coming on stream
(for example, light tight oil in the United States).
Geopolitical tensions and domestic strife are assumed
to ease gradually over 2015–16, allowing for a gradual
recovery in the most severely affected economies.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, PROSPECTS, AND POLICY PRIORITIES

Figure 1.7. Monetary Policies and Credit in Emerging Market
Economies
Monetary conditions have tightened in many emerging market economies, as
central banks have responded with policy rate increases to the tighter external
ﬁnancial conditions faced by these economies since the taper talks of May 2013.
Nevertheless, real policy rates remain negative or well below precrisis averages in
many emerging market economies. Bank credit growth has continued to slow in
emerging market economies, although it remains at double-digit rates in some.
Economy-wide leverage, as measured by the ratio of bank credit to GDP, has
therefore continued to increase.

with the July 2014 WEO Update, the IMF’s global and

Comparison Program purchasing-power-parity weights and therefore

of comparison with the current WEO, global and regional growth
rates reported in the April 2014 WEO have therefore been recalculated using the revised purchasing-power-parity weights.

Global outlook
Global growth, computed using the new 2011

rate of about 3.7 percent in the second half of 2014
and slightly higher in 2015, around 1 percentage point
faster than in the first half of 2014. The increase in
growth will be driven by a rebound in both advanced
economies, with the United States playing the most
important role, and emerging markets. Growth in
most emerging market and developing economies is
projected to be supported by the waning of temporary
setbacks to domestic demand and production (including from geopolitical tensions and domestic strife),
policy support to demand, and the gradual lifting of

structural impediments to growth, as well as strengthening external demand from advanced economies.

Global growth is projected to rebound to an annual rate of about 3.7 percent in the
second half of 2014 and into 2015. The strongest rebound in growth is expected in
the United States, whereas the crisis legacy brakes will ease only slowly in the
euro area, and growth in Japan will remain modest. Growth in most emerging
market and developing economies is projected to be supported by the waning of
temporary setbacks to domestic demand and production (including from
geopolitical tensions); policy support to demand; the gradual lifting of structural
impediments to growth; and strengthening external demand from advanced
economies.

The outlook for 2014 is marginally weaker than
in the July 2014 WEO Update, with an upward
revision for growth in the United States (Table 1.1,
Figure 1.8) offset by some downward revisions for
emerging markets, particularly in Latin America
and the Middle East, as well as for the euro area
and Japan. Relative to the April 2014 WEO, global
growth for 2014 has been revised downward by
some 0.4 percentage point, primarily on account
of a weaker-than-expected first half of 2014, and is
slightly lower for 2015. Growth forecast comparisons
in the remainder of this WEO report are made with
respect to those in the April 2014 WEO, adjusted
to reflect the new purchasing-power-parity weights
where needed.
Outlook for advanced economies
Growth is expected to strengthen in 2014–15 across
most advanced economies, but the pace of recovery
remains different across regions. The strongest rebound
in growth is expected in the United States, whereas the
crisis legacy brakes will ease only slowly in the euro
area, and growth in Japan will remain modest. Growth
elsewhere, including in other Asian advanced economies, Canada, and the United Kingdom, is projected
to be solid.
•• In the United States, conditions remain in place for a
stronger pickup in the recovery: an accommodative
monetary policy stance and favorable financial conditions, much-reduced fiscal drag (with a cumulative
change in the primary structural balance of some
1¼ percent in 2014–15, compared with 1½ percent
in 2013), strengthened household balance sheets,
and a healthier housing market. As a result, growth
is projected to average about 3 percent in the second
half of 2014 into 2015. Asset purchases by the Federal Reserve are projected to end in October 2014,
with a liftoff from the zero bound in mid-2015.
Employment growth is projected to be strong, but
some recovery of the labor market participation rate
will slow the decline in the unemployment rate. The
legacy of the very weak first quarter of 2014 implies
a downward revision of 0.6 percentage point to
the 2014 growth forecast relative to the April 2014
WEO, whereas the forecast for 2015 is roughly
unchanged.

CHAPTER 1

•• In the euro area, a weak recovery is projected to
gradually take hold, supported by a reduction in
fiscal drag, accommodative monetary policy, and
improving lending conditions, with a sharp compression in spreads for stressed economies and
record-low long-term interest rates in core countries. Growth is projected to average 0.8 percent
in 2014 and 1.3 percent in 2015, weaker than the
April 2014 WEO projections. Prospects are uneven
across countries—not just between the economies
most severely affected by the crisis and the rest,
but also within those groups. Among the former,
growth in Spain has resumed, supported by external
demand as well as higher domestic demand reflecting improved financial conditions and rising confidence. Growth is now projected to average 1.3 and
1.7 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively, revised
upward from about 1 percent in the April 2014
WEO. The Italian economy, in contrast, contracted in the first half of 2014, and on an annual
basis is not expected to return to positive growth
until 2015. Among the core economies, growth projections for the German economy have been revised
downward relative to the April 2014 WEO, primarily reflecting a weaker recovery in domestic demand.
Growth in France stalled in the first half of 2014,
and projections have been revised downward.
•• In Japan, the pattern of growth in the first half
of the year was affected by the April consumption tax hike, which boosted activity in the first
quarter at the expense of the second. In light of
the larger-than-expected contraction in the second
quarter, GDP is now projected to increase 0.9 percent in 2014—0.5 percentage point less than the
April 2014 WEO projections. With private investment expected to recover, growth is projected to
remain broadly stable in 2015, notwithstanding the
planned fiscal adjustment.
•• In most other advanced economies, including
Canada, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, growth is expected to be solid. In the United
Kingdom, activity has rebounded and become more
balanced, driven by both consumption and business investment, thanks to improving credit and
financial market conditions and healthy corporate
balance sheets. Growth is projected to average
3.2 percent in 2014 and 2.7 percent in 2015, about
¼ percentage point stronger than forecast in the
April 2014 WEO. House prices are increasing at
a strong pace, especially in London, and have also

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, PROSPECTS, AND POLICY PRIORITIES

been buoyant in other advanced economies, including Canada, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland (see
Box 1.1).
Outlook for emerging market and developing
economies
Growth in emerging market and developing economies is projected to increase modestly in the second
half of 2014 and into 2015, supported by stronger
domestic demand as well as a recovery in external
demand associated with faster growth in advanced
economies. As in past years, emerging market and
developing economies will continue to account for
the lion’s share of global growth—even at market
exchange rates. Still, the forecast is some 0.3 percentage point weaker in both 2014 and 2015 relative to
the April 2014 WEO forecast, reflecting both a weaker
first-half outturn for 2014 and an assessment that
some of the setbacks appear related to structural factors
and are hence likely to be more lasting. Indeed, the
outlook for emerging markets has been marked down
for the past several WEO reports, reflecting a changing assessment of the sustainability of the growth rates
achieved before the crisis and during the 2010–11
rebound (Box 1.2).
•• In China, growth projections have been marked
down slightly for both 2014 and 2015 relative to
those in the April 2014 WEO. After a weakerthan-expected first-quarter outturn, the authorities
deployed policy measures to support activity, including tax relief for small and medium enterprises,
accelerated fiscal and infrastructure spending, and
targeted cuts in required reserve ratios. Growth
gained traction in the second quarter on these measures, as well as on stronger exports, and is projected
to average 7.4 percent in 2014, in line with the
authorities’ target. For 2015, growth is projected to
moderate to 7.1 percent as the economy makes the
transition to a more sustainable path and residential
investment slows further.
•• In India, growth is expected to increase in the
rest of 2014 and 2015, as exports and investment
continue to pick up and more than offset the effect
of an unfavorable monsoon on agricultural growth
earlier in the year. The outlook is slightly stronger
for 2014 relative to that in the April 2014 WEO,
and unchanged for 2015. Growth in the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations–5 (ASEAN-5) is projected at 4.7 percent in 2014, rising to 5.4 percent
in 2015. Relative to that in the April 2014 WEO,
International Monetary Fund | October 2014

9

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: LEGACIES, CLOUDS, UNCERTAINTIES

the forecast is slightly weaker for 2014—driven by
a sharp slowdown in Thailand amid political tensions earlier in the year—and unchanged for 2015.
Elsewhere in emerging and developing Asia, growth is
likely to remain strong, helped in part by favorable
financial conditions and broadly accommodative
policies.
•• Growth for Latin America and the Caribbean is
now projected to fall to 1.3 percent in 2014, with
a rebound to some 2.2 percent in 2015. Projections
have been marked down by more than 1 percentage
point for 2014 and 0.8 percentage point for 2015,
reflecting external factors, given weaker-thanexpected export performance amid deteriorating
terms of trade, as well as a variety of idiosyncratic
domestic constraints. In Brazil, GDP contracted in
the first half of the year, reflecting weak investment
and a moderation in consumption, given tighter
financial conditions and continued weakness in
business and consumer confidence. These factors,
along with weakness in competitiveness, are projected to keep growth subdued in much of 2014–
15. In Mexico, weaker-than-expected growth in early
2014, on account of weak external demand and
construction activity, lowered projections for this
year relative to the April 2014 WEO forecast, but
growth is projected to pick up in 2015 and beyond,
as the effects of structural reforms begin to come
into play and U.S. growth strengthens. Elsewhere
in the region, downward growth revisions reflect
weaker domestic demand (Chile and Peru); deepening macroeconomic and policy imbalances that are
manifesting themselves as high inflation, negative
growth, and a rising differential between the parallel
and official exchange rates in Argentina; and severe
policy distortions that have led to widespread shortages, a collapse in growth, and inflation now exceeding 60 percent in Venezuela.
•• The forecast for the Commonwealth of Independent
States has significantly weakened, reflecting a sharp
deterioration in economic conditions in the first
half of the year, which is expected to persist for
some time. In Russia, investment remains weak
amid subdued confidence, which is further affected
by geopolitical tensions and sanctions. Activity is
not projected to pick up before 2015. Continued
declines in industrial production and exports will
cause a sharp contraction in activity in Ukraine
in 2014, with conditions improving slowly next

10

year. Growth in the rest of the CIS has already
slowed, with weaker trade and remittance flows
from Russia, and is projected to be lower in 2014–
15 relative to the April 2014 WEO projections.
•• Growth in emerging and developing Europe is projected to remain close to 3 percent in 2014–15, with
an upward revision in projections by 0.4 percentage point for 2014. This revision primarily reflects
strengthening private consumption in Hungary and
robust domestic demand in Poland.
•• With increased strife in some countries in the
region, the projected pickup in growth in 2014
in the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and
Pakistan region is now projected to be weaker relative to the April 2014 WEO forecast. Growth is
expected to increase in 2015, assuming that security
improves, allowing for a recovery in oil production,
particularly in Libya. Economic activity in the oil
importers is projected to improve only gradually as
they continue to deal with difficult sociopolitical
transitions, subdued confidence, and setbacks from
regional conflicts.
•• In sub-Saharan Africa, growth is projected to remain
strong, broadly in line with the April 2014 WEO
projections over the 2014–15 period, although prospects vary across countries. In South Africa, 2014
growth is being dragged down by industrial tensions
and delays in fixing infrastructure gaps, including electricity constraints. A muted recovery is
expected in 2015. In contrast, in Nigeria, activity
has been resilient despite poor security conditions
and a decline in oil production earlier this year.
In a few countries, including Ghana and, until
recently, Zambia, large macroeconomic imbalances
have resulted in pressures on the exchange rate and
inflation. Beyond the human toll it is exacting, the
Ebola outbreak is set to have an acute impact on
the economies of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone,
as discussed in Chapter 2. Should the outbreak
continue to intensify and spread significantly to
neighboring countries, it could have more far-reaching consequences.
•• These projections imply a robust outlook for lowincome developing countries, with growth projected
to exceed 6 percent in both 2014 and 2015. Stronger growth in advanced economies will buoy lowincome developing countries’ net external demand,
although the projected easing in nonfuel commodity
prices will induce some deterioration in the terms of

CHAPTER 1

Inflation remains too low in advanced economies,
an indication that many of these economies have
substantial output gaps, and deflation continues to be
a concern. In the United States, inflation measured
with the personal consumption expenditure deflator is
forecast to be 1.6 percent at the end of 2014 and to
rise gradually toward the Federal Reserve’s longer-term
objective of 2 percent. In the euro area, inflation is
projected to increase gradually as the recovery strengthens and output gaps slowly decrease, to 0.9 percent on
an annual basis in 2015 and 1.2 percent in 2016. But
price pressures are expected to remain very subdued
under the current baseline projections, because persistent output gaps, weak credit conditions, and financial
fragmentation—especially in stressed economies—will
combine to contain prices. As a result, euro-area-wide
inflation rates are expected to remain substantially
below the ECB’s price stability objective through at
least 2019 with current policies, suggesting that the
risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored has
increased. In Japan, headline inflation is projected to
rise to an annual average rate of 2.7 percent in 2014.
This rise reflects the consumption tax increase, but
underlying inflation is rising as well, at 1.1 percent this
year. Inflation is projected to increase gradually toward
the 2 percent target in the medium term as the output
gap closes and inflation expectations rise. In emerging
market and developing economies, inflation is projected to decline in 2014, in line with the April 2014
WEO projections, and to remain broadly unchanged
in 2015. The recent decline reflects to an important
extent the softening of commodity prices—particularly those for food commodities, which have a high
weight in the consumer price index baskets for these
countries.
External sector and outlook for rebalancing
Global trade volume growth slowed markedly in
the first half of 2014 compared with global activity (Figure 1.9, panel 1). Expectations that with a
strengthening recovery, global trade would once again
grow faster than GDP, based on developments in the
second half of 2013, have not materialized (Figure 1.9,
panel 2). Some of the slowdown in trade growth could

Global trade growth slowed again in the ﬁrst half of 2014, consistent with weaker
global growth during this period. But world trade has lacked its traditional strong
momentum since the deceleration in global activity in 2011. Global current account
imbalances have narrowed substantially since the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008
and are projected to narrow further. Among the larger economies, the projected
change in current account balances in the near term is consistent with a further
narrowing of excess surpluses and deﬁcits (as measured by the current account
gaps in 2013 identiﬁed in the IMF’s 2014 Pilot External Sector Report).

Figure 1.10. Exchange Rates and Reserves
Currencies of major emerging market economies have depreciated against the
U.S. dollar in 2014, reﬂecting ﬁnancial market turmoil early in the year and
relatively weaker medium-term prospects compared with advanced economies.
More broadly, exchange rate movements during the past year have generally been
consistent with further corrections in currency over- and undervaluation (as
measured by the REER gaps identiﬁed in the IMF’s 2014 Pilot External Sector
Report). The pace of reserve accumulation has slowed in Latin America and
emerging and developing Europe, reﬂecting lower capital inﬂows and reserve
losses from foreign exchange interventions. It has remained strong in the Middle
East, reﬂecting still-high oil prices, and has accelerated recently in emerging and
developing Asia.

reflect a more modest pace in the fragmentation of
global production processes (value chains) after years
of rapid change. Indeed, much of the recent slowing
in trade growth relative to GDP is an emerging market
phenomenon. And some of this slowdown could be
cyclical, reflecting declining world growth since 2011.
Indeed, in the early stages of the global recovery
in 2009–10, global trade had picked up strongly,
broadly in line with patterns in earlier periods of
increasing global growth. Global trade is projected to
pick up ahead of GDP as the global recovery strengthens, but the difference between trade and GDP growth
is projected to remain below recent precrisis averages.
Global current account imbalances narrowed in 2013
and are projected to contract further, albeit modestly,
in 2014 and beyond (Figure 1.9, panel 3). The contraction in 2014 is projected to come from a reduction in
deficit and surplus positions within Europe, as well as
from some contraction in surpluses in oil exporters. At
the same time, as discussed in Chapter 4, legacy effects
from the period of global imbalances and the global
financial crisis persist, with countries that ran large
current account deficits before the crisis still facing high
gross and net external liabilities. Although many of
these countries have achieved large current account corrections, weak or negative GDP growth and subdued
inflation have prevented a systematic improvement
in their net external positions. And the low projected
growth rates for nominal and real GDP imply a very
gradual improvement in debtor countries’ net external
positions going forward, even though current account
balances in several cases are projected to remain in
surplus.
The projected narrowing of global current account
imbalances is generally consistent with a reduction
in “excessive” imbalances, and exchange rate changes
during the past year have been providing some support to the adjustment. As discussed in the 2014 Pilot
External Sector Report (IMF 2014a), external imbalances in 2013, although declining, remained almost
twice as large as would be consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies. Figure 1.9 (panel 4) shows
that projected changes in current account balances
for 2014 relative to 2013 would go in the direction of
narrowing the current account gaps for 2013 discussed
in the 2014 Pilot External Sector Report. These gaps
measure deviations of current account balances from
a level consistent with underlying fundamentals and
desirable policies. And panel 1 of Figure 1.10 compares the 2013 currency assessments in the 2014 Pilot

CHAPTER 1

External Sector Report—which are based on average real
effective exchange rates for that year—with subsequent
changes in real effective exchange rates. Undervalued currencies (those with a negative real effective
exchange rate gap in 2013) have generally appreciated
and overvalued currencies depreciated, consistent with
rebalancing.

Risks
Downside risks have increased compared with the
spring. The main reason is the increase in geopolitical
risks, including turmoil in the Middle East and international tensions surrounding the situation in Russia
and Ukraine. Also, with the baseline now reflecting
increased financial market optimism—risk spreads and
major implied volatility indicators are close to precrisis
expansion lows, equity prices have continued to rise,
and longer-term yields have declined—downside risks
from a financial market correction have increased.
As for the other risks discussed in the April 2014
WEO, those from unexpected bumps originating
from monetary policy normalization in the United States
remain. Inflation in the euro area has declined further,
and inflation expectations have drifted downward,
indicating that risks of outright deflation or a protracted period of very low inflation also remain. From a
medium-term perspective, low potential output growth
and “secular stagnation” are still important risks in
advanced economies, given that robust demand growth
has not yet emerged. In particular, despite continued
very low interest rates and increased risk appetite in
financial markets, a pickup in investment has not yet
materialized, possibly reflecting concerns about low
medium-term potential growth and subdued private
consumption (in a context of weak growth in median
incomes). For emerging markets, despite downward
revisions to forecasts, the risk remains that the projected increase in growth next year will fail to materialize (at least in full) and that potential growth is lower
than currently projected. And risks of a hard landing in
China in the medium term owing to excess capacity
and the credit overhang remain a concern, given that
investment and credit continue to be the main drivers
of growth.

Global GDP Forecast
The fan chart for the global real GDP forecast
through 2015 suggests a broadly unchanged uncer-

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, PROSPECTS, AND POLICY PRIORITIES

tainty band around the WEO projections relative to
six months ago (Figure 1.11, panel 1). The probability
of global growth falling below the 2 percent recession
threshold in 2015 is less than 1 percent, which is appreciably lower for the next-year forecasts compared with
values in October 2012 and October 2013. In regard
to the components underlying uncertainty around the
forecasts, downside risks to global growth due to oil
prices have increased compared with the April 2014
WEO, and notably so for 2015. Downside risks related
to an equity price correction in 2014 have also risen,
consistent with the notion that some valuations could be
frothy. In addition, prospects of rising U.S. term spreads
in 2015 due to higher long-term rates are consistent
with upside risks to global growth, based on the past
predictive performance of term spreads.
Simulations using the IMF staff’s Global Projection
Model suggest an increase in recession risks (as measured by the probability of two consecutive quarters of
negative growth in the four quarters ahead), particularly in the euro area and the Rest of the World group
(Figure 1.12, panel 1). This increase partly reflects a
lower starting point for growth compared to the April
2014 WEO. The results of these simulations underscore that a number of fragilities remain present in the
global recovery.

Immediate and Short-Term Risks
Risks to the fragile global recovery come from several sources: increased geopolitical tensions and their
repercussions for commodity markets and real activity,
shocks originating in financial markets, and macroeconomic disappointments in systemically important
countries or regions. In all these cases, global trade and
financial market interconnectedness can act to transmit
and amplify shocks, with large cross-border spillovers.
With regard to geopolitical risks, the baseline incorporates a recession in Ukraine and stagnant output in
Russia in 2014, with adverse spillovers to the CIS and,
to a lesser extent, other trading partners. These effects
are assumed to gradually wane in 2015 and thereafter.
Larger global spillovers could result from further unrest
triggering disruptions in the production or transportation of natural gas or crude oil, higher risk aversion
in financial markets, a negative impact on confidence
and business investment in trading partners caused by
greater uncertainty, and disruption to trade and finance
resulting from an escalation of sanctions and countersanctions. An additional important source of geopolitical

The fan chart, which indicates the degree of uncertainty about the global growth
outlook, has remained broadly unchanged from that in the April 2014 WEO. Lower
baseline uncertainty (given that there is more information about 2014 available
now) should, in principle, have lowered the uncertainty band for 2014, all else
equal; that it has not is suggestive of somewhat higher downside risks in the near
term. Financial-market-based measures of volatility and measures of forecast
dispersion suggest broadly unchanged uncertainty.

The IMF staff’s Global Projection Model suggests that one-year-ahead recession
risks have increased compared with the April 2014 WEO in the euro area, Japan,
Latin America, and the Rest of the World group. The increase is largely due to
lower growth starting points, which imply that a smaller negative shock is more
likely to trigger a recession, everything else equal. Deﬂation risks have increased
for the euro area compared with the April 2014 WEO, again mostly on account of
an even lower starting point for inﬂation given that euro area inﬂation declined to
about ½ percent in the second quarter of 2014.

risks is related to developments in the Middle East. The
baseline incorporates severe negative effects of current
strife on economic activity in 2014 for some countries
in the region, particularly Iraq and Libya, which are
assumed to unwind in 2015 and thereafter. Increased
strife in the region could trigger disruptions to oil
production and a sharp rise in oil prices. The potential
global implications of such a turn of events, and possible
amplification mechanisms through financial markets, are
explored in “Risk Scenarios: Oil Price Spike.”
With low interest rates and increased risk appetite in
financial markets, equity prices have increased, spreads
have compressed, and volatility has declined to very
low levels. There are valid reasons for some financial
market optimism: tail risks have decreased during the
past two years, balance sheet repair has progressed, and
central bank communication has been effective, all in
a context in which low long-term interest rates would
naturally boost asset prices. However, the increased
risk appetite in financial markets has not translated
into a pickup in investment, which—particularly in
advanced economies—has remained subdued. And
as discussed further in this chapter and in the October 2014 GFSR, there is a concern that markets are
underpricing risk, not fully internalizing the uncertainties surrounding the macroeconomic outlook and their
implications for the pace of withdrawal of monetary
stimulus in some major advanced economies.
More specifically, financial markets can amplify risks
associated with faster-than-expected increases in U.S. interest rates. As discussed in the 2014 Spillover Report
(IMF 2014b), previous WEO reports, and the Spillover
Feature in Chapter 2, the nature of these risks and those
of global spillovers will depend on the factors triggering
the increases. Faster U.S. growth would raise external
demand for partner countries and also contribute to
higher confidence in a global recovery; on balance this
would be a positive for the rest of the world, despite
the tightening of global financial conditions. But risks
remain of an increase in U.S. interest rates triggered by
other factors, which could have more disruptive spillover
effects. These factors could include an increase in the
term premium on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds resulting from a portfolio shift or expectations of more rapid
monetary policy tightening caused by a downward reassessment of the amount of slack in the U.S. economy.
The increase in the term premium could in turn cause
an increase in risk premiums and volatility in global
financial markets and trigger a reversal of capital flows,

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, PROSPECTS, AND POLICY PRIORITIES

particularly from vulnerable emerging markets. As noted
in the October 2014 GFSR, some U.S. markets, such as
those for credit and high-yield bonds, appear particularly susceptible to negative effects from faster-thanexpected monetary policy normalization.
Growth disappointments, geopolitical events, or
other triggers can also set off a sudden reversal of risk
premiums and volatility compression in global financial
markets. An increase in global risk aversion can trigger
safe haven flows and thus be associated with a decline
in U.S. long-term interest rates (in contrast to the
scenarios described in the previous paragraph) but still
imply a significant tightening of financial conditions,
capital flow reversals, and exchange rate pressures in
emerging markets, as well as negative effects on equity
prices. The October 2014 GFSR develops a scenario
in which a rapid market adjustment causes term bond
market and credit risk premiums to revert to historical norms. An adverse feedback loop between outflows
and asset performance in the asset management sector
could exacerbate the move from low to high volatility,
with negative implications for many credit and emerging market assets. Such a shock could cause large losses
in global bond portfolios, which could precipitate
rapid portfolio adjustments and significant market turmoil, with potentially global implications for financial
and macroeconomic stability.
In some advanced economies, protracted low inflation
or outright deflation poses risks to activity—particularly
where the legacies of the crisis include high public or
private debt or both. Current inflation remains below
target—and close to zero in some cases—in many
advanced economies and is projected to increase only
slowly. The risk is that a protracted “undershooting” of
the inflation target would cause a decline in longerterm inflation expectations. With monetary policy
rates in many cases close to or at the zero bound, the
room to lower rates is limited. Higher real rates would
hamper the recovery, including by exacerbating debt
overhang problems.2 In most economies, the risk of
deflation by the end of 2014 is negligible, according to
the Global Projection Model simulations, but the risk
of inflation remaining persistently below central bank
targets remains high. The risk of outright deflation
remains a concern for the euro area, where inflation has declined further in recent months, and to a

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: LEGACIES, CLOUDS, UNCERTAINTIES

Risk scenarios: Oil price spike
Geopolitical risks are again a key concern in regard to
oil prices. In the case of Iraq, an escalation in the internal
conflict could lead to disruptions in the country’s (as well as
global) oil production. This possibility could lead to adverse
global spillovers to other economies through higher oil
prices, lower risk appetite in global financial markets, and
lower confidence more broadly. This analysis considers
these two spillover mechanisms in two scenarios. In both,
the oil price is assumed to spike by some 20 percent
on average in the first year in response to unexpected
global oil supply disruptions caused by temporarily lower
production in Iraq (Figure 1.13). Oil prices return to baseline
after three years.
In the first scenario, only oil prices spike. As a result,
real incomes decline because higher production costs
lower profits in net oil importers, where domestic demand
falls sharply. Domestic demand in oil exporters increases
with the terms-of-trade gains, but not enough to offset
the negative impact on oil importers. As a result, world
GDP declines by about ½ percent in the year the shock
materializes. The magnitudes of the output declines across
regions depend on the share of oil imports in costs and
household spending, as well as on constraints on monetary
policy responses (blue bars in Figure 1.13, panel 5). Japan
is most affected on both accounts—its economy is at the
zero lower bound—and the effects on net oil importers
among emerging markets are large because of their
relatively higher oil dependency.
In the second scenario, the oil price spike is also
assumed to lower confidence among consumers, firms,
and investors. The assumption is that in the year the shock
hits, equity prices decline in advanced economies by 3
percent, on average, and in emerging market economies
by 7 percent. Subsequently, as in the first scenario, world
equity prices fall further on lower profits and growth in net
oil importers. As oil prices start falling, risk appetite and
confidence begin normalizing. Still, the adverse effects
on domestic demand and output in net oil importers are
in almost all cases more than twice as high as under the
first scenario (red bars in Figure 1.13, panel 5), reflecting
additional negative wealth effects and higher costs of
capital in these economies. World GDP declines by about
1½ percent.

Figure 1.13. Iraq Oil Shock

(Percent deviation from the WEO baseline, unless indicated
otherwise)
The IMF’s G20 Model (G20MOD) is used here to explore the
macroeconomic impact of a potential signiﬁcant global oil supply
disruption due to conﬂict escalation in Iraq. In the ﬁrst scenario (blue
lines and bars), the rise in oil prices is the only drag on the global
economy, whereas in the second (red lines and bars), the disruption
also undermines conﬁdence. Iraq’s oil exports drop by 50 percent
from the current level (roughly 1½ percent of current global oil
consumption), with only half of the decline offset by higher oil
production from current spare capacity. This leads to an oil price
spike of 20 percent, partly on account of sharply higher precautionary demand for oil inventories. The oil price starts falling after the
ﬁrst year, but only gradually, largely because the supply disruption is
assumed to take longer to unwind than expected initially.

lesser extent for Japan (given that underlying inflation
remains well below the 2 percent target). In the euro
area, the risk of deflation—as measured by the probability of two consecutive quarters of negative inflation
within a four-quarter forecast window—is estimated
to be about 30 percent (Figure 1.12, panel 2). Similarly, broad indicators of deflation vulnerability, which
measure the risk of more persistent price-level declines,
remain above the high-risk threshold for some euro
area economies, reflecting even lower-than-expected
inflation in recent months (Figure 1.12, panel 3).
There are also near-term growth risks in China. These
risks are mainly associated with the likelihood of a
more severe real estate market correction than envisaged in the baseline. Real estate investment has been
an important engine of growth in China, and it will be
challenging to allow the imbalances in the market—
including signs of overvaluation in large cities and
oversupply in many smaller cities—to correct while
preventing an excessively sharp slowdown. Financial
sector links would amplify the impact of this correction, given the direct exposure of banks and shadow
banks to real estate through credit to developers and
household mortgages, and also indirectly, through the
use of real estate as collateral for other loans. Furthermore, local government spending relies on the real
estate sector directly, through land sales revenue, and
indirectly, through the tax revenue generated by the
sector. Although policy action—for example, through
additional infrastructure investment—could help mitigate the immediate impact of the shock, such action
would complicate the challenge of rebalancing demand
away from investment toward consumption.

Medium-Term Risks
The pattern of downward revisions to growth forecasts documented in Box 1.2 and the repeated markdowns of estimates of medium-term potential growth
highlight the uncertainties surrounding the resilience
of the global economy in the medium term. Accordingly, this WEO report focuses on risks that demand
and potential growth might fall short of expectations, a
theme also developed in previous reports.3
Low potential growth in advanced economies:
Increasing evidence suggests that potential growth in

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, PROSPECTS, AND POLICY PRIORITIES

advanced economies had started to decline before the
crisis, and total factor productivity has been increasing
at modest rates across all major advanced economies.4
And the impact of a more modest rate of growth in
total factor productivity would be compounded by
slower growth or an outright decline in labor input
in light of population aging. In addition to these
longer-term trends, a protracted period of weak
growth and large negative output gaps could erode
the growth potential of stagnating economies. The
channels through which this erosion would operate
include lower investment, including in research and
development, affecting the capital stock and total factor productivity, as well as erosion of skills and lower
labor supply as a result of hysteresis in unemployment.
Low actual and potential growth would also further
complicate the challenge of reducing high public and
private debt.
Secular stagnation in advanced economies: In addition to the implications of weaker potential growth,
the major advanced economies, especially the euro
area and Japan, could face an extended period of low
growth reflecting persistently weak private demand that
could turn into stagnation. In such a situation, some
affected economies would not be able to generate the
demand needed to restore full employment through
regular self-correcting forces. The equilibrium real
interest rate on safe assets consistent with full employment might be too low to be achieved with the zero
lower bound on nominal interest rates. As discussed in
Chapter 3 of the April 2014 WEO, real interest rates
on safe assets are likely to rise under the WEO baseline
but remain below the average value of about 2 percent
recorded in the mid-2000s before the crisis. However,
the further declines in nominal and real interest rates
on long-term “safe” government bonds during the past
few months—despite expectations of a strengthening
recovery—underscore the fact that stagnation risks
cannot be taken lightly. The risk scenario discussed
below illustrates how stagnation in advanced economies could itself amplify declines in potential growth,
generating protracted negative effects on GDP for the
world economy as a whole.
Lower potential growth in emerging market economies: As discussed in Box 1.2 and in Chapter 3 of
the 2014 Spillover Report (IMF 2014b), growth
forecasts for emerging markets have been reduced

Risk scenario: Secular stagnation and low potential output in advanced economies
appetite for real risks, and debt overhang after the crisis. In
turn, the decline in growth resulting from weaker domestic
demand is assumed to reduce advanced economies’
potential output. Specifically, lower investment results in
reduced productivity growth. Higher unemployment leads to
skill depreciation in the labor force and a higher natural rate
of unemployment. The size of the labor force also declines,
because discouraged workers exit the labor market.
These (relatively small) demand shortfalls in advanced
economies, together with the erosion of potential output,

Secular stagnation in advanced economies remains a
concern. Robust demand momentum has not yet emerged
despite continued very low interest rates and easing of
brakes to the recovery, including from fiscal consolidation
or tight financial conditions. The following scenario explores
the global economic implications of protracted demand
weakness in advanced economies, reflecting a sequence of
unexpected negative shocks to private investment and higher
private saving in the major economies. These developments
could be triggered by continued low confidence, limited

Figure 1.14. Secular Stagnation
(Percent, unless indicated otherwise)

The IMF’s G20 Model (G20MOD) is used here to explore a plausible
alternative baseline with secular stagnation in advanced economies.
The sources of stagnation are lower-than-expected private investment
and higher-than-expected private saving, which lead to weaker
domestic demand in advanced economies. Investment growth slows
by just under 0.5 percentage point a year in the euro area and Japan;
it slows by more than 1 percentage point a year in the United States
and other advanced economies. Private saving as a share of GDP rises
by about 0.2 percentage point a year in advanced economies. Weaker
demand conditions in turn have negative spillovers to these
economies’ potential output. Given capital-embodied technology, lower
investment results in slowing productivity growth. In addition, higher
unemployment results in skill erosion that raises the natural rate of
WEO baseline

unemployment, and the labor force decreases as discouraged
workers withdraw from the labor force. Overall, the labor supply
decreases by roughly 0.1 percent a year in advanced economies.
As a result, growth in advanced economies is roughly 0.5 percentage
point below the WEO baseline, while inﬂation is about 0.8 percentage
point lower after ﬁve years. Slower advanced economy growth has
signiﬁcant spillovers to emerging market economies, both directly,
through lower external demand, and indirectly, because equity
markets in emerging market economies are assumed to reﬂect some
of the weakness in advanced economy equity markets. Global growth
is roughly 0.4 percentage point below the WEO baseline.

CHAPTER 1

Risk scenario: Secular stagnation and low
potential output in advanced economies
(continued)
could lead to sustained global economic weakness over
a five-year period (Figure 1.14). Specifically, in advanced
economies, investment growth is between 0.8 and
1 percentage point lower than under the baseline,
whereas private saving ratios are 0.5 percentage point
higher. On average, growth in advanced economies is
roughly 0.4 percentage point lower and inflation about
0.8 percentage point lower after five years. Despite the
fall in potential output, output gaps still widen initially
with lower growth. And subsequently, these gaps narrow
only slowly. Because demand weakness is unexpected,
monetary policy in advanced economies ends up being
too tight in hindsight, with real interest rates not falling
enough. Relative to the baseline, the normalization of
advanced economy interest rates is more gradual, and
the global real interest rate declines.
The lower growth in advanced economies has
significant spillovers to emerging market economies, both
directly, through lower external demand, and indirectly,
through negative productivity spillovers. Equity markets
in emerging market economies thus reflect some of the
weakness in advanced economy equity markets. Relative
to the WEO baseline, emerging market growth is about
0.2 percentage point lower on average and global growth
roughly 0.3 percentage point lower, with oil prices falling
by roughly 10 percent over five years.

repeatedly in WEO reports since 2010—including
in this one. At the same time, current forecasts still
envisage a meaningful and durable pickup in growth
in emerging ­markets in 2015. There is a risk that
such a rebound may fail to materialize, reflecting lack
of action on structural constraints leading to lower
potential growth, a tightening of global financial conditions, a slow pace of recovery in advanced economies, or any combination of these factors. Structural
constraints, as well as the external factors mentioned
previously, may also hamper the pace of growth in
low-income countries, which so far have been performing very well.
Hard landing in China: In addition to the general
risk of actual and potential growth falling short of
current estimates, an additional risk to global growth
comes from the possibility of a hard landing in China,
as also discussed in previous WEO reports. Without
a change in the pattern of growth that relies on credit
and investment, vulnerabilities will continue to rise.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, PROSPECTS, AND POLICY PRIORITIES

Cross-country evidence suggests that credit booms
of a similar size have often led to sharp corrections.
However, in China’s case, the government still has the
capacity to absorb and respond to the types of shocks
that triggered crises elsewhere: a run on deposits, a collapse of the real estate market, or capital flight. At the
same time, the repeated use of credit-financed stimulus to investment in response to shortfalls in growth
reduces the available policy space and risks amplifying
underlying vulnerabilities. Absent a rebalancing of
growth, the risk of a shock causing financial disruption or a sharp slowdown will rise further—with large
potential cross-border repercussions, given the size and
openness of the Chinese economy.

Policies
The global recovery remains fragile and uneven.
The brakes placed on the recovery by high public and
private debt in advanced economies are coming off,
but at different rates across countries, and unemployment rates and output gaps are still high in some
cases (Figure 1.15). Stagnation risks and low potential
growth in these economies remain important mediumterm concerns. These factors point to the need for
action on two fronts: continued support to domestic
demand and the adoption of policies and reforms
that can boost supply. Emerging markets continue to
underpin world growth but are slowing down from
precrisis growth rates. They need to address underlying
structural problems and take on structural reforms—
policy challenges that are quite heterogeneous across
countries. At the same time, they must deal with the
implications of monetary policy normalization in the
United States and possible shifts in financial market
sentiment more generally. Implementation of these
policies would underpin stronger and more balanced
growth and help achieve a further narrowing of global
external imbalances.

Fighting Low Inflation and Sustaining the Recovery in
Advanced Economies
Across advanced economies, output gaps generally
remain large and are projected to close only gradually,
inflation is low, and dealing with high public debt
requires fiscal consolidation to continue, as discussed
in the October 2014 Fiscal Monitor. Thus, maintaining
an accommodative monetary policy stance to support

The global recovery remains uneven. In advanced economies, the brakes placed on
growth by high public and private debt are coming off, but at different rates across
countries, and unemployment levels and output gaps are still high in some cases.
Medium-term growth prospects have also been revised downward in many
economies, particularly among major emerging markets, compared to the
projections made in the fall 2011 WEO.

the recovery is essential. Within these broad contours,
however, challenges increasingly differ across countries.
•• The recovery in the euro area remains weak and
uneven, unemployment rates far exceed their equilibrium value in most countries, and euro-area-wide
inflation is too low, pointing to pervasive weakness
in domestic demand. This requires policy actions
to support activity. On the monetary policy front,
recent measures taken by the ECB—lower policy
rates, and the announcement of cheap term funding
for banks and a program of private asset purchases—
are welcome. But if the inflation outlook does not
improve and inflation expectations continue to drift
downward, the ECB should be willing to do more,
including purchases of sovereign assets. Nevertheless,
reducing fragmentation in stressed economies and
ensuring that inflation rises back toward the price
stability objective requires action beyond monetary
policy. The review of banks’ asset quality that is currently underway is critical to reestablishing confidence
in banks and improving intermediation. And looking
beyond the demand constraints, structural measures
must be taken to increase very low potential growth
rates—as discussed further in the next subsection.
On the fiscal policy front, the pace of fiscal consolidation has slowed and the overall fiscal stance for
2014–15 is only slightly contractionary. This strikes
a better balance between demand support and debt
reduction. Germany, which has completed its fiscal
consolidation, could afford to finance much-needed
public investment in infrastructure (primarily for
maintenance and modernization), without violating
fiscal rules. Large negative growth surprises in euro
area countries should not trigger additional consolidation efforts, which would be self-defeating. Moreover,
if deflation risks materialize and monetary policy
options are depleted, the escape clauses in the fiscal
framework may need to be used to respond.
•• In Japan, aggressive monetary policy easing—the
first arrow of Abenomics—has helped lift inflation
and inflation expectations, and actual and expected
inflation are progressing toward the 2 percent target.
Communication by the Bank of Japan has been
effective, but more could be done to help anchor
expectations, including clarifying the indicators
used to assess whether inflation is on track. This
effort would also help guide expectations when a
need arises to adjust the asset purchase program
and facilitate preparations for eventual exit. Should
actual or expected inflation stall or growth disap-

point, further action by the Bank of Japan would
be warranted—but it would be essential that such
action be accompanied by complementary growthenhancing reforms, partly because of potential risks
to financial stability. On the fiscal front, given very
high public debt, implementation of the second
consumption tax increase is critical to establish a
track record of fiscal discipline but is likely to take a
toll on domestic demand, underscoring the importance of a pickup in confidence and investment.
•• In the United States, with growth expected to increase
above trend in the remainder of 2014 and 2015, the
main policy issue is the appropriate speed of monetary policy normalization. Under the IMF staff’s baseline projection, the current plans—namely, ending
asset purchases later this year and gradually increasing
the policy rate starting in mid-2015—are appropriate,
given the still-sizable output gap and subdued inflation. But the timing of the increase in the policy rate
may have to be adjusted based on developments on
the inflation and unemployment fronts. Two factors
complicate efforts to assess the amount of slack in
the economy: it is difficult to determine how much
of the decline in labor force participation is cyclical,
and uncertainty exists about the equilibrium rate of
unemployment. With the labor market strengthening
more rapidly than forecast and inflation, although
low, beginning to rise, risks of persistently low inflation have decreased, and the likelihood is arguably
higher that policy interest rates could rise faster
relative to the WEO baseline on account of reduced
slack. In this context, an effective communications
strategy is essential to prevent disruptive market
responses and anchor market expectations. On the
fiscal policy front, the priorities should be avoiding short-term fiscal accidents caused by political
brinkmanship and adopting a more growth-friendly
approach to fiscal consolidation, including through
front-loaded infrastructure spending, while reaching political agreement on a credible and detailed
medium-term fiscal consolidation path.
•• The recovery in other advanced economies is
becoming stronger, with buoyant house prices posing policy challenges in some of them (Box 1.1). In
the United Kingdom, for example, macroprudential
tools have been deployed to contain financial stability risks. Tighter monetary conditions could also be
considered if macroprudential tools prove ineffective
at addressing financial stability concerns, but careful
consideration would need to be given to the trade-

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, PROSPECTS, AND POLICY PRIORITIES

off between damage to the real economy and the
ultimate costs of financial vulnerabilities.
The role of public investment
As discussed in Chapter 3, for economies with
clearly identified infrastructure needs and efficient
public investment processes, and where there is economic slack and monetary accommodation, there is a
strong case for increasing public infrastructure investment. The increased public investment would provide
a much-needed boost to demand in the short term
and would also help raise potential output in the long
term. Moreover, evidence from advanced economies
suggests that an increase in public investment that is
debt financed would have larger output effects than
an increase that is budget neutral, with both options
delivering similar declines in the debt-to-GDP ratio.
Financial stability and macroprudential policy
Although sizable output gaps in advanced economies remain, the possibility of a buildup in financial
sector risks in a protracted low-interest-rate environment continues to make close monitoring necessary, as
elaborated in the October 2014 GFSR. For instance,
a number of smaller advanced economies are experiencing credit booms, and in certain segments of
U.S. financial markets, risks appear to be underpriced.
Authorities should remain vigilant, strengthen regulation and supervision of the shadow banking system,
and be ready to deploy macroprudential tools as a
first line of defense should such a threat become more
salient. As discussed in the GFSR, strengthening macroprudential tools may require changes to the regulatory and legal structure.5
Boosting medium-term growth and reducing risks of
stagnation
In the euro area, more growth-enhancing structural
reforms are necessary to tackle high unemployment,
increase competitiveness in stressed economies, and
facilitate rebalancing. To reduce youth unemployment,
country-specific measures such as cost-effective active
labor market policies, measures to lower the opportunity cost of employment, and better-targeted training
programs can also help. Higher infrastructure investment in creditor countries would help boost domestic

demand in the short term, thereby helping reduce
excessive surpluses and boosting potential output down
the road. In debtor countries, competitiveness-enhancing reforms to product and labor markets would help
boost export growth, sustaining external adjustment
even as the recovery takes hold and import compression unwinds.6 There should be continued efforts to
implement the European Union Services Directive,
make progress with free trade agreements, and more
closely integrate energy platforms and policies.
In Japan, more forceful structural reforms (the third
arrow of Abenomics) are needed to boost potential
growth and move decisively away from deflation. In particular, increasing the labor supply is of the essence, given
unfavorable demographic trends, but it is also important
to reduce labor market duality, enhance risk capital provision to boost investment, and raise productivity through
agricultural and services sector deregulation. The task of
boosting growth is also critical in light of the challenges
posed by high public debt and the need for sizable fiscal
consolidation—for which a concrete medium-term plan
beyond 2015 is urgently needed.
In the United States, potential growth is higher
than in most other large advanced economies, thanks
to a growing labor force. However, both labor supply and total factor productivity have been growing at
rates well below historical trends, and investment in
relation to GDP remains well below precrisis levels.
Steps should be taken to raise productivity, encourage innovation, augment human and physical capital,
and increase labor force participation. Such measures
should involve investment in infrastructure as well as
education. With a decline in labor force participation
and still-elevated long-term unemployment, scope also
remains for strengthening active labor market policies,
which in the past have been much less prevalent in the
United States than elsewhere in the advanced world.

Adapting to a Changing Environment in Emerging
Market and Developing Economies
Emerging markets’ efforts to rebalance growth
toward domestic sources in recent years have supported
world growth and facilitated a sizable unwinding of
global current account imbalances. But in a number
of countries this rebalancing, in a context in which
growth has been below expectations for the past few
6Structural labor reforms may entail nonnegligible fiscal costs, as
discussed in Chapter 2 of the October 2014 Fiscal Monitor.

22

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

years, has also increased some vulnerabilities and
reduced policy space, with inflation above target, or
weaker fiscal positions relative to the precrisis period,
or both. Reducing these vulnerabilities has become
more important in light of changes to the world environment. On the one hand, the recovery in advanced
economies suggests that demand for emerging market
exports will increase. On the other hand, the ensuing
normalization of monetary policy—particularly in the
United States—would indicate that some of the capital
flows that went to emerging markets in search of
higher returns may well reverse direction. Such a reversal, in turn, implies tighter financial conditions and a
financial environment in which foreign investors are
less forgiving and macroeconomic weaknesses are more
costly. And financial bumps, such as those of May–
June 2013, may well happen again—particularly after
a renewed period of benign global financial conditions,
with declining spreads and low volatility.
In this environment, to reduce vulnerabilities, the
macroeconomic policy stance should be consistent
with the extent of economic slack, within a credible
macroeconomic framework. The April 2014 WEO discusses the management of capital flow risks in emerging market and developing economies. In general,
these countries should continue to manage external
financial shocks with exchange rate flexibility, complemented with other measures, such as foreign exchange
intervention to limit excessive market volatility.
During the past year, some countries have successfully
lowered their vulnerabilities to adverse shocks by adopting tighter macroeconomic policies to reduce inflation
and narrow external current account deficits (India,
Indonesia). Vulnerabilities in some countries relate to
rapid domestic credit expansion. With the external
environment becoming less supportive, greater attention
to monitoring the financial sector as well as exposures
of nonfinancial firms, particularly in foreign exchange,
and to enforcing prudential regulation and supervision
and macroprudential measures to alleviate these risks, is
needed. In other economies, higher external borrowing
has increased exposure to external funding risks, and
raising domestic saving rates, including through stronger
public finances, should be a priority (Brazil, Turkey).
In China, rebalancing toward domestic demand has
been characterized by booming investment and credit,
with credit intermediation occurring not only through
banks, but also through local government platforms
and the shadow banking sector, regulation and supervision of which are weaker. To address the attendant

CHAPTER 1

risks, policies need to be carefully calibrated to help the
economy make the transition to more consumption-led
growth—with slower investment and real estate activity—while buttressing financial sector stability. In this
light, it is crucial to implement key elements of the
authorities’ structural reform that aim to strengthen
the regulation and supervision of the financial sector,
reduce implicit guarantees, liberalize the deposit rate,
and use interest rates instead of quantitative targets for
the implementation of monetary policy, thus encouraging market-based pricing of risks. Further expansion of
the social safety net, by reducing the current high rate
of social security contribution, and better health care
benefits would help reduce household saving rates and
raise domestic consumption. This domestic rebalancing
strategy, together with further exchange rate flexibility,
would also contribute to global rebalancing.
Several years of slowing growth prospects (Box 1.2)
suggest that it is also time for major emerging market
economies to turn to important structural reforms
to raise growth more robustly. The agenda, naturally
diverse across countries, includes removing infrastructure
bottlenecks in the power sector (India, South Africa);
easing limits on trade and investment and improving
business conditions (Indonesia, Russia); and implementing reforms to education, labor, and product markets to
raise competitiveness and productivity (Brazil, China,
India, South Africa) and government services delivery (South Africa). The policies being implemented
in Mexico—particularly in opening the energy and
telecommunications sectors to competition, as well as
labor market reforms—are welcome steps for attracting investment and raising employment and potential
growth. The postelection recovery of confidence in India
also provides an opportunity for that country to embark
on its much-needed structural reforms.

Challenges for Low-Income Countries

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, PROSPECTS, AND POLICY PRIORITIES

macroeconomic policies, more favorable business and
investment regimes leveraging increased interest from
foreign investors, and in a number of cases strong
terms of trade. But vulnerabilities remain. Overall,
low-income countries’ progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals has been uneven and
slow. For a few of these countries, the recent widening
of fiscal deficits and higher debt levels reflect a shift
in public spending away from essential investment—
social priorities and infrastructure—toward higher
current spending. With increased access to nonofficial foreign finance, nonresidents are holding larger
amounts of both foreign-currency and local-currency
debt, making some countries—particularly those with
domestic policy weaknesses—vulnerable to shifts in
market sentiment and reversal of capital flows. The
projected decline in many commodity prices would
strain budget revenues and foreign exchange earnings
in a number of countries, and more modest growth
prospects in emerging markets, together with low
growth in advanced economies, may challenge the ability of low-income countries to sustain strong growth.
In this context, and with growth still vigorous,
strengthening policies and reducing vulnerability to
external shocks is paramount. This would mean, for
many of these countries, boosting fiscal positions with
stronger revenues (including by increasing the revenue base), as well as limiting current public spending
and rationalizing it toward more social and education spending. Structural policy challenges include
strengthening fiscal frameworks to foster medium-term
planning and preserve debt sustainability, as well as
deepening structural transformation and diversification. Building greater monetary policy independence
and strengthening the monetary policy framework and
credibility would also allow exchange rates to become
more flexible to adjust to external shocks and limit
their potential adverse effects on the economy.

Growth rates for many low-income countries have
been high for a number of years, supported by better

Special Feature: Commodity Market Developments and Forecasts,
with a Focus on Natural Gas in the World Economy
Commodity prices have edged lower since the release of
the April 2014 World Economic Outlook (WEO),
led by a drop in food prices on improved supply prospects. Oil prices have recently fallen on weak demand
and ample supply. Metal prices have ticked up on
reduced inventories for some metals. With geopolitical
tensions, risks to oil prices are on the upside. Weatherrelated risks to food supplies have moderated.
Commodity prices have edged lower in recent
months (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 1). The decline has been
led by a 9 percent drop in food prices, owing mostly
to improved supply prospects. Crude oil prices have
recently declined, despite geopolitical supply concerns,
and are well below the average price of about $104 a
barrel prevailing since the beginning of 2011. Natural gas prices, on the other hand, have declined in all
major markets because of weak demand and ample

supply (see the section “Natural Gas in the World
Economy”). Coal prices have also slumped on significant oversupply. Metal prices have unexpectedly risen 2
percent but are projected to decline.
Turning to oil markets, crude oil supply disruptions
reached a total of more than 3 million barrels a day
(mbd) during the past year, with the largest outages in
Iraq, Libya, and Syria, in addition to the disruptions
generated by sanctions against the Islamic Republic
of Iran. Other disruptions have arisen from geopolitical (for example, South Sudan) and technical (for
example, Canada and the North Sea) factors. Despite
these disruptions, oil prices have edged lower, reflecting
offsets from strong supply growth in countries outside
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) (mainly from U.S. shale oil deposits),
continued high production in some OPEC producers,
and the potential backstop from relatively high OPEC
spare capacity. Increases in non-OPEC supply are
expected to exceed the moderate growth in world oil
demand in 2014 and 2015. There are downside risks
to prices should global growth disappoint, as discussed

COMMODITY MARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND FORECASTS, WITH A FOCUS ON NATURAL GAS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY

elsewhere in this WEO report. But there are also risks
of further disruptions from geopolitical issues in a
number of oil-producing regions.
Oil production increases in North America (Figure
1.SF.1, panel 2)—particularly in light tight oil from
shale deposits—have affected global oil trade flows.
With increased domestic production, U.S. net oil
imports have dropped from 12.5 mbd in 2005 to 5.5
mbd to date in 2014. Light crude oil imports from
west Africa and elsewhere have been most affected
and have been redirected to other destinations. The
United States has also increased oil product exports,
taking advantage of low-priced domestic crude
oil and further benefiting the country’s net trade
position.
Food prices have declined 9 percent since March
2014 on an improved global production outlook.
However, prices of a few food commodities have
moved higher. Meat prices have surged as a result
of a porcine epidemic virus that has significantly
increased piglet mortality in the United States, and
prices of arabica coffee beans have soared because of
a severe drought in Brazil. Weather conditions have
been favorable so far in the current harvest year, and
bumper harvests are expected for the main cereal and
oilseed crops. Although global stocks are expected to
increase (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 3), they will still remain
below historical averages for most major crops, except
soybeans. The likelihood of an El Niño event materializing in the fall of 2014 has been downgraded to
50 percent. El Niño weather conditions would likely
have a negative impact on global production of corn,
rice, and wheat, whereas soybean production could
be higher. There are also risks associated with Russia
imposing a ban on agricultural products from Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway, and the
United States. The ban could exert downward pressure
on prices as a result of reduced demand and could
increase domestic prices within Russia—although the
country will be sourcing imports from other regions,
such as Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
Metal prices have unexpectedly risen 2 percent since
March 2014 on reduced inventories for some metals
(aluminum, copper, zinc), following more than three
years of decline. Metal consumption remains relatively
strong, particularly in China (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 4).
Nevertheless, overall, metal markets remain in net supply (flow) surplus, because of strong supply, suggesting
that metal prices will likely decline in the near term,
consistent with current futures price curves.

Price Outlook and Risks
Commodity prices are expected to decline, in line
with futures markets. Crude oil prices are projected
to average $102.8 a barrel in 2014 (down 1.3 percent
from 2013), falling to $99.4 in 2015 and to $97.3 in
2016. This pattern is consistent with strong increases
in non-OPEC production. Food prices are projected
to decline by 4.1 percent in 2014 and by 7.9 percent
in 2015 and to remain broadly unchanged in 2016.
This projection reflects favorable harvest conditions
for the current year, as discussed earlier. Metal prices
are projected to decline by 7.5 percent in 2014 and
by 1.8 percent in 2015, before rising 0.6 percent in
2016. This price path reflects ongoing supply gains in
the short term but also anticipates some tightening
in market conditions in the medium term, as lower
prices should start to have negative supply effects (for
example, through lower investment).
Risks to oil prices are tilted toward the upside
given the wide range of supply outages and ongoing geopolitical tensions (Figure 1.SF.2). The largest
concerns are escalating violence within Iraq and the
dispute between Russia and Ukraine. To the downside, reduced tensions and a recovery in output from
affected areas, including the Islamic Republic of Iran,
could weigh heavily on oil prices, as would slower
demand. Food price risks are tilted upward, given
the recent decline in prices for major cereal crops
and routine variability with weather. Risks to metal
prices are fairly balanced given current surpluses and
adequate stocks, with supply pressures deferred to
2015 (nickel) and beyond (most metals).

Natural Gas in the World Economy
Natural gas markets are much less integrated than
oil markets, given the cost and logistical difficulty of
trading gas across borders. The limited integration of
gas markets is evident from substantial price differences
across regions despite increasing liquefied natural gas
trade. Global natural gas production and consumption
have increased steadily and are projected to do so even
more rapidly in the medium term. Three major developments of the past few years have had particularly
important implications for gas and energy markets: the
shale gas revolution in the United States, the reduction in nuclear power supply following the Fukushima
disaster in Japan, and the geopolitical tensions between
Russia and Ukraine.

across borders imply that natural gas markets are much
less integrated than oil markets. Shipping or transporting natural gas requires either costly pipeline networks
or liquefaction infrastructure and equipment, including dedicated vessels, and then regasification at the
destination. The limited integration of gas markets is
evident from substantial price differences across regions
in recent years resulting from the U.S. shale gas boom
and the Fukushima disaster, and in spite of increasing
liquefied natural gas trade (Figure 1.SF.3).1
The Islamic Republic of Iran, Russia, Qatar,
Turkmenistan, and the United States have the largest reserves of natural gas (Tables 1.SF.1 and 1.SF.2).
Technological improvements in exploration and drilling activities have enabled both new discoveries and
exploitation of previously identified reserves of natural
gas. As a result of these new discoveries and the heightened exploitation of existing reserves, there are many

in the 1990s.2 The largest producers of natural gas are
the United States and Russia, followed by the Islamic
Republic of Iran, Qatar, and Canada (Table 1.SF.2).
Natural gas consumption has risen steadily. It now
accounts for nearly 25 percent of global primary
energy consumption, whereas the share of oil has
declined rapidly, from 50 percent in 1970 to about 30
percent today. Global natural gas demand is projected
to increase strongly in the medium term (IEA 2014),
with emerging market and developing economies
accounting for the bulk of the growth. Natural gas
usage faces competition from substitutes for gas in
many sectors, particularly from renewables and coal
in power generation—in part because of subsidies and
gas-pricing regimes. Natural gas is also expected to
make further inroads into transportation, in which its
use is still very limited, eventually including the use of
liquefied natural gas as shipping fuel.
The pattern of global trade in natural gas has
evolved rapidly. Because natural gas has mainly been
transported to consumers via pipeline, only one-third
of natural gas consumed is traded internationally.
Europe and North America are by far the largest markets integrated by pipelines, but their net imports have
declined since 2005 on account of weaker economic
activity and higher gas production in the United
States. One-third of internationally traded natural gas
is shipped as liquefied natural gas, and that share has
been expanding rapidly, with the increase going mainly
to Asia (Figure 1.SF.4). There were almost 20 liquefiednatural-gas-producing countries in 2013. Qatar has
rapidly developed liquefied natural gas export capacity in the past decade and is now the largest exporter,
accounting for about one-third of global natural gas
trade.

liquefied natural gas exporters and even become a net
exporter of natural gas later this decade (U.S. EIA
2014). With surging supply and weak demand, natural
gas prices in the United States have fallen sharply in
recent years and are effectively decoupled from those in
the rest of the world. In particular, prices in Asia and
the European Union have risen, partly because of the
indexation of imported natural gas prices to oil prices.
So far, energy users in the United States have been the
main beneficiaries of the energy price declines that

3Natural gas production from shale deposits in the United States
began in the 1980s, but the combination of hydraulic fracturing and
horizontal drilling allowed gas production to increase sharply late in
the first decade of the 2000s (with the higher natural gas prices supplying additional motivation). Shale gas production now accounts
for about half of total U.S. natural gas production. The drilling technology has been applied to development of oil from shale deposits

have resulted from the U.S. shale revolution. However,
that revolution has helped to stabilize international
energy prices, including by freeing global energy
supply for European and Asian markets, thus offsetting some of the shortages attributable to geopolitical
disruptions.4 Also, the U.S. shale boom has displaced
coal from the United States to Europe, lowering energy
costs in the latter.
The shale gas boom in the United States has also
had a significant impact on the geography of global
energy trade.5 U.S. fossil fuel imports decreased to
$225 billion (1.3 percent of GDP) in 2013 from
4While both the shale oil and gas booms have led to lower average world energy prices compared with what they would have been
without these booms, the shale gas boom in particular has increased
the dispersion in regional prices.
5Shale gas development has significant potential in many parts of
the world, notably in Argentina, Australia, China, Poland, and Russia, where shale gas developments are under way, but also in many
other locales. Development of this potential could further shift the
patterns of global energy and nonenergy trade. However, shale gas
production is expected to increase at a slower pace in countries other
than the United States, because many of the conditions that facilitated the U.S. shale gas boom are not in place or at sufficient scale.

$412 billion (2.8 percent of GDP) in 2008. Both
demand for coal and coal prices in the United States
have also declined. These declines, in turn, have
encouraged increased exports of coal to Europe,
which, together with weak activity there following
the global economic and financial crisis, has reduced
Europe’s demand for natural gas.6 The shale gas boom
has drastically reduced U.S. liquefied natural gas
imports from Africa, the Middle East, and Trinidad
and Tobago (Figure 1.SF.5) and has also substantially
reduced natural gas imports from Canada, triggering a sharp decline in prices as a result of a natural
gas glut. Exporters have shifted energy exports to
other locations, such as China, Europe, and India, in
response to the U.S. reduction in energy imports.7 In
the United States, the shale gas boom has made much
6In regard to trade, this shift has affected primarily Algeria, Norway, and Russia, the largest gas exporters to Europe.
7Trinidad and Tobago has seen its exports of liquefied natural gas
to the United States plummet. Since the start of the U.S. shale gas
boom, however, Trinidad and Tobago has actively reoriented its liquefied natural gas exports toward South America, Europe, and Asia.

of the liquefied natural gas import infrastructure
redundant. The infrastructure cannot easily be converted to export capacity, because liquefaction capacity is different from import regasification capacity. In
addition, firms are required to obtain authorization
to export natural gas (except to Canada and Mexico),
though there are signs that the regulatory hurdles are
loosening.8 In the medium term, the removal of U.S.
gas export restrictions would trigger the building up
and reconversion of liquefied natural gas facilities for
export purposes and in turn could help reduce energy
price differences worldwide and further affect other
natural gas exporters.
The U.S. advantage in natural gas has also led to
an increase in U.S. competitiveness in nonenergy
products, in turn affecting its competitors. Results
of a bivariate vector autoregression including the
difference in industrial production and the difference
in the price of natural gas between the United States
and Europe suggest that natural gas prices can have a

substantial independent impact on economic activity
(Figure 1.SF.6). This specification controls for global
shocks such as the global economic and financial
crisis, an issue that has been overlooked in other
studies.9 A 10 percent reduction in the relative price
of natural gas in the United States is found to lead to
an improvement in U.S. industrial production relative
to that of the euro area of roughly 0.7 percent after
one and a half years. Box 1.SF.1 provides estimates
of the gain in international competitiveness of U.S.
manufacturing exports due to cheaper natural gas.

9Using industry-level data, Melick (2014) estimates that the fall in
the price of natural gas since 2006 is associated with a 2–3 percent
increase in activity for the entire manufacturing sector, with much
larger effects of 30 percent or more for the most energy-intensive
industries. Celasun and others (2014) find that a doubling of the
natural gas price differential in favor of the home country would
increase manufacturing industrial production in the home country
by 1.5 percent.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March
2011 highlighted the environmental liabilities associated with nuclear power generation and induced a
sharp increase in natural gas usage. Before the disaster,
about one-quarter of Japan’s energy was generated by
means of nuclear reactors. Following the disaster, the
Japanese government decided to halt production at all
nuclear power plants in the country. To compensate
for the resulting loss in electricity generation, Japanese
electric power companies increased their use of fossilfuel power stations and appended natural gas turbines
to existing plants. As a result, Japan’s liquefied natural
gas imports have increased dramatically—by about 40
percent—since the disaster (Figure 1.SF.7).
Japan is thus now the world’s largest importer of
liquefied natural gas. In 2013, the country’s imports
of liquefied natural gas amounted to 119 billion
cubic meters: more than one-third of the world total.
Increased natural gas demand from Japan has benefited
producers in Asia, the Middle East, and Oceania at
a time when global natural gas demand has slowed.
Japan’s imports have helped offset some of the negative effects of the reduction in U.S. liquefied natural
gas imports. Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia,
Malaysia, and Qatar have seen their liquefied natural
gas exports to Japan rise rapidly (Figure 1.SF.8). The
sharp increase in natural gas demand has led to higher
prices in Asia, and Japan in particular, with prices in
Asia reaching twice European prices and four times
U.S. prices.

Risks from Geopolitical Tensions between Russia and
Ukraine
The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has highlighted
European energy markets’ dependence on natural gas.
In January 2009, Gazprom, the Russian energy utility,
shut off all supply to Europe through Ukraine. In
2009, the spot price for gas increased by 50 percent,
but the one-month-forward contract price moved up
slowly—by 20 percent—during the three-week shutoff;
crude oil prices did not react noticeably. Europe’s
dependence on natural gas transiting through Ukraine
has decreased from 80 percent to roughly 50 percent
since then. On June 16, 2014, Gazprom stopped providing natural gas to Ukraine but left the transit and
supply to Europe unaffected.

SPECIAL FEATURE

COMMODITY MARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND FORECASTS, WITH A FOCUS ON NATURAL GAS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY

Ukraine and countries in southeast Europe appear
particularly vulnerable to potential disruptions of Russian gas supply. Should the gas cutoffs persist and be
extended to other countries, the greatest impact will
be on Ukraine and countries in southeast Europe that
receive Russian gas transiting through Ukraine—in
particular, Bulgaria and countries of the former Yugoslavia, which rely on Russian gas for virtually all of
their import requirements and have only limited access
to gas from alternative sources. Other countries, however, will be affected through rising spot prices, which
may spread from natural gas to other fuels. Such risks
can be mitigated through accumulation of reserves,
purchasing pipeline gas from Algeria and Norway,
importing liquefied natural gas, or buying Russian gas
transported via other pipelines. Other fuels, notably
coal and oil products, could also be substituted for gas.
Continental Europe imports a substantial portion
of the gas it needs from Russia. In 2013, roughly 152
billion cubic meters of Russian gas—36 percent of
European gas consumption—were exported to Europe
via pipeline. On average, Russia supplies about 30
percent of Europe’s natural gas needs. Roughly half of
the gas supply from Russia is transported via pipeline
through Ukraine (down from 80 percent before the
Nord Stream pipeline was built). The share of natural gas in primary energy consumption ranges widely
across European nations, from less than 2 percent in
Sweden to 42 percent in the Netherlands.
So far the geopolitical tensions in the region have
barely affected natural gas and crude oil prices. This
price stability is less surprising in the case of crude oil
because there are far fewer concerns about the consequences of a potential disruption in the supply of oil
from Russia than about those of a natural gas supply
disruption. In May of this year, Russia signed a $400

billion deal to transport 38 billion cubic meters of gas
a year from eastern Siberia to China starting in 2018.
Pricing has not been disclosed, but the price is thought
to be somewhat less than what Europeans are paying
for pipeline gas from Russia. This deal gives Russia
greater export flexibility should European gas demand
continue to fall.

Conclusions
Overall, the pattern of global trade in liquefied
natural gas, and energy more generally, is expected to
evolve rapidly. In particular, the United States is likely
to become a net exporter of liquefied natural gas by
the end of 2015, Japan has become the world’s largest
importer of liquefied natural gas, and Europe faces
uncertainty in its supply of natural gas, considering
the geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine.
Energy policy, including for coal and renewables, plays
a key role in shaping the energy mix, in turn affecting
global trade in energy. Specifically, Europe and Japan
are at a crossroads, facing a difficult balance between
energy security, environmental concerns, and economic
efficiency goals. In the medium term, natural gas prices
in Asia are expected to decline, assuming the resumption of nuclear power generation in Japan and lower
oil prices. European gas prices could edge lower as
European countries move further toward spot-priced
gas imports, but the tensions between Russia and
Ukraine have led to increased uncertainty about future
market developments. Domestic natural gas prices
in the United States are expected to rise with rapidly
growing liquefied natural gas exports but to remain
markedly lower than those in Europe and Asia, given
liquefaction costs.

Box 1.SF.1. The Trade Implications of the U.S. Shale Gas Boom
The shale gas boom has led to a debate in the
United States about whether relaxing the restrictions
on exporting natural gas would diminish the gains in
external competitiveness resulting from lower domestic
natural gas prices. As noted in the text of the Special
Feature, the boom has led to a decoupling of U.S.
natural gas prices from those in Europe and Asia since
2005, and the resulting price differentials are expected
to persist. At the same time, the share of energy-intensive manufacturing exports in total U.S. manufacturing exports has been rising steadily, whereas the share
of non-energy-intensive exports has been declining
(Figure 1.SF.1.1).
This box sheds light on the global trade implications
of international differences in natural gas prices using
the U.S. shale gas boom as a natural experiment. The
main finding, based on sector-level data, is that the
current gap between U.S. prices and those in the rest
of the world has led to a 6 percent increase, on average, in U.S. manufactured product exports since the
start of the shale gas boom. Even though natural gas
and energy costs in general represent relatively small
shares of total input costs, the lower natural gas price
in the United States, which is likely to persist, has had
a noticeable effect on U.S. energy-intensive manufacturing exports.1

Energy intensity and manufacturing exports
For the period 2000–12, which covers the shale
boom in the United States, the logarithm of manufactured-product exports is regressed on the interaction
between differentials in energy intensity and in price
between the United States and the rest of the world.
The specification is a classical equation suggested by
trade models. The coefficient associated with the interaction term is expected to be positive; that is, the more
energy intensive a product is, the more likely it is to
be exported. The equation estimated is
ln(product exporti,j,k,t ) = αi,j,k + γt + η × Energy
Intensityk, × Price Differentialt + εijkt,

The author of this box is Rabah Arezki.
1These results are also robust to an array of checks, including
additional controls such as country differences in labor costs and
GDP. Arezki and Fetzer (forthcoming) present extensive technical details and robustness checks. A multitude of factors that go
beyond the scope of this box are driving U.S. manufacturing
exports. The interpretation of the present results is, of course,
subject to all else being equal.

Table 1.SF.1.1. Regression Results
Energy Cost Share

What is learned from the results?
The coefficient associated with the interaction
between energy intensity and price differential is large,
positive, and statistically significant (Table 1.SF.1.1).
The baseline point estimate is 0.42 with a standard
error of 0.10. The direct energy cost share for manufacturing products is a little more than 5 percent,
and the total energy cost share is about 8 percent. In
comparison, the direct labor cost share for manufacturing goods is 20 percent. The measure of the price
differential between the rest of the world and the
United States is of a factor of three, on average.3 This
suggests that for the average manufacturing product,
U.S. exports have risen by at least 6 percent (0.42 × 3
× 0.05) as a result of the price gap.
The results are checked to determine their robustness to using the natural gas cost share as opposed to
the energy share, and also to the use of year dummies
instead of natural gas price differentials; furthermore,
oil and petroleum manufacturing products, which
have a direct energy cost share greater than 60 percent, are dropped. The direct natural gas cost share
is on average 2 percent for manufacturing products.
This measure does not account for the fact that gas
could be indirectly consumed through electricity. The
baseline results are robust to using these alternative
measures of energy use and specifications, and broadly
similar figures are obtained.
Further evidence suggests that the channels through
which cheaper domestic natural gas prices in the

Box 1.1. Housing Markets across the Globe: An Update
Developments in real estate markets have led to
seemingly contradictory concerns about both overheating and slow recovery. This dichotomy reflects
the fact that housing markets across the globe have
broadly followed a two-speed pattern: in one group of
countries, housing markets quickly rebounded after
modest declines during the Great Recession, while in
the other group, they are still recovering from much
sharper declines.
Reflecting these divergent movements, the IMF’s
Global House Price Index—an average of real house
prices in 50 countries—has barely budged during the
past two years, after a sharp drop during the crisis
(Figure 1.1.1, panel 1). The recovery in house prices
has been particularly anemic relative to that in other
financial assets; for example, global indices of stock
markets have rebounded to precrisis levels, although
stock prices have also been much more volatile than
house prices (Figure 1.1.1, panel 2).
However, the overall house price index masks the
fact that economies fall into two clusters. The first
cluster consists of 33 economies in which housing
markets are still recovering: house prices in general
dropped sharply at the onset of the Great Recession,
and the subsequent recovery has been slow. The second
cluster comprises 17 economies in which housing
markets have rebounded: the drop in house prices
in 2007–08 was more modest and was followed by a
quick rebound (Figure 1.1.2, panel 1).1 In the former
group, real house prices are, on average, 20 percent
lower than in 2008; in the latter group, they are about
25 percent higher. Credit has also expanded much
more slowly in the former group than in the latter
(Figure 1.1.2, panel 2).
In the economies in which house prices have
rebounded, construction gross value added and real
residential investment are both 15 percent higher than
The main authors of this box are Hites Ahir and Prakash
Loungani, drawing on their ongoing work with Philippe Bracke
(Bank of England), Ambrogio Cesa-Bianchi (Bank of England),
and Alessandro Rebucci (Johns Hopkins University), and with
assistance from Deniz Igan and Heedon Kang.
1The determination of which group to place countries in
is based on average real house price growth during the period
2007–14. Most countries clearly fall into one of the two groups,
although a few are on the border. The results are not sensitive
either to the placement of these countries or to their exclusion
from the analysis. The results are also qualitatively similar if
countries are weighted by GDP in group aggregates rather than
weighted equally.

in 2008. In recovering economies, the two metrics
began to show a small uptick only in the past year
(Figure 1.1.3).
The placement of countries in the two groups has
been influenced by a number of factors. The rebound
economies, on average, had a smaller precrisis boom
in house prices than did the recovering economies,
and they were judged to have better prospects for a
growth rebound when the crisis hit (see Box 1.2 of
the October 2010 World Economic Outlook). Rebound
economies have also turned out to have higher growth
since the crisis: during the period 2008–13, the average annual growth in the rebound economies was 2.7
percent, compared with 0.5 percent in the recovering

economies. The slower growth in the recovering group
may partly reflect the drag from household sector
deleveraging: many economies in that group had a significant buildup in leverage during the boom period.

In many cases, the house price booms are restricted
to particular cities (in Australia and Germany, for
example) or are amplified by supply constraints (New
Zealand for example).4

Cause for concern?

Active use of macroprudential tools

In countries where housing markets are still recovering, the policy challenge is to bring about a more
robust recovery while addressing the underlying cause
of the unsustainable booms that led to the crisis. For
instance, in the United States, the resumption of mortgage lending to lower-rated borrowers has been slow,
given the recognition that lending to such borrowers
was one trigger for the crisis.2
Concerns about sustainability are greater in economies in which housing markets have rebounded,
particularly for the emerging market economies in this
group, for which growth prospects have been revised
downward considerably in recent years. The most
notable case is China, where the challenge is to allow
for the necessary correction in real estate markets while
preventing an excessively sharp slowdown. In large cities
in China, house prices show signs of overvaluation relative to fundamentals, despite measures aimed at restricting speculative demand. In contrast, many smaller cities
have experienced oversupply because local governments
promoted large-scale development to boost growth and
used land sales to finance local-government spending.
In recent months, real estate markets in China appear
to have entered a downturn. In Brazil, house prices and
lending have increased sharply since 2009, and although
the real-estate-loan-to-GDP ratio has tripled, it started
from a very low base.
In other countries where housing markets have
rebounded, IMF assessments point to modest overvaluations in Canada and Israel and more substantial
overvaluations in Norway and Sweden (Table 1.1.1).3

Many countries—particularly those in the rebound
group—have been actively using macroprudential
tools to manage house price booms (Figure 1.1.4). The
main macroprudential tools employed for this purpose
are limits on loan-to-value ratios and debt-serviceto-income ratios and sectoral capital requirements.5
Such limits have long been in use in some economies,
particularly in Asia (see Chapter 4 of the April 2014
Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and Pacific). For
example, Hong Kong SAR has had a loan-to-value
cap in place since the early 1990s and introduced a
debt-service-to-income cap in 1994. In Korea, loanto-value limits were introduced in 2002, followed by
debt-service-to-income limits in 2005. Recently, many
other advanced and emerging market economies have
followed the example of Hong Kong SAR and Korea.
In some countries, such as Bulgaria, Malaysia, and
Switzerland, higher risk weights or additional capital
requirements have been imposed on mortgage loans
with high loan-to-value ratios.6 Empirical studies thus

2The United Kingdom experienced a sharp decline in house
prices during 2008–10, which is why it ends up being classified here in the recovering group. During the past year, U.K.
house prices have risen substantially, particularly in the London
market. The IMF’s recent Selected Issues paper for the United
Kingdom notes that “the increase in house prices in a context of
weak credit growth suggests that cash transactions, in particular
by foreigners, are playing an increasingly important role in the
housing recovery” (IMF 2014d, 12). The report also points to
tight housing supply constraints as another factor behind house
price increases.
3Table 1.1.1 also notes the dates on which these assessments
were published. It is important to keep these in mind, because
some adjustments in prices may have taken place since these

36

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

dates. The assessments are based on different methods but
broadly relate developments in house prices to a set of fundamentals such as GDP growth, interest rates, and rents. (See Igan
and Loungani 2012 for typical results from regressions of house
prices on fundamentals.)
4In the United Arab Emirates, rapid increases in some segments of the real estate market have prompted concerns about
possible excessive risk taking. The IMF staff has advised that
additional measures—such as macroprudential tightening and
setting higher fees for reselling within a short time—are warranted, especially if real estate prices and lending continue to rise
(IMF 2014c).
5Limits on loan-to-value ratios cap the size of a mortgage
loan relative to the value of the property associated with the
loan, in essence imposing a minimum down payment. Limits
on debt-service-to-income ratios restrict the size of a debt
service payment to a fixed share of household income, containing unaffordable increases in household debt. Sectoral capital
requirements force lenders to hold extra capital against loans to
a specific sector, such as real estate, discouraging heavy exposures
to the sector. See IMF 2013 for a fuller discussion of the role
of macroprudential policies as part of the tool kit for managing
house price booms.
6In Norway, higher risk weights have been assigned to all
mortgage loans from banks using the Basel II internal-ratingsbased (IRB) approach to capital requirements, not just those
with high loan-to-value ratios.

Box 1.1 (continued)
Table 1.1.1. IMF Assessments of Housing Market Developments in Rebound Economies
Country
(date of assessment)

Assessment

Australia
(February 2014)

The rise in prices is concentrated in Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth. It has not been accompanied by an
overall increase in leverage. Credit growth is moderate, and many households continue to pay down
debt.

Austria
(September 2013)

The housing market has experienced strong price growth, but from low levels. From a medium-term
perspective, the real price increase appears modest: a cumulative 40 percent over 10 years in Vienna
and about 5 percent elsewhere.

Brazil
(October 2013)

Since the global financial crisis, Brazil has experienced a rapid expansion in real estate loans and housing
prices. During 2009–12, the real-estate-loan-to-GDP ratio increased to 6.9 percent from 2.3 percent.

Canada
(February 2014)

House prices are high relative to both income and rents. The IMF staff estimates that real average house
prices in Canada are about 10 percent higher than fundamental values, with most of the gap coming
from the markets in Ontario and Quebec.

China
(July 2014)

In large cities in China, house prices show signs of overvaluation relative to fundamentals, despite
measures aimed at restricting speculative demand. In contrast, many smaller cities have experienced
oversupply because local governments have promoted large-scale development to boost growth and
used land sales to finance local-government spending.

Colombia
(June 2014)

Real house prices have nearly doubled during the past decade, driven mainly by prices in the capital and
two other cities.

Germany
(July 2014)

Recent house price inflation has been stronger in cities such as Hamburg and Munich. Bundesbank
analysis suggests that prices in Germany as a whole are close to fundamental values, but apartment
prices in large cities may be overvalued by about 25 percent.

Hong Kong SAR
(May 2014)

Property prices have increased some 300 percent from their trough in 2003. Although prices have leveled
off more recently, estimates from IMF staff models indicate that they could be higher than suggested by
fundamentals.

Israel
(February 2014)

Property prices are currently about 25 percent higher than their equilibrium value, owing largely to low
mortgage interest rates and supply shortages. Price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios are also well
above their equilibrium values.

Luxembourg
(May 2014)

Relatively high prices reflect both upward pressure from strong demand and supply bottlenecks. Although
households’ financial positions appear relatively sound, rising real estate exposures in domestically
oriented banks warrant close monitoring.

Malaysia
(March 2014)

House prices have increased rapidly, outpacing income and rental growth. Strong demand for residential
property loans has been driven by a robust labor market and falling lending rates. However,
underwriting standards do not appear to have deteriorated.

New Zealand
(June 2014)

From historical and international comparisons and by some measures of affordability, house prices appear
elevated, in part reflecting limited housing stock caused by low housing investment and geographical
constraints preventing a rapid housing supply response.

Norway
(August 2014)

Various factors have been contributing to rising house prices, including high income and wage growth,
immigrant inflows, and supply constraints. Nevertheless, there are signs of overvaluation, with a sustained
increase in the price-to-income ratio and a large deviation in the price-to-rent ratio from its historical average.

Philippines
(August 2014)

House price increases have been modest compared with those in many other countries in Asia. The priceto-rent ratio has declined modestly since 2010 and does not signal price misalignment.

Singapore
(November 2013)

After having risen more than 50 percent from their mid-2009 trough, house prices stabilized, and have
recently started to fall, on intensive application of macroprudential policies. Indicators on the quantity
side also indicate a softening of the market.

Sweden
(June 2014)

Real house prices increased by about 50 percent between 2005 and May 2014, with the annual increase
averaging about 7 percent since 2012. Standard indicators suggest house prices are 20 percent higher
than those suggested by fundamentals.

Switzerland
(May 2014)

With monetary conditions remaining accommodative and housing prices growing faster than incomes,
measures to curb mortgage demand, especially from the more vulnerable households, need to be
strengthened.

far suggest that limits on loan-to-value and debt-service-to-income ratios have effectively cooled off both
house price and credit growth in the short term.7
7See, for example, Zhang and Zoli 2014 on the evidence for
Asian countries and also Claessens, Ghosh, and Mihet 2014 and
Lim and others 2011.

38

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

Implementation of these tools has costs as well as
benefits, so each needs to be designed carefully to
target risky segments of mortgage loans and minimize
unintended side effects. For instance, stricter loan-tovalue limits can be applied to differentiate speculators
with multiple mortgage loans from first-time home
buyers (as in, for example, Israel and Singapore) or
to target regions or cities with exuberant house price
appreciation (as in, for example, Korea). Regulators
also should monitor whether credit operations move
toward unregulated or loosely regulated entities and
should expand the regulatory perimeter to address
the leakages if necessary. For example, when sectoral macroprudential instruments are used to limit
mortgage loans from domestic banks, they can be
circumvented through a move to nonbanks (as in, for
example, Korea) or foreign banks or branches (as in,
for example, Bulgaria and Serbia).
Macroprudential tools may also not be effective
for targeting house price booms that are driven by
increased demand from foreign cash inflows that
bypass domestic credit intermediation. In such cases,
other tools are needed. For instance, stamp duties
have been imposed to cool down rising house prices
in Hong Kong SAR and Singapore. Evidence shows
that this measure has reduced house demand from
foreigners, who were outside the loan-to-value and
debt-service-to-income regulatory perimeters.8 In other
instances, high house prices could reflect supply bottlenecks, which would need to be addressed through
structural policies such as urban planning measures.

8Higher transaction taxes may not be the desired policy
response in all cases. Taxes based on property values may be less
distortionary. Moreover, financial stability risks may be lower if
houses are bought with cash rather than credit, taking away some
of the need for a policy response. See Crowe and others 2011 for
a discussion of the effectiveness of various policies to manage real
estate booms, including the difficulties of calibrating many of the
macroprudential tools (for example, because of circumvention)
and political economy considerations.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, PROSPECTS, AND POLICY PRIORITIES

Box 1.2. The Origins of IMF Growth Forecast Revisions since 2011
After a sharp rebound following the global financial
crisis, global growth declined every year between 2010
and 2013—from 5.4 percent to 3.3 percent. The
slowdown was partly driven by new shocks, such as
the euro area crisis. But even though forecasts in World
Economic Outlook (WEO) reports were also pared
down, global growth outturns have still surprised on
the downside relative to each successive WEO forecast
since 2011. Against this backdrop, this box analyzes
the origins of the growth forecast errors in recent
WEO projections, beginning with the October 2010
WEO.1

Growth forecast errors: Where, when, and how
much?
One-year-ahead forecasts for global growth
in 2011–14 were, on average, too optimistic—
some 0.6 percentage point higher than outcomes
(Table 1.2.1).2 Average forecast errors for emerging
market and developing economies (which accounted
for some 80 percent of world growth during this
period) were almost twice as large as those for
advanced economies. The table also shows that a few
economies account for the lion’s share of the forecast
error. Specifically, Brazil, China, India, and Russia (the
BRICs), whose share in global GDP at purchasingpower-parity weights is about 28 percent, account
for about half of the overall forecast error.3 And four
stressed economies in the Middle East account for
another 20 percent of the global forecast error. For
advanced economies, much of the overprediction of
The authors of this box are Rupa Duttagupta and Thomas
Helbling, with support from Angela Espiritu.
1This analysis also updates that in the October 2013 WEO,
which documented the origins of forecast revisions for regional
growth through the fall of 2013.
2These errors measure the difference between estimates for
actual growth in year t reported in the fall 2014 WEO (with t
varying between 2011 and 2014) and the growth projection for
year t made in the fall WEO of the previous year. For 2014, the
forecast revision between the fall 2014 WEO and the fall 2013
WEO is used instead of the forecast error because the 2014
actual is not yet known.
3To make the forecasts analyzed here comparable across the
WEO reports, all regional and global growth aggregates use the
recently revised purchasing power parities of the 2011 International Comparison Program. Also, all regions and economies in
the analysis represent a constant composition of countries, classified as advanced or emerging market and developing economies
according to the October 2014 WEO. However, the figures are
not adjusted for revisions in the historical data.

growth was for 2011–12, reflecting the euro area crisis
(with large revisions especially for stressed euro area
economies), the 2011 Japanese earthquake, and lower
growth in some advanced Asian economies excluding
Japan (particularly in 2012). For these advanced Asian
economies, the error is likely related to the 1.4 percentage point growth forecast error for China in 2012.
Forecast errors for the United States and for the
remaining emerging market and developing economies
were, on average, minor.

Growth forecast errors: Which GDP component?
The overprediction of global growth in 2011–13
primarily reflects an overprediction of investment (Figure 1.2.1). The contribution of the forecast errors for
other demand components, such as net exports and
consumption, varied across regions and countries—for
instance, net exports were weaker than forecast in both
Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. These results
do not identify the ultimate sources behind shortfalls
in investment growth. Nevertheless, they suggest that
domestic factors played a role in lowering investment
growth below expectations, especially where disappointments in investment exceeded those in export
growth. This implication resonates with recent studies
that find that external factors play an important role
in, but do not fully explain, the recent slowdown
in emerging market and developing economies (see
Chapter 4 of the April 2014 WEO; Cubeddu and others 2014; and IMF 2014b).

Growth forecast errors: Domestic and in trading
partners
Further suggestive evidence is provided in Figure 1.2.2, which shows the relationship between
forecast errors for domestic growth and those for
growth in trading partners. In 2011–13, the forecast
errors for both domestic and partner-country growth
were typically negative and positively correlated, with
a 1 percentage point forecast error in trading partners’
growth associated, on average, with a domestic growth
forecast error of some 0.9 percentage point. However,
growth forecast errors for trading partners explain only
a small fraction of the variance in forecast errors for
domestic growth.

Serial prediction errors?
Was growth systematically overpredicted in the
same countries? The scatter plot in Figure 1.2.3, based

relatively small.4

Summary
In sum, the analysis in this box shows that much of
the overprediction in global growth for 2011–14 can
be traced to a relatively small number of economies,
accounting for some 43 percent of world GDP in
purchasing-power-parity terms. These include the four

largest emerging markets (the BRICs), a few stressed
economies in the Middle East and the euro area,
Japan, and some Asian advanced economies. The contribution of the remaining advanced economies as well
as other emerging market and developing economies
to global growth disappointments has been generally
small. Growth forecast errors for advanced economies
were concentrated in 2011–12 and have been, on average, much smaller than the size of errors for emerging
market and developing economies. There has been a
general tendency toward repeated overprediction of
growth, as reflected in positive serial correlation in
forecast errors. But the magnitude of serial correlation
seems relatively small in general.
How should these results be interpreted? A plausible
explanation is that in some economies, particularly
the BRICs, there has been a gradual downward revi-

East and to some extent for Russia, growth revisions also represent new shocks related to geopolitical
tensions. For advanced economies, growth forecasts
for 2011–12 underpredicted the severity of the euro

revisions to growth in Japan following the 2011 earthquake—have clearly played some role.

COUNTRY AND REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

After a slowdown in the first half of 2014, global growth
is forecast to strengthen to 3.5 percent in the second half of
2014 and 3.8 percent in 2015. But growth is uneven and
still weak overall and remains susceptible to many downside risks. Production disruptions or sharply higher global
oil prices—due to geopolitical tensions—would reduce
global growth, as would an unexpected tightening in
financial conditions owing to higher-than-expected U.S.
long-term interest rates or increased risk aversion. Over
the medium term, protracted weak demand in advanced
economies could result in lower growth everywhere,
including, in part, through negative supply-side effects.

G

lobal growth slowed more than expected
from an annualized rate of 3.9 percent in
the second half of 2013 to 2.7 percent in
the first half of 2014. Although the downside surprise was mainly owing to temporary factors,
particularly for the U.S. economy, it also reflected a
weaker recovery in the euro area, as the region continued to overcome the legacies of the crisis, and in Japan,
where the negative effects on demand of the consumption tax increase were greater than previously expected.
Among emerging market and developing economies,
growth in China picked up in the second quarter,
responding to the measures deployed to boost activity after a weaker-than-expected first-quarter outturn.
However, domestic demand remained weak in a few
major economies, notably in Latin America. Geopolitical tensions related to the Russia-Ukraine situation and
the Middle East dampened activity in those regions,
but with limited broader spillovers so far.
Against this backdrop, advanced economies are
expected to continue a slow recovery, with growth rising to 1.8 percent this year and to 2.3 percent in 2015
(Figure 2.1, panel 1). Growth in emerging market and
developing economies will slow to 4.4 percent in 2014,
before rising to 5.0 percent in 2015. The forecast is
weaker than projected in the April 2014 World Economic Outlook (WEO), reflecting the negative growth
surprises in the first half of the year, a more subdued
pace of domestic demand growth in some emerging

markets, and stronger adverse effects of geopolitical
tensions. Notwithstanding the recovery, growth is weak
overall, and medium-term growth prospects have been
marked down for many economies in the past several
WEO reports (see Figure 1.15).
Downside risks to the forecast remain relevant. As
elaborated in Chapter 1, escalation in geopolitical tensions is an immediate risk, as it could lead to sharply
higher oil prices. This chapter’s Spillover Feature finds
that the consequences of a rise in the U.S. long-term
interest rate depend on the drivers of the increase—for
example, stronger U.S. growth versus tighter U.S.
monetary policy due to higher-than-expected inflation—as well as on recipient countries’ economic
conditions and characteristics. And a protracted weak
recovery in advanced economies would result in slower
medium-term growth everywhere through weaker trade
and productivity spillovers (Figure 2.1, panel 2). Thus,
for more robust growth, many countries need policies
to lift actual growth to its potential level and measures
to raise potential growth itself.

The United States and Canada: Recovery to
Continue after Temporary Setback
Growth is now stronger in the United States and
Canada after a slowdown in the first quarter of 2014.
However, many downside risks, from both domestic and
external sources, remain relevant. In the United States,
monetary policy normalization should be gradual to
sustain the recovery and avert negative domestic or global
spillovers. Medium-term growth should be strengthened by
upgrading infrastructure and human capital. In Canada,
stronger exports and business investment are expected to
translate into more balanced growth, but housing market
risks should continue to be closely monitored.
After a temporary setback in the first quarter of
2014, the U.S. economy has rebounded. Temporary
constraints—an unusually harsh winter and a sharp
correction to an earlier inventory buildup—have now
receded. Growth reached an annualized 4.2 percent in

In the United States, the recovery is ﬁrming after a brief slowdown in the ﬁrst
quarter of 2014, as improvements in labor markets continue and private
investment picks up. Wage and price pressures, however, remain subdued.
Canada’s growth also slowed in the ﬁrst quarter but has since rebounded strongly,
with exports beneﬁting from the U.S. recovery and a weaker currency, while
housing market risks call for continued vigilance.

the second quarter.1 Improving housing activity, stronger nonresidential investment, and steady payroll gains
suggest that the rebound is becoming more sustainable
(Figure 2.2). The unemployment and labor participation rates stood at 6.1 percent and 62.8 percent,
respectively, in August.
Despite the recovery, price pressures remain
contained, with consumer price index inflation at
1.7 percent in August and core personal consumption
expenditure inflation—the Federal Reserve’s preferred
measure of underlying inflation—at 1.5 percent in
August. Price increases reflect higher energy and food
costs, although increasing housing costs (rents and
owner-equivalent rental costs) and the waning of the
sequester-related compression of health care costs have
also been factors in price conditions. Real wages have
been flat, given still-substantial slack in the labor market.
At about 3 percent, growth is projected to remain
above potential for the rest of the year and into 2015.
The strength is underpinned by an improving labor
market, better household balance sheets, favorable
financial conditions, a healthier housing market as
household formation gradually returns to levels that are
more closely aligned with demographic factors, higher
nonresidential investment as firms finally upgrade
aging capital stock, and a smaller fiscal drag.
However, medium-term prospects are generally
subdued. Under current policies, potential growth is
estimated at only about 2 percent, weighed down by
population aging and lower productivity growth compared with that in previous decades.
The risks to the outlook are broadly balanced. On
the downside, an unexpected rise in inflation due to
lower-than-expected economic slack could increase interest rates more sharply or more quickly than currently
expected. Or there could be a disorderly unwinding of
the recent compression of volatility and term premiums
in financial markets. Uncertainty about fiscal policy
and associated political brinkmanship could return in
early 2015. External risks include a sharper slowdown in
emerging markets, including China, and sharply higher
oil prices, given geopolitical tensions. On the upside,
the nascent improvement in private investment could
continue, boosting confidence regarding future economic
prospects and raising growth. Further improvements in

mortgage credit availability for relatively lower-rated borrowers could stimulate a faster housing market recovery.
Policies should be geared toward keeping the recovery
on course and achieving increased long-term growth.
Monetary policy should manage the exit from zero
interest rates in a manner that allows the economy to
converge smoothly to full employment with stable prices
while containing risks to financial instability, which, if
they materialized, could have negative global spillovers.
Financial stability concerns arising from a prolonged
period of very low interest rates should be addressed
with tightened supervision, stronger prudential norms,
and strengthening of the macroprudential framework.
Forging agreement on a credible medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan is a high priority, with steps to lower
the growth of health care costs, reform social security,
and increase revenues. Identifying specific measures
for fiscal savings in future years would help relax the
near-term budget envelope and allow increased funding
for efforts aimed at raising labor force participation,
encouraging innovation, strengthening productivity,
and tackling poverty and long-term unemployment.
Supply-side measures to raise potential growth through
stepped-up infrastructure investments, better educational outcomes, improvements to the tax structure,
and development of a skilled labor force, including
through immigration reform, should also be considered.
Canada’s growth slowed in the first quarter of 2014
but has since rebounded. The economy is expected to
grow at 2.3 percent and 2.4 percent in 2014 and 2015,
respectively (Table 2.1, Figure 2.1). Exports should

48

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

benefit from the U.S. recovery and a weaker currency,
which in turn would stimulate investment. However,
more protracted weakness in external demand could
hamper the momentum in exports and investment,
while high household debt and a still-overvalued housing market remain important domestic vulnerabilities.
The slack in the economy, well-anchored inflation
expectations, and downside risks to the outlook imply
that the current accommodative monetary policy remains
appropriate. Fiscal consolidation, while exerting only a
modest drag on near-term growth, needs to proceed at
the provincial level, where fiscal room is limited. Domestic vulnerabilities associated with the housing market and
the household sector call for continued vigilance and may
require additional macroprudential measures.

Europe
Advanced Europe: At Different Stages of Recovery
Advanced Europe is experiencing a multispeed recovery.
Growth is still weak in the euro area, with lingering
risks of more protracted low growth and low inflation.
Elsewhere in Europe, housing market risks are emerging
in some advanced economies. In the euro area, the priority is to strengthen the recovery, raise inflation, and lift
medium-term growth through a mix of accommodative
monetary policy, strengthening bank and corporate balance sheets, completing the banking union, and implementing structural reforms. Advanced European economies
outside the euro area should mitigate financial sector
vulnerabilities from the housing market.

CHAPTER 2

Figure 2.3. Advanced Europe: At Different Stages of Recovery
Financial markets remain generally resilient as a fragile recovery gets under way in
the euro area. However, inﬂation remains low, reﬂecting large output gaps for most
euro area countries. Stubbornly high unemployment rates, large debt, and
persistent ﬁnancial fragmentation continue to provide headwinds to growth.
Current account balances have improved, but with persistent surpluses in creditor
economies.

Advanced Europe has begun to recover, but the
recovery is still slow and tentative in the euro area.
The euro area stagnated in the second quarter of
2014, with investment surprising on the downside
in several large economies. Financial markets have
remained resilient, with spreads at precrisis lows and
lower bank funding costs. However, the legacies of
the crisis—inadequate demand, high debt, and unemployment—continue to pose challenges to robust and
sustained growth:
•• Output and investment remain well below precrisis
levels. Growth is weak and uneven across countries.
•• Low inflation—well below the European Central
Bank’s (ECB’s) price stability objective—is ubiquitous, reflecting persistent slack. Inflation expectations have declined.
•• Balance sheets remain impaired, partly because of
high debt and unemployment. Financial fragmentation persists, and firms in stressed economies face
borrowing constraints. The ECB’s comprehensive
assessment is prompting banks to strengthen balance
sheets, but this effort is still a work in progress.
•• Notwithstanding progress on reforms, deep-seated
obstacles to productivity and competitiveness
remain. Moreover, the adjustment of relative prices
and external imbalances has been asymmetric, with
persistent current account surpluses in creditor
countries.
The outlook is for a modest recovery and subdued
inflation. Growth—predicated on continued improvements in lending conditions and resilient external
demand—is expected to average about 0.8 percent
in 2014 and 1.3 percent in 2015. The forecast is
weaker for both years compared with the April 2014
WEO (Figure 2.3). Over the medium term, growth
is expected to hover around 1½ percent. Within
this weak outlook, prospects are uneven across the
region—stronger in Germany and Spain, weaker in
France and Italy. Inflation will average about 0.5 percent in 2014 and is expected to remain well below
the ECB’s medium-term price stability objective in
the foreseeable future owing to persistent slack over
the medium term.
Growth is stronger in other advanced European
economies (Table 2.2), but not without concerns:
•• The United Kingdom’s economy is expected to
continue to grow strongly. Demand is becoming
more balanced, with stronger business investment.
But despite rapid employment growth, some slack

growth has been low. Inflation remains below the 2

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

•• The outlook in Sweden is for rising growth, driven
by strong household demand and investment. Inflation is low, in part because of increasing services
sector productivity. However, higher unemployment
among vulnerable groups, especially at the lower end
of the wage distribution, is a concern.

CHAPTER 2

•• Growth is expected to continue in Switzerland,
although at a more modest pace, reflecting the
recent softening in consumption and construction
investment. Inflation is forecast to remain close to
zero. Medium-term challenges include an aging
population.
For the euro area, risks surrounding the growth
projection are tilted to the downside. Specifically, the
risk of protracted slow growth and persistently low
inflation is high. And should the risk materialize, the
effects would reverberate throughout Europe. There are
also risks associated with reform fatigue and largerthan-expected bank recapitalization needs. Elsewhere
in Europe, including in the United Kingdom, risks
are more balanced. However, the United Kingdom, as
well as Sweden and Switzerland, faces financial stability
risks arising from housing and mortgage markets. For
the entire region, negative external developments—
such as lower growth in trading partners, an abrupt
tightening of global financial conditions, and economic
disruptions and sharply higher oil prices owing to
geopolitical reasons, including from the Russia-Ukraine
situation—are another major source of risk.
Policy efforts should focus on strengthening the
recovery while ensuring financial stability. In this context, monetary and fiscal policies need to respond to
divergent growth and inflation prospects:
•• For the euro area, the priority is to achieve strong
above-trend growth and raise inflation, implying
maintenance of accommodative monetary policy.
Despite strong actions already taken in June and
September of this year, if the inflation outlook
does not improve and inflation expectations fail to
increase, the ECB should be willing to do more,
including the purchase of sovereign assets. Fiscal policy, which is only slightly contractionary in
2014–15 for the euro area as a whole, should not
be tightened further in the event of negative growth
surprises. Over the medium term, public debt in
some countries needs to be reduced to more sustainable levels. For Germany, there remains a strong case
for an increase in public investment, for example,
for the upgrade and maintenance of transportation
infrastructure.
•• In the United Kingdom, given weak price and wage
pressures, monetary policy should stay accommodative for now, but it may need to be tightened
quickly if inflation rises. Interest rate increases could
also be considered if macroprudential tools prove

COUNTRY AND REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

insufficient to contain financial stability risks (see
next paragraph), with careful consideration given to
the trade-off between damage to the real economy
and the ultimate costs of financial vulnerabilities.
This also holds for Sweden, where, absent effective
action to reduce financial stability concerns, monetary policy will have to continue to balance price
and financial stability risks. Large medium-term
and contingent liabilities related to Sweden’s large
financial sector call for fiscal consolidation.
Stronger private sector balance sheets and financial
sector reforms are needed to foster financial stability. In the euro area, bank recapitalization, lower
corporate debt (in part through improved national
solvency frameworks), and an effective common fiscal backstop to complete the banking union would
help reduce financial fragmentation and restart credit
flows. Financial sector vulnerabilities should be
tackled in other advanced European economies: this
implies continued strengthening of bank capital, but
also effective and/or tighter macroprudential measures
(Sweden, Switzerland). Macroprudential tightening may also be needed in the United Kingdom if
recent measures prove insufficient to contain financial
stability risks. The financial sector reform agenda
in advanced Europe should be completed, including with respect to reforms dealing with large and
systemically important banks and those to enhance
cross-border resolution mechanisms.
Structural reforms are key to meeting mediumterm challenges to growth. Greater labor and product
market flexibility in debtor economies and higher
infrastructure and private investment in creditor
economies would raise productivity, employment, and
growth and would also support greater rebalancing in
the euro area. Lower hiring costs and more effective
training programs would help reduce high youth
unemployment rates. Capital markets need to be
developed to fund small and medium firms. Longerterm challenges include simplifying the region’s
complicated fiscal framework and strengthening its
enforcement. In Sweden and the United Kingdom,
housing supply-side measures are crucial to safeguard
housing affordability and mitigate financial stability
risks. Labor market reforms would accelerate and sustain the transition of vulnerable groups into employment in Sweden. In Switzerland, the r­ esolution of
uncertainty related to future immigration policy
would support growth.

Prospects remain uneven in emerging and developing Europe, with strong growth
and improving employment in Hungary and Poland, but continued weakness in
southeastern Europe. Financial conditions are still broadly supportive, but credit
growth remains weak except in Turkey.

Growth in emerging and developing Europe is also
uneven, although domestic demand is strengthening
in many countries in the region. With downside risks
remaining, monetary and exchange rate policies should be
used to support demand and manage the risks from market volatility, while fiscal policy should focus on rebuilding buffers. Enhancing debt resolution frameworks and
advancing labor market reforms remain priorities for most
countries in the region.

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

Economic recovery in emerging and developing
Europe continued to be uneven, with growth remaining strong or accelerating in Hungary, Poland, and
Turkey in 2013 and into the first half of 2014, but
slowing in southeastern Europe. Financial market
developments were also mixed although still broadly
supportive (Figure 2.4). Corporate sector credit
remained weak outside Turkey, partly reflecting the
burden on the financial system from high levels of
nonperforming loans. The region has thus far been
resilient to the geopolitical tensions in Russia and
Ukraine.
Inflation declined in most economies in the region,
reflecting lower food and energy prices, as well as
disinflation pressure from the euro area, particularly
for economies that peg their currencies to the euro.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Montenegro fell into deflation with persistent economic
slack.
Growth is forecast to reach 2.7 percent in 2014 and
2.9 percent in 2015. The forecast entails an upward
revision to growth in 2014 of 0.4 percentage point
relative to the April 2014 WEO projections, mainly
reflecting the stronger-than-expected outturn so far this
year in some economies, and is unchanged for 2015.2
•• Growth in Hungary and Poland is projected to rise,
reaching 2.8 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively, in
2014, supported by rising investment and declining
unemployment in Poland and significant monetary
easing and higher public spending in Hungary. In
2015, growth will average 3.3 percent in Poland but
slow to 2.3 percent in Hungary with the projected
tightening in fiscal and monetary conditions.
2Note that the global and regional growth rates reported in
the April 2014 WEO have been recalculated using the revised
purchasing-power-parity weights (see note 1 of Chapter 1) to make
them comparable to the figures in the current WEO report.

CHAPTER 2

•• Turkey’s growth is expected to average 3 percent in
2014–15, down from 4 percent in 2013. In 2014,
private consumption is projected to moderate, and
government spending and investment will be the
main drivers of growth, although net exports will
also contribute. In 2015, growth will rotate toward
private consumption and investment owing to the
lagged effect of recent monetary easing.
•• Southeastern Europe is projected to experience slower
growth in 2014, in part because of severe floods in
May that particularly affected Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, before picking up in 2015 on
reconstruction spending, rebuilding of flood-damaged
areas, and in some countries, employment growth.
Inflation is expected to average about 3.8–4.0 percent during 2014–15. However, in a number of
economies, inflation is likely to be much lower either
because of imported disinflation (Bulgaria) or persistent economic slack (Croatia). In Turkey, inflation
projections have been revised upward as a result of
high food prices, the lagged effects of exchange rate
depreciation, and a monetary policy stance that is
inconsistent with the authorities’ inflation target.
A return of market turbulence and a weaker euro area
recovery continue to be the main risks to the outlook.
Given the large stock of external private debt in many
countries, as well as significant foreign-exchange-linked
domestic debt in some, the region is also susceptible to
other adverse shocks. These risks are somewhat mitigated by recent ECB policy actions to ease monetary
conditions further, which could raise confidence and
domestic demand more than currently expected.
As the recovery continues, and with most countries set to pursue fiscal consolidation to rebuild fiscal
balances that deteriorated during the global crisis,
monetary and exchange rate policies should be used
flexibly—at different rates given differences in policy
space and underlying vulnerabilities—to respond to
changing market and economic conditions.
Enhancing private sector debt resolution frameworks, including through voluntary debt restructuring,
would help tackle high levels of nonperforming loans
and support credit growth. Reforming labor markets
by reducing redundancy payments and addressing
duality, enhancing the business climate, and improving competitiveness is crucial for many countries to
increase potential growth. For Turkey, policies should
aim to reestablish a nominal anchor and tighten the
fiscal stance while promoting national saving and
competitiveness.

COUNTRY AND REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

Asia and Pacific: Steady Growth Ahead
The region’s growth cooled somewhat in early 2014
but is now broadly on track for a rebound in the second
half of the year. Growth will be driven by a bounce back
in domestic demand, and for some, by stronger external
demand. Downside risks stem from a sharp tightening
in global financial conditions, as well as from protracted
weak growth in advanced economies. A homegrown concern arises from a sharp slowdown in the real estate sector,
especially in China. Under the baseline projections, fiscal
consolidation should proceed gradually, and monetary
tightening should start or continue where slack is negligible and inflation is high or rising. Structural reforms
remain crucial for raising medium-term growth.
Growth slowed across most of the Asia and Pacific
region in the first quarter of 2014 as export growth
declined and domestic demand cooled in China
(Figure 2.5). For some countries, the slowdown also
reflected idiosyncratic factors (for example, political
tensions in Thailand). However, activity picked up in
most of the region’s economies in the second quarter,
including in China, on new measures to support activity. In India, growth increased in the second quarter
on rising business confidence and stronger manufacturing activity since the election. Japan experienced a
strong first-quarter growth outturn—reflecting, mostly,
a stronger-than-expected rise in consumption ahead
of the consumption tax hike—offset, however, by a
somewhat sharper-than-envisaged slowdown in the
second quarter, again driven by a sharp contraction in
consumption.
Financial conditions have remained broadly supportive across the region, with strong credit growth, rising
equity and bond fund flows in the second quarter of
2014, and stronger asset prices—reaching all-time
highs in some cases.
The region’s near-term outlook remains strong,
predicated on a continuing global recovery. Growth
is forecast to remain at 5.5 percent in 2014, rising to
5.6 percent in 2015—slightly weaker for both years
compared with the April 2014 WEO forecast (Table
2.3). The downward revisions partly reflect the weaker
first-quarter outturn. Growth is expected to be driven
by domestic demand, given still-favorable financial
conditions and healthy labor markets, but export
growth is also expected to remain strong given the projected rebound in advanced economies and China. The
macroeconomic policy stance across most economies is

Figure 2.5. Asia and Paciﬁc: Steady Growth Ahead
Growth momentum cooled in early 2014 in the Asia and Paciﬁc region, but recent
data point to a rebound in the second half of the year. Exports should pick up on
the back of stronger demand from advanced economies. Domestic demand is also
expected to remain robust, helped by favorable ﬁnancial conditions, healthy labor
markets, and broadly accommodative policies.

also expected to remain broadly supportive. Inflation is
forecast to remain generally low and stable.
•• In China, growth will remain strong at 7.4 percent
in 2014 on recent measures—higher infrastructure
spending, support for small and medium enterprises,
and social housing—and improved net exports.
Growth is projected to moderate to a more sustainable rate of 7.1 percent in 2015 as slower credit
growth through both the banking and nonbanking
sectors slows investment and the moderation in real
estate sector activity continues.
•• In Japan, the sharp economic contraction in the
second quarter induced by the consumption tax
increase is expected to be short lived, with a moderate pace of recovery returning thereafter. GDP
growth for 2014–15 is projected to average about
0.8–0.9 percent.
•• Growth in India is expected to rise to 5.6 percent in
2014 and pick up further to 6.4 percent in 2015 as
both exports and investment increase.
•• Growth in Australia, Korea, and New Zealand is
expected to be driven mainly by exports. In Korea,
growth should rise from 3.7 percent this year to
4.0 percent in 2015, led by exports and investment.
Australia’s growth is forecast at 2.8–2.9 percent in
2014–15, with a pickup in exports offsetting waning mining investment. New Zealand is expected
to benefit from reconstruction spending and export
recovery, with average growth above 3 percent in
2014–15.
•• The Association of Southeast Asian Nations–5
(ASEAN-5) economies are expected to grow steadily,
except Thailand, where a sharp slowdown driven by
political tensions this year should be followed by a
rebound next year. Growth in Indonesia is expected
to pick up moderately in 2015 owing to improved
investor sentiment in the postelection period. Growth
in Malaysia and the Philippines is forecast to remain
strong in 2014–15, helped by favorable external
demand and broadly accommodative policies and
financial conditions.
•• For the rest of developing Asia, growth should remain
broadly robust, despite rising vulnerabilities associated
with high fiscal and current account deficits in some
countries. Given their relatively limited exposure to
global financial markets, these economies were less
affected by last year’s tightening in financial conditions and are expected to benefit from stronger global
and regional growth via stronger trade, remittances,

and tourism. However, the small states of the Pacific
will continue to underperform as a result of infrastructure gaps and competitiveness issues.
Inflation in the region is expected to remain stable
at 3.7 percent during 2014–15, but with important
differences across economies. In Japan, underlying
inflation, excluding the effects of the consumption
tax increase, has been rising. Medium-term inflation expectations have also been rising, although they
remain below the Bank of Japan’s 2 percent target.
In India, with recent monetary tightening, disinflation should continue, but inflation overall will remain
high at 7.8 percent in 2014, declining slightly to 7.5
percent in 2015. Inflation will also pick up in a few
economies in which subsidy or tax reform is expected
to be implemented or in which output is estimated to
be above potential (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines).

The immediate risks to the outlook stem from a
sharp tightening of global financial conditions—triggered, for instance, by greater volatility induced by
U.S. monetary policy normalization or a spike in
global risk aversion—which could lead to capital
outflows, asset price declines, and higher domestic
interest rates. This risk is more elevated in countries
that depend to a greater extent on external financing (India, Indonesia) and in economies with a large
foreign investment presence in domestic financial
markets (Indonesia). In some economies, an additional
risk stems from a sharp decline in house prices and
housing activity (China, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore)
or relates to elevated household leverage (Australia,
Korea, Malaysia). Sharply higher oil prices due to an
escalation of geopolitical tensions would also affect
economic activity in the region.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: LEGACIES, CLOUDS, UNCERTAINTIES

Over the medium term, in addition to risks of spillovers from prolonged low growth in advanced economies, emerging Asia’s potential growth, which has
declined in the last few years, could weaken further,
particularly if reform implementation is delayed.
Rebuilding policy space and implementing structural reforms for sustainable and stronger growth
remain key policy priorities. With respect to fiscal
policy, although policy space varies across the region
and automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate, fiscal consolidation is desirable across most of Asia
and the Pacific. It is a priority where debt levels are
relatively higher (Japan) or where there are contingent
fiscal liabilities (Malaysia).
Under the baseline projections, monetary normalization should also proceed gradually in most of the
region’s economies, given that slack is negligible and
in some cases inflation is still high (India) or expected
to rise (Malaysia, Philippines). China needs to further
bring down credit growth and local government borrowing to address financial stability risks while allowing the economy to transition to a slower and more
sustainable pace of growth. As highlighted in the April
2014 Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and Pacific, macroprudential policies have been generally effective in
containing financial stability risks and should remain
part of the toolkit. Exchange rate flexibility should be
the main shock absorber, but foreign exchange intervention can also help smooth volatility and address
disorderly market conditions.
Structural reforms should continue to aim at lowering near-term vulnerabilities and bolstering mediumterm growth. The agenda varies across the region
but includes financial sector, state-owned enterprise,
and local government reforms (China); fiscal reforms
(India, Japan); banking sector reforms (Mongolia,
Vietnam); product and labor market reforms (Japan,
Korea); and improvement of investment conditions
(India).

Latin America and the Caribbean: Still Losing
Speed
Growth declined further in early 2014 across the
region, reflecting a slowdown in external demand as well
as weaker domestic momentum. A modest recovery is
projected for 2015, yet risks remain tilted to the downside
as many economies struggle to find new engines of sustainable growth in an environment of stagnant commodity
prices and more binding supply bottlenecks. This situation
56

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

heightens the importance of preserving macroeconomic
stability and implementing structural reforms to raise
investment and productivity.
Growth in Latin America and the Caribbean continued to slow in early 2014, with data coming in even
weaker than expected. External conditions played a
role, as exports fell short of expectations in early 2014,
and terms of trade deteriorated for some countries
(Figure 2.6). However, domestic factors were also
important in several economies as supply bottlenecks
and policy uncertainty held back business confidence
and investment. The resulting slowdown has increasingly spread to consumer spending amid signs that
labor markets—although still quite tight—are starting
to soften.
Overall, financial conditions are still supportive,
with continued gains in equity prices and a narrowing
of sovereign spreads since the beginning of the year,
which have helped to reverse most of the financial
market losses suffered after the mid-2013 turmoil.
Domestic interest rates have also eased in most economies since April, but credit growth has continued to
slow, notably in Brazil.
Growth in the region is expected to average 1.3
percent for 2014, the lowest rate since 2009 and
1.2 percentage points below the April 2014 WEO
projection (Table 2.4). The downward revision partly
reflects weaker-than-expected growth outturns for the
first half of the year and domestic demand growth
that is now expected to be slower than previously
projected. Regional growth will pick up to 2.2 percent
in 2015—again 0.7 percentage point weaker than
previously projected—supported by improving exports
and a recovery in investment. In particular, supply-side
reforms undertaken by some countries, like Mexico,
should start to pay off as an initial wait-and-see
attitude among businesses gives way to higher capital
spending.
•• In Brazil, output contracted during the first half of
the year. Full-year growth in 2014 is now projected
at 0.3 percent. Weak competitiveness, low business
confidence, and tighter financial conditions (with
interest rate hikes through April 2014) have constrained investment, and the ongoing moderation in
employment and credit growth has been weighing
on consumption. A moderate pickup in activity is
expected for 2015, with growth rising to 1.4 percent
as the political uncertainty surrounding this year’s
presidential election dissipates. Inflation is expected to

CHAPTER 2

remain in the upper part of the target range, reflecting inflation persistence, binding supply constraints,
and pent-up pressure from administered prices.
• Mexico’s economy is gathering pace, although not
fast enough to offset fully the weakness in early
2014 that was driven by lower external demand and
slower-than-expected construction activity. Growth
is projected to average 2.4 percent in 2014 and reach
3.5 percent in 2015, helped by a firmer U.S. recovery,
a rebound in domestic construction activity, and the
gradual dividends from the ongoing reform of the
energy and telecommunications sectors.
• Sluggish growth in investment and durables consumption has resulted in an unexpected sharp slowdown in Chile and Peru this year. In Chile, recent
monetary and fiscal easing and a weaker exchange
rate should support a modest rebound. Peru’s
prospects should also improve as the impact of a
temporary decline in metal production tapers off
and supportive recent policy measures take effect. In
Colombia, growth is expected to remain solid, led
by strong construction activity.
• Argentina is projected to remain in recession in
2014–15, amid rising macroeconomic imbalances
and uncertainties related to the lingering standoff
with holdout creditors. Inflation remains elevated,
and the gap between the official and the informal
exchange rates has been widening again in recent
months. In Venezuela, severe policy distortions
are expected to continue to constrain production,
resulting in a sharp drop in activity and an inflation rate that now exceeds 60 percent.
• Growth in Central America is projected to slow
slightly to 3.8–3.9 percent in 2014–15 as countryspecific domestic factors—including the closing of a
large plant funded through foreign direct investment,
which will affect export growth in Costa Rica—offset
the positive effects from stronger U.S. activity.
• In the Caribbean, long-standing competitiveness
problems, high public debt, and significant financial
fragilities will result in low growth in much of the
region.
Around this subdued outlook, risks remain tilted
somewhat to the downside. Activity in the region’s
commodity exporters might weaken with negative
external demand shocks, such as a sharper-thanexpected investment slowdown in China. An abrupt
rise in U.S. interest rates could prompt a replay of
the mid-2013 financial turmoil, which would tighten
financial conditions and depress confidence further.

COUNTRY AND REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

Figure 2.6. Latin America and the Caribbean: Still Losing
Speed
Economic activity across Latin America and the Caribbean has continued to slow,
reﬂecting less supportive external conditions and domestic policy uncertainties.
Even so, spare capacity remains limited, as evidenced by above-target inﬂation,
still-tight labor markets, and persistent external current account deﬁcits.
Meanwhile, ﬁnancial markets have recovered from their January 2014 trough but
remain vulnerable to new shocks.

5The data for Argentina are officially reported data as revised in May 2014. On February 1, 2013, the IMF issued a declaration of censure, and in December 2013 called on Argentina
to implement specified actions to address the quality of its official GDP data according to a specified timetable. On June 6, 2014, the Executive Board recognized the implementation
of the specified actions it had called for by end-March 2014 and the initial steps taken by the Argentine authorities to remedy the inaccurate provision of data. The Executive Board will
review this issue again as per the calendar specified in December 2013 and in line with the procedures set forth in the Fund’s legal framework.
6Consumer price data from January 2014 onwards reflect the new national CPI (IPCNu), which differs substantively from the preceding CPI (the CPI for the Greater Buenos Aires
Area, CPI-GBA). Because of the differences in geographical coverage, weights, sampling, and methodology, the IPCNu data cannot be directly compared to the earlier CPI-GBA data.
Because of this structural break in the data, staff forecasts for CPI inflation are not reported in the Fall 2014 World Economic Outlook. Following a declaration of censure by the IMF
on February 1, 2013, the public release of a new national CPI by end-March 2014 was one of the specified actions in the IMF Executive Board’s December 2013 decision calling on
Argentina to address the quality of its official CPI data. On June 6, 2014, the Executive Board recognized the implementation of the specified actions it had called for by end-March
2014 and the initial steps taken by the Argentine authorities to remedy the inaccurate provision of data. The Executive Board will review this issue again as per the calendar specified
in December 2013 and in line with the procedures set forth in the Fund’s legal framework.

A sharp rise in oil prices would have an overall negative effect on the region’s growth, despite benefiting a
small number of net hydrocarbon exporters (notably
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela). Higher
fuel prices could also intensify inflation or budgetary pressures (owing to large subsidies in some cases).
Some Caribbean and Central American economies are
particularly exposed, given large oil import needs and
already-weak fiscal and external positions.
Over the medium term, another key risk for some
economies in the region is a potential continuation
58

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

of weak investment if underlying competitiveness and
structural issues are not adequately addressed. The
effects on growth would be compounded by a prolonged stagnation in advanced economies.
The priority across most of the region is to maintain macroeconomic stability while stepping up efforts
to boost potential growth. Still-tight labor markets,
above-target inflation, and persistent current account
deficits all point to limited resource slack. This situation argues against considering further fiscal expansion,
notably in countries with weak public finances. Achiev-

CHAPTER 2

ing the targets set under existing fiscal frameworks
through high-quality measures is critical to preserving
the credibility of those frameworks, avoiding a further
erosion of fiscal positions, and supporting disinflation.
Monetary policy, in turn, should be used to manage
short-term fluctuations in growth. However, several
central banks are currently facing a challenging combination of slowing growth and persistent price pressures,
implying limited room to ease. Exchange rate flexibility remains essential not only to facilitate external
adjustment, but also to discourage one-sided currency
bets. Financial regulators should monitor private sector
vulnerabilities closely and tighten prudential standards
as necessary.
Structural reforms, to raise growth and its inclusiveness, should focus on creating the conditions for
higher productivity and capital spending, including
by addressing shortcomings in educational outcomes,
infrastructure provision, and the business environment.
Without such reforms, growth could well continue to
disappoint relative to the high expectations created by
the past decade and put at risk the important social
advances the region has achieved.

Commonwealth of Independent States: Coping

The European CIS economies weakened sharply
in the first half of 2014 (Figure 2.7). Investment
dropped in Russia, where geopolitical tensions have
further weakened already-subdued business confidence.
Ukraine’s crisis deepened further, with output contraction driven by falling industrial production and
exports. Some economies in the Caucasus and Central
Asia (CCA) slowed with weaker trade and remittance
flows, given their economic ties to Russia.
Weaker activity has also reflected a worsening in
financial conditions in the region: capital outflows
intensified in Russia in the first half of 2014, putting
pressure on the exchange rate and resulting in higher
inflation, which induced policy rate hikes by the

central bank. Since February of this year, Ukraine has
experienced official reserve losses and exchange rate
depreciation. With significant deposit withdrawals and
loan quality deterioration, financial sector stress has
risen. The depreciation of the Russian ruble has also
exerted exchange rate pressure on the Kyrgyz Republic
and Tajikistan, whereas in Kazakhstan, the currency
was preemptively devalued.
Growth is projected to decline from 2.2 percent
in 2013 to 0.8 percent this year, before recovering to
1.6 percent in 2015 as geopolitical tensions subside
(Table 2.5). The forecast is significantly weaker for
both years, compared with that in the April 2014
WEO, reflecting the ongoing crises and regional
spillovers given Russia’s role as a key regional trading

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

•• Russia’s GDP is projected to remain flat in 2014
and recover modestly to grow by 0.5 percent in
2015 as investment contraction moderates and nonenergy exports strengthen.
•• In Ukraine, activity is projected to contract sharply this
year, reflecting production disruptions from the ongoing conflict and the difficult macroeconomic situation.
•• With weak external demand from Russia and
structural limitations, Belarus’s growth will remain
subdued. Growth will also be modest in Moldova,
owing to a slowdown in agriculture and spillovers
from weaker activity in its main trading partners
(European Union, Russia, Ukraine).
•• In the CCA’s oil and gas exporters, growth will
decline in 2014–15 as high energy prices, large
policy buffers, and diversified export markets
only partly offset the effects of Russia’s slowdown.
Growth will decline in Kazakhstan in 2014–15,
reflecting both weaker external demand and lower
investor confidence due to increased regional
tensions.

CHAPTER 2

•• Economic activity in most oil-importing economies
in the CCA (Armenia, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan)
will also slow, given their close remittance and trade
linkages with Russia and weakened investor sentiment, as well as relatively limited policy space.
Despite lower growth and declining food prices,
average inflation in the region is forecast to rise from
6.4 percent in 2013 to 7.9 percent in 2014, reflecting
pass-through from recent exchange rate depreciations.
In Russia, inflation will likely rise above the target;
in Belarus and Ukraine it is expected to exceed 10
percent. The February devaluation of the Kazakhstani
tenge is expected to raise inflation but maintain it
within the target range. In Uzbekistan, inflation will
likely remain in the double digits, given continuing increases in administered prices and nominal
depreciation.
Risks to growth are largely to the downside. An
escalation of geopolitical tensions between Russia
and Ukraine, resulting in a tightening of sanctions
against Russia, could entail a serious setback for
the region. Even without further escalation, prolonged uncertainty could erode confidence, accelerate capital outflows, put pressure on the exchange
rate, and further weaken investment and growth in
Russia, with adverse spillovers to the rest of the CIS
via lower imports, remittances, and foreign direct
investment.
With higher risks and worsening economic conditions, a key priority is to preserve macroeconomic
stability. For Russia, monetary and financial policies
should aim to anchor inflation expectations given
recent depreciation, while recent steps to increase
exchange rate flexibility should continue in order to
facilitate adjustment to shocks, including from oil
prices. Under an IMF-supported program, Ukraine
is implementing economic and structural reforms
to address long-standing structural weaknesses and
macroeconomic imbalances. For Belarus, policies to
halt wage increases and reduce directed lending and
foreign exchange intervention would help safeguard
macroeconomic stability. In Moldova, weaknesses in
the banking system need to be addressed to ensure
the stability of the financial sector.
In the CCA, monetary policies should be tightened
if inflation pressure persists. Although a pause in
fiscal consolidation is justifiable with slowing growth
prospects in some economies (Armenia, Kazakhstan),
gradual consolidation should be pursued over the
medium term to place public debt on a sustainable

COUNTRY AND REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

path. CCA economies also need structural reforms for
strong and inclusive medium-term growth, specifically through improving the business climate and
governance and increasing global and regional trade
integration.

The Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and
Pakistan: Fragile Recovery
Economic activity in the Middle East, North Africa,
Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP) region is projected
to pick up in 2014–15, but the recovery will remain
fragile. Political transitions in many countries and security
problems, including from the recently intensified conflict
in Iraq, pose downside risks. For many countries, fiscal
consolidation is needed to rebuild buffers against unexpected shocks and preserve wealth for future generations.
Achieving sustained, strong growth over the medium term
will require structural reforms.

Oil-Exporting Economies
Activity in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
economies accelerated slightly in the second half of
2013 and into 2014, driven by higher oil production
and government spending. By contrast, although the
Islamic Republic of Iran is showing signs of recovery,
the pace of activity deteriorated in the non-GCC oil
exporters, where security conditions remain challenging. The conflict in northern Iraq has started to affect
non-oil growth in that country. Although most oil
production is in the country’s south and oil output
levels have not been materially affected, the departure
of skilled personnel will limit Iraq’s ability to expand
or, possibly, even maintain oil production. Ongoing
political turmoil and security issues have disrupted oil
production in Libya and undermined oil production in
Yemen.
Average growth for the oil exporters is projected
to edge up from 2.2 percent in 2013 to 2.5 percent
in 2014 and to 3.9 percent in 2015. The forecast is
0.9 percentage point weaker for 2014–15, compared
with that in the April 2014 WEO (Table 2.6):
•• In the GCC countries, growth is projected to average about 4½ percent in 2014–15, with non-oil
GDP growing by 6 percent and oil GDP rising by
½ percent. The latter mostly reflects the accommodation of oil supply disruptions elsewhere in a
context of modest increases in global oil demand
and rising supply in North America.

•• In the non-GCC oil exporters, growth is forecast
to average only ¼ percent in 2014 given recent
political shocks and deteriorating security. Growth is
projected to recover to 3 percent in 2015, assuming a rebound in oil production in Iraq, Libya, and
Yemen. These assumptions are, however, subject to
significant uncertainty.
Inflation is expected to remain contained in most
countries, particularly in the GCC, in light of softening
global food prices and pegged exchange rates. Inflation
will remain high in many non-GCC countries, however,
reflecting production disruptions and other idiosyncratic
factors, such as a recent fuel price increase in Yemen.
The major risk to oil exporters arises from unexpected oil market developments. An immediate risk
relates to disruptions to oil production (relative to

62

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

baseline projections) owing to escalating geopolitical tensions, particularly in Iraq, Libya, and Yemen.
Activity in these countries could contract in response
to such disruptions, should they materialize. As discussed in Chapter 1, such disruptions could also lead
to higher oil prices and lower global growth, but they
could boost oil revenues for other oil exporters in the
region. There are also risks that oil prices could turn
out to be lower than expected because of increased oil
supply or lower demand. On the supply side, Libya’s
oil production could recover earlier than expected, the
sanctions-related restrictions on the Islamic Republic of Iran’s oil exports could be relaxed, or U.S. oil
output could continue to surprise on the upside. On
the demand side, energy demand in emerging markets
could be weaker if downside risks to activity in these

Oil-Importing Economies
Economic activity in the MENAP oil importers has
remained lackluster given deep-rooted inefficiencies
in economic structures, regional conflicts, and continued sociopolitical tensions. However, confidence has
begun to improve, and exports are picking up with
higher demand from trading partners. Some structural
reforms are slowly nurturing competitiveness and foreign direct investment through lower production costs.
Growth in MENAP oil importers is projected to rise
from 2.6 percent in 2014 to 3.7 percent in 2015—

Figure 2.8. The Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and
Pakistan: Fragile Recovery
Despite strong activity in the GCC economies, the recovery in the MENAP region as
a whole has been fragile, owing to ongoing political transitions and recently
intensiﬁed conﬂicts. Fiscal balances in oil exporters have weakened and are
projected to deteriorate over the near and medium term. In oil importers, external
and ﬁscal vulnerabilities remain signiﬁcant.

economies should materialize. Protracted stagnation
in advanced economies (see Figure 2.1) would have
similar effects.
A key priority for most oil-exporting economies in
the region is to shore up weakening fiscal balances,
which reflect stalled progress in withdrawing fiscal
stimulus implemented by the GCC countries during the Great Recession and oil production shocks in
the non-GCC countries. The overall fiscal balance is
projected to decline from 2 percent of GDP in 2014
to 1 percent in 2015. Fiscal surpluses are too low in
most GCC countries to enable them to save an equitable share of oil wealth for future generations and are
expected to vanish by 2017 (Figure 2.8). All non-GCC
oil exporters are running fiscal deficits despite reliance on nonrenewable resources as the main revenue
source. Fiscal consolidation is thus needed in most
oil-exporting countries in the region over the medium
term, to build buffers against future shocks and ensure
that future generations can also benefit from their
oil wealth. However, in some non-GCC countries,
the need for consolidation is more immediate, given
weaker fiscal positions after recent oil production
declines. Fiscal consolidation should importantly
include phasing out costly and inefficient energy
subsidies and replacing them with targeted social safety
nets, as well as raising non-oil revenue. These efforts
should be supported with strengthened budget processes to control spending.
Structural reforms can help diversify the region’s
economies away from oil, raise productivity, and
encourage firms in the region to expand into the
tradables sector. Continued effort is needed to promote
GCC nationals’ employment in the private sector.
Non-GCC countries urgently need to improve security
and the business environment.

broadly similar to the April 2014 WEO projections
for 2014, and 0.5 percentage point weaker for 2015.
Growth is expected to be driven by rising external
demand from Europe and the GCC countries and some
recovery in domestic demand as confidence improves
and political transitions evolve. However, growth is still
too weak to tackle persistently high unemployment,
especially among the young, and widespread socioeconomic inequities.
•• In Morocco, the ongoing implementation of structural reforms is beginning to bear fruit, and growth
is expected to pick up in 2015. Private investment
is expected to strengthen with increased confidence, rising tourism receipts, and stronger export
performance.
•• Growth is also strengthening in Pakistan, reflecting in part the positive effects of energy reforms,
although large fiscal and external vulnerabilities still
remain.
•• In Tunisia, progress in the political transition is leading to increased donor support. However, growth
remains timid, and rising external imbalances have
continued to put pressure on the exchange rate.
Important steps are being taken to reduce banking
sector fragilities, a key constraint on stronger and
more inclusive growth.
•• Egypt’s presidential election and substantial GCC
financing have restored some confidence and
stabilized growth. However, continued reforms and
additional external financing are critical to securing macroeconomic stability, generating inclusive
growth, and creating jobs.
•• In Jordan, recent reforms have stabilized growth and
macroeconomic balances, but prospects are weighed
down by adverse regional spillovers. Beyond the
crisis in Syria, spotty gas flows from Egypt have
required expensive alternative-energy imports. An
escalated conflict in Iraq could jeopardize trade and
confidence.
•• In Lebanon, the political impasse and spillovers
from the Syrian conflict have dampened confidence
and activity. The presence of a larger number of
refugees (one-quarter of the population) is affecting
security, fueling high unemployment and poverty,
and stressing already-weak public finances.
The recovery is vulnerable to setbacks in political
transitions and intensified social and security tensions,
including through their effects on oil prices, refugee
movements, and trade disruption. Lower-than-expected
growth in emerging markets, Europe, or the GCC
64

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

could slow tourism, exports, and remittances. Countries with limited exchange rate flexibility could face
higher domestic interest rates when global monetary
conditions tighten, although limited integration in
international capital markets provides some monetary
policy autonomy.
Structural reforms will help raise medium-term
growth, create jobs, and improve living standards and
equity. Business climate and governance reforms, better
access to finance, and greater trade integration (particularly in higher-value-added products) are critical to
lower firms’ operating costs and increase employment
opportunities. Labor market and education system
reforms will help raise human capital and productivity—for example, by better aligning education and
vocational training with private sector needs. Domestic
reform efforts can also be bolstered by the international
community through financing, access to key export
markets, technical assistance, and policy advice.
Macroeconomic and financial policies should support the growth- and job-enhancing policy agenda.
Fiscal consolidation is needed to instill confidence
and restore public debt sustainability over the
medium term. But it can be done at a measured pace,
where financing allows. The ongoing reorientation
of spending toward well-targeted social safety nets,
infrastructure, education, and health care—all key to
raising growth and jobs—could be supported through
enhanced implementation capacity and restrained
increases in spending on public sector wages. As
growth improves, equity and business confidence
can be boosted by broadening the tax base, increasing income tax progressivity, implementing subsidy
reforms, and expanding targeted social safety nets.

Sub-Saharan Africa: Maintaining Speed
Economic activity in sub-Saharan Africa has continued to grow robustly—on the back of supportive external
demand conditions and strong growth in public and private
investment—and the outlook is expected to remain favorable for the lion’s share of the region’s countries. However,
beyond the severe humanitarian implications, the ongoing
outbreak of the Ebola virus is exacting a heavy economic
toll in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Domestic risks
also include a rapid buildup of fiscal vulnerabilities in a
few countries and an intensification of security threats.
Those risks could be compounded if global financing
conditions were to tighten faster than anticipated and if
emerging markets should slow down markedly, especially

in countries that depend on private external financing
or on exports of natural resources. Consequently, for the
vast majority of countries, sustaining high growth to foster
employment creation and inclusive growth while preserving
macroeconomic stability remains the key consideration. In
the few countries where macroeconomic imbalances have
emerged, they need to be addressed.
Growth in sub-Saharan Africa was buoyant at 5.1
percent in 2013, and activity remained strong in the
first half of 2014. This was driven mainly by domestic demand, both from high investment outlays and
strong private consumption—especially in low-income
countries—but export growth has also remained
strong. Continued solid public and private investment spending resulted from infrastructure projects
and investment in mining and energy production in

numerous countries; agricultural production recovered
in some others.
Recent revisions to national accounts data suggest
that some of the region’s economies (Ghana, Nigeria)
are far more diversified than previously thought—
Nigeria’s 2013 nominal GDP level has been revised
upward by more than 80 percent, making it the largest
economy in the region, with industry and services sectors representing a much larger share of the economy
than previously estimated.
In many economies in the region, growth has also
been supported by a further easing in external financial
conditions since April 2014. Some economies have
been able to tap capital markets at a heightened pace,
and recent sovereign bond issuances in the Eurodollar
market were largely oversubscribed, including maiden
issuances in Kenya and Côte d’Ivoire. In fact, the “riskInternational Monetary Fund | October 2014

on” mode has been broad based, with little discrimination based on domestic policies. Sovereign spreads have
reverted to post-global-crisis lows across the board,
regardless of countries’ fiscal positions—with the
notable exception of those in Ghana. In this environment, currencies have generally stabilized after having
weakened in 2013—except in Ghana—and some economies (in particular, Nigeria) that had used external
reserves to defend the external value of their currencies
in 2013 have been able to replenish these reserves. The
Ghanaian cedi, however, has suffered from continued
downward pressure, largely reflecting domestic policy
slippages. Pressures on the Zambian kwacha were also
substantial until May 2014, but the currency has since
then recovered some of the lost ground.
This overall positive outlook is, however, overshadowed by the dire situation in Guinea, Liberia, and
Sierra Leone, where the current Ebola outbreak is
exacting a heavy human and economic toll. In addition, in contrast to robust activity in much of the
region, growth in South Africa has remained lackluster, dragged down by protracted strikes, low business
confidence, and tight electricity supply. The significant
depreciation of the rand has so far resulted in only a
limited amount of much-needed external adjustment.
The region’s growth is projected to accelerate further,
rising from 5.1 percent in 2014 to 5.8 percent in
2015 (Table 2.7, Figure 2.9). The forecast is slightly
weaker for 2014 compared to that in the April 2014
WEO, but slightly stronger for 2015. In many
countries, activity will continue to benefit from the
boost generated by infrastructure projects, the expansion of productive capacity, buoyant services sectors, a
rebound in agricultural production, or combinations
of those factors. In some middle-income countries
and oil exporters, however, the picture is more mixed.
In South Africa, a muted recovery is expected to take
hold only in 2015, as improving labor relations allow
inventory rebuilding and gradually stronger net exports
to offset the drag from financial tightening.
Homegrown factors pose risks to the outlook for the
region. Should the Ebola outbreak become more protracted or spread to more countries, it would have dramatic consequences for economic activity in the west
African region. The security situation in several parts
of sub-Saharan Africa remains fragile, including in the
Central African Republic and South Sudan. Finally, the
fiscal position is weakening in a few countries on the
back of rising current expenditures.

CHAPTER 2

On the external front, the region has become more
sensitive to external real and financial shocks, given
its increasing global linkages. Thus, a sudden reversal
in risk premiums and volatility compression in global
financial markets could severely affect sub-Saharan
African countries reliant on external market funding.
Lower growth in emerging market economies—notably
China—also poses a protracted risk for the region, but
especially for countries heavily reliant on commodity exports. Sharply higher oil prices would benefit
the region’s oil exporters but negatively affect its oil
importers, especially since energy constraints faced by
most countries in the region are related to a high cost
of electricity, as generation often relies on fuel-based
power plants.

COUNTRY AND REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

For the vast majority of the countries in the region,
sustaining high growth remains the key consideration
to foster employment creation and inclusive growth.
Policies should continue to emphasize growth-enhancing measures, including by boosting domestic revenue
mobilization, supporting much-needed infrastructure
investment, and improving the business climate. But as
policymakers pursue development objectives, it will be
important to pay heed to macroeconomic constraints,
avoid overreliance on volatile capital flows, and prevent
a permanent widening of the fiscal position. In the
few countries where macroeconomic imbalances have
become a source of concern, adjustment is necessary
but will need to avoid adverse consequences for the
poor and vulnerable groups.

Spillover Feature: Underlying Drivers of U.S. Yields Matter for Spillovers
The U.S. tapering announcement in May 2013
triggered a sharp repricing of risk and was followed by
unusually high market volatility (Figure 2.SF.1). Yields
in other advanced economies increased significantly,
and emerging market economies were hit hard: local
bond yields increased, equity prices declined, and
currencies depreciated. The market turbulence that
followed the taper talk was likely the side effect of an
unanticipated policy turning point amid one-sided
market positioning accompanied by very low implied
volatility in option prices. Such market positioning has
reemerged during recent months, but in a context in
which the liftoff from the zero lower bound is more
imminent than a year ago.
Given the prospects for tightening financial conditions, it is important, from a spillover perspective,
to know what is driving the tightening, because this
determines the nature of the spillover. Thus, this Spillover Feature examines the underlying drivers of U.S.
yields, their recent behavior, and potential spillovers,
building on the 2014 Spillover Report (IMF 2014).1
The analysis proceeds in two steps: (1) it separates
the key drivers of U.S. yields into “real” and “money”
shocks using a vector autoregression (VAR) with sign
restrictions, and (2) it explores the implications of
spillovers from the two shocks for different country
groupings, using panel VARs. The intuition behind the
identification scheme is simple: while positive (tightening) money shocks push yields up and depress stock
prices, positive real shocks (better prospects/more risk
appetite) increase both yields and stock prices.
The analysis suggests that spillover effects are different depending on the drivers of U.S. yields and recipient countries’ economic characteristics. Specifically,
money shocks have adverse spillover effects abroad
because they increase foreign yields significantly, which
depresses economic activity. Spillovers to emerging
market economies are stronger than those to small
advanced economies. At the same time, real shocks
have a generally positive spillover impact on recipient
economies: higher economic activity in the United

Stavrev, and Sebastian Weber, with research assistance from Ava
Yeabin Hong and Chanpheng Fizzarotti.
1In light of the uneven recovery in advanced economies, see the
2014 Spillover Report for a discussion of the implications of an
asynchronous policy exit, with the United Kingdom and the United
States exiting first, followed by the euro area and Japan.

(Si,t ), is used. Specifically:
Ri,t = ai,0 + ai,1Ri,t–1 + ai,2Si,t–1 + eRi,t ,

(2.SF.1)

Si,t = di,0 + di,1Ri,t–1 + di,2Si,t–1 + eSi,t .

(2.SF.2)

The parameters ai,0, ai,1, ai,2, di,0, di,1 and di,2 are
reduced-form coefficients, and eRi,t and eSi,t are reducedform shocks that are a linear combination of the
structural shocks MONEYi,t ~ N(0,1) and REALi,t ~
N(0,1). Matheson and Stavrev (forthcoming) offer a
more detailed description of the methodology.
The contemporaneous sign restrictions used to
identify the two shocks assume that positive economic
news causes both long-term yields and equity prices to

rise, whereas tighter monetary policy causes long-term
yields to rise and equity prices to fall. Hence, the sign
restrictions imposed on the two variables in the VAR
are as follows:2
R

S

REAL

+

+

MONEY

+

−

The data are daily over the period from January 2000
to mid-July 2014. The long-term bond yield (R) series
is the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield at constant
maturity, and the equity price (S) series is the (log)
Standard & Poor’s 500 index. Through the use of longterm yields instead of short-term yields in the analysis,
a broader concept of money shocks that encompasses
both conventional and unconventional monetary
policy shocks is considered. However, the identification
is also consistent with exogenous shocks to the term
premium, shifts in portfolio preferences away from
bonds and equities toward higher demand for cash,
and potential upward surprises in inflation unrelated to
increased demand. At different times, different factors
will be dominant.
The results from the decomposition highlight the
changing roles of money and real shocks in regard
to U.S. yield developments over the period May
2013–July 2014.3 Specifically, in the aftermath of the
taper talk, higher yields were driven by money shocks,
contributing about 60 percent of the total 100 basis
point increase by the September “no taper” announcement. The subsequent actual taper announcement in
December 2013 had little impact on yields because it
was perceived by markets as confirmation of a better economic outlook. Starting in early 2014, yields
2The money and real shock decomposition is based on the model
that provides the least distance to the pointwise median impulse
response of all the models that fulfill the sign restrictions (Fry and
Pagan 2011).
3Note that the real shocks from the bivariate VAR decomposition comprise both activity and “risk-on/-off” shocks, which could
have potentially different spillover implications. To disentangle risk
shocks, the U.S. nominal effective exchange rate has been added to
the bivariate VAR. Although activity and risk shocks have the same
impact on yields and stock prices, their impact on the exchange
rate is different: the U.S. dollar appreciates (depreciates) as a result
of stronger activity (risk) (for elaboration on the estimation, see
IMF 2014). Preliminary results from this three-way decomposition
suggest qualitatively similar results for the contribution of money
shocks. Regarding real shocks, the results suggest that the activity
component has remained broadly stable, whereas the risk-on contribution has increased since May 2014. Further analysis is needed to
assess the spillover implications of activity and risk shocks.

declined in line with the falling contribution from
the money shock, whereas the contribution from real
shocks remained broadly unchanged. Since mid-May
2014, money shocks have turned negative (easing in
money conditions), offsetting the positive contribution
of better economic news to U.S. yields. By mid-July
2014, real shocks accounted for the entire 60 basis
point increase in U.S. long-term yields since May 2013
(Figure 2.SF.2).

Spillover Effects from Higher U.S. Yields
To assess the international transmission of the
identified real and money shocks to U.S. yields, the
dynamic effect of these external shocks (Xt ) on other
countries’ variables (Yi,t ) is obtained using a panel VAR
model estimated with monthly data.4 Specifically:5
4A number of authors have assessed the role of U.S. shocks for
other countries. See, for instance, Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon

constant across the sample period. Spillovers may have been larger

in which Al and Bl represent reduced-form coefficient
matrices. The dependent-variable vector includes the
local-currency long-term sovereign bond yield (Ri,t ),
the annual change in the nominal effective exchange
rate (Ei,t ), and an activity measure (Zi,t ) alternatively
described by the annual change in industrial production,
the annual change in the stock price index, or the sum
of equity and bond net-capital-inflow-to-GDP ratios:6
Yi,t = (Ri,t

Ei,t

Zi,t ).

(2.SF.4)

The external shocks (Xt ) are the U.S. money and real
shock, respectively.7 Because the two shocks are orthogonal to each other, they are included separately in the
estimation. All regressions include 12 lags.8 Confidence
bands are based on bootstrapped standard errors.9
The analysis uses monthly data for the period from
January 2000 to July 2014. Long-term local-currency
sovereign bond yields are taken from Bloomberg, L.P.,
and the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS)
database. The nominal effective exchange rate is based
on data from the IMF’s Information Notice System
(INS), and the industrial production data are obtained
from the IFS database and Haver Analytics.
The (unbalanced) panel includes a total of 29 economies: 6 small advanced economies (Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland),
9 central and eastern European economies (Bulgaria,
in the aftermath of the crisis. However, the number of available
observations is insufficient to make testing this hypothesis empirically feasible.
6This approach is preferred to a regression including all three
activity measures at a time, which would severely reduce the degrees
of freedom given two additional variables and 12 lags. Impulseresponse functions are reported for yields, nominal effective exchange
rate, and industrial production from the baseline specification and
complemented by those for the annual change in the stock price
index and the sum of the equity and bond net-capital-inflow-toGDP ratios from the alternative specification. Data are taken from
the IMF’s International Financial Statistics database and from EPFR
Global. Changing the specification to a log-level regression or a
first-difference of the log-level regression affects the value of the
point estimates somewhat but has no implications for the qualitative
results.
7To convert the shocks, which are identified at daily frequency, to
monthly frequency, the sum of the shocks in the respective month
is taken.
8The optimal lag length varies depending on the test criteria
(between 9 and 16 lags).
9Confidence bands allow for cross-equation correlation in the
VAR structure. However, confidence bands are likely underestimating the uncertainty around the coefficient estimates because crosssectional dependence across countries is not taken into account and
an estimated variable is used as a regressor.

Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Poland,
Romania, Slovak Republic, Turkey), 10 Asian economies (China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Korea,
Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand), 3
Latin American economies (Brazil, Colombia, Mexico),
and South Africa. To minimize endogeneity concerns,
larger advanced economies, such as Japan, the United
Kingdom, and the euro area, are excluded from the
spillover analysis (although even for these economies, it
is likely that U.S. shocks dominate; see for elaboration
Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon 2011).
The results show that spillovers associated with a
25 basis point increase in the U.S. 10-year bond yield
differ notably depending on whether the underlying
driver is a real or a money shock (Figure 2.SF.3). In
particular, money shocks are followed by increases in
bond yields, a depreciation of the currency, capital
outflows, and declines in stock markets and economic
activity. The same yield increase due to better growth
prospects (real shock) is followed by a limited response
in bond yields, an appreciation of the currency, capital
inflows, and higher stock market returns and economic activity. The response of the exchange rate is
not immediately intuitive, given that better economic
prospects in the United States may also cause higher
capital inflows and an appreciation of the U.S. dollar.
The fact that the other currencies appreciate (and capital flows to them) is explained by the dual character
of the real shock (see note 4). Given the nature of the
identification scheme, the real shock can capture both
better economic news about the U.S. economy and
increased risk appetite, which leads to a reallocation of
assets from safe (U.S. bonds) to more risky (stocks and
emerging market bonds) assets. If risk appetite dominates, the real shock causes capital to flow to emerging
markets, appreciating their currencies and depressing
their yields. However, whether risk motives or U.S.
economic news dominates, industrial production rises
in the United States and other economies.
The results also suggest that spillovers from money
shocks appear, in general, smaller than effects in the
United States, whereas those from real shocks appear
larger (Figures 2.SF.3 and 2.SF.4). In particular, following an adverse money shock, industrial production in
recipient countries falls on average about ¾ percent,
whereas U.S. industrial production declines by about
1¼ percent over the course of a year. This is in line
with the panel results that interest rates in recipient
economies increase by less than those in the United
States after a money shock. The estimates are slightly

above those for conventional monetary policy spillovers, which range from a ratio of 1:3 to a ratio of 1:2
for the contraction in recipient-country output relative
to U.S. output.10 At the same time, a positive real
shock in the United States boosts industrial production there by a bit less than in recipient economies,
likely reflecting the additional positive impact from
higher risk appetite embedded in real shocks. The
VAR literature based on quarterly data finds average
responses to U.S. growth surprise shocks in the range
from a ratio of 1:4 to a ratio of 1:2 and for some
countries above a ratio of 1:1 (see the April 2014
World Economic Outlook).11 However, the identification
strategy underlying these estimates differs from the one
used here, which comprises both growth surprise and
risk-on components. The latter are generally associated
with larger effects for emerging markets and thus may
account for the higher spillover estimate.
The average responses mask potential variation across
countries, reflecting, for example, differing economic links
with the United States or policy frameworks that can act

as shock absorbers or amplifiers. This aspect is further
analyzed by contrasting two cases: first, splitting the sample into small advanced economies and emerging markets,
and second, comparing the results for central and eastern
European, Asian, and Latin American emerging markets.
Figure 2.SF.5 shows the average response of bond yields,
nominal effective exchange rates, industrial production,
capital flows, and stock prices for the country groups in
the first 3, 6, and 12 months following money and real
shocks. Results for Latin America should be interpreted
with care, because they rely on a small sample of only
three economies for which data are available, mainly in
the latter half of the sample period.
In response to a U.S. money shock, compared
with those in advanced economies, yields in emerging
market economies increase by more, exchange rates
depreciate by less, capital outflows are larger, and output and stock prices contract by more. The differential
responses likely reflect the higher risk associated with
emerging market assets and the higher exchange rate
flexibility and deeper financial markets in advanced
economies. The response to a U.S. real shock is less
differentiated across the two groups, with the notable
exception of the yield response, which reflects, among
other factors, the dual nature of the real shock (comprising a risk-on component that tends to depress
bond yields in emerging markets).12
Activity in Asian economies tends to be less affected
by U.S. money shocks relative to economies in central
and eastern Europe and Latin America, despite higher
capital outflows and larger stock market declines. However, economies in central and eastern Europe and Latin
America experience larger currency depreciations and
greater increases in bond yields. The tighter financial
conditions in these economies prompt a larger decline
in industrial production relative to that in economies
in Asia. In response to a U.S. real shock, the difference between economies in Asia and those in central
and eastern Europe is less pronounced (and mostly not
statistically significant), with the exception of the reaction of stock market prices, which tend to rally more in
central and eastern Europe than in Asia. The different
impacts on central and eastern European and Asian
economies from U.S. money and real shocks likely
reflect, among other things, differences in fundamentals
12The stronger yield response in advanced economies compared
with that in emerging markets following real shocks is consistent with real shocks capturing risk-on behavior, with emerging
market bonds and equities generally considered more risky, whereas
advanced economy bonds are viewed as safer assets.

SPILLOVER FEATURE

(for example, relatively strong current account balances
in Asian economies).13 In addition, central and eastern
European economies tend to have greater participation
of foreigners in local currency markets. This may explain
the stronger equity price response and nonsignificant
negative response of bond yields to a real shock, reflecting the risk-on aspect. Latin American economies’ yields
and nominal effective exchange rates are more responsive
than those in economies in the other two regions, partly
reflecting relatively open capital accounts and more flexible exchange rate regimes.

Conclusions
This analysis suggests that spillover effects differ
depending on the underlying drivers of U.S. yields. A

references therein.

faster recovery (real shock) in the United States has a positive impact on global growth by strengthening external
sector performance and boosting confidence in recipient
economies. At the same time, an unexpected tightening
of financial conditions (adverse U.S. money shock) has
negative spillover effects abroad as it pushes up foreign
yields significantly, depressing economic activity.
The impact across countries varies depending on the
strength of their economic links with the United States,
their policy frameworks (which can act as shock absorbers
or amplifiers), or both. Small advanced economies are less
vulnerable to adverse U.S. money shocks than emerging
market economies, reflecting, among other factors, their
more flexible exchange rate regimes and deeper financial
markets. Across emerging market economies, tightening
financial conditions have a smaller impact on activity in
Asian economies than in central and eastern European
and Latin American economies, partly reflecting relatively
strong external balances among Asian economies.

IS IT TIME FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE PUSH? THE MACROECONOMIC
EFFECTS OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT

This chapter finds that increased public infrastructure
investment raises output in both the short and long
term, particularly during periods of economic slack
and when investment efficiency is high. This suggests
that in countries with infrastructure needs, the time
is right for an infrastructure push: borrowing costs are
low and demand is weak in advanced economies, and
there are infrastructure bottlenecks in many emerging market and developing economies. Debt-financed
projects could have large output effects without increasing the debt-to-GDP ratio, if clearly identified infrastructure needs are met through efficient investment.

ive years after the global financial crisis, the
global recovery continues but remains weak.
In many advanced economies there is still substantial economic slack, and inflation remains
too low in the euro area. Robust demand momentum
has not yet taken hold, despite prolonged accommodative monetary policy, slowing in the pace of fiscal consolidation, and improvements in financial conditions.
As noted in Chapter 1, there are now worries that
demand will remain persistently weak—a possibility
that has been described as “secular stagnation” (Summers 2013; Teulings and Baldwin 2014).
In emerging market economies the concerns are of
a different nature. After a sharp rebound following the
crisis, growth rates in the last few years have fallen not
only below the postcrisis peak of 2010–11, but also
below levels seen in the decade before the crisis. The
persistent nature of the deceleration in output suggests that structural factors may be at work (Cubeddu
and others 2014), and the serial disappointments in
growth have led to a ratcheting down of medium-term
growth forecasts (Figure 3.1). Although many factors
are likely to be playing a role, one frequently expressed
concern is inadequate infrastructure. In many emergThe authors of this chapter are Abdul Abiad (team leader), Aseel

ing market economies, including Brazil, India, Russia,
and South Africa, infrastructure bottlenecks are not
just a medium-term worry but have been flagged as a
constraint even on near-term growth. In low-income
countries, deficiencies in the availability of infrastructure remain glaring and are often cited as an impediment to long-term development.1
Given these concerns and the current environment
of low government borrowing costs—real interest
rates are expected to remain lower than precrisis levels
for the foreseeable future (see Chapter 3 of the April
2014 World Economic Outlook)—might this be a good
time to increase public infrastructure investment? In

advanced economies an increase in infrastructure investment could provide a much-needed fillip to demand,
and it is one of the few remaining policy levers available to support growth, given already accommodative
monetary policy. In developing economies it could help
address existing and nascent infrastructure bottlenecks.
And in all economies it would help boost medium-term
output, as higher infrastructure capital stocks expand
productive capacity. As the Group of Twenty (G20)
finance ministers and central bank governors stated in
their communiqué from Sydney in February, higher
infrastructure investment “is crucial for the global
economy’s transition to stronger growth.”2
There are also arguments against such a push. Many
advanced economies have little fiscal space available given
still-high debt-to-GDP ratios and the need for further
consolidation. Financing risks could increase with expected
normalization of some key central banks’ monetary policies. There are open questions about the size of the public
investment multipliers and the long-term returns on
public capital, both of which play a role in determining
how public-debt-to-GDP ratios will evolve in response
to higher public investment. Japan in the 1990s is often
cited as a cautionary tale (Box 3.1). In all economies, but
in developing economies in particular, inefficiencies in the
public investment process are of concern: there is no shortage of anecdotes of increased government investment that
produced few measurable benefits (see World Bank 1994;
Pritchett 2000; Caselli 2005; and Warner 2014).
To assess appropriately the benefits and costs of
increasing public investment in infrastructure, it is
critical to determine what macroeconomic impact
public investment will have. This chapter examines the
following questions:
•• How have public capital and investment evolved
over time? How does infrastructure provision
vary across groups of countries and types of
infrastructure?
•• What are the macroeconomic effects of public
investment? To what extent does it raise output, both in the short and the long term? Does
it increase the public-debt-to-GDP ratio if it is
debt financed? How do these effects vary with key
characteristics of the economy, such as the degree of
economic slack, the efficiency of public investment,
and the way the investment is financed?

•• What do these findings suggest for infrastructure
investment? Is this a good time to raise infrastructure investment? How do fiscal institutions and rules
shape the evolution of public investment?
To address these questions, this chapter presents stylized facts on the provision of public and infrastructure
capital. Since measures of infrastructure investment and
the stock of infrastructure capital are not available for a
wide range of countries, the evolution of public investment and the stock of public capital are used as proxy
measures.3 This is supplemented by physical measures of
infrastructure, such as kilometers of roads and kilowatts
of power generation capacity. The chapter then examines
the historical evidence on the macroeconomic effects
of public investment. Using a novel empirical strategy,
the chapter offers new evidence on the effects of public
investment changes on output and debt in advanced
economies. It also presents evidence on their effects in
emerging market and developing economies. To complement the empirical analysis, the chapter employs model
simulations to explore additional issues, such as the role
of monetary policy and the productivity of public capital. The chapter’s main findings are as follows:
•• The stock of public capital (a proxy for infrastructure
capital) as a share of output has declined significantly
over the past three decades across advanced, emerging
market, and developing economies. In emerging market economies and low-income countries, infrastructure provision per capita is still a fraction of that in
advanced economies. In some advanced economies,
there are signs that aging infrastructure and insufficient maintenance and investment are affecting the
quality of the existing infrastructure stock.
•• Increased public investment raises output, both in
the short term because of demand effects and in
the long term as a result of supply effects. But these
effects vary with a number of mediating factors,
including (1) the degree of economic slack and
monetary accommodation, (2) the efficiency of
public investment, and (3) how public investment is
financed. When there is economic slack and monetary accommodation, demand effects are stronger,
and the public-debt-to-GDP ratio may actually
decline. If the efficiency of the public investment
process is relatively low—so that project selection

capital and infrastructure capital are closely related: a
significant component of the public capital stock in most countries
consists of infrastructure, and the public sector was and continues to
be its main provider. The two tend to be strongly correlated; see the
stylized facts presented in the chapter.

CHAPTER 3

IS IT TIME FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE PUSH? THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT

and execution are poor and only a fraction of the
amount invested is converted into productive public
capital stock—increased public investment leads to
more limited long-term output gains.
•• For economies with clearly identified infrastructure
needs and efficient public investment processes
and where there is economic slack and monetary
accommodation, there is a strong case for increasing
public infrastructure investment. Moreover, evidence
from advanced economies suggests that an increase
in public investment that is debt financed could
have larger output effects than one that is budget
neutral, with both options delivering similar declines
in the public-debt-to-GDP ratio. This should not,
however, be interpreted as a blanket recommendation for a debt-financed public investment increase
in all advanced economies, as adverse market reactions—which might occur in some countries with
already-high debt-to-GDP ratios or where returns to
infrastructure investment are uncertain—could raise
financing costs and further increase debt pressure.
•• Many emerging market and low-income economies
have a pressing need for additional infrastructure
to support economic development. But increasing
public investment may lead to limited output gains, if
efficiency in the investment process is not improved.
Historically, there has been much wider variation in
the macroeconomic response to public investment in
emerging market and developing economies than in
advanced economies. Model-based simulations suggest
that public investment raises output in emerging market
and developing economies, but at the cost of higher
public-debt-to-GDP ratios, because of the general
absence of economic slack and the relatively low efficiency of such investment. Thus, negative fiscal consequences should be carefully weighed against the broader
social gains from increased public investment. For those
emerging market and developing economies where
infrastructure bottlenecks are constraining growth, the
gains from alleviating these bottlenecks could be large.
•• Increasing investment efficiency is critical to mitigating the possible trade-off between higher output and
higher public-debt-to-GDP ratios. Thus a key priority in many economies, particularly in those with
relatively low efficiency of public investment, should
be to raise the quality of infrastructure investment
by improving the public investment process. This
could involve, among other reforms, better project
appraisal and selection that identifies and targets
infrastructure bottlenecks, including through cen-

tralized independent reviews, rigorous cost-benefit
analysis, risk costing, and zero-based budgeting
principles, and improved project execution.4
•• Improvements in fiscal institutions and some fiscal
rules could help protect public investment during
periods of fiscal consolidation.
For many economies, given the large expected infrastructure investment needs over the coming years,
facilitating increased private financing and provision of
infrastructure will be very important—it is in fact one
of the G20’s top priorities.5 The analysis of public versus
private infrastructure provision is beyond the scope of this
chapter, but as a burgeoning literature on the subject has
noted, facilitating increased private financing and provision of infrastructure could help ease fiscal constraints,
generate efficiency gains, and increase investment returns
(see for example Chapter 3 of the October 2014 Regional
Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa; European Investment Bank 2010; Arezki and others, forthcoming; OECD
2014; and World Bank, forthcoming). However, publicprivate partnerships can also be used to bypass spending
controls, and governments can end up bearing most of the
risk involved and facing potentially large fiscal costs over
the medium to long term. Therefore, as the April 2014
Fiscal Monitor emphasizes, it is critical that countries maintain maximum standards of fiscal transparency when using
public-private partnerships for infrastructure provision.6

The Economics of Infrastructure: A Primer
This section discusses the basic economics of infrastructure in order to set the stage for the remainder of
the chapter. It discusses the role of infrastructure in the
economy, how it differs from other types of capital,
and the channels through which stepped-up infrastructure investment can affect economic activity, both in
the short and long term.
Infrastructure refers to the basic structures that
facilitate and support economic activity. In this chapter
the term is used to denote what economists refer to

as “core” infrastructure—roads and other transportation facilities, power generation and other utilities, and
communications systems. Transport networks connect
producers and consumers to markets, utilities provide
essential inputs such as power and water for both
production and consumption, and communications
networks facilitate the exchange and dissemination of
information and knowledge. As such, infrastructure is
an indispensable input in an economy’s production, one
that is highly complementary to other, more conventional inputs such as labor and noninfrastructure capital. Indeed, it is hard to imagine any production process
in any sector of the economy that does not rely on
infrastructure. Conversely, inadequacies in infrastructure are quickly felt—in some countries, power outages,
insufficient water supply, and decrepit or nonexistent
roads adversely affect people’s quality of life and present
significant barriers to the operation of firms.
A few key characteristics distinguish infrastructure from
other types of capital. First, infrastructure investments
are often large, capital-intensive projects that tend to be
“natural monopolies”—it is often more cost-effective for
services to be provided by a single entity. Second, they
tend to have significant up-front costs, but the benefits or
returns accrue over very long periods of time, often many
decades; this longevity (and the associated difficulty of
ascertaining adequate returns over such a long horizon)
can pose a challenge to private financing and provision.
Third, infrastructure investments have the potential to
generate positive externalities, so that the social return to
a project can exceed the private returns it can generate for
the operator.7 This can lead to underprovision of needed
investments. For these reasons, infrastructure has historically been provided by the public sector, public-private
partnerships, or regulated private entities.
In deciding which infrastructure projects to undertake, governments must carefully weigh broader social
returns against funding costs and fiscal consequences,
recognizing that infrastructure projects are not undertaken primarily to boost revenues. Certain infrastructure projects may have a high social return, but costs
might not be recouped through user charges and prices
or through increased tax revenue from higher activity.
Such situations generate a trade-off between positive
social benefits on the one hand and negative fiscal
consequences on the other.
7The benefits of constructing a new bridge, for example, spill over
to the rest of the road network of which it is a part, and households and firms become more productive because of the improved
transport network.

78

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

Increasing the flow of infrastructure services could be
achieved by stepping up investment in new infrastructure projects (such as building new roads), but also by
boosting operation and maintenance spending (such
as filling potholes in existing roads), which reduces the
rate of capital depreciation and extends the lifetime of
installed infrastructure. Despite evidence of high rates
of return, operations and maintenance spending is often
neglected in favor of building new infrastructure (Rioja
2013), and is sometimes one of the first budget items
to be pared back in times of fiscal pressure (Adam and
Bevan 2014). But reducing maintenance expenditure is
not equivalent to true fiscal savings from a longer-term
perspective: potholes that are not filled today will have
to be filled eventually, possibly at a higher cost.
An increase in public infrastructure investment affects
the economy in two ways. In the short term it boosts
aggregate demand through the short-term fiscal multiplier, similar to other government spending, and also by
potentially crowding in private investment, given the highly
complementary nature of infrastructure services. The size of
the fiscal multiplier can vary with the state of the economy.
Government investment also adds to the stock of public
debt if the government borrows to finance additional
spending. Whether debt rises as a share of GDP in the
short term depends on the size of the fiscal multiplier and
the elasticity of revenues to output. GDP may rise by more
than debt initially, and the resulting higher tax revenue may
offset some of the increased spending on public investment.
Over time, there is also a supply-side effect of public
infrastructure investment as the productive capacity
of the economy increases with a higher infrastructure
capital stock. The efficiency of investment is central to
determining how large this supply-side effect will be
(see Box 3.2). Inefficiencies in the investment process,
such as poor project selection, implementation, and
monitoring, can result in only a fraction of public
investment translating into productive infrastructure,
limiting the long-term output gains.
The extent to which increases in public capital can
raise potential output is a key factor in determining the
evolution of the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium
and long term. In particular, if short-term multipliers,
public investment efficiency, and the elasticity of output to public capital are sufficiently high, an increase
in public investment can be “self-financing” in that it
leads to a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio.8
8See Appendix 3.2 for further elaboration on this conceptual
framework.

CHAPTER 3

IS IT TIME FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE PUSH? THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT

Public and Infrastructure Capital and
Investment: Where Do We Stand?
This section documents how public and infrastructure
capital and investment have evolved over the past four
decades. Public capital and infrastructure capital are
closely related: a significant component of the public
capital stock in most countries consists of infrastructure,
and the public sector was and continues to be its main
provider.9 However, there are differences: public capital
can include noninfrastructure components (such as
machinery and equipment, inventories, valuables, and
land), and infrastructure can also be provided by the
private sector or government-owned enterprises. Since
measures of infrastructure investment and the stock of
infrastructure capital are not available for a wide range
of countries, the stylized facts here use the evolution of
public investment and the stock of public capital as a
proxy measure (Box 3.3 discusses issues with the measurement of the public capital stock).10 This approach
is supplemented by looking at physical measures of
infrastructure, such as kilometers of roads and kilowatts
of power generation capacity.
The stock of public capital, which reflects to a large
extent the availability of infrastructure, has declined
significantly as a share of output over the past three
decades across advanced, emerging market, and developing economies (Figure 3.2). In advanced economies,
this reflects primarily a trend decline in public investment from about 4 percent of GDP in the 1980s to
3 percent of GDP at present.11
In emerging market economies and low-income
countries, sharply higher public investment in the late
1970s and early 1980s significantly raised public capital
9Over the past two decades, private participation in infrastructure
via public-private partnerships has been on the rise. In the aggregate,
however, public infrastructure investment still dwarfs private, as
infrastructure investment via public-private partnerships is still less
than a tenth of public investment in advanced economies and less
than a quarter of public investment in emerging market and developing economies.
10Direct measures of public capital—more formally known as
government nonfinancial assets—are available for a handful of
economies only, and even these estimates are often based on different
coverage and methods. As a result, the public capital series used
here, taken from the April 2014 Fiscal Monitor, are constructed by
cumulating government investment spending, assuming some initial
value of public capital and depreciation rates (see the April 2014
Fiscal Monitor and Kamps 2006 for details).
11Although the decline in the stock of public capital in advanced
economies may partially reflect an increasing role of the private sector
in the provision of infrastructure (such as energy and telecommunications), the stock of private capital and the level of private investment
as a share of output have also declined over the past three decades.

stocks, but since then public capital relative to GDP has
also fallen.12 Higher public investment rates in the past
decade have stemmed the decline. Public capital stocks
relative to GDP tend to be higher in developing economies than in advanced economies because of the higher
investment rates and lower GDP levels in the former.
However, when one adjusts for the efficiency of public
investment (Box 3.2), which tends to be lower in developing economies, the estimated stock of public capital
is significantly reduced (dashed lines in Figure 3.2; see
also Dabla-Norris and others 2012; Gupta and others
2014; and Chapter 2 of the April 2014 Fiscal Monitor).
And in per capita terms, these economies still have only
a fraction of the public capital available in advanced
economies (Figure 3.2, panel 5). The large variation
in public capital stocks per person is mirrored by the
availability of physical infrastructure per person (Figure
3.3).13 Power generation capacity per person in emerging market economies is one-fifth the level in advanced
economies, and in low-income countries it is only oneeighth the level in emerging markets. The discrepancy in
road kilometers per person is similarly large.
Even in some advanced economies, in which
measures of the quantity of infrastructure appear high
relative to those in the rest of the world, there are
deficiencies in the quality of the existing infrastructure
stock.14 Business executives’ assessment of the overall
quality of infrastructure has been declining for the
United States and Germany (Figure 3.4, panel 1),
reflecting largely the perceived deterioration in the
quality of roads and highways (panel 2). As the American Society of Civil Engineers (2013) notes, 32 percent
of major roads in the United States are now in poor
or mediocre condition, and the U.S. Federal Highway
Administration estimates that between $124 billion
and $146 billion annually in capital investment will
be needed for substantial improvement in conditions
and performance—considerably more than the current
12Figure 3.12 shows the evolution of public capital stocks in
emerging markets and in low-income countries separately. Both
follow the same general pattern of rising in the late 1970s and early
1980s and declining thereafter, though the rise and decline have
been sharper in low-income countries.
13Public capital stock per capita and physical infrastructure
per capita (as measured by a synthetic index of power, roads, and
telephones) are highly correlated. The cross-country correlation over
the period 2005–11 is about 0.77, and a 1 percent higher stock of
public capital per person corresponds to a 0.73 percent higher stock
of infrastructure per person (Figure 3.3, panel 4).
14In addition, the evidence presented by Abiad and others
(forthcoming) seems to suggest that the quantity of infrastructure in
several advanced economies is also becoming increasingly inadequate.

IS IT TIME FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE PUSH? THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT

$100 billion spent annually on capital improvements
at all government levels.
Figure 3.4 also illustrates the heterogeneity of the
state of infrastructure. Although the decline in the
perceived quality of infrastructure in the United States
and Germany is evident, a similar decline is not apparent in other Group of Seven economies—for example,
in Canada, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
Italy’s infrastructure quality seems to be on the rise,
albeit from relatively low levels. This heterogeneity
should not be surprising and presents an important
caveat: individual countries have differing infrastructure needs, and increased infrastructure investment
should be considered only if there is a documented
need and an economic payoff.

The Macroeconomic Effects of Public
Investment
In order to assess the benefits and costs of additional
public infrastructure investment properly, policymakers
need a clear picture of the macroeconomic implications
of such investment.
As discussed earlier in the chapter, an increase in
public infrastructure investment affects output both in
the short term, by boosting aggregate demand through
the fiscal multiplier and potentially crowding in private
investment, and in the long term, by expanding the
productive capacity of the economy with a higher
infrastructure stock. The macroeconomic response
is shaped by various factors, including the degree of
economic slack and monetary accommodation in the
short term and efficiency of public investment in the
long term. This section examines whether these theoretical predictions regarding the macroeconomic effects
are borne out in the data. In contrast to the large body
of literature that has focused on estimating the longterm elasticity of output to public and infrastructure
capital using a production function approach,15 the
analysis here adopts a novel empirical strategy that
allows estimation of both the short- and medium-term
effects of public investment on a range of macroeconomic variables. Specifically, it isolates shocks to public
investment that can plausibly be deemed exogenous to
macroeconomic conditions and traces out the evolution of output, the public-debt-to-GDP ratio, and
private investment in the aftermath of these shocks.
15See Romp and de Haan 2007; Straub 2011; and Bom and
Ligthart, forthcoming, for a survey of the literature.

Since data on public infrastructure investment are
not widely available, the empirical analysis examines
the macroeconomic effects of total public investment,
which may include investment in noninfrastructure
items. To the extent that the productivity-enhancing
effects of other public investments are lower than those
for core infrastructure investment (see for example
Bom and Ligthart, forthcoming), the estimates in the
chapter present a lower bound on the long-term effects
of public infrastructure investment.
The empirical analysis is complemented by model
simulations for both advanced and developing economies, which helps identify the role of additional
factors, such as monetary policy, investment efficiency,
and productivity of public infrastructure capital.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: LEGACIES, CLOUDS, UNCERTAINTIES

An Empirical Exercise for Advanced Economies
The analysis begins by assessing the macroeconomic
impact of public investment shocks in advanced
economies, using the approach of Auerbach and
Gorodnichenko (2012, 2013). In this approach, public
investment shocks are identified as the forecast error of
public investment spending relative to GDP. This procedure overcomes the problem of fiscal foresight (Forni
and Gambetti 2010; Leeper, Richter, and Walker 2012;
Leeper, Walker, and Yang 2013; Ben Zeev and Pappa
2014), because it aligns the economic agents’ and the
econometrician’s information sets. Two econometric
specifications are used. The first establishes whether
these unanticipated shocks have significant effects on
macroeconomic variables such as output, public-debtto-GDP ratios, and private investment. The second
is used to analyze whether these effects vary with the
state of the economy, public investment efficiency, and
the way higher public investment is financed (that is,
whether it is debt financed or budget neutral).16
The analysis shows that public investment shocks
have statistically significant and long-lasting effects on
output (Figure 3.5, panel 1). An unanticipated 1 percentage point of GDP increase in investment spending increases the level of output by about 0.4 percent
in the same year and by 1.5 percent four years after
the shock. Using the sample average of government
investment as a percentage of output (about 3 percent of GDP), this implies short- and medium-term
investment spending multipliers of about 0.4 and 1.4,
respectively. These multipliers are consistent with other
estimates reported in the literature (see Coenen and
others 2012 and literature cited therein).17 The results
are also robust to different time samples and when
public investment shocks are isolated from other government spending shocks, as well as from unexpected
changes in output.18

16See

Appendix 3.2 for details.
results are qualitatively similar if one estimates the impact
of simple changes in public investment as a share of GDP instead of
using forecast errors; see Appendix 3.2.
18A potential concern, for example, is that public investment
shocks may respond to output growth surprises: public investment
could be accelerated when unexpected growth provides funds, for
example, or slowed when growth disappointments decrease revenues.
In data from 17 advanced economies over the period 1985–2013,
public investment innovations are only weakly correlated with output growth surprises (correlation –0.11). Moreover, purifying public
investment shocks by removing the portion explained by growth
surprises delivers results that are very similar to and not statisti17These

82

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

The point estimates in panel 2 of the figure show
that higher public investment spending typically
reduces the debt-to-GDP ratio both in the short term
(by about 0.9 percentage point of GDP) and in the
medium term (by about 4 percentage points of GDP),
but the decline in debt is statistically significant only in
the short term. There is no statistically significant effect
on private investment as a share of GDP (panel 3).
The latter finding suggests the crowding in of private
investment, as the level of private investment rises in
tandem with the higher GDP as a result of the increase
in public investment.
The macroeconomic effects of public investment
shocks are very different across economic regimes
(Figure 3.6, panels 1 through 4).19 During periods
of low growth, a public investment spending shock
increases the level of output by about 1½ percent in
the same year and by 3 percent in the medium term,
but during periods of high growth the long-term effect
is not statistically significantly different from zero.20
Public investment shocks also bring about a reduction
in the public-debt-to-GDP ratio during periods of low
growth because of the much bigger boost in output.
During periods of high growth, the point estimates
suggest a rise in public debt, though the wide confidence intervals imply that these are not statistically
significantly different from zero.21
In addition, the macroeconomic effects of public
investment shocks are substantially stronger in councally significantly different from those reported in the baseline (see
Appendix 3.2).
19Economic regimes are identified as periods of very low growth
(recessions) and very high growth (significant expansions). Periods
of very low (high) growth identified in this analysis correspond to
periods of large negative (positive) output gaps: during periods of
very low (high) growth, the output gap varies between –0.4 and –7.2
(–1.1 and 8.5) percent of potential output, with an average output
gap of –3.7 (3.5) percent. Using the output gap instead of growth
rates to identify economic regimes gives qualitatively similar results.
In particular, during periods of large negative output gaps, the shortterm multiplier is 0.6 and is statistically significant, but when output
gaps are large and positive, the output effect of public investment is
0.2 and not statistically significant.
20This finding is consistent with a growing literature that explores
the effect of fiscal policy during recessions and expansions (see
Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2012; Blanchard and Leigh 2013; and
IMF 2013 and the literature cited therein).
21One possibility is that these results are driven by the fact that
these shocks occur in periods of economic recovery. However, no
statistically significant correlation is found between the measure
of investment spending shocks used and the economic regime. In
particular, the correlation between investment spending shocks and
the economic regime (or the change in the economic regime) is
–0.01 (0.01).

tries with a high degree of public investment efficiency,
both in the short and in the medium term (Figure 3.6,
panels 5 through 8). In countries with high efficiency
of public investment, a public investment spending
shock increases the level of output by about 0.8 percent in the same year and by 2.6 percent four years
after the shock. But in countries with low efficiency of
public investment, the output effect is about 0.2 percent in the same year and about 0.7 percent in the
medium term. As a result, although public investment
shocks are found to lead to a significant medium-term
reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio (about 9 percentage points four years after the shock) in countries with
high public investment efficiency, they tend to increase
the debt-to-GDP ratio (albeit not in a statistically significant manner) in countries with low public investment efficiency.
The output effects are larger when public investment
shocks are debt financed than when they are budget
neutral (Figure 3.6, panels 9 to 12).22 In particular,
although a debt-financed public investment shock
of 1 percentage point of GDP increases the level of
output by about 0.9 percent in the same year and by
2.9 percent four years after the shock, the short- and
medium-term output effects of a budget-neutral public
investment shock are not statistically significantly different from zero. The larger short- and medium-term
output multipliers for debt-financed shocks imply that
the reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio is similar in
the two types of shocks.
It is possible that increasing debt-financed public
investment in countries with debt that is already high
may increase sovereign risk and financing costs if the
productivity of the investment is in doubt (possibly
because of poor project selection), which in turn could
lead to further debt accumulation, exacerbating debt
sustainability concerns.23 Within the sample of 17
advanced economies employed in the estimation, the
empirical evidence suggests that historically, debtfinanced public investment shocks have not led to
increases in funding costs, as proxied by sovereign real
22Budget-neutral

public investment shocks are identified as those
in which the difference between the shocks to other components of
the government budget and public investment shocks is greater than
or equal to zero.
23Empirical evidence for emerging markets suggests that debtfinanced public spending is associated with higher and more volatile
sovereign risk spreads than tax-financed spending (Akitoby and Stratmann 2008). For further discussion of the links between public debt,
public investment, and growth, see Ostry, Ghosh, and Espinoza
2014.

Public investment shocks have a statistically signiﬁcant and long-lasting effect
on output. They also typically reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio, though the decline
in debt is statistically signiﬁcant only in the short term. The level of private
investment rises in tandem with GDP.

IS IT TIME FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE PUSH? THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT

interest rates. Moreover, an examination of whether the
effects of public investment shocks on debt and output
depend on the initial level of public debt yields no evidence that historically, the effects of public investment
differ materially according to the initial public-debtto-GDP ratio. This may, however, be a result of lower
debt-to-GDP ratios in advanced economies during
most of the sample period.

An Empirical Exercise for Developing Economies
The empirical strategy used for the sample of
advanced economies requires forecasts of public investment, which are not available over a long time span for
economies that are not members of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development. Given this
data limitation, three different approaches are used that
provide complementary evidence on the macroeconomic
effects of public investment in developing economies.24
The first approach is to examine episodes of public investment booms and trace the evolution of key
macroeconomic variables in the aftermath of large and
sustained increases in public investment. The goal of
this exercise is simply to establish the stylized facts about
the macroeconomic conditions surrounding booms,
rather than to estimate the causal effect of major pushes
in infrastructure investments. Estimating the causal
impact of booms is confounded by the fact that whether
a country undergoes an investment boom and when a
boom occurs are not exogenous to the country’s macroeconomic conditions. For example, a shock that raises
expected growth (for example, a sustained terms-of-trade
boom or discovery of natural resources) may prompt
governments to invest in infrastructure now, inducing
a positive correlation between output and investment.
Nevertheless, examining these large investment booms is
a useful exercise for two reasons. First, a number of lowincome countries have considerably stepped up government investment in recent years as a way to jump-start
their economies in the face of weak external demand
and infrastructure bottlenecks. Second, there are various theoretical reasons for such large investment drives
to have different consequences relative to the average
impact of public investment shocks that is picked up by
the other two strategies.25 This analysis follows Warner
24Details

between different infrastructure projects and
public and private investment may lead to disproportionate gains
from coordinated pushes in infrastructure—the main hypothesis
25Complementarities

(2014) in identifying investment booms as a sustained
and significant increase in the government investment
ratio. Once the initial year of the investment boom is
identified, the evolution of key macroeconomic variables
is traced in the period following the start of the public
investment push.
The historical experience with public investment
booms paints a similar picture to the estimated macroeconomic impacts of public investment in advanced
economies (Figure 3.7). About 120 public investment
booms in the sample are identified, the vast majority of
them in emerging market and developing economies.
These booms are characterized by large and sustained
increases in government investment spending: public
investment as a share of GDP rises by about 7 percentage points of GDP in the first years of the boom. During
this period, the level of output continuously increases,
stabilizing after the fifth year at a level about 8 percent
higher than in the year before the boom. This suggests a
public investment multiplier of about 1–1.3.26
The analysis also traces the evolution of public debt
after the beginning of a boom. The estimates’ standard
errors are large, but there is no evidence of an increase
in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the aftermath of a boom.
If anything, the negative point estimates suggest a
relative decline in public debt as a share of output
five years after the beginning of the boom. However,
as shown in Appendix 3.2, the declining public debt
ratio is driven by investment booms in commodityexporting economies, in which stepped-up government
investment could well have coincided with natural
resource windfalls for public revenues.
The second approach to examining the macroeconomic consequences of public investment in developing countries is inspired by Corsetti, Meier, and Müller
(2012). The empirical strategy relies on the idea that
significant parts of government spending (investment
in particular) are likely determined by past information and cannot easily respond to current economic
conditions.27 Thus, one can estimate a fiscal policy
behind “big push” theories of development. On the other hand, large
scaling up of public investment may result in the implementation
of inframarginal projects and thus have lower-than-average impact
(Warner 2014).
26These findings are somewhat different from those in the recent
study by Warner (2014), who analyzes the growth impacts of public
investment booms in a smaller set of low-income countries.
27In principle, this assumption can be violated for two reasons.
First, public investment can automatically respond to cyclical conditions. This, however, should not pose a problem, because automatic
stabilizers operate mostly via revenues and social spending. Second,

The estimated policy shocks are then used to trace the

discretionary public investment spending can occur in response
to output conditions. As discussed in Corsetti, Meier, and Müller
2012, the relevance of this concern relates to the precise definition of
contemporaneous feedback effects. Although it is typically assumed
in the literature that government spending does not react to changes
in economic activity within a given quarter (Blanchard and Perotti
2002), whether it may respond in a period longer than a quarter
is an open question. Recent evidence for advanced economies
(Beetsma, Giuliodori, and Klaassen 2009; Born and Müller 2012),
however, suggests that the restriction that government spending not
respond to economic conditions within a year cannot be rejected.
28This identification strategy is very similar to the structure
embedded in fiscal policy vector autoregression. The fiscal policy
rule links the change in government investment to its lags, lagged
growth, current and lagged public indebtedness, and expectations of
the next year’s growth.

2. Public Investment
Instrumented by Ofﬁcial
Loan Disbursement

The third approach builds on recent work by Kraay
(2012, forthcoming) and Eden and Kraay (2014) and
applies primarily to low-income countries. In many
of these countries, loans from official creditors such as
the World Bank and other multilateral and bilateral
aid agencies finance a significant fraction of government spending. The disbursements of these loans and
the spending they finance are spread out over many
years following the approval of the loans. Hence,
part of the fluctuation in government investment is
predetermined, as it reflects loan approvals in previous years. If one assumes that loan approval decisions
made by creditors do not anticipate future macroeconomic shocks that affect output, this predetermined
component of spending can be used as an instrument
for total government investment to identify the causal
impact of public investment on output.
These two approaches suggest that public investment
may have a positive effect on output (Figure 3.8). The
estimated effects are substantially smaller using the fiscal policy rule methodology, though they are more precisely estimated (panel 1). The contemporaneous effect
of a 1 percentage point of GDP increase in public
investment is a 0.25 percent increase in output, which
gradually increases to about 0.5 percent four years after
the shock. The Eden and Kraay (2014) methodology
yields larger but much more imprecisely estimated

coefficients, with the effect of a public investment
shock of about 1 percent four years after the shock
(panel 2). The wide confidence bands preclude rejection of the null hypothesis that the two methodologies lead to identical estimates of the effect of public
investment on output. The estimated medium-term
multiplier is between 0.5 and 0.9, slightly lower than
the multiplier estimated for advanced economies.

A Model-Based Approach
The empirical approaches in the preceding sections
assess the short- and medium-term macroeconomic
effects of public investment. But they are not well
suited to estimating the effects of public investment
shocks over longer periods (for example, more than
10 years), nor can they fully address issues that are
relevant today but have little historical precedent, such
as the zero floor on nominal interest rates in many
advanced economies and the current environment
of very low real interest rates (see Chapter 3 of the
April 2014 World Economic Outlook).29 Therefore, to
complement the empirical analysis, this section looks
at the macroeconomic effects of public investment
shocks using dynamic general-equilibrium models. An
additional advantage of relying on model simulations
is that in these models, public investment shocks are
strictly exogenous and no identification assumptions
are needed.
Simulations for advanced and emerging market
economies use the IMF’s Globally Integrated Monetary and Fiscal model.30 Simulations for low-income
countries are based on the model of Buffie and
others (2012), which captures aspects pertinent to
low-income countries, such as low public investment
efficiency, absorptive capacity issues, and limited access
to international and domestic borrowing (see Box 3.4).
A critical input in the model-based analysis is the
elasticity of output to public capital. There is now a
substantial literature, triggered by the seminal contributions of Aschauer (1989), that estimates the
long-term elasticity of output to public capital. A
cursory reading of the literature reveals estimates ranging widely, from large and positive to slightly negative.
However, a recent meta-analysis by Bom and Ligth29Japan’s experience with public investment in the 1990s is perhaps the most relevant historical example; for details, see Box 3.1.
30For a detailed description of the model, see Kumhof and Laxton
2007 and Kumhof, Muir, and Mursula 2010.

art (forthcoming) of 68 of these studies shows that
much of the variation in estimates can be attributed
to differences in research design, including how public
infrastructure capital is defined, what output measure
is used, whether capital is installed at the national level
or by state and local governments, the econometric
specification and sample coverage, and whether endogeneity and nonstationarity are properly addressed.
Controlling for these factors, Bom and Ligthart come
up with a much narrower range for the estimated output elasticity of public capital (Table 3.1). In particular, they suggest that the elasticity of core infrastructure
installed by a national government is 0.17. This is the
estimated elasticity that is assumed in the simulations
in this chapter.31
Model simulations for advanced economies
Since the global financial crisis, policy rates in the
largest advanced economies have been near zero and
are expected to remain at this level in the near term
because of still-large output gaps (see Chapter 1).
The effects of public investment shocks under these
conditions are examined through a simulation of the
macroeconomic response of output, the public-debtto-GDP ratio, and private investment to a 1 percent
of GDP increase in public investment, assuming that
monetary policy rates stay close to zero for two years.32
The results of this simulation suggest that a 1 percent
of GDP permanent increase in public investment
increases output by about 2 percent in the same year.
Output declines in the third year after the shock as
monetary policy normalizes, then increases to 2.5 per31Panels 5 and 6 of Figure 3.10 illustrate how different assumptions
regarding the elasticity of output to public capital affect the results.
32There are two main reasons to assume that policy rates stay near
zero for two years. First, such an assumption is in line with market
expectations about policy rates for most large advanced economies.
Second, in the model, the only way the central bank can stabilize
output and inflation is by cutting nominal interest rates. When the
option of cutting interest rates is removed for a longer period—
for example, three or more years—the model generates unstable
macroeconomic dynamics, which complicates the computation of
simulation results.

cent over the long term because of the resulting higher
stock of public capital (Figure 3.9, panel 1). Similarly,
private investment increases both in the short and in
the long term (Figure 3.9, panel 3). The large output
effects imply that the debt-to-GDP ratio declines, by
about 3 percentage points of GDP three years after
the shock, after which it increases somewhat, stabilizing at about 1.5 percentage points of GDP below the
baseline five years after the shock.33
How different would the results be under normal
conditions of less slack and an immediate monetary
policy response to the increase in public investment? In
this case, the short-term output effects would be much
smaller. As a result, the debt-to-GDP ratio would eventually rise, stabilizing at a level 1.5 percentage points
of GDP higher than the baseline (Figure 3.10, panels
1 and 2). These results are broadly consistent with the
empirical evidence in the previous subsections.
These simulations implicitly assume that public
investment is fully efficient, that is, that each dollar
invested translates into productive public capital. However, it is likely that in countries with a lower degree
of investment efficiency, the resulting output effects
are smaller. The simulations presented in Figure 3.10,
panels 3 and 4, confirm and quantify these results. In
countries with a lower degree of investment efficiency,
a 1 percentage point of GDP increase in public investment increases output by about 2.2 percent in the long
term, compared with about 2.8 percent in countries
where public investment is fully efficient. As a result,
in countries with a low degree of investment efficiency,
the debt-to-GDP ratio would decline less than in
countries with full investment efficiency.

of the shock.

policy. Another important difference between these
two groups is that public investment efficiency in
advanced economies is typically higher than that in
emerging market and low-income economies (Box
3.2). Because of these two factors, a public investment shock of similar size leads to considerably lower
long-term output effects in emerging market economies and low-income countries than in advanced
economies (Figure 3.11 and Box 3.4). This phenomenon also has implications for public debt dynamics.
The model simulations suggest that increased public
investment may be self-financing under current conditions in advanced economies (in the sense that the
public-debt-to-GDP ratio does not rise), but higher
public investment would mean a higher public-debtto-GDP ratio in emerging market economies and
low-income countries.

2013

Is now a good time for an infrastructure push? This
chapter documents a substantial decline in public capital
as a share of output over the past three decades across
advanced, emerging market, and developing economies.
It also notes that, in per capita terms, infrastructure
provision in emerging market economies and lowincome countries is still only a fraction of what it is in
advanced economies. As for the macroeconomic impact
of increased public investment, the chapter finds that
such investment raises output in both the short and
long term. It also finds that these effects vary with a
number of mediating factors, and these are fundamental
to teasing out the chapter’s policy implications.
For economies with clearly identified infrastructure
needs and efficient public investment processes and
where there is economic slack and monetary accommodation, there is a strong case for increasing public
infrastructure investment. Moreover, evidence from
advanced economies suggests that an increase in public
investment that is debt financed would have larger output effects than an increase that is budget neutral, with
both options delivering similar declines in the debt-toGDP ratio. Current conditions present an opportunity
to increase public investment, for those economies
where the aforementioned conditions hold. The
increased public investment would provide a muchneeded boost to demand in the short term and would
also help raise potential output in the long term. These
conclusions should not, however, be interpreted as a

If monetary policy is not accommodative, the short-run output impact of public
investment shocks is smaller. Differences in public investment efﬁciency and
return on public capital will also shape the macroeconomic response.

blanket recommendation for a debt-financed public
investment increase across all economies. Adverse market reactions—which could occur in some countries
with already-high debt-to-GDP ratios or where returns
to infrastructure investment are uncertain—could raise
financing costs and further increase debt pressure.
But if infrastructure needs are indeed pressing and
investment may be self-financing for some economies—in the sense that the public-debt-to-GDP ratio
may not rise as a result of investment—why is public
investment in advanced economies at a three-decade
low? The reason is that in practice, public investment decisions frequently are not guided by economic
rationale. This can cut both ways—inefficient and

unproductive projects are often pursued by politicians
and line ministries when they should not be, and some
productive projects (and importantly, maintenance) are
forgone when they should be given priority. Regarding the latter, Box 3.5 illustrates how improvements
in fiscal institutions and some fiscal rules seem to help
preserve public investment during periods of fiscal
consolidation.
For many emerging market economies and lowincome countries, there is a pressing need for additional infrastructure to support economic development.
But increasing public investment may lead to limited
output gains, if efficiency in the investment process
is not improved. Historically, there has been much
wider variation in the macroeconomic effects of public
investment, and the empirical estimates of the macroeconomic effects of public investment are as a result
much less precise. Model-based simulations suggest
that public investment does raise output in both the
short and long term, but at the cost of rising publicdebt-to-GDP ratios because of the general absence of
economic slack and the relatively low efficiency of such
investment. Thus, negative fiscal consequences should
be carefully weighed against the broader social gains
from increased public investment. For those emerging
market and developing economies where infrastructure
bottlenecks are constraining growth, the gains from
alleviating these bottlenecks could be large.
Increasing investment efficiency is critical to mitigating the possible trade-off between higher output
and higher public debt. Thus a key priority in many
economies, particularly in those with relatively low
efficiency of public investment, should be to raise
the quality of infrastructure investment by improving
the public investment process (Box 3.2). Improvement could involve, among other reforms, better
project appraisal and selection that identifies and
targets infrastructure bottlenecks, including through
centralized independent reviews, rigorous cost-benefit
analysis, risk costing, and zero-based budgeting
principles. As the April 2014 Fiscal Monitor notes,
only half of the increase in government investment in
emerging market and developing economies during
1980–2012 translated into productive capital; it also
finds that reducing all inefficiencies in public investment by 2030 would provide the same boost to the
capital stock as increasing government investment
by 5 percentage points of GDP in emerging market
economies and by 14 percentage points of GDP in
low-income countries.

Conceptual Framework
What are the effects of public investment on output
and the debt-to-GDP ratio? Following Delong and
Summers (2012), this section presents a highly stylized
framework for assessing the effect of public investment
on output and the debt-to-GDP ratio and for evaluating under which conditions an increase in public
investment is self-financing.
In the short term, an increase in public investment
boosts aggregate demand through the short-term fiscal
multiplier. This increase in government spending will
also affect the debt-to-GDP ratio, which may increase
or decrease depending on the size of the fiscal multiplier and on the elasticity of revenues to output. More
formally, in the short term (one year), an increase in
public investment as a share of potential GDP (Di)
leads to a change in the debt-to-potential-GDP ratio
(Dd ) given by

Over time, the short-term increase in public investment will affect the debt-to-GDP ratio by affecting
its annual debt-financing burden, which is equal to
the difference between the real government borrowing
rate (r) and the GDP growth rate (g) times the initial
change in the debt-to-GDP ratio:
(r – g)Dd = (r – g)(1 – mt)Di.

(3.2)

Whether this additional financing burden will lead
to an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the long

term will depend on the parameters of equation (3.2)
but also crucially on the elasticity of output to public
capital. In particular, in the long term, an increase in
public investment will lead to an increase in potential
output (Y ), which will generate long-term future tax
dividends:
tDY = ty0Di,

(3.3)

in which  is the long-term elasticity of output to public capital and y0 is the initial output-to-public-capital

ratio.34 Equations (3.2) and (3.3) imply together that
if short-term multipliers and the elasticity of output to
public capital are sufficiently large, such that
(r – g)(1 – mt) – tyo ≤ 0,
then at the margin, an increase in public investment
will be self-financing.

Empirical Analysis for Advanced Economies
Baseline approach
The analysis in this section assesses the macroeconomic impact of public investment shocks, applying
the statistical approach used by Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012, 2013). In this approach, shocks are
identified as unanticipated changes in public investment; public investment forecasts are used to compute
unanticipated innovations. This procedure overcomes
the problem of fiscal foresight (see Forni and Gambetti 2010; Leeper, Richter, and Walker 2012; Leeper,
Walker, and Yang 2013; and Ben Zeev and Pappa
2014), because it aligns the economic agents’ and the
econometrician’s information sets.35
Two econometric specifications are used, first to
establish the macroeconomic impact of public investment shocks and then to determine whether the
effects vary with the state of the economy and with
the degree of public investment efficiency. In the first
specification, the average response of real GDP, the
debt-to-GDP ratio, and private investment as a share
of GDP are estimated. The statistical method follows
the approach proposed by Jordà (2005) to estimate
impulse-response functions. This approach has been
advocated by Stock and Watson (2007) and Auerbach
and Gorodnichencko (2013), among others, as a
flexible alternative that does not impose the dynamic
restrictions embedded in vector autoregression (autoregressive distributed-lag) specifications and is particularly suited to estimating nonlinearities in the dynamic
response. The first regression specification is estimated
as follows:
yi,t+k – yi,t = aki + gkt + bkFEi,t + ki,t ,

(3.4)

34For simplicity of formulation, the depreciation rate is assumed
to be zero.
35Leeper, Richter, and Walker (2012) demonstrate the potentially
serious econometric problems that result from fiscal foresight. They
show that when agents foresee changes in fiscal policy, the resulting
time series have nonfundamental representations.

in which y is the log of output (debt-to-GDP ratio and
private-investment-to-output ratio); ai are country fixed
effects, included to take account of differences in countries’ growth rates; gt are time fixed effects, included to
take account of global shocks such as shifts in oil prices
or the global business cycle; and FE is the forecast error
of public investment as a share of GDP, computed as
the difference between actual and forecast series.
In the second specification, the response is allowed
to vary with the state of the economy and with the
degree of public investment efficiency. The second
regression specification is estimated as follows:
yi,t+k – yi,t = aki + gkt + bk1G(zit)FEi,t
+ bk2(1 – G(zit))FEi,t + ki,t ,

with
exp(–gzit)
G(zit) = ——————,
g > 0,
1 + exp(–gzit)
in which z is an indicator of the state of the economy
(or degree of public investment efficiency) normalized
to have zero mean and unit variance. The indicator
of the state of the economy considered in the analysis is GDP growth,36 and the measure of investment
efficiency is from the World Economic Forum’s Global
Competitiveness Report and was also used in the April
2014 Fiscal Monitor.
Equations (3.4) and (3.5) are estimated for each k =
0, . . . , 4. Impulse-response functions are computed
using the estimated coefficients bk, and the confidence
bands associated with the estimated impulse-response
functions are obtained using the estimated standard
errors of the coefficients bk, based on clustered robust
standard errors.
The macroeconomic series used in the analysis come
from the OECD’s Statistics and Projections database,
which covers an unbalanced sample of 17 OECD
economies (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Japan, Korea,
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States) over the period
36As in Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2013, g = 1.5 is used for
the analysis of recessions and expansions, g = 1.0 for the role of
public investment efficiency. The results do not qualitatively change
for different values of gamma greater than zero. Similar results are
obtained when the output gap is used to identify the state of the
economy. The main reasons for identifying the state of economy
using GDP growth instead of the output gap are that the latter is
unobservable and its estimates are highly uncertain and subject to
substantial and frequent revisions.

1985–2013. The forecasts of investment spending used
in the analysis are those reported in the fall issue of
the OECD’s Economic Outlook for the same year.37 As
a robustness check, the forecasts of the spring issue of
the same year and the fall issue of the previous year are
alternatively used. The results show that the response
functions are almost identical and not statistically significantly different from that reported in the baseline
(Table 3.4, columns 2 and 3).
A problem in the identification of public investment shocks is that they may be endogenous to output
growth surprises. Indeed, whereas automatic stabilizers operate mostly via revenues and social spending,
discretionary public investment spending can occur in
response to output conditions. Inspection of the data,
however, shows that the public investment innovations
identified are only weakly correlated (about –0.11)
with output growth surprises. Moreover, the results
obtained by separating public investment shocks from
output growth innovations are almost identical and not
statistically significantly different from those reported
in the baseline (Table 3.4, column 4).

Another possible problem in identifying public
investment shocks is a potential systematic bias in the
forecasts concerning economic variables other than
public investment, with the result that the forecast
errors for public investment are correlated with those
for other macroeconomic variables. To address this
concern, the measure of public investment shocks has
been regressed on the forecast errors of other components of government spending, private investment,
and private consumption. The results, presented in
column (5) of Table 3.4, show that the response functions are almost identical and not statistically significantly different from that reported in the baseline.
Whether public investment has a different macroeconomic impact depending on whether the
public investment shocks are positive or negative
is also assessed, using the following econometric
specification:
yi,t+k – yi,t = aki + gkt + bk+Dit FEi,t
+ bk–(1 – Dit)FEi,t + ki,t ,

(3.6)

with
37The macroeconomic series from the OECD’s Statistics and
Projections database are available for a much longer period relative
to World Economic Outlook forecasts. See Vogel 2007 and Lenain
2002 for an assessment of OECD forecasts and a comparison with
forecasts prepared by the private sector. The size of the shock varies
between –4.6 and 1.2 percentage points of GDP, with an average
(median) of about –0.3 (–0.1) percentage point of GDP.

Dit = 1 if FEit > 0, and 0 otherwise.
The results of this exercise show that although the
output effect is typically larger for positive investment
shocks than for negative ones, the difference is not
statistically significant (Table 3.4, columns 6 and 7).

The results presented in this section show that the
short-term effects of investment spending shocks are
larger in recessions than in expansions. This finding
is robust to different specifications (interacting the
shock with a recession dummy instead of a transition
function of the state of the economy) and definitions
of recessions (recessions defined as periods of negative
growth or when growth is below the 2013 OECD
average GDP growth) (Figure 3.13). Although these
results may be driven simply by the fact that these
shocks occur in periods of economic recovery, no
statistically significant correlation is found between
the measure of investment spending shocks used in
this study and the state of the economy. In particular,

and the state of the economy (change in the state of
economy) is –0.01 (0.01). Similarly, no statistically
significant correlation is found between the measure of
investment spending shocks used here and the degree
of investment efficiency. This suggests that the result
that macroeconomic effects are larger in countries with
higher investment efficiency is not driven by the fact
that investment spending shocks tend to occur more
frequently and to be larger in countries with higher
degrees of public investment efficiency.38 Finally, these
results are also robust to different measures of public
investment efficiency, such as the one presented in Box
3.3 (Figure 3.14).
Alternative approach
As an alternative approach, the dynamic macroeconomic impact of changes in public investment (as a
share of GDP) is estimated. The results, depicted in
panel 1 of Figure 3.15, show that changes in public
investment have statistically significant and long-lasting
effects on output. In particular, a 1 percentage point
of GDP increase in investment spending increases
the level of output by about 1.2 percent in the same
year and by 1.3 percent after four years. If the sample
period average response of government spending to
output (about 3 percentage points of GDP) is used,
38In particular, the correlation between investment spending
shocks and the degree of efficiency is –0.11.

CHAPTER 3

IS IT TIME FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE PUSH? THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT

the short- and medium-term investment spending
multipliers are about 1.2 and 1.3, respectively.
A 1 percentage point of GDP increase in investment spending is found to reduce the debt-to-GDP
ratio in the short term (by about 1.2 percentage points
of GDP), but the medium-term effect is surrounded
by large uncertainty and not statistically significantly
different from zero (Figure 3.15, panel 2). There is no
statistically significant effect on private investment as a
share of GDP (Figure 3.15, panel 3).
The results are qualitatively similar when changes in
public investment are instrumented with fiscal-spending-based consolidations and expansions identified
using the narrative approach (Chapter 3 of the April
2011 World Economic Outlook).39

Empirical Analysis for Developing Economies
The empirical strategy that is applied for the sample
of advanced economies requires forecasts of public
investment, which are not available over a long time
span for non-OECD economies. Given these data
limitations, three different approaches are undertaken
that provide complementary evidence on the macroeconomic effects of public investment in developing
economies.

First approach: Investment booms
The first approach employed here is to examine episodes of public investment booms and trace the evolution of key macroeconomic variables in the aftermath
of large and sustained increases in public investment.
Investment booms are identified, following Warner
(2014), as a sustained and significant increase in the
government investment ratio. Using historical series
of real public investment as a share of GDP from the
April 2014 Fiscal Monitor, the beginning of a boom is
identified as the point at which

39These narrative measures are identified as those motivated
by reasons unrelated to economic activity and are found to have
statistically significant effects on public investment. Compared with
the approach described in the previous section, this approach has
one major shortcoming, in that the vast majority of the identified
exogenous shocks are positive (that is, fiscal consolidations) and are
motivated by debt reduction and therefore may be endogenous to
debt-to-GDP ratios. In particular, out of 206 episodes, 161 are fiscal
consolidations, and only 45 are fiscal expansions.

exceeds the 80th percentile of such differences for
a particular country for at least three consecutive
years. This ensures that (1) this is a relatively large
change in investment for the specific country and
(2) the increase in investment is sustained over a
period of time.

at 3 percentage points of GDP for non–advanced
economies and 1 percentage point of GDP for
advanced economies, where public investment ratios
are significantly lower (see Figure 3.2).
Figure 3.16 presents the distribution of the beginning of public investment booms identified by this
statistical procedure across time and for advanced and
emerging market and developing economies. The vast
majority of booms studied took place in emerging
market and developing economies, with only a handful
in advanced economies. Public investment booms are
concentrated in the 1970s, when there was also a substantial buildup in the public capital stock in emerging
market and developing economies, as well as in the
mid-2000s, when public investment rates picked up
again in this group of countries (see Figure 3.2).
Once the initial year of the investment boom has
been identified, the evolution of key macroeconomic
variables in the period following the public investment
push is traced, using the estimation equation
yi,t+k – yi,t = αki + γtk + βk Boomi,t + εki,t ,

(3.7)

in which y is the log of real output (the evolution of
public investment as a share of GDP is also examined,
as well as the debt-to-GDP ratio); αi are country fixed
effects, to account for different growth rates and levels
of public investment across countries; γt are time fixed
effects that control for global shocks such as shifts in
commodity prices and global recessions; and Boomi,t
is an indicator variable that equals one in the year the
boom begins and zero otherwise. Separate regressions
are estimated for each k = {0,9}. The coefficients βk
trace the impulse-response function of the level of the
98

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

dependent variable of interest at time t + k to a public
investment boom that began at time t.
Estimating the causal impact of booms is confounded
by the fact that whether a country undergoes an investment boom and when a boom occurs are not exogenous
to the country’s macroeconomic conditions. For example,
anticipation of high growth in the future (such as from
a sustained terms-of-trade boom or discovery of natural
resources) may prompt governments to invest in infrastructure now, leading to overestimation of the causal
impact of investment. Alternatively, public investment
may be ratcheted up during times of economic slack in
the hope of providing a boost to growth, which could
potentially bias the estimated impact downward. The
goal of this exercise is simply to establish the stylized facts
around public investment booms, without claiming that
the patterns observed are caused by the boom.
Figure 3.17 depicts the evolution of public investment, output, and public debt in the 10 years following the beginning of a boom using the study’s
baseline definition of a boom (as described earlier and
presented in Figure 3.7), as well as several robustness
checks. Namely, the sensitivity of the patterns to using
alternative cutoffs for the absolute change in public
investment in identifying the booms is examined.
Although the baseline is built on an absolute difference
between the five-year-forward and five-year-backward
moving average of at least 3 percent for emerging
market and developing economies and 1 percent for
advanced economies, uniform cutoffs of 2 percent and
4 percent are also considered. Using a 2 percent cutoff
for defining a boom increases the number of booms
identified to 134; with the 4 percent cutoff, 89 booms
are identified.
Given the poor availability of data on the breakdown of total investment into public and private,
some of the data on real government investment that
are used are imputed from the total investment series,
potentially conflating the roles of the public and
private sectors. As an additional robustness check, the
series on public and private investment for each of
the 122 booms identified in the baseline are examined, and booms prior to and during which there is a
high degree of comovement between the public and
private investment series are excluded.40 This procedure
40

This methodology constitutes a rather conservative method
of defining public investment booms, as it likely excludes cases in
which the patterns in total investment reflect primarily the behavior
of public investment and cases in which there is strong complemen-

reduces the number of booms to 101. The red lines
in Figure 3.17 depict the evolution of the macroeconomic variables following the 101 booms identified
in this manner. Across all these alternative definitions
of a boom, the same patterns are observed: there is a
sustained increase in the level of output in the years
following the beginning of a public investment boom,
with no evidence of a rise in public indebtedness.
Finally, the extent to which these findings might
simply reflect the experience of economies that benefit from favorable terms-of-trade shocks or natural
resource discoveries and ratchet up public investment
in response to these growth-enhancing events is examined. The sample of economies is split into commodity
(including fuel) exporters and non–­commodity exporttarity between public and private investment. On the latter, see Eden
and Kraay 2014.

ers. The investment booms identified in the sample of
commodity exporters are clearly larger in magnitude
and are associated with a larger increase in output
(Figure 3.18). Perhaps not surprisingly, this is precisely the set of countries that drive the negative point
estimates on the evolution of the public-debt-to-GDP
ratio following booms. In the non–commodity exporters, public investment booms are followed by a small
and statistically nonsignificant increase in public debt.
Finally, zeroing in on booms that are not coincidental
to or preceded by favorable terms of trade yields results
very similar to the baseline (red lines in Figure 3.18).
Booms associated with favorable terms of trade are
defined as those for which the five-year average (that
is, from t – 4 to t, in which t is the beginning of the
boom) of the deviation of the trade-weighted terms of
trade from their long-term historical average exceeds
the 80th percentile.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: LEGACIES, CLOUDS, UNCERTAINTIES

Second approach: Exogenous public investment
shocks
The second approach is inspired by Perotti (1999)
and Corsetti, Meier, and Müller (2012). The empirical strategy relies on the idea that significant portions
of government spending (and especially investment)
are likely determined by past information and cannot
easily respond to current economic conditions. Thus,
a fiscal policy rule can be estimated for public investment and a series of exogenous shocks to public investment obtained from the residuals of this estimation.
The policy shocks are then used to trace the dynamic
effects of public investment on output.
The first step of this approach consists of estimating
an annual time series of public investment innovations.
The change in public investment (as a share of GDP)
is assumed to follow a simple rule that relates it to its
own lag, current and past debt-to-GDP ratios, past
output growth, and expectations about current economic activity (proxied by the World Economic Outlook
growth forecasts):41
Dii,t = ai + gt + bDii,t–1 + d0di,t + d1di,t–1 + ugi,t–1
+ mEi,t–1(gi,t) + i,t ,
(3.8)
in which ii,t denotes public investment as a share
of GDP; ai and gt indicate country and time fixed
effects, respectively; d is the debt-to-GDP ratio; g
denotes output growth; E(g) denotes expectation about
current economic activity; and  represents the measure of public investment shocks.
The identifying assumption is that there is no twoway contemporaneous interdependence between change
in investment and output growth. In principle, this
assumption can be violated in two ways. First, public
investment can automatically respond to cyclical conditions. This, however, should not pose a problem, because
automatic stabilizers operate mostly through revenues and
social spending. Second, discretionary public investment
spending can occur in response to output conditions. As
Corsetti, Meier, and Müller (2012) discuss, the relevance
of this concern relates to the precise definition of contemporaneous feedback effects. Although it is typically
assumed in the literature that government spending does
not react to changes in economic activity within a given
quarter (Blanchard and Perotti 2002), whether it might
41The growth forecasts used in the analysis are those reported in
the spring issue of the World Economic Outlook for the same year. As
a robustness check, the forecasts of the fall issue of the same year and
the spring issue of the previous year are alternatively used.

respond in a period longer than a quarter is an open question. Recent evidence for advanced economies (Beetsma,
Giuliodori, and Klaassen 2009; Born and Müller 2012),
however, suggests that the restriction that government
spending not respond to economic conditions within one
year cannot be rejected.
The second step consists of estimating the impact of
these innovations (êi,t) on macroeconomic outcomes, as
described in equation (3.4). Since estimating the public investment rule requires forecasts of the next year’s
growth, the estimation sample is restricted to the post1990 period, when such forecasts become available
for emerging market and developing economies. The
results are based on a sample of 77 emerging market
economies and 51 low-income countries.
In the baseline specification, the top and bottom
1 percent of shocks are trimmed from the public investment shock series. Including the entire sample leads to
smaller and statistically nonsignificant point estimates
of the effect of public investment on output. Trimming
the top and bottom 5 percent of shocks yields larger and
more statistically significant point estimates (Table 3.5).
Third approach: Instrumental variables
The third strategy builds on recent work by Kraay
(2012, forthcoming) and Eden and Kraay (2014). In
many low-income countries, loans from official creditors
(such as the World Bank and other multilateral and bilateral aid agencies) finance a significant fraction of government spending. The disbursements of these loans and
the spending they finance are spread out over many years
following the approval of the loans. Hence, part of the
fluctuation in government investment is predetermined,
because the fluctuation reflects loan approval decisions
made in previous years. If it is assumed that loan approval
decisions by creditors do not anticipate future macroeconomic shocks that matter for output, this predetermined
component of spending can be used as an instrument for
total government investment to identify the causal impact
of public investment on output.
Kraay’s (forthcoming) series on predicted disbursements of loans (excluding loans approved in the
current year) is employed as the instrument for public
investment.42 Using loan-level data from the Debtor
42Kraay (forthcoming) employs the predicted disbursements
of official loans as an instrument for total government spending,
whereas Eden and Kraay (2014) use it as an instrument for public
investment, to tease out the short-term multiplier of public investment in a set of 52 low-income countries. The work discussed in this
appendix builds on these studies by examining both the short- and

1In the baseline specification, the top and bottom 1 percent of public investment shocks are trimmed.

Reporting System database maintained by the World
Bank, Kraay (forthcoming) constructs loan-level predicted disbursements by applying to each initial loan
commitment the average disbursement profile across
all other loans issued by the same creditor in the same
decade to all countries in the same geographical region
as the actual borrower. These predicted loan-level
disbursements of previously approved loans are then
aggregated at the country-year level.43 These series are
available for the 1970–2010 period.
Because the identification strategy requires a strong
correlation between public investment and predicted
disbursements of loans, the sample is restricted to
countries where disbursements from official creditors
constitute an important source of financing. Namely,
following Kraay (forthcoming), only countries whose
disbursements of loans from official creditors equal on
average at least 1 percent of GDP over 1970–2010 are
included. This results in a regression sample covering
95 countries for which data on both public investment
and official creditors’ loan disbursements are available.
The following series of regressions is then estimated
using two-stage least squares:

in which y is the log of real output; ai are country
fixed effects; gt are time fixed effects; and Xi,t is the
change in public investment as a share of GDP, instrumented with the change in predicted disbursements of
previously approved loans. Equations are estimated for
each k = {0,4}. The coefficients bk trace the impulseresponse function of the level of output at time t + k
to a change in public investment at time t.
Table 3.6 reports the estimated coefficients bk based
on equation (3.9). Panel 1 presents the first-stage
regression results, and panel 2 reports the two-stage
least-squares estimates of the response of output to
change in public investment instrumented by the
change in predicted loan disbursements. The results
from three different samples are presented: all economies for which there are data, in column (1); only
countries in which disbursements of loans from official
creditors average at least 10 percent of total government spending, in column (2); and only countries eligible for support from the World Bank’s International
Development Agency, in column (3).
Across all three samples of economies, the effects
of public investment on output are rather imprecisely
estimated. The estimated coefficient is statistically
significant at conventional levels only for the year
following the change in investment. This could be a
result of the rather weak first stage—the F-statistics
are smaller than 10 in all three samples (Staiger and
Stock 1997)—or could simply reflect the wide variety
of experiences with public investment in developing
economies.

IS IT TIME FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE PUSH? THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT

Box 3.1. Public Investment in Japan during the Lost Decade
Public investment in Japan is sometimes criticized as
having contributed to the country’s large debt increase
and for failing to stimulate growth during the so-called
Lost Decade. But there is reason for skepticism about
such claims. To shed light on this debate, this box
revisits Japan’s experience with public investment.
It is true that Japan briskly increased public
investment in the early 1990s, but the increase was
unwound after just a few years to finance higher
social security spending for a rapidly aging population. In particular, after the bursting of the bubble
economy in the early 1990s, the government increased
public investment spending by 1½ percent of GDP,
with such spending reaching a peak of 8.6 percent
in 1996. After that, the ratio of public investment to
GDP steadily declined, picking up only recently in
the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the 2011
earthquake, and the start of Abenomics (Figure 3.1.1).
In the 20 years after 1992, the last year in which Japan
recorded a fiscal surplus, social spending increased by
10.6 percent of GDP, and public investment declined
by 2.3 percent of GDP.

Not only was there this decline in investment
throughout the late 1990s and the first decade of the
2000s, which has perhaps been less well remembered
than the fast rise in the early 1990s, but announcements of investment plans have regularly exceeded
their implementation. The ratio of public investment
plans to actual implementation was 80–85 percent
between 1998 and 2009, after which it dropped as
resources for many planned projects shifted to recovery
from a series of earthquakes that culminated with the
historic 2011 event (Figure 3.1.2). This partial implementation may also help explain the gap between the
perceived and actual growth of public investment.
However, the perception that the ability of public
investment to stimulate activity has been on a declining trend is more accurate (see, for example, Auerbach
and Gorodnichenko 2014). According to a macroeconomic model of the Japanese economy produced
by the Economic and Social Research Institute—an
arm of Japan’s Cabinet Office—the short-term public
investment multiplier declined from 1.31 in 1998 to

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

103

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: LEGACIES, CLOUDS, UNCERTAINTIES

Box 3.1 (continued)
1.14 in 2011. Potential reasons for this decline include
balance sheet adjustments (in the wake of the global
financial crisis) that may have reduced the public
investment multiplier, a lack of coordination between
fiscal and monetary policies, reduced availability of
highly productive projects, and cross subsidization
among projects (Syed, Kang, and Tokuoka 2009).1

1Because projects with different profitability rates are tracked
within the same account, a less productive infrastructure project
can sometimes be cross subsidized by a more lucrative project.

104

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

In sum, the frequent claim that Japan’s public
investment has been wasted does not fully withstand
careful examination. It is true that Japan’s public
investment has recently faced greater challenges, as
indicated by a lower multiplier effect since 1998. But
given the great burst of activity in the early 1990s,
the actual decline in the volume of public investment
relative to GDP since the late 1990s, combined with
the sharply reduced implementation of projects after
2009, may have combined to produce a misleadingly
heightened perception that Japan’s investment has
been ineffective.

CHAPTER 3

IS IT TIME FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE PUSH? THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT

Box 3.2. Improving the Efficiency of Public Investment
To be efficient, public investment must meet two
conditions: it must be allocated to projects with the
highest ratio of benefits to costs, and its aggregate level
must align with fiscal sustainability. Efficiency entails
not only the proper allocation of investment to sectors,
but also the production of public assets at the lowest
possible cost. When public investment is inefficient,
higher levels of spending may simply lead to larger
budget deficits, without increasing the quantity or
quality of roads, schools, and other public assets that
can help support economic growth.
One method for assessing the efficiency of public
investment is to estimate “efficiency frontiers.”1 If a
country has higher-quality infrastructure than other
countries with a similar or greater level of capital
stock, it is on the efficiency frontier. The further a
country is from the efficiency frontier, the lower its
efficiency score. Applying this approach, AlbinoWar and others (forthcoming) find that, on average,
emerging market and developing economies are 10–20
percent less efficient than advanced economies (Figure
3.2.1).2 The averages mask substantial differences
within each group, however, indicating a global potential for improvement.
Examining the quality of public investment management can help identify the underlying causes of these
inefficiencies. For example, the Public Investment
Management Index assigns country scores for the four
phases of public investment management: project
appraisal, selection and budgeting, implementation,
and ex post evaluation (Dabla-Norris and others
2012). These scores indicate that emerging market
economies generally perform better than low-income
countries (Figure 3.2.2).
But problems are evident in advanced economies
as well. Common challenges include weak strategic
guidance, budget planning, and project appraisal

1Estimation of the efficiency frontier involves comparing an
indicator of public infrastructure quantity (the input) to an indicator of public infrastructure quality (the output). Quantity is
the sum of past public investment, adjusted for depreciation, per
capita. Quality is the “overall quality of infrastructure” indicator
from the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report.
2As a proxy for the private sector’s provision of infrastructure,
the estimates include GDP per capita as an input. The results are
not greatly affected by adding this control (the correlation coefficient of the efficiency scores with and without GDP per capita
as an input is 0.89).

(including a failure to undertake cost-benefit analysis
systematically); poor project selection and budgeting because of rigidities in the sectoral allocation of
investment and fragmented decision making regarding
capital and current budgets and investment; completion delays and cost overruns from overly optimistic
cost estimates and inadequate cost controls; and a lack
of interim and ex post project evaluation.
Well-designed institutional arrangements for public
investment decision making and management can
help improve the efficiency of public investment (IMF,
forthcoming). For example, project appraisal can be
strengthened by instituting a centralized, independent
review process to ensure robust estimates of the costs,
benefits, and risks of potential projects, as has been
done in Australia, Chile, Korea, and Norway.
Both project appraisal and project selection can be
strengthened by preparing investment budgets from a
zero base, as in the United Kingdom, to ensure that

new capital expenditure targets those sectors with the
highest returns rather than those that have previously
benefited from substantial investment. Planning current and capital expenditure within a medium-term
budget framework can also ensure that investments
are sustainable and that maintenance spending is fully
taken into account, as is done, for example, in Australia, Chile, Ethiopia, Ireland, and Korea.
Project implementation can be improved by providing for explicit contingencies within the budget in
anticipation of cost overruns and to avoid overcommitting the budget to new projects, as in Denmark
and the United Kingdom. Finally, project evaluation
can be strengthened by undertaking more systematic
assessments of whether projects are on time, are within
budget, and deliver their expected outputs, as is done,
for example, in Chile and Korea.

Box 3.3. Fiscal Balance Sheets: The Significance of Nonfinancial Assets and Their Measurement
What assets constitute the stock of public capital in
various economies? Answering this question requires
data on the stock of nonfinancial assets within the
framework of a balance sheet that covers all levels of
government or the public sector.1
In a macroeconomic statistics balance sheet, a distinction is made between nonfinancial assets, financial
assets, liabilities, and net worth. The standard breakdown of nonfinancial assets as applied in the analytical
framework for government finance statistics is shown
in Table 3.3.1.
A recent IMF working paper (Bova and others
2013) looks at the size, composition, and management of government-owned nonfinancial assets across
32 advanced and emerging market economies. It finds
that nonfinancial assets comprise mainly structures

(such as roads and buildings) and, when valued, land
and subsoil assets. These assets have increased in value
over time, primarily because of higher property and
commodity prices, and in large part are owned by
subnational governments. However, their levels as
a percentage of GDP differ widely across countries
(Figure 3.3.1).
Although data compilation is often a first step
toward more effective asset management, the availability of internationally comparable data on nonfinancial assets is limited, and some countries report
only subcategories. Moreover, some countries report
data only for the central government rather than for
general government or the public sector. Achieving a
full, global picture of governments’ balance sheets will
require broader data coverage and the resolution of
differences in accounting methods.

Box 3.4. The Macroeconomic Effects of Scaling Up Public Investment in Developing Economies
Scaling up public investment can spur economic
advancement in developing economies, but it can also
involve some major macroeconomic challenges and
trade-offs regarding growth and debt sustainability.
This box discusses some of these benefits and challenges, paying particular attention to some factors that
shape the effects on growth and debt sustainability.
The effects of investment depend not only on the rate
of return of public capital (relative to the cost of funding), but also on the type of financing, the efficiency
of public investment, the response of the private
sector, and the authorities’ ability to implement fiscal
adjustment and manage debt. To illustrate the discussion, the box uses the Debt, Investment, and Growth
model developed by Buffie and others (2012), which is
calibrated to capture aspects pertinent to low-income
countries, such as low public investment efficiency,
limited absorptive capacity, and limited access to international and domestic borrowing.1
Figure 3.4.1 presents the macroeconomic effect of
scaling up public investment in low-income countries.
In particular, it assumes that the public-investmentto-GDP ratio increases from the current level of about
7 percent of GDP to 14 percent of GDP in about
three years and then stabilizes at about 9 percent of
GDP. The results of the simulation show that such an
increase can generate substantially greater output over
the long term (by about 7 percent after 25 years), but
it can also raise the debt-to-GDP ratio in the short to
medium term, even though part of the scaling up is
financed with concessional loans and grants (blue lines
in the figure). In the absence of nonconcessional external borrowing, taxes must increase sharply in the short
to medium term, leading to a crowding out of private
investment and consumption. The more ambitious
and front-loaded the increase in public investment,
the larger the increase in taxes and its associated effects
tend to be.

1The Debt, Investment, and Growth model is a real, dynamic,
open economy framework with several production sectors that
use public capital as an input; it allows for different financing
strategies (external concessional, external commercial, domestic)
and various fiscal rules that respond to debt paths. In the model,
efficiency is set to 0.5—that is, 1 dollar of public investment can
translate into 0.5 dollar of public capital—a ratio in line with
estimates in Pritchett 2000. See also Dabla-Norris and others
2012. The return to public capital is calibrated to 25 percent,
which is close to values provided by Foster and Briceño-Garmendia (2010) and Dalgaard and Hansen (2005).

IS IT TIME FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE PUSH? THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT

Box 3.4 (continued)
Nonconcessional external borrowing can help bridge
financing gaps and smooth difficult macroeconomic
adjustments in the short to medium term. With more borrowing, debt-to-GDP ratios can be expected to increase for
some time, but this additional financing can help ease the
fiscal adjustment and prevent the crowding out of private
consumption and investment (Figure 3.4.1). These gains
from additional nonconcessional debt should, however,
be balanced against the risks associated with this type of
financing. Policymakers may put off necessary tax increases
and expenditure cuts while continuing to borrow on nonconcessional terms, thus potentially saddling the country
with a high ratio of debt to GDP.
Resource-rich developing economies may have additional resources to finance investment increases, but they
also face additional challenges. Natural resources provide
a valuable opportunity to invest those resources domestically to speed up development (see Collier and others
2010 and van der Ploeg and Venables 2011). Resourcerich economies should design mechanisms to prevent
boom-bust cycles. They can do so by incorporating in
their plans the implications of the volatility of resource
prices and the exhaustibility of reserves, as well as by
establishing a resource fund.2 Such economies should also
be cautious about borrowing in advance (before resource
revenues materialize) to start investment programs.3
The macroeconomic effect of increasing public investment hinges on countries’ structural characteristics,
especially the efficiency of such investment. In particular, in countries with high investment efficiency, more
public investment may lead to significant growth effects
and a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the long
term (after 25 years). In countries with low investment
efficiency, however, it may lead to low growth dividends
and unsustainable debt dynamics (Figure 3.4.2).
Overall, reaping the growth and development benefits
of greater public investment while minimizing the risks
to debt sustainability in developing economies will
require policymakers to improve public investment efficiency, debt management capacity, and fiscal flexibility.

2A resource fund works as a fiscal buffer mechanism that
saves resource revenues in boom times that can be drawn down
to support investment spending during periods of low resource
revenues. See Berg and others 2013 and Melina, Yang, and
Zanna 2014.
3In the 1970s era of soaring commodity prices, many developing economies used their natural resources as collateral for loans
to undertake ambitious projects. When prices plummeted in the
1980s, these economies suffered debt crises (Gelb 1988; Manzano and Rigobón 2007).

Box 3.5. Fiscal Institutions, Rules, and Public Investment
Budget institutions affect fiscal policy outcomes and
shape the composition of the budget, including the
share of resources devoted to investment spending.
For example, stronger planning institutions have been
associated with smaller cuts in public investment over
the past four years (Figure 3.5.1, panel 1, and IMF
2014).
Budget rules also affect public investment spending,
especially in the case of the so-called golden rule of
public finance. This rule calls for excluding net investment spending from the budget balance against which
implicit or explicit fiscal discipline targets are applied.
The idea behind the rule is that a government, like a
private company, should not attribute to one year the
full cost of projects expected to generate gains over
several years.
Several arguments have been advanced in favor of
the golden rule.1 First, financing investment out of
current revenue may conflict with other spending
objectives of policy authorities or with institutional or
political constraints. Under such conditions, amending
the budget constraint with a golden rule may allow a
rise in productive investment, which adds to the stock
of public capital and raises output. Second, the golden
rule takes into account that borrowing to finance
productive public investment could pay for itself over
the longer term, both through user fees and through
higher tax revenues resulting from higher output.
Third, spreading the costs of public investment over
time promotes intergenerational equity, shifting part of
the cost of investment to future beneficiaries. Finally,
if public investment is productive, a balanced current
budget is consistent with a positive, steady-state ratio
of public debt to GDP and with optimal fiscal policy.
T﻿he golden rule can also entail significant budgetary
and economic development risks (see for example Balassone and Franco 2000 and Buiter 2001). First, in the
presence of excess demand, public investment should be
part of the fiscal adjustment required to bring domestic
absorption into line with resource availability. Second,
investments carry no guarantee of success, and even
public investments that significantly boost economic
growth may not reduce budgetary pressures if the
tax base is limited or tax enforcement is weak. Third,
freeing public investment from fiscal constraints may

IS IT TIME FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE PUSH? THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT

Box 3.5 (continued)
discriminate against desirable forms of private involvement in infrastructure, such as when it brings efficiency
to the investment, and it may bias spending toward
physical capital and sacrifice current expenditure on
human capital such as health and education spending.
Finally and importantly, the golden rule may induce
creative accounting that excludes some current spending
from fiscal targets by classifying it as investment. Strong
institutional capacity is therefore needed to ensure that
adopting the golden rule achieves its objective without
raising fiscal risks. Moreover, in countries with serious
concerns about debt sustainability, implementing the
golden rule may simply not be feasible because there are
few alternatives to focusing on the overall balance.
Has the golden rule been effective in protecting
public investment from fiscal contractions? A novel
database, the IMF’s Fiscal Rules Dataset, facilitates an
empirical investigation of this question for a set of 56
economies, including 6 with the golden rule in place
at some point during 1985–2013.2
The way the golden rule shapes how fiscal adjustments affect public investment as a share of GDP is
estimated using the following empirical specification:
yi,t+k – yi,t = aki + gkt + bK1GRi,tFAi,t
+ bK2(1 – GRi,t )FAi,t + dGRi,t
+ Xi,t + ki,t ,
(3.5.1)
in which y is public investment as share of GDP; ai are
country fixed effects; gt are time fixed effects; GRi,t is
a dummy variable that equals one when country i has
in place a golden rule in year t; X is a vector of control
variables, including lags of output growth and debt-toGDP ratio; and FA is a dummy that equals one for the
2The database covers 56 advanced, emerging market, and
developing economies, of which 9 had a golden rule in place
at some point between 1985 and 2013 (Brazil, Costa Rica,
Germany, Japan, Kosovo, Liberia, Malaysia, Pakistan, United
Kingdom). Database limitations for Kosovo, Liberia, and Malaysia restrict the present analysis of golden-rule countries to the
remaining 6.

starting year t of the fiscal adjustment in each country
i and zero otherwise. Fiscal consolidation (expansion)
episodes are identified as two-year periods in which
the cyclically adjusted primary-balance-to-GDP ratio
improves (deteriorates) in each year and the cumulative
improvement (deterioration) is equivalent to at least 2
percent of GDP (Alesina and Ardagna 2012).
The results (Figure 3.5.1) show that the golden rule
has helped preserve public investment following periods of fiscal contraction (while having no statistically
significant effect following periods of fiscal expansion).
In particular, although public investment declined by
about 0.4 percentage point of GDP on average one
year after a consolidation episode in countries with
no golden rule in place, the decline in investment was
significantly smaller in countries with a golden rule.
These results have to be interpreted with caution,
however, because causality is difficult to establish.
The results are robust to the inclusion of a broader
sample of 18 countries with rules that fully or partially
exclude public investment from the ceiling.
In recent years, a number of advanced economies
have improved the design of their fiscal rules by adopting so-called second-generation fiscal rules, which allow
for greater flexibility to accommodate shocks while
maintaining the government’s commitment to mediumand long-term fiscal sustainability (IMF 2014). The
European countries with the largest economies (France,
Germany, Italy, United Kingdom) have taken steps to
enshrine their fiscal rules in law. Other advanced economies, including Australia, Canada, Japan, and Korea,
have more clearly specified their fiscal policy objectives
and rules without embedding them in law.
Fiscal rules are also increasingly supported by more
comprehensive and binding medium-term expenditure frameworks. Since 2010, Germany, Italy, and the
United Kingdom have strengthened their mediumterm budget frameworks by either improving their
institutional coverage or tightening multiyear expenditure limits.

ARE GLOBAL IMBALANCES AT A TURNING POINT?

Global current account (“flow”) imbalances have narrowed
significantly since their peak in 2006, and their configuration has changed markedly in the process. The imbalances
that used to be the main concern—the large deficit in the
United States and surpluses in China and Japan—have
more than halved. But some surpluses, especially those in
some European economies and oil exporters, remain large,
and those in some advanced commodity exporters and major
emerging market economies have since moved to deficit.
This chapter argues that the reduction of large flow imbalances has diminished systemic risks to the global economy.
Nevertheless, two concerns remain. First, the nature of the
flow adjustment—mostly driven by demand compression in
deficit economies or growth differentials related to the faster
recovery of emerging market economies and commodity
exporters after the Great Recession—has meant that in many
economies, narrower external imbalances have come at the
cost of increased internal imbalances (high unemployment
and large output gaps). The contraction in these external
imbalances is expected to last as the decrease in output due
to lowered demand has likely been matched by a decrease in
potential output. However, there is some uncertainty about
the latter, and there is the risk that flow imbalances will
widen again. Second, since flow imbalances have shrunk but
not reversed, net creditor and debtor positions (“stock imbalances”) have widened further. In addition, weak growth has
contributed to increases in the ratio of net external liabilities to GDP in some debtor economies. These two factors
make some of these economies more vulnerable to changes in
market sentiment. To mitigate these risks, debtor economies
will ultimately need to improve their current account balances and strengthen growth performance. Stronger external
demand and more expenditure switching (from foreign to
domestic goods and services) would help on both accounts.
Policy measures to achieve both stronger and more balanced
growth in the major economies, including in surplus economies with available policy space, would also be beneficial.

Introduction
A worrying trend in the run-up to the global
financial crisis was the widening of current account
imbalances in some of the world’s largest economies.
The concerns were fourfold: first, that some of the
imbalances reflected domestic distortions, from large
public deficits in some economies to excessive private
saving in others, correction of which was in individual
economies’ self-interest; second, that some of the
imbalances might be reflecting intentional distortions,
such as unfair trade practices or exchange rate policies,
with adverse implications for trade partners; third, that
a reduction in the U.S. current account deficit would
likely require a slowdown in U.S. domestic demand
growth, which—absent stronger demand elsewhere—
would weaken global growth; and fourth, that the
economies with large deficits and growing external
liabilities, most notably the United States, might suffer
an abrupt loss of confidence and financing, leading to
massive disruptions of the international monetary and
financial systems.1
A decade later, where do we stand?
Flow imbalances—current account surpluses and
deficits—have narrowed markedly, and inasmuch as
they reflected domestic distortions, this narrowing has
benefited both the economies suffering from them and
the system as a whole. In addition, imbalances—especially deficits—have become less concentrated, so the
risks of a sudden reversal (or the consequences thereof )
are likely to have diminished. Two issues remain,
however. How much of the narrowing is temporary
and how much is permanent? And how worried should
we be that net foreign asset positions have continued
to diverge because flow imbalances have only narrowed
rather than reversed?
Consensus on these issues has yet to emerge. Some
view the large global imbalances of the mid-2000s as a
past phenomenon, unlikely to return; others, how1See, for example, the September 2006 World Economic Outlook,
as well as IMF 2007 and its discussion by the IMF Executive Board
(https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2007/pn0797.htm).

ever, are more skeptical that the adjustment that has
taken place will prove durable, and they urge greater
policy action to address the remaining imbalances.2
These opposing perspectives (and their accompanying
policy prescriptions) suggest that there is a need to
better understand the mechanics of adjustment and
the extent to which the domestic and international
distortions that underlay the precrisis imbalances have
been addressed.
This chapter thus assesses whether global imbalances
remain—or might again become—a matter of concern.
To do so, it traces the evolution of global imbalances
before and after the global financial crisis and seeks to
answer the following key questions:
•• How has the distribution of flow imbalances
changed over time as they have narrowed? Has the
narrowing been due more to expenditure changing
or to expenditure switching from foreign to domestic goods and services? Will imbalances widen again
as output gaps are closed?
•• How have stock imbalances evolved? What are the
underlying forces, and what are the likely future
dynamics?
The main findings are as follows:
•• With the narrowing of systemic current account
balances, the configuration of global imbalances
has shifted markedly since their peak in 2006.
The imbalances that were the main concern at the
time—the large deficit of the United States and
the large surpluses of China and Japan—have all
decreased by at least half relative to world GDP.
At the same time, though not the original focus of
concerns about global imbalances, the unsustainability of some large European deficits became apparent,
and these economies have been undergoing often
painful external adjustment.
•• Beyond these major changes, the pattern of surpluses and deficits has changed in other ways.
Some major emerging market economies and a few
advanced commodity exporters have moved from
2Eichengreen (2014) argues that global imbalances are over
because neither the United States (the largest deficit economy in
2006) nor China (the largest surplus economy in 2006) will return
to precrisis growth and spending patterns. Lane and Milesi-Ferretti
(2012) find that although current account imbalances have been corrected, the external adjustment has been unbalanced, relying mostly
on a reduction in demand in deficit economies. El-Erian (2012)
warns of complacency, arguing that although global imbalances
have narrowed, there remains a need to implement policy changes
to address the remaining domestic and international distortions that
underlie global imbalances.

surplus to deficit. The surpluses of oil exporters
and those of European surplus economies, however,
remain quite large.
•• Corrective movements in real effective exchange
rates (currency depreciations for deficit economies,
appreciations for surplus economies) have played a
surprisingly limited role overall, and hence so has
expenditure switching.3 Much of the recent adjustment in flow imbalances has therefore been driven
by the reduction in demand in deficit economies
after the global financial crisis or by growth differentials related to the faster recovery of emerging
market economies and commodity exporters after
the Great Recession. Factors that may have worked
against anticipated exchange rate realignment
include changes in investor sentiment (for example,
safe haven flows after the crisis) and the fact that the
euro area includes economies with both large precrisis deficits and large precrisis surpluses. Also, other
shocks (such as increased energy production in the
United States and the decline of energy production
in Japan following the 2011 earthquake) would have
implied reductions in the absolute size of current
account balances for given exchange rates.
•• The decrease in output due to lowered demand
has been largely matched by a decrease in potential
output. Thus, even without expenditure switching,
much of the narrowing of the imbalances in deficit
economies should be seen as permanent. However,
the size of output gaps is highly uncertain, including
in some euro area deficit economies, and therefore
so is the future path of current account balances.
•• Stock imbalances have not decreased—on the contrary, they have widened—mainly because of continued flow imbalances, coupled with low growth
in several advanced economies. Some large debtor
economies thus remain vulnerable to changes in
market sentiment, highlighting continued possible
systemic risks, though the status of the U.S. dollar
as a reserve currency seems, if anything, more secure
now than in 2006.
The chapter proceeds by first documenting the
reduction in global imbalances since 2006 and examin3The September 2006 World Economic Outlook, for instance,
argued that a “gradual and orderly unwinding of imbalances” was
the most likely outcome, with a sustained depreciation of the U.S.
dollar in real terms and a real effective exchange rate appreciation
in surplus economies. Obstfeld and Rogoff (2005) noted that any
significant improvement in the U.S. trade balance would typically
involve a large depreciation of the U.S. dollar in real terms.

ing their changing constellation during that period. It
then examines the mechanics of the adjustments that
took place and considers whether global imbalances
could widen again with a pickup in global growth.
Finally, the chapter addresses the dynamics of stock
imbalances, considers how both stock and flow imbalances are likely to evolve, and offers conclusions.

Narrowing the Bulge: The Evolution of Flow
Imbalances
At the level of an individual country, there is no presumption that the current account should be balanced,
and there may be good economic reasons to run current
account surpluses or deficits. Large deficits—and associated large net foreign financial liabilities—however,
expose the country to the risks of a sudden cessation in
financing or the rolling over of those liabilities. If the
economy is systemically important, a “sudden stop” of
such financing could have wider repercussions. Large
surpluses present fewer risks, but they can be problematic from a multilateral perspective if they are driven by
export-led growth strategies or if they arise in a world
of deficient aggregate demand—as has been the case
since the global financial crisis. Indeed, distortions may
be transmitted globally through surpluses and deficits
if they occur in large economies, undermining the efficient operation of the international monetary system.
And the more concentrated the imbalances, the greater
the risks to the global economy. The configuration of
current account imbalances in the mid-2000s, with
large deficits for the United States and large surpluses
for China and Japan, is widely understood to have met
those criteria for systemic risk. This section documents
the evolution of global imbalances since 2006, without passing judgment (yet) on the desirability of their
dynamics.
Current account imbalances have narrowed substantially since their peak eight years ago, shortly before
the global financial crisis (Figure 4.1). At that time, the
sum of the absolute values of current account balances
across all economies peaked at 5.6 percent of world
GDP. Global imbalances subsequently shrank by almost
one-third in 2009 at the height of the global recession.
They rebounded somewhat in 2010 but have narrowed
again since, declining to about 3.6 percent in 2013.
Likewise, from 2006 through 2013, the aggregate imbalance of the top 10 deficit economies dropped by nearly
half as a percentage of world GDP, from 2.3 percent to
1.2 percent (Table 4.1), and the corresponding value for

the top 10 surplus economies dropped by one-fourth,
from 2.1 percent to 1.5 percent.
The constellation of deficits and surpluses also
changed by 2013 (Table 4.1; Figures 4.2 and 4.3). On
the deficit side, the large U.S. deficit shrank by half in
dollar terms and by almost two-thirds as a percentage
of world GDP. European economies with large deficits—though not the focus of initial concerns about
imbalances—moved as a whole to a small surplus
(Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, and Spain). Deficits
in some advanced commodity exporters (Australia and
Canada) rose, and those of some major emerging market economies (Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and
Turkey), some of which had run surpluses in 2006,

moved up to occupy the remaining top 10 spots.4
Overall, the concentration of deficits also fell dramatically: in dollar terms, the top 5 economies in 2006
accounted for 80 percent of the global deficit; in 2013,
the top 5 accounted for less than 65 percent of the
(reduced) total.
On the other side, China’s surplus almost halved
in relation to world GDP, putting it second to that of
Germany. Also especially notable is Japan, nearly tied
for second place in 2006 but absent from the top 10
in 2013. Major factors behind the decline of China’s
surplus were sharply higher investment, expansionary
fiscal policy in response to the global financial crisis,
booms in credit and asset prices, and lower external
demand—all of which were reflected in substantial
nominal and real effective exchange rate appreciation. Japan’s trade balance moved into deficit for the

first time since 1980, in part because of higher energy
imports after the Great East Japan earthquake, the
disruption to exports after the earthquake as well as the
Thai floods, and increased public spending since the
crisis. The surpluses of some European economies (Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland), by contrast, together
with those of oil exporters, remained large.5 Although
Norway and Russia (and Singapore) dropped out of
the top 10, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates joined
that group, along with the Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China. The share of the top 5 economies in the global dollar surplus barely changed, with
those economies accounting for about half the total.
Therefore, in the most recent picture, the overall
constellation of global imbalances looks quite different
than that in 2006. What brought about this change
and whether the narrowing of the imbalances is likely
to persist are the subjects of the next two sections.

5For at least some oil exporters, current account surpluses are
insufficient from an intergenerational equity perspective.

The large current account surpluses in China and Japan fell substantially as a
percentage of national GDP between 2006 and 2013. A number of northern
European and advanced Asian economies were running even greater surpluses
by 2013, while some major emerging market economies moved from surpluses
to deﬁcits.

The Mechanics of the Adjustment
In principle, external adjustment can take place
through changes in aggregate expenditure or changes
in its composition. In practice, adjustment in deficit
economies often takes place through expenditure reduction. That is certainly the case for the 2006–13 period
(see, for example, Lane and Milesi-­Ferretti 2014). This
has meant that the squeeze in external (flow) imbalances was accompanied by a substantial widening of
internal imbalances, that is, greater economic slack (to
the extent that the declines in output in deficit economies have been cyclical, driven only by temporarily low
demand). In a number of deficit economies, mostly
advanced, the adjustment took place amid the typical
legacy of financial crisis: a downshift in the path of
output relative to precrisis trends (approximated by the
medium-term output forecasts from the October 2006
World Economic Outlook).
The panels in Figure 4.4—which show a number
of key variables for the main individual deficit and
surplus economies established in Table 4.1, as well as

for various groups of economies—highlight the downshift in output for the United States and European
deficit economies. The output contractions were highly
synchronized across advanced economies, in deficit and
surplus economies alike, as were the declines in output
paths. Nevertheless, the output contractions and
downshifts were typically smaller, relatively speaking,
in surplus economies, which experienced only mild
financial crises, if any, and were mostly hit by spillovers. In China and other emerging market economies,
output remained close to precrisis trends.
If the reduction in demand and output in deficit
economies was the main mechanism for the post-2006
adjustment in global imbalances (and trade spillovers
one of the transmission mechanisms), one would
expect to see a relatively stronger export contraction
in major surplus economies. This was indeed the case
in China and oil exporters, and to a lesser extent in
Japan, where exports contracted more than imports.

economies thus broadly led to some demand rebalancing between deficit and surplus economies.
Weak domestic demand mainly reflected a sharp
contraction in investment expenditure in most economies, but more so for deficit economies than for those
in surplus. This, in turn, helped narrow the current
account imbalances of advanced deficit economies (for
example, the United States and a number of European
deficit economies) and at the same time improved
the financial net lending and borrowing positions of
households and nonfinancial corporations. Although
aggregate investment also fell in advanced surplus
economies (for example, Japan and several northern
European economies), this decline was more than
offset by a reduction in aggregate saving, which led to
an overall narrowing of their surpluses.6 In contrast,
China, the largest surplus economy in 2006, experienced a significant increase in investment, which,
compounded by a small decline in national saving,
resulted in a substantial narrowing of its current
account surplus.7
Such rebalancing continued because many surplus
economies, emerging market economies in particular,
recovered faster from the global financial crisis than
advanced economies in deficit. The sources of the differential reflected not only macroeconomic policy stimulus, notably in China, but also strong capital inflows,
the rebound in commodity markets, and gains in terms
of trade, which also boosted domestic demand.
These growth differentials supported further demand
rebalancing, leading to relatively faster growth of import
volumes and a rising divergence of the path for export
volume from that for import volume. Current account
surpluses declined, with some major emerging market
economies experiencing current account reversals. Oil
exporters were the main exception; their current account
balances improved with higher oil prices, notwithstanding rapid import growth. The flip side to the rising
terms of trade for commodity exporters was termsof-trade losses in commodity importers, including in
deficit economies; all else equal, the terms-of-trade losses
6Germany

was the exception, with a relatively larger decrease
in overall investment relative to saving, leaving it as the only large
surplus economy to experience a widening of its surplus.
7Much of the increase in the investment-to-GDP ratio (5.5 percentage points) took place during the period 2006–09. The saving
rate also increased during this period, partly offsetting the impact
on the current account surplus, which fell by 3.5 percentage points.
Since 2009 the saving rate has declined and the investment-to-GDP
ratio has increased modestly, with a further 2.8 percentage point
adjustment in the current account.

122

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

lowered the improvements in external current accounts
in nominal terms or as a percentage of GDP.
Real currency appreciation in some surplus economies and depreciation in some deficit economies suggest
that some expenditure switching has taken place in the
recent narrowing of imbalances. Currency appreciation
in China, commodity exporters, and emerging market
economies stands out on the surplus side; dollar depreciation has helped in the United States. In contrast, there
has been little real appreciation in Japan or depreciation
in European deficit and European surplus economies.
This underscores how pegged currencies and downward nominal rigidities in a number of stressed deficit
economies, notably in the euro area, have constrained the
relative price adjustment needed for the reallocation of
resources between tradables and nontradables. The CPIbased real effective exchange rate measure used in the
analysis may, however, understate the impact of changes
in relative prices on the current account relative to other
measures, such as relative unit labor costs. Unfortunately, unit-labor-cost-based real effective exchange rates
are available only for a relatively limited set of (mostly
advanced) economies.
The relationship between a country’s 2006 current account balance and the subsequent growth in
domestic demand relative to that of its trading partners
is positive and statistically significant (Figure 4.5).
That is, economies with surpluses (deficits) experienced
faster (slower) demand growth compared with their
partners. The same is true of the subsequent change
in the value of currencies (Figure 4.6): economies
with surpluses (deficits) experienced real appreciations
(depreciations) relative to their trading partners.
Although both expenditure reduction and expenditure
switching have been at play, the subsequent adjustment in
current account balances has been more strongly related
to changes in relative domestic demand (Figure 4.7) than
to changes in the real effective exchange rate (Figure 4.8).
More formal analysis is afforded by a panel regression
of the annual change in the current account (as a share
of GDP) on the change in aggregate demand relative
to that in trading partners, changes in the real effective
exchange rate, and changes in the terms of trade. The
regression yields statistically significant coefficients with
the expected sign for all explanatory variables.8 The R 2 of
8The panel consists of 64 economies for the period 1970–2013;
see Appendix 4.2 for details. The real effective exchange rate is
potentially endogenous to the current account, which tends to bias
the coefficient downward, so the finding of a statistically significant
negative coefficient is despite, not because of, any endogeneity bias.

the regression (including lags of all explanatory variables)
is 0.41; dropping the aggregate demand terms lowers it to
0.10, but dropping the real effective exchange rate term
lowers it only to 0.39. In other words, the real effective
exchange rate, though statistically significant, adds little to
the explanatory power of the regression. For the 2007–13
period, the relative importance of the demand terms is
even more apparent: the (implied) R 2 of the full model
for this period is 0.51; without the demand terms it is
0.02, and without the real effective exchange rate term,
it is 0.51. The importance of expenditure reduction in
the recent adjustment can also be gauged by comparing

The limited explanatory power of the real effective exchange rate in the current account adjustment
reflects a number of factors beyond the generally dominant role of demand changes in a global crisis context.
Structural and institutional factors limited real effective
exchange rate adjustment in some cases, notably within
the euro area.9 In the case of the United States and

Expenditure reduction played an important role in current account adjustment
between 2006 and 2013. Economies with a larger (smaller) contraction in
domestic demand relative to that of their trading partners typically experienced
a larger (smaller) improvement in their current account balances.

Expenditure switching also was at work in current account adjustment between
2006 and 2013. Economies with depreciated (appreciated) currencies typically
experienced an improvement (deterioration) in their current account balances.

have weakened the relation between exchange rate
changes and current account adjustment. In the case
of the United States, for example, increased production of tight oil led to current account improvements,
while the underlying equilibrium exchange rate likely
appreciated. Finally, changes in investor sentiment have
sometimes worked against real effective exchange rate
realignment, including, for example, in the case of safe
haven flows.
The 2006–13 episode is not, of course, the first time
that global imbalances have contracted: previous occasions include 1974 and 1986. The latter provides an
instructive contrast with the current instance (Box 4.1):
the real effective exchange rate pictures were broadly
similar, with the yen appreciating substantially in real

effective terms in that episode while the dollar depreciated. No other currencies changed notably in real effective terms. In the former West Germany, for example,
real appreciation began only with reunification in 1990.
If anything, the reach of exchange rate changes has been
broader in the current episode, with the currencies of
major emerging market economies and commodity
exporters also appreciating.
The main difference between these adjustment episodes is in the growth environment. Whereas in 1986
the narrowing of imbalances took place in the context
of growth rotating above preadjustment trends, the
narrowing in the current instance has occurred in the
context of the global financial crisis, with likely permanent losses in output levels and, in some cases, even

CHAPTER 4

lower trend growth. Not surprisingly, demand reduction has contributed more to the recent narrowing
than in 1986, and expenditure switching correspondingly less.
Juxtaposing the external adjustment of the worstaffected East Asian crisis economies in the late 1990s
with that of four of the euro area economies most
severely affected by the recent crises provides another
useful comparison (Box 4.2). Massive and sustained
real depreciations, together with a supportive external
environment, allowed the East Asian economies to
benefit from expenditure switching. By contrast, the
four stressed euro area economies during the current
episode have experienced only limited expenditure
switching so far: the adjustment of relative prices
through internal devaluation has been gradual and
more painful, hurting their growth prospects (see, for
instance, Tressel and others 2014).10 The narrowing of
global imbalances during the current episode is thus
bracketed by the two extremes of the East Asian and
the euro area experiences.
Overall, the limited role of exchange rate adjustments in the narrowing of imbalances has meant that
that process has entailed high economic and social
costs—most notably, high rates of unemployment and
large output gaps—partly because resources were not
quickly reallocated between tradables and nontradables
sectors. However, it has also allowed for substantial
adjustment without disruptive exchange rate adjustments to the major reserve currencies (most notably,
the dollar) that some feared before the global financial
crisis. In the process, the distortions underlying the
large imbalances up to about 2006, that is, asset price
bubbles and credit booms in many advanced economies, have also largely corrected—though others may
have emerged, including because of the expansionary
policies that the crisis has engendered.

The Durability of the Adjustment
How lasting is the observed narrowing of current
account imbalances likely to be? There are two elements to this question. Mechanically, as activity recovers and output gaps start to close, domestic demand
will rebound in deficit economies; the concern is that
without sufficient expenditure switching, this rebound
10See Berger and Nitsch 2014 and Ghosh, Qureshi, and Tsangarides 2014 for evidence that imbalances within the euro area became
more persistent with the adoption of the euro.

Are Global Imbalances at a Turning Point?

could lead to a renewed widening of external imbalances.11 Going beyond such mechanics, it is worth
asking whether the policy and other distortions that
underlie global imbalances have diminished, especially
because—other than the risk of a sudden stop—it is
these distortions that carry implications for multilateral
welfare. Moreover, inasmuch as policy and other distortions do not—or should not—reappear, the extent
to which they have diminished speaks to the durability
of the observed adjustment.

Output Gaps and Imbalances
Whether global imbalances will, in the absence of
further expenditure switching, again expand as the
recovery gets under way is closely linked to the issue
of whether output declines in deficit economies since
the global financial crisis have been largely cyclical
or structural. Experience from past financial crises
suggests that potential output often declines and the
country never recovers its precrisis growth path (see
Cerra and Saxena 2008), but it is extraordinarily difficult to arrive at a definitive judgment—especially
in regard to what happens after a far-reaching global
financial crisis.
To determine the sensitivity of estimates of the
extent to which the observed narrowing of flow imbalances will reverse as output gaps close, Figure 4.9
presents different scenarios using alternative assumptions about output gaps, estimates of which are subject
to sizable uncertainty.12 Between 2006 and 2013,

13The sensitivity analysis is based on alternative assumptions
about the output gaps of the Group of Twenty economies. Both in
2006 and in 2013, these economies accounted for more than threequarters of global deficits and about one-half of global surpluses. The
four largest economies—China, Germany, Japan, and the United
States—accounted for 60 percent of total deficits and 40 percent
of total surpluses in 2006 and 35 percent of total deficits and 31
percent of total surpluses in 2013.

The narrowing of current account imbalances since 2006 is likely to be long
lasting, as cyclical factors appear to have played a relatively minor role. Even in
the worst-case scenario, which results from estimating output gaps as the
difference between the actual level of output in 2013 and the 2013 level
extrapolated using precrisis trends, the current account narrowing amounts to
around 1½ percent of world GDP (which is almost half the adjustment without
cyclical factors).

cally adjusted global imbalance in 2013 with the actual
level in 2006 yields a narrowing of 2.6 percent of
world GDP (Figure 4.9, panel 1).14 The implication is
that virtually all of the narrowing of global imbalances
observed to date should be durable and should not
reverse as output gaps close.
14Economies are classified as surplus or deficit based on their
positions in 2006. Therefore, the adjustment of global imbalances reported in this section differs somewhat from that reported
elsewhere in this chapter, where economies are classified as surplus or
deficit according to their position each year.

126

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

This surprisingly modest estimate for the cyclical
component of the global imbalances derives from the
synchronicity of output gaps across economies (because
it is the difference in output gaps that matters) and
from the fact that the output gaps themselves are
(relatively) small. In particular, in the WEO data, the
economies that saw the greatest declines in output
relative to precrisis trends also experienced the largest
slowdowns in potential output growth, compressing
the range of output gaps.
An alternative view is that an economy’s capacity
to produce cannot simply be destroyed in a financial
crisis, whereas a sharp increase in uncertainty, pessimistic expectations, disruption of financing, and
other factors could lead to large, but still temporary,
decreases in demand. An extreme version of this
view is that the full extent of the deviation of output from the 2013 level that would be implied by
precrisis trends represents the output gap. Applying
this alternative assumption naturally gives significantly larger cyclically adjusted global imbalances
for 2013: a deficit of 1.8 percent of world GDP and
a surplus of 2.3 percent of world GDP, for a total
imbalance of 4.1 percent of world GDP (Figure 4.9,
panel 2). The improvement in global imbalances
since 2006 would then amount to only 1.5 percent
of world GDP. Thus, in this scenario, almost half of
the observed adjustment could be undone as output
gaps close.
It turns out, however, that it is mainly the
U.S. economy that is critical to this calculation. The
WEO output gap for the United States in 2013 is
3.8 percent, whereas the trend-based alternative would
imply a gap of 10.7 percent, which seems implausible
and is hard to reconcile with, for example, improving
labor market indicators. Returning to the WEO gap
for the United States (keeping all others at their trend
deviation gaps) in the counterfactual simulation, or
returning to the WEO gaps for both the United States
and China, restores the narrowing in the cyclically
adjusted global imbalances since 2006 to about 2 percent of world GDP (Figure 4.9, panel 2).
Keeping in mind the sizable uncertainty surrounding estimates of output gaps (notably but not only for
the euro area), this suggests that even under extreme
assumptions about the size of output gaps, one-half
of the observed shrinkage in global imbalances would
remain as these gaps close; a more plausible gap
assumption for the United States alone would mean
that two-thirds should endure.

CHAPTER 4

15In what follows, “cyclically adjusted” refers to the WEO output
gaps, not the trend deviation output gaps, which were used only for
the alternative scenario for the counterfactual analysis earlier in the
chapter.
16These arguments are developed by Blanchard and Milesi-Ferretti
(2012).
17Policy gaps or distortions are deviations of actual policy stances
(that is, fiscal balances, health spending, foreign exchange intervention, private credit, and capital controls) from their desirable or
appropriate levels (as determined by IMF country desks). At the
same time, to ensure global consistency, domestic policies are considered relative to foreign policies.

Concerns about global imbalances go beyond just their
magnitude: from the outset, a key issue in debates has
been the extent to which observed imbalances are manifestations of underlying policy distortions. A complementary approach to assessing the durability of the correction
to date is therefore to ask whether the underlying distortions have diminished in the intervening years.
To this end, this section compares observed cyclically
adjusted current account balances15 with those predicted
using the IMF’s External Balance Assessment (EBA)
framework, which is an empirical model of current
account determination. Put differently, the residuals
from the EBA regression, also known in this context as
“current account gaps,” can be considered an indicator
of the proportion of current account balances that cannot be explained by a country’s macroeconomic fundamentals. They are thus a measure of excessive imbalances
reflective of underlying distortions and possibly systemic
risks.16 Three important caveats bear emphasizing. First,
determining globally consistent measures of current
account gaps remains difficult and is model specific. To
the extent that the EBA model omits certain unobserved fundamentals, the residual imputes their effect
to distortions. Second, some of the variables in the
regression are policy variables, which need not necessarily be at desirable or sustainable settings. Although the
EBA model in its operational form explicitly corrects for
deviations between actual and desirable policies (“policy
gaps”), time series of “desirable” policy settings are not
available for historical data; in the exercise that follows,
therefore, the 2013 estimates of desirable policy settings
are applied to 2006 as well.17 Third, even for 2013, IMF
staff assessments of current account gaps (provided in
the IMF’s External Sector Report) draw on the EBAbased current account gaps (and in most cases are very
similar to them) but also reflect staff judgment.

Current account gaps fell between 2006 and 2013 for the largest and
systemically most important economies. This suggests that underlying distortions
and global risks also shrank. The contribution of policy gaps in most economies
either narrowed or remained roughly unchanged, with the exception of a few
emerging market economies. The latter implies that the current account gaps for
these economies were larger than reported.

magnitude is proportional to the country’s share of
world GDP) that lie below the 45-degree line indicate
a smaller current account gap in 2013 than in 2006.
The general picture that emerges from the analysis is that current account gaps tended to decrease
between 2006 and 2013 for the largest and systemically most important economies. As such, underlying distortions and global risks also became smaller.
However, they did not disappear. In particular, whereas
the current account gaps for China, European deficit
economies, and the United States were close to zero
128

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

in 2013, they remained elevated for European surplus
economies, including Germany.
The residuals above exclude the estimated effects
of policy gaps, which are shown separately in Figure 4.11, panel 2. For a few (mostly emerging market)
economies, the estimated effect of policy gaps on
current account imbalances is larger in 2013 than it
was in 2006. Adding these policy gaps to the residuals would therefore widen the current account gaps
for these economies. In most cases, however, the net
contribution of policy gaps to current account gaps
either remained roughly constant or diminished
between 2006 and 2013.
What policies were behind these improvements in
the larger economies? In the United States, despite
some improvement in the cyclically adjusted fiscal balance, since it is the difference in the balance relative to
other trading partners that matters, the fiscal variable
actually results in a slight widening of the policy gap
between 2006 and 2013.19 A more telling improvement relates to excesses in the financial sector, which
both the bust phase of the boom-bust cycle and tighter
regulation have helped reduce.20 The net change in the
U.S. policy gap between 2006 and 2013, therefore, is
roughly a wash—and the bubble for the United States
in Figure 4.11 (panel 2) lies on the 45-degree line. In
China, the policy improvement is captured by slower
accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and some
relaxation of capital controls, which are the counterparts to the substantial real effective exchange rate
appreciation. The policy gap therefore shrinks significantly. Not all of the narrowing of the current account
surplus is necessarily benign, however. Rather than a
decline in saving, much of the change in China’s current account between 2006 and 2013 comes through
an increase in the already-high rate of investment,
exacerbating concerns about allocative efficiency and
financial stability and raising questions about its sus19The U.S. fiscal balance (relative to trading partners) improved
through 2009, then deteriorated between 2010 and 2013, implying
little difference between snapshots of 2006 and 2013.
20In the EBA regression, most excesses are captured by the residual
(“distortions”) rather than policy variables such as the quality of
financial regulation (which is difficult to quantify in a statistical
analysis). The only policy variable proxying such excesses is the
growth of the ratio of credit to GDP. This is why the bulk of the
improvement in the current account gap for the United States shows
up in the regression residual rather than in the effect of the policy
gap variable. It is also why it would not be appropriate to make too
sharp a distinction between “policy distortions” and “other distortions” in the analysis.

CHAPTER 4

tainability. For Germany, the net impact of the policy
gap shrinks because the effect of lower excessive credit
growth (that is, credit growth greater than the rate of
GDP growth) more than offsets the tightening of the
fiscal balance (relative to trading partners), which itself
contributes to widening Germany’s current account
surplus.
Although such analysis can never be definitive
(being highly dependent on the model used to identify
“fundamentals”), it does suggest that policy and other
distortions have diminished along with the observed
narrowing of flow imbalances during the past few
years. The improvement in global imbalances thus is
not only quantitative but rather represents, from a
multilateral perspective, a qualitative improvement in
welfare.21 Nevertheless, the European deficit economies’ adjustment difficulties, which have resulted in
massive import compression, unemployment, and
economic dislocation, point to greater scope for
surplus economies—especially, though not exclusively,
those in the region—to rebalance their economies and
switch expenditure toward foreign-produced goods.
Moreover, the conclusion that reduced policy and
other distortions have narrowed global imbalances
is somewhat at odds with the finding in the preceding section that lower demand, largely matched by
a decrease in potential output, has been responsible
for much of the observed narrowing of global imbalances. These two observations may be reconciled to
the extent that potential output was artificially high
as a result of distortions—or (what amounts to the
same thing) that output was above potential (­including
because of distortions in the financial sector), and the
global financial crisis both resolved the distortions
and lowered demand, bringing it more in line with
potential output. This can only be a partial explanation, however, so the role of policy improvements and
lower distortions in accounting for the narrower flow
imbalances is likely to be limited.22

21This is not to suggest, of course, that no distortions remain. The
2014 Pilot External Sector Report (IMF 2014) discusses a variety of
policies to further align current account balances with underlying
fundamentals.
22The low goods and services price inflation in the run-up to the
global financial crisis suggests that output is unlikely to have been
much above potential since, in that case, the low observed inflation
would have meant that all of the excess demand was falling only on
imported goods. Although (for instance) the United States indeed
had a large current account deficit, it seems implausible that the
excess demand would have fallen exclusively on imported goods.

Are Global Imbalances at a Turning Point?

The Stock Dimension of Imbalances
Going beyond flow analysis, the external balance sheet
of a country—its international investment position in
the balance of payments statistics—is another important
dimension in global imbalances (see, for example, Obstfeld 2012a, 2012b). Economies with large net liability
positions, in particular, may become vulnerable to disruptive external financial market conditions, including, in the
extreme case, the sudden drying up of external financing
(sudden stops) (see, for example, Catão and MilesiFerretti 2013).23 Both in the global financial crisis and
during the subsequent euro area crisis, such vulnerabilities
played a prominent role, as a number of economies experienced sovereign debt problems, sudden stops, or both.
Comparing the 10 largest debtors and 10 largest
creditors in 2006 and 2013 reveals striking inertia in
these rankings (Table 4.2)—especially compared with
those for current account balances (Table 4.1). This
inertia exists because net foreign asset stocks are typically slow-moving variables. There is also some overlap
between the top 10 list for flow imbalances and that
for stock imbalances—which is to be expected, given
the two-way feedback between the current account
and net foreign asset dynamics (surpluses cumulate
into rising stocks; higher net foreign assets generate
more factor income, contributing to larger surpluses).
The other striking fact about global stock imbalances—again, in contrast to flow imbalances—is that
they continued to grow during the period 2006–13
(Figure 4.12), with little discernible change in pace
after 2006, the year in which flow imbalances peaked.
Moreover, they became, if anything, more concentrated
on the debtor side, with the share of the top 5 economies rising from 55 percent of world output in 2006
to 60 percent in 2013. The trend of international
financial integration has not been reversed, as might
have been expected following the global financial crisis
(Figure 4.13).
What explains the widening stock imbalances?
When these imbalances are measured as a percentage of GDP, there can be three reasons for wider net
foreign asset positions. The first is continued flow
imbalances. Even a narrowing of these imbalances, as
occurred during the period under consideration, is not
enough, all else equal, for a decrease in stock imbal23Flow

imbalances are sometimes taken as indicating potential distortions of current policy settings, whereas stock imbalances reflect
past policies; stock imbalances may, however, be relevant for current
vulnerabilities.

ances. What would be required for such a decrease
would be a reversal of flows (from deficit to surplus
or vice versa) that is sustained: one year of surplus
after several years of deficits will typically not suffice. Indeed, there is a strong relationship (R2 = 0.73,
and t-statistic of 13.6) between the change in net
foreign assets between 2006 and 2013 and the current account balances accumulated during the same
period (Figure 4.14). On average (and in most of the
top 10 cases), continued current account deficits in
debtor economies played the main role in the widening
stocks of net foreign liabilities as a percentage of GDP
(Table 4.3). Similarly, for creditors, continued current
account surpluses explain much of the widening stocks
of net foreign assets.
Second, valuation effects can change asset positions
independently of flow imbalances. Such changes had
some effect on net foreign asset positions between
2006 and 2013, albeit in most cases less than those

from cumulative current account balances or economic growth for the largest debtors and creditors
(Table 4.3).24 Notable exceptions were Belgium,
Canada, Finland, Greece, South Africa, and the United
Kingdom, where valuation changes were the dominant
factor behind the improvement in their net foreign asset
positions—and in the United Kingdom’s case, knocked
it out of the largest 10 debtors in 2013 (Table 4.2).
The sources of valuation changes are complex
and depend on the country’s initial international
investment position (creditor or debtor) and the
composition of its gross assets and liabilities (fixed
income, equity).25 In general, asset prices increased

that creditor economies made fewer valuation gains (as a share of
their initial stock position) compared with debtor economies. At
the same time, nominal depreciation in debtor economies appears
to have increased valuation gains for these economies (because it

between 2006 and 2013: both equity and bond prices
rose with the substantial decline in long-term interest
rates, which, all else equal, should benefit net creditors
relative to net debtors (and thus widen imbalances).
Conversely, the drastic downward revision of economic
prospects for most large debtor economies after the
global financial crisis lowered the value of assets located
in these economies. Although this implies a negative
wealth effect for a particular country, it also means a
reduced the value of their liabilities, namely, the assets located in

asset positions. Although these variables are statistically significant

lower value of its foreign liabilities, implying a capital
gain. The United States was unique in this regard:
despite the country being a major debtor and having
experienced a large downward revision in its growth
prospects, the value of U.S. assets rose because of safe
haven concerns, implying a capital loss on its international investment position.
Third, growth effects can also lead to higher imbalances as a share of GDP, as in the case of public debt
(Table 4.3). Economic growth was also important, with
the effects up to roughly one-third the size of those from
cumulative current account balances, and with the opposite sign. For creditor economies, GDP growing ahead of
net foreign assets lowered net foreign asset ratios, whereas
in debtor economies, this contributed to lower net foreign
liability ratios. In euro area debtor economies, however,

the persistence of stock imbalances reflected the deep
contraction in some of these economies. Growth and the
strength of the external flow adjustment will likely be
the main forces determining the future direction of stock
imbalances; valuation effects might help, but they cannot
be relied on.

Evolve?
Where are global imbalances headed? The preceding
discussion suggests that flow imbalances have nar132

rowed, and the closing of output gaps should not in
itself reverse much of the narrowing. But output gaps
are only part of what drives current account dynamics:
policy choices and other economic forces might lead to
a renewed widening or further shrinking of flow imbalances. Projections underlying the WEO point to the latter: if these projections are realized, flow imbalances will
decline from a total (deficit plus surplus) of 3.3 percent
of world GDP in 2013 to less than 3.0 percent of world
GDP by 2019 (Figure 4.15).26 Although that is not a
dramatic further narrowing of flow imbalances, they are
at least not projected to grow.
The current account imbalance of the United States,
the largest on the deficit side, is projected to remain
roughly constant at about 0.60 percent of world GDP,
as the effect of domestic demand growth offsets the
improving energy trade balance. The negative balance
of deficit economies in the European Union (EU)
(“Europe deficit” in the figure) is projected to shrink
marginally, from 0.20 percent of world GDP in 2013
to 0.14 percent of world GDP by 2019. On the
surplus side, through 2019, oil exporters are projected
to halve their imbalances from 0.70 percent of world
GDP to 0.31 percent of world GDP, whereas China
and other parts of Asia (“Other Asia” in the figure) are
projected to widen their surpluses from 0.50 percent
to 0.70 percent of world GDP. Germany and the other
EU surplus economies (“Europe surplus” in the figure)
together are projected to shrink their surpluses from
0.70 percent to 0.54 percent of world GDP.
In contrast, stock imbalances are projected to
grow from about 40 percent of world GDP in 2013
to about 45 percent of world GDP by 2019 (Figure 4.16).27 The net foreign asset position of China,
the second-largest creditor, is projected to rise from
2.3 percent of world GDP in 2013 to 3.4 percent of
world GDP by 2019, whereas the net foreign liabilities
of the United States, the largest debtor, are projected
to rise from 7.6 percent of world GDP to 8.5 percent
of world GDP during that period. Several other
economies that have large debtor positions as a share of
their own GDP and that make the top 10 list globally
in 2006 or 2013 (or both) are projected to stabilize or
improve their international investment positions.

26These

projections assume that output gaps are approximately
closed by the end of the projection horizon (2019).
27These projections assume that the real effective exchange rate
will be constant, and that there are no valuation effects.

To explore the expected dynamics of stock imbalances further, panel 1 of Figure 4.17 plots current
account balances in 2013 against net foreign asset positions in 2013. For creditor economies, the relationship
is upward sloping: economies with higher net foreign
asset positions in 2013 ran larger current account
surpluses. The relationship for debtor economies is
instead negative, indicating that the more indebted
the economy, the smaller its current account deficit or
the larger its current account surplus. Moreover, for
many debtor economies, the projected average current
account balance for the next five years exceeds the balance that would be required to stabilize the ratio of net
foreign assets to GDP, so these economies’ net liability
positions will decline (Figure 4.17, panel 2).28
Determining the point at which deficits or debtor
positions become substantially more vulnerable is difficult, because many factors are typically at play in a crisis. Statistical analysis of past crises (banking, currency,
sovereign debt, and sudden stops) suggests thresholds of
6 percent of GDP for the current account deficit and
28The current account balance that stabilizes net foreign assets is
calculated as ca* = g × nfa, where ca* is the current account balance
that stabilizes net foreign assets as a percentage of GDP, g is the
(projected) growth rate of the U.S. dollar value of GDP, and nfa is
the initial net foreign asset position as a percentage of GDP.

60 percent of GDP for the net foreign liability position
as points at which vulnerability to crisis is heightened
in advanced economies.29 Corresponding thresholds
based on a sample of emerging market economies
are 3 percent of GDP for the current account deficit
and 40 percent of GDP for the net foreign liability
position.30 It bears emphasizing that these thresholds
are purely indicative, with large type I (false negative)
and type II (false positive) errors. For instance, among
advanced economies, the likelihood of experiencing
some form of crisis when the current account deficit
exceeds 6 percent of GDP is 13 percent—almost double
the 7 percent crisis probability when the deficit is below
that threshold. But another way of stating the same
29The threshold is determined by calculating the value that minimizes the sum of the percentage of type I (false negative) and type II
(false positive) errors for each type of crisis; the resulting threshold
values are averaged, using as weights the goodness of fit (1 minus the
sum of type I and type II errors); see Appendix 4.5.
30These estimated thresholds are similar to those obtained in the
literature. Using 26 episodes of adjustment from a sample range
of 1980–2003, Freund and Warnock (2005) calculate an average
current account trough of 5.6 percent of GDP, after which a deficit
economy has experienced reversals. Catão and Milesi-Ferretti (2013)
study the extent to which net foreign liabilities help predict an
external crisis. They find that net foreign liabilities are a significant
predictor of a crisis (even if the current account balance is controlled
for), particularly when they exceed 50 percent of GDP.

time, worsen the dynamics of their net liability positions), for instance, as monetary policy in advanced

substantial improvements in their net-exports-to-GDP
ratios. While the deficits and debtor positions of these
economies do not account for a significant proportion of global imbalances, experience during the global

small economies may have wider repercussions due to
upstream and downstream financial linkages.

1. Current Account and Net Foreign Asset Position, 2013

In 2006, the current account balance and net foreign asset positions of several
economies were close or exceeded the thresholds associated with past crises
(banking, currency, sovereign debt, and sudden stops). In 2013 and 2019 only a
handful of these economies exceeded or are projected to exceed the crisis
thresholds. This indicates that the vulnerability of these economies to crisis has
diminished.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: LEGACIES, CLOUDS, UNCERTAINTIES

in 2006 to 8.5 percent of world GDP in 2019. Indeed,
one of the concerns with growing global imbalances in
the mid-2000s was the (admittedly remote) possibility of the U.S. liability position suddenly reaching a
tipping point, after which private and public holders of
U.S. assets would lose confidence, and the U.S. dollar
would lose its reserve currency status.
The U.S. net liability position in fact worsened to
almost 8 percent of world GDP in 2013, but for a
number of reasons, the likelihood that the dollar will
lose its reserve currency status seems substantially
lower than it did eight years ago. First, projected flow
deficits of the United States are now considerably
smaller than they were in 2006. Second, the U.S. dollar continues to be the leading transaction currency in
foreign exchange markets and a key invoicing currency
in international trade. It accounts for a dominant
share of all outstanding debt securities issued anywhere in the world and especially of those securities
sold outside the issuing country in a currency other
than that of the issuer (Goldberg 2010). Third, dollar
assets held in central bank reserves are not excessive in
relation to central banks’ “optimal” currency portfolios.32 Fourth, at present, the dollar has relatively few
competitors, since being a reserve currency requires
that a substantial stock of assets be denominated in
that currency. Fifth, and perhaps most telling, during
the global financial crisis—whose epicenter was the
United States—investors rushed for the safety of the
U.S. dollar.33

Conclusion
Global current account imbalances have narrowed
substantially since their precrisis peaks in 2006, and
their configuration changed markedly along the way.
As a proportion of world GDP, the United States’ large
32Optimal currency composition of reserve portfolios is calculated
under the assumption that the objective is to preserve the “real”
value of reserves. A natural choice of deflator in this context is the
import deflator, because the ultimate purpose of holding reserves is
to enable net imports. Such an exercise yields a global optimal currency portfolio for reserves in which the dollar accounts for roughly
60 percent of the value (regardless of whether individual economies’
optimal portfolios are weighted by imports or by reserve holdings);
that level approximately matches the reported share in the IMF’s
Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves database for 2013; see Ghosh, Ostry, and Tsangarides 2011 for details of
this calculation.
33See, for instance, Ghosh, Ostry, and Tsangarides 2011, Prasad
2014, and Schenk 2013 on historical precedents of global switches
in reserve currencies.

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

current account deficit has been more than halved,
and the euro area deficit economies have moved into
surplus. The surpluses in China and Japan, the two
main counterparts to the 2006 U.S. deficit, have
decreased markedly as well. Moreover, a few advanced
economy commodity exporters and some major emerging market economies that previously had surpluses
have now switched to deficits, contributing to smaller
imbalances, but also, in some cases, contributing to
new vulnerabilities.
With the shrinkage in large deficits, the systemic
risks from flow imbalances surely decreased. The IMF’s
most recent Pilot External Sector Report (IMF 2014)
still finds that many larger economies’ flow imbalances
are excessive relative to levels consistent with fundamentals and appropriate policy settings, but the current account imbalances have nevertheless narrowed, in
some cases considerably, from their 2006 levels. Likewise, the current account gaps related to new deficits
remain relatively small. Although many large current
account deficits remain in economies other than the
largest ones, the related reversal risks are likely to be
country specific, not systemic.
Much of the adjustment in flow imbalances has
been driven by lowered demand in deficit economies
after the global financial crisis and by growth differentials related to the faster recovery of emerging market
economies and commodity exporters after the Great
Recession. Expenditure switching (from imports to
domestic goods and services or vice versa) has, in general, played less of a role throughout the recent adjustment period, especially in economies that have faced
significant slack and operate under fixed-exchange-rate
regimes. But such expenditure switching has risen
among the largest deficit and surplus economies, as it
did in earlier episodes of narrowing global imbalances.
The significant role of weaker demand and growth
differentials in the narrowing of global flow imbalances
has been associated in many economies with high costs
in the form of increased internal imbalances. However, the weaker demand has also allowed substantial
current account adjustment without the disruptive exchange rate corrections—most notably of the
U.S. dollar—that some feared were in the offing before
the global financial crisis. In the process, some of the
asset price bubbles and credit booms that underlay the
large imbalances in many advanced economies up to
about 2006 have also been corrected, although others
may have since emerged, including as a result of the
response to the crisis.

CHAPTER 4

The widening of internal imbalances while external
imbalances narrowed has led, however, to concerns
that, without further expenditure switching, external
imbalances could widen again once output gaps close.
Indeed, as output gaps in several advanced economies
widened in 2013, global imbalances narrowed further.
In advanced economies, much will depend on whether
the lowering of their output since the global financial
crisis has been mostly structural or mostly cyclical.
If structural—the case incorporated in WEO baseline forecasts—much of the narrowing in global flow
imbalances will be lasting.
But in some advanced economies with current
account deficits, notably those in the euro area, output
gaps are most likely large, and more expenditure
switching would help these economies boost growth
while maintaining narrower external imbalances.
Against this backdrop, the uneven contribution of surplus economies to the narrowing of global imbalances
remains a concern. The imbalances remain large among
European surplus economies and oil exporters.
The nature and intensity of the policy measures
needed to address remaining external imbalances and
to contain emerging imbalances vary across economies
and country groups. For instance, deficit economies
need to take actions to advance fiscal consolidation
and introduce structural reforms to facilitate external
adjustment (including those to raise saving, make labor
markets more flexible, and remove supply bottlenecks).
In some emerging market economies with increasing deficits, measures to rein in private demand may
be needed, including macroprudential measures to
restrain credit booms and asset price bubbles. Surplus
economies, in contrast, need to take steps to rebalance
growth—including, in some cases, by raising public
sector investment (see Chapter 3). In some other
cases, adoption of more market-based exchange rates,
reduction of capital account restrictions, strengthening
of social safety nets, and implementation of financial
sector reforms might also be required. As historical
precedents and theory suggest, greater coordination
of economic policies between, and among, surplus
and deficit economies will make it easier to achieve
these goals individually and collectively (see Ostry and
Ghosh 2013).
Although concerns about global flow imbalances
may have lessened since 2006, problems remain with
respect to net external positions or stock imbalances.
As a percentage of GDP, these metrics have generally
widened further since most economies continue to

Are Global Imbalances at a Turning Point?

be either net lenders or net borrowers, with current
account imbalances typically only narrowing rather
than reversing. Output declines or low output growth,
together with low inflation, are another reason why
net external liabilities have remained high as a share
of GDP. Some large debtor economies thus remain
vulnerable to changes in market sentiment and hence
represent continued possible systemic risks. However,
the liability position of the United States, the largest
debtor globally, in relation to its own GDP remains
relatively low, and the behavior of investors during the
global financial crisis is a testament to their continued
confidence in dollar assets.
Containing stock imbalances in debtor economies
ultimately requires improvements in current account
balances and stronger growth; increased resilience will
also depend on the structure of assets and liabilities.
Policy measures to achieve both stronger and more
balanced growth in the major economies would help in
this respect, including in large surplus economies with
available policy space. Such measures would also help
further reduce global imbalances.

in Table 4.4 along with their data sources) are collected on an annual basis from 1970 to 2013, where
available.
The main variables, including current account balance, net foreign asset position, trade balance, exports,
imports, savings, and investment, are reported as percentages of nominal GDP. Weights used to construct
country group aggregates are based on nominal GDP
(market-value-based) weights. In addition, real variables, including domestic demand, exports, imports,
and GDP, are constructed as percentage changes (log
differences).
Precrisis trends are obtained from data in previous
WEO reports, such as the September 2006 WEO
database, and are constructed using a linear trend for a

for example, the 1996–2003 period for 2006.
The economies included in Tables 4.1 and 4.2
are identified using current account balances and
net foreign asset data from the BOPS database and
EWN data set. Given the focus of the chapter, the
rankings in these tables allow the identification of
economies with imbalances with potentially systemic
implications.

•• Largest current account deficits and surpluses. These
economies are identified by ranking the WEO database’s full list of economies by the dollar size of their
current account balances. The top 10 surplus and
deficit economies are then selected.
•• Largest net foreign asset (creditors) and liabilities (debtors) positions. Economies are selected from available
data by the dollar size of their positive (creditors) or
negative (debtors) net foreign asset positions.

CHAPTER 4

Saving and Investment
The current account balance (CA) is equal to
national savings (S) minus investment (I). As the data
for savings are the least reliable, values for that variable
are derived from the other two using the following
identity:
S = CA + I,

(4.1)

in which each variable is expressed as a percentage of GDP. The current account data are obtained
from BOPS, and investment is obtained from WEO
national accounts data.

Decomposing the Change in Net Foreign Assets
The change in a country’s net foreign asset position
is defined as follows:
NFAt – NFAt–1 ≡ CAt + KAt + EOt + Xt ,

(4.2)

in which CA is the current account—which is the sum
of net exports of goods and services, current transfers,
and investment income; KA is capital transfers; EO
is errors and omissions; and X is net capital valuation
gains (losses if negative) from shifts in exchange rates
and asset prices.
Thus, the relationship between external flows
and stocks can be rewritten as follows (Lane and
Milesi-Ferretti 2014):
NFAt ≡ NFAt–1 − FAt + Xt ,

(4.3)

in which FAt is the financial account balance, that
is, FAt = –(CAt + KAt + EOt ); and Xt is the valuation
effect.
Hence, to calculate the cumulative valuation effects
during 2006–13 as presented in Table 4.3, one can use
the following equation:
13
2013
∑20
t=20 07 Xt = NFA2013 – NFA2006 + ∑t=2007 FAt.

(4.4)

These variables are in levels and calculated in local
currency using period-average exchange rates for flows
and end-of-period exchange rates for stocks. Recursive
iteration and substitution in equation (4.2) shows two
of the main components of the net foreign asset position—the cumulative current account and the cumulative valuation effect:
NFAt = ∑qs=–10CAt–s + ∑qs=–10(KAt–s + EOt–s)
+ ∑qs=–10 Xt–s + NFAt–q.

(4.5)

Are Global Imbalances at a Turning Point?

However, a better proxy for a country’s stock imbalance is the ratio of its net foreign asset position to
GDP, which controls for the size of the economy. In
this case, equation (4.5) can be written as follows:
(∑qs=–10CAt–s) (∑qs=–10(KAt–s + EOt–s))
nfat – nfat–q = ——–——
+ ————————
Yt
Yt
(∑qs=–10 Xt–s)
g yt,t–q
+ —––—— – ——–—
nfat–q , (4.6)
Yt
1 + g yt,t–q
in which lowercase letters denote variables as a ratio to
GDP. The final term on the equation’s right-hand side
captures the adjustment due to nominal GDP growth,
in which g yi,t=q is the nominal GDP growth between
t – q and t, and q ≥ 1.

Appendix 4.2. Panel Estimations
A country’s current account balance is determined
by a number of factors, both domestic and foreign,
summarized in the following relationship:
CA = f (DD, DD*, e, t).

(4.7)

The current account (as a share of GDP), CA, is a
function of real domestic demand, DD; real domestic
demand in trading partner economies, DD*; the real
effective exchange rate, e; and the terms of trade, t.
Taking the total derivative yields the relationship to be
estimated:
∂CA
∂CA
∂CA
∂CA
dCA = –—– dDD + —–– dDD* + —– de + —– dt.
∂DD

(4.8)
Economic theory gives us an idea of the sign of these
effects in advance:34
∂CA

—— < 0; —–— > 0; —— < 0; —— > 0.

(4.9)

Given the chapter’s global focus, panel data techniques are applied to test equation (4.8) and establish
the relative importance of expenditure changing and
expenditure switching during current account adjustment periods. Because current account balances are
the outcome of intertemporal decisions taken jointly
34The negative relationship between the change in the real effective
exchange rate and the change in the current account as a percentage
of GDP assumes that the Marshall-Lerner condition is satisfied, that
is, that the sum of the elasticities of exports and imports with respect
to the real exchange rate exceeds unity.

by multiple agents globally, pooling information in a
panel regression allows a richer set of dynamics to be
captured over time and across economies.
This relationship is specified econometrically as
follows:
DCAi,t = b0 + b1DDDi,t + b2DDD*i,t + b3DREERi,t
+ b4DToTi,t + ui + ei,t ,

(4.10)

in which for country i, DCAi,t is the year-over-year
change in the current account (as a share of GDP);
DDDi,t is the annual growth rate of real domestic
demand; DDD*i,t is the weighted average annual real
domestic demand growth across country i’s trading
partners; DREERi,t is the annual percentage change in
the real effective exchange rate; DToTi,t is the annual
growth rate in the terms of trade; ui captures countryspecific fixed effects; and ei,t are the idiosyncratic
errors.
Fixed-effects panel estimation with robust standard errors is used for the regression for a sample of
64 economies (Table 4.5) using annual data for the
period 1970–2013. The panel is unbalanced owing to
gaps in the data.
The results for 10 regression estimations are
reported in Table 4.6. The first column of the table
reports the coefficients from the full regression of
the change in current account balances as a share of
GDP on the four explanatory variables (regressors)
140

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

and their one-period lags as listed in equation (4.10).
The results indicate that over the full sample period,
a 1 percentage point increase in the growth rate of
domestic demand for one year is associated with a
deterioration in the current account balance of slightly
more than 0.3 percentage point of GDP over two
years. A 1 percentage point increase in trading partner
demand growth for one year leads instead to an
improvement in the current account by a little more
than 0.06 percentage point of GDP over two years.
Finally, a 5 percent depreciation in the real effective
exchange rate is associated with an improvement in the
current account balance of 0.3 percentage point over
two years.
The next five columns of the table explore how
the explanatory power of the regression (the overall
R 2) alters once certain key explanatory variables are
excluded. As noted in the chapter text, the omission of
the change in the real effective exchange rate (column
4) has little impact on overall explanatory power, but
removing growth in aggregate demand (both domestic
demand and that of trading partners) leads to a sharp
reduction in the model’s goodness of fit (from slightly
more than 0.4 to 0.1).
Columns (7) through (10) present results from
partitioning the data set into two subsets. The first
subset looks at the effect of a change in the explanatory
variables in the years of adjustment in global imbalances (using binary indicators for the years 1975–

79, 1987–91, and 2007–13; column 7) compared with
remaining years in the sample (column 8). In this case,
the negative coefficient on the growth in real domestic
demand is larger in the years of adjustment relative
to more “normal” periods. In addition, expenditure
switching does not appear to have been strongly associated with changes in the current account during the
periods of adjustment, unlike in other years. However,
it is possible that the strength of expenditure switching is weakened by the more extreme fallout from the
global financial crisis and subsequent Great Recession.
Columns (9) and (10) show very similar regression
results for economies with either pegged or floating
exchange rates. In particular, the impact of changes in
the real effective exchange rate on the current account
is virtually identical, but more precisely estimated in
the case of economies with floating exchange rates.
When the relationship is tested for the 1986–91
adjustment period (see Box 4.1), the change in the real
effective exchange rate has a statistically significant negative effect on the current account balance; that is, a
real depreciation improves a country’s external balance.
A simple robustness test, performed by substituting
142

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

lagged terms for each explanatory variable, shows that
the significance and sign of the effects of the different
factors on the change in the current account do not
alter substantially for the real effective exchange rate
and domestic demand (column 6).
The panel regression is also performed for the recent
adjustment period in global imbalances, 2007–13
(Table 4.7). As noted in the chapter text, the
impact of domestic demand growth is even stronger between 2007 and 2013 (column 2) than in the
full sample (column 1), whereas neither growth in
domestic demand in trading partners nor changes
in the real effective exchange rate has a statistically
significant impact. One factor that may explain
the lack of significance of the impact of real effective exchange rate changes is the fact that increases
in indirect taxes—which happened in a number of
deficit economies—imply an appreciation in the
consumer-price-index-based real effective exchange rate
used in the regression but no change in underlying
competitiveness.
The coefficients from the full regression (column
1 of Table 4.6) are used to calculate a counterfactual

CHAPTER 4

path for the current account balance for the case in
which the expenditure-switching channel is turned off.
As noted in the chapter text, this exercise suggests that
under those circumstances, imbalances would have
widened by an additional 0.4 percent of world GDP
in 2013.

Appendix 4.3. Distortions, Policies, and
Imbalances
The text compares “current account gaps” in 2006
and 2013 as a measure of the degree to which lower
distortions and improved policies have contributed
to the narrowing of flow imbalances. This appendix
provides details of that analysis.
A country’s current account (as a percentage of
GDP) may be modeled as depending upon a vector
of policies, P; a vector of distortions, D; a vector of
observed fundamentals, F; and a vector of unobserved
fundamentals, U:
CA = a + P′b + D′g + F′d + U′θ.

(4.11)

The appropriate current account balance (that is,
taking account of multilateral consistency, as well as
sustainable and appropriate policies, P*)—the current
account “norm”—is given by
CA* = a + P*′b + F′d + U′θ.

(4.12)

Ideally, the actual current account (equation 4.11)
would be compared with its norm (equation 4.12),
CA – CA* = r = a + (P – P*)′b + D′g,

(4.13)

with the difference between them providing a measure of the policy or other distortions that underlie
observed current account positions. Moreover, a comparison of r over time (for example, r2013 versus r2006)
would provide an indication of the extent to which
these distortions had diminished or grown.
The norm is not directly observable, however, and
instead a regression model of the current account must
be employed as a proxy:35
CÂ = a + P′b + F′d.

(4.14)

The regression residual is
CA – CÂ = e = D′g + U′θ.

(4.15)

35The regression that underlies the IMF’s External Balance Assessment is used for this purpose (see http://www.imf.org/external/np/
res/eba/pdf/080913.pdf ).

Are Global Imbalances at a Turning Point?

As a proxy for d (the true deviation of the current
account from its norm), the regression residual e suffers
from two shortcomings: first, in addition to genuine
distortions, it includes unobserved fundamentals (that
is, variables that are omitted from the regression); and
second, since the regression controls for actual policies,
the residual does not capture the effect on the current
account of any divergence of actual policies, P, from
their appropriate or desirable values, P*.
To the extent that the unobserved fundamentals
are relatively constant, the first of these problems is
mitigated by comparing the residual over time. Therefore, smaller residuals in 2013 than in 2006 (|e2013| <
|e2006|) can be taken as an indication of fewer distortions. To address the second problem, if an estimate
of the desirable policy settings is available, a residual
inclusive of the policy distortion may be defined:
J = e + (P – P*)′b = D′g + U′θ + (P – P*)′b, (4.16)
where again, comparing J over time likely reduces
the impact of the omitted variables. The difficulty in
implementing this strategy is that, although estimates
of P* are available for 2013 as part of the EBA and
External Sector Report (ESR) exercises, corresponding
estimates for 2006 are not available. Since the desirable policies are likely to be fairly invariant over time
(for instance, the fiscal balance is defined in cyclically
adjusted terms), however, it is possible to approximate
the 2006 value using its 2013 value and calculate J2006
= e2006 + (P2006 – P*2013)′b.
Figure 4.11 (panel 1) compares |e2013| with |e2006| as
an indication of how nonpolicy distortions underlying
observed current account balances have changed over
time, while Figure 4.11 (panel 2) compares |P2013 – P*2013|
to |P2006 – P*2006| as an indication of how all distortions—
policy and other—have evolved. It bears emphasizing
that neither the regression residuals, e, nor the policy-gapinclusive residuals, J, correspond precisely to the ESR
gaps. The latter incorporate IMF staff judgment concerning appropriate external balances, taking account of
additional information that cannot be readily captured in
standard regression analysis. Although in many cases the
ESR gaps (which are available only for 2013) are similar
to the policy-gap-inclusive residuals, J, for 2013, there
are some instances in which there are marked differences
due to country-specific factors.36

considered here); for this reason, the residual for Japan is not shown

Appendix 4.4. Counterfactual Output Gap
Analysis
One of the key questions tackled in the chapter is
whether the unwinding of global current account imbalances will prove durable. This question is examined by
looking at cyclically adjusted current account balances.
To the extent that the relatively narrow imbalances now
can be attributed to the difference in cyclical positions or to global excess capacity, a bounce back can be
expected in the medium term as output gaps close.
However, there is no universally accepted methodology for assessing how cyclical conditions affect current
account balances. To get an idea of magnitudes, a simple,
parsimonious approach based on the IMF’s EBA methodology is employed.37 The cyclical component of the
ratio of the current account to GDP for a given country
is computed as the difference between its output gap
and the world output gap multiplied by a factor (−0.4)
recovered from the EBA current account regression.38
37See, for instance, http://www.imf.org/external/np/res/eba/
pdf/080913.pdf.
38The EBA regression is estimated on a sample of 49 mostly
advanced and emerging market economies (covering 90 percent of
global GDP) for the period 1986–2000.

144

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

The world output gap is computed using the purchasingpower-parity-weighted average of output gaps for all
economies recorded in the IMF’s WEO database.
Cyclically adjusted current account balances are
calculated for the Group of Twenty economies using
three country-specific output gap measures: (1) the
output gap reported in the WEO, (2) the difference
between the 2013 level of GDP implied by the 2006
precrisis trend (calculated using the average growth rate
for 1998–2005), and (3) a hybrid of (1) for the United
States and China and (2) for all other economies.
The cyclical components are then aggregated
separately for surplus and deficit Group of Twenty
economies and subtracted from the sum of their raw
balances to arrive at cyclically adjusted current account
balances for the two country groups.39 These are compared with the “unadjusted” current account surpluses
and deficits (actual current account balances), calculated for the full sample of economies in the WEO.
Measures calculated using (1) deliver a narrowing of
2.6 percent of world GDP (dashed lines in panel 1 of
Figure 4.9), 1.5 percent using (2) (solid lines in panel

2 of Figure 4.9), and 2 percent using (3) (dashed lines
in panel 2 of Figure 4.9).

Appendix 4.5. Vulnerability Thresholds
To establish the level at which a current account
deficit (or net liability position) exposes a country to
significantly greater risk, a threshold value is chosen
so as to minimize the percentage of crises missed and
the percentage of noncrises misclassified (type I and
type II errors, respectively). By defining the loss function in terms of the percentages of crises and noncrises,
the estimation penalizes missing a crisis much more
heavily than issuing a false alarm (for example, if crises
are 5 percent of the sample, missing one crisis is as
costly as issuing 19 false alarms).
Four types of crisis are considered: banking, currency,
and debt crises (from Laeven and Valencia 2012), and
an indicator for sudden stops (from Chapter 4 of the
April 2012 WEO); a comprehensive crisis indicator,
which takes the value of one if there is at least one crisis
in a given year, is also defined. The model is estimated
using lagged values for the current account and net

foreign asset position, since these variables may adjust
sharply following a crisis (and vulnerabilities are better
captured by the lagged value, that is, before the postcrisis adjustment). For that reason, observations in the year
following a crisis are excluded from the estimation.
The exercise is performed for two samples of
economies. The first sample consists of 34 advanced
economies and corresponds to the sample used in the
IMF’s Vulnerability Exercise for Advanced Economies.
The second sample consists of 53 emerging market and
developing economies. It includes the sample used in
the IMF’s Vulnerability Exercise for Emerging Market
and Developing Economies, as well as recently designated advanced economies that were emerging market
and developing economies in the historical sample
(for example, Korea). The data cover the period 1980–
2010. Table 4.8 reports the results for the different
crises. To obtain the average threshold (used in the
chapter text), a weighted average of the thresholds for
the different crises is calculated, in which the weights
are proportional to the explanatory power of the
threshold for the type of crisis with which it is associated (1 minus the sum of type I and type II errors).

Box 4.1. Switching Gears: The 1986 External Adjustment
Another exceptional episode of adjustment in global
imbalances began in 1986 following an agreement
between the largest deficit and surplus economies. This
box highlights how expenditure switching featured more
heavily in this episode against a backdrop of relatively
strong global economic conditions.
The Plaza Accord of September 1985 initiated
a period of adjustment in global imbalances. The
accord among the world’s five largest economies (the
Group of Five) sought to limit the widening imbalances between the world’s largest deficit economy (the
United States) and largest surplus economies (Japan
and West Germany). The agreement would work
through coordinated foreign exchange rate interventions that would help depreciate the U.S. dollar
against other currencies, mainly the Japanese yen and
the German deutschmark (or “appreciate nondollar currencies”).1 As a result, absolute global current
account imbalances declined during the five years
beginning in 1986 at an average annual rate of ¼ percent of world GDP, resulting in a total adjustment of
1¼ percent by 1991 (Figure 4.1.1).
The configuration of imbalances at the start of the
adjustment in 1986 was similar to that of 2006, with
deficits and surpluses largely concentrated in a handful
of systemically important economies (Table 4.1.1). As
of 1986, the U.S. current account deficit accounted for
three-fourths of the sum of the world’s top 10 deficits, and
the combined surpluses of Japan and West Germany were
almost as large in dollar terms. By 1991, the U.S. external imbalance had moved into surplus and accounted
for the lion’s share of the reduction in the world’s largest
deficits. The primary counterparts to this adjustment on
the surplus side (switching from surplus to large deficits)
were Germany, which was undergoing reunification, and
Spain. Therefore, the share of Japan and the United States
in absolute global imbalances declined from more than
50 percent in 1986 to 17 percent in 1991.
Unlike the adjustment in the recent period, the
adjustment that began in 1986 took place against a
relatively more benign global economic landscape,
with GDP across major deficit and surplus economies
remaining close to or above trend during this period.
GDP in the United States remained close to preadjustThe authors of this box are Aqib Aslam and Juan Yépez.

depreciating from its peak in March 1985, but the pace of depreciation picked up following the Plaza Accord.

ment trends, and those in major surplus economies
climbed above trend. Overall, global GDP growth
remained steady between 1987 and 1989, dipping
only in 1990 as the United States fell into recession.
A key difference between the two periods of adjustment is the relatively larger role for expenditure
switching in the earlier episode. Expenditure switching
between foreign-produced and domestically produced
goods was inevitable given that the adjustment was
engineered through exchange rate intervention, and the
result was an 11 percent real appreciation of the yen
during the period 1986–88 and a 15 percent real depreciation of the dollar.2 However, outside these two major

the sharp depreciation of the dollar was disrupting currency
markets, ministers from the parties to the agreement as well as
from Canada (the Group of Six) met at the Louvre in February
1987 (the “Louvre Accord”) seeking to “put the brakes” on the
dollar decline. The dollar continued to depreciate, however, with
the depreciation ultimately resulting in the October 1987 stock

surplus and deficit economies, there was no strong
change in the direction of real effective exchange rates,
and the rest of the world’s absolute level of imbalances
remained the same as a portion of world GDP.
The relatively greater role for expenditure switching
in the 1986 episode can be seen in a panel regression
that examines the contribution of domestic demand
and the real effective exchange rate in the 1986–91
and 2007–13 current account adjustment periods
(Table 4.1.2). For example, in the years following the
Plaza Accord, a 10 percentage point reduction in the
real appreciation rate increases the rate of adjustment
of the current account by 3 percentage points, an effect
that is statistically significant. In contrast, although the
estimate is larger in the most recent adjustment period,
its effect is not statistically significant.
At the same time, if the demand variables of the
panel regression are dropped, the R 2 of the 1986–91
period is larger than that of the 2007–13 adjustment period, and the coefficient of the real effective
exchange rate becomes larger and more statistically
significant. The contemporaneous relationship between
the real effective exchange rate, the terms of trade, and
the current account is complex because these variables
are jointly determined; therefore, the estimates from
these regressions could be biased.
The stronger role of expenditure switching in the
second half of the 1980s is also recovered using a
complementary framework—a parsimonious panel
vector autoregression—in which the issue of potential endogeneity can be better addressed. Historical
decompositions (Figure 4.1.2) of the current account
adjustment into demand and price factors show that
shocks to the real effective exchange rate can explain
one-third of the improvement in the current account
from its historical average for advanced and emerging
market deficit economies (red segments) in the years
immediately following the Plaza Accord (compared
with one-eighth in the 2007–13 adjustment period).3
market crash, when coordinated interest rate cuts by Group of
Seven (adding Italy to the group) central banks allowed them to
inject liquidity without exerting further stress on exchange rates;
see Ghosh and Masson 1994, chapter 4.
3The historical decomposition is obtained from a panel vector
autoregression for 64 economies calculated for the 1973–2013
period using annual data. The identification strategy is based on
contemporaneous restrictions based on the following recursive
ordering: the terms of trade; the real effective exchange rate; and
the changes in real external demand, real domestic demand, and
the current account balance as a share of GDP; therefore, there

CHAPTER 4

Are Global Imbalances at a Turning Point?

Box 4.1 (continued)
Overall, the key lesson from the 1986 episode is
that, in a favorable global economic environment,
a policy-engineered current account adjustment can
prove to be both effective and durable. Imbalances
remained compressed in the aftermath of the 1991
global recession until as late as 1996, making this the
longest period of current account narrowing since the
is a series of shocks for each variable in the model. Results are
qualitatively robust to different orderings.

Bretton Woods era (see green bars in Figure 4.1.1).
Therefore, the Plaza Accord, although not without its
detractors, provides some insight into how policyinduced expenditure switching could reduce external
imbalances and in some cases boost growth.4

4Some commentators blame the Plaza and Louvre Accords for
igniting the expansionary policies that led to Japan’s asset boom
and bust, which triggered that country’s “lost decade” in the
1990s. See Box 4.1 of the April 2010 World Economic Outlook.

Box 4.2. A Tale of Two Adjustments: East Asia and the Euro Area
The experiences of the stressed euro area economies
during the recent euro area sovereign debt crises stand in
contrast to those of the Asian market economies during
the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. The difference
between these two groups in their patterns of adjustment is stark: East Asian economies were able to rely on
demand-switching effects to a much greater degree than
have the stressed euro area economies and thereby avoided
the prolonged contraction in output that has afflicted the
latter.
Financial crises erupted in Asia starting in Thailand
in July 1997 before spreading to other economies in
the region. Four of the affected economies—Indonesia,
Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand (the “East Asia–4”)—
all experienced severe recessions. More than a decade
later, three euro area economies—Greece, Ireland, and
Portugal—became embroiled in sovereign debt crises
in the wake of the global financial crisis, and one
other in the euro area—Spain—faced strong funding
pressures arising from banking sector problems. As a
result, these four economies also experienced sharp
economic downturns (the “stressed euro area–4”).
Both the East Asian and the stressed euro area economies endured sizable external adjustments, though the
current account swing in the former was much more
abrupt than that in the latter (Figure 4.2.1).
The experiences of the two groups of economies
share some important similarities and differences.
Both groups experienced what appear to be permanent
losses in output in the aftermath of their respective
crises (Figure 4.2.2). By the end of 1998, average
real output growth in the East Asia–4 had fallen to
–10 percent, and during the Great Recession, average
annual growth in the stressed euro area economies
turned negative, falling to –4 percent in 2009.1
Yet the subsequent paths for output and current
accounts in the two sets of economies have differed
The author of this box is Aqib Aslam.
1The two groups shared two other important similarities when
their respective crises struck, notably fixed or semifixed exchange
rates and large current account deficits. Indonesia, Korea, and
Thailand operated such exchange rate regimes before the crisis,
and the stressed euro area group was subject to fixed exchange
rates in respect to one another and their major regional trading
partners. In the East Asia case, current account deficits were
mainly associated with private sector overinvestment, creating
downward pressure on the currencies in the region and encouraging speculative attacks. Current account imbalances in most
of the stressed euro area economies were instead partly linked to
fiscal imbalances.

markedly. In the East Asia–4, output growth recovered
relatively quickly, returning within a few years to rates
closer to those observed before the crisis. In contrast,
pressures from the region’s sovereign debt crisis meant
that activity in the stressed euro area economies
contracted again in early 2011 and started to rebound
only in the second half of 2013. As a result, output
in the stressed euro area–4 remains firmly below 2006
projections and has yet to recover. Therefore, relative
patterns in aggregate demand changes and expenditure switching could shed light on the differences in
external adjustment.
In the East Asia–4, average real domestic demand
growth plummeted to –18 percent in 1998 before
recovering the following year (Figure 4.2.3). The
corresponding drop in the stressed euro area economies was not as great, at about –6 percent in 2009.

However, the protracted nature of the euro area crisis
has meant that domestic demand in these economies
has continued to shrink, on average, by slightly more
than 3 percent per year since 2008. Furthermore,
the average growth of external demand for the East
Asia–4 was stronger than that for the stressed euro
area–4. That strength boosted exports, which in turn
improved the current account balance and economic
growth. Indeed, real domestic demand among the
major trading partners of the East Asia–4 grew during
the postcrisis period (Figure 4.2.4). In contrast, the
weak external demand for the four stressed euro area
economies reflected the severity of the Great Recession

and the anemic global recovery, an environment that
made the external adjustment and growth recovery for
that group much more challenging than for the East
Asian economies.
Another key divergence in experiences is the extent
of expenditure switching. Most of the economies in
the East Asia–4 abandoned their de facto currency
pegs soon after the crisis hit, experiencing sharp
real depreciations that ranged from 15 percent to
50 percent (Figure 4.2.5).2 By contrast, real effective
exchange rate movements for the stressed euro area
economies have been much smaller; the average real
depreciation peaked at 2.5 percent in 2010 and then
2In most cases, these economies also resisted subsequent nominal and real currency appreciations by accumulating reserves to
replenish their depleted stocks of foreign exchange reserves.

again in 2012. Instead, these economies have had
to rely on slow and painful internal wage and price
declines to improve their competitiveness.
These relative differences in the effects of demand
compression and switching on external balances can
be traced through the changes in saving, investment,
and the trade balance. In both episodes, the reduction in domestic demand manifested itself as a sharp
contraction in investment. For instance, in East Asia,
the abrupt collapse in investment in response to the
capital flow reversal led to a marked improvement
in current account balances. Broadly similar patterns
were observed for the stressed euro area economies,
although the decline in investment was more moderate
and protracted.

The marked improvement in East Asian trade balances reflects both the effects of demand compression
on imports (a decrease) and the effects of demand
switching on exports (an increase) and imports (a further decrease) (Figures 4.2.6 and 4.2.7). The improved
trade balance was complemented by stronger exports
resulting from buoyant external demand. In contrast,
the improvement in the stressed euro area–4’s trade
balance has been largely due to the effects of demand
compression on imports and the drag on exports
from a weak external environment. With insufficient
expenditure switching, exports have only recently
returned to precrisis levels for the region on average
(see Figure 4.2.7).
When both expenditure reduction and expenditure
switching are at work, external adjustment can clearly

However, sudden stops wreaked far greater havoc on
the financial systems and output of the East Asia–4
than did the financial and sovereign debt crises on the
economies of the stressed euro area, a difference partly
reflecting the automatic stabilizers that operated within
the Economic and Monetary Union.

IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK,
SEPTEMBER 2014

The following remarks were made by the Chair at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the World
­Economic Outlook, Global Financial Stability Report, and Fiscal Monitor on September 25, 2014.

E

xecutive Directors noted that an uneven
global recovery continues, notwithstanding
setbacks in the first half of the year. However,
the pace of recovery remains weak as the legacies of the crisis continue to cast a shadow. Investment
has not picked up solidly in many advanced economies, and emerging market economies are adjusting
to lower rates of economic growth than those reached
during the immediate postcrisis recovery. Moreover,
activity in some regions is being negatively affected by
ongoing geopolitical tensions. Directors also observed
that some problems that predate the global financial
crisis—including the effects of an aging population
on labor force growth, weak productivity growth, and
infrastructure gaps—are coming back to the fore and
affecting the pace of recovery through lower potential
growth in a number of economies.
Directors noted that global growth should
increase as growth in major advanced economies
picks up on accommodative monetary policies, supportive financial market conditions, and the more
gradual pace of fiscal consolidation (except in a
few countries, including Japan). Growth in emerging market and developing economies should also
increase with a gradual improvement in structural
factors affecting activity in some economies and further strengthening in external demand as advanced
economies’ growth recovers.
Notwithstanding this expected pickup in growth,
Directors underscored that the recovery remains
fragile and subject to significant downside risks. If
geopolitical tensions persist it could have negative
effects on confidence and contribute to increases
in oil prices and declines in asset prices. In some
advanced economies, risks also arise from the effects
of protracted low inflation or deflation on activity or
on public debt dynamics.

Directors underscored concerns about increased
financial risk taking arising from the prolonged
period of low interest rates, resulting in asset price
appreciation, spread compression, and record-low
volatility across a broad range of asset classes. They
also noted that asset holdings are now concentrated in a small number of large managers. These
increased market and liquidity risks could spill over
to global markets, potentially triggered by heightened geopolitical risks or volatility associated with
monetary policy normalization. Directors noted that
the largest banks have strengthened their balance
sheets in response to tighter regulation, but low
profitability at some banks has created the need for
an overhaul of business models, potentially creating
headwinds for the economic recovery. Moreover,
credit intermediation has been migrating to the
shadow banking sector, creating new challenges for
supervision and regulation. Against this backdrop,
Directors observed that a tighter financing environment could adversely affect the sovereign debt
dynamics of many emerging market and developing economies, particularly if coupled with lower
growth.
Directors also remained concerned about
medium-term risks to the global recovery. Growth
in advanced economies could continue to disappoint over a longer period because of lower potential growth or because of a sustained weakness in
demand. Directors noted that absent structural
reforms, potential growth may be lower than currently projected.
Directors called for greater efforts in most
economies to restore growth. They considered that
premature normalization in monetary policy should
be avoided, given the absence of robust demand
growth in advanced economies. Some Directors also

155

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: LEGACIES, CLOUDS, UNCERTAINTIES

saw a need for additional actions by the European
Central Bank, while a few Directors cautioned that
more time is needed to gauge the effectiveness of
policies already introduced. A few other Directors
saw little or no scope for further unconventional
monetary accommodation in the euro area, as it
may not be effective in promoting demand and sustainable growth, and cautioned against maintaining
such accommodation longer than necessary, in view
of the financial stability risks.
Directors highlighted the need to restructure
weak banks and resolve nonviable institutions and
to enhance the transmission of monetary policy
through balance sheet repair. Moreover, adequate
data to monitor the buildup of risks and a mandate
for authorities to limit these risks, particularly in
the shadow banking sector, are required. Directors
broadly supported the use of macroprudential policies to improve the trade-off between financial and
economic risk taking as well as regulate and supervise the shadow banking sector, although a number
of Directors noted the limited experience regarding the effectiveness of such measures. To ensure
adequate incentives for risk taking in the banking
sector, some Directors underscored the importance
of governance and executive compensation reforms.
Directors stressed that fiscal adjustment in
advanced economies needs to be attuned, in pace
and composition, to support the immediate recovery as well as lay the ground for medium-term
plans (especially in the United States and Japan).
More generally, debt and deficit reduction should
be designed to minimize their adverse effects on
jobs and growth. Directors broadly agreed that for
countries with clearly identified infrastructure needs
and in which efficient public investment processes
exist, an increase in public infrastructure investment
could provide a boost to demand as well as raise
potential output in the medium term. Directors also
broadly noted that in some cases a more supportive
fiscal stance could help to bring forward the growth
benefits of structural reforms, provided that there is
enough fiscal room and that the costs and benefits
of the reforms, as well as their implementation prospects, are sufficiently certain. In some countries, fiscal conditions put a premium on structural reforms
that can be implemented without budgetary costs.

156

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

Directors noted that emerging markets’ efforts
to rebalance growth toward domestic sources have
supported global growth, although this rebalancing,
combined with lower-than-expected growth, has also
reduced policy space and raised vulnerabilities for
some countries. In this context, the scope for macroeconomic policies to support growth, should downside risks materialize, is limited for economies with
weak fiscal or external current account positions or
high or increasing inflation levels or those facing
financial system risks from a sustained period of
credit expansion. Directors underscored the importance of reducing these vulnerabilities, including
by rebuilding fiscal buffers. They also stressed that
continued strong growth in low-income countries
calls for greater progress in strengthening policies—
by boosting fiscal positions with stronger revenues
and rationalizing public spending, achieving greater
monetary policy independence, and strengthening
public financial management. Directors emphasized
the importance for emerging markets to continue
managing external financial shocks with exchange
rate flexibility, complemented with other measures
to limit excessive exchange rate volatility.
Directors underscored the importance of structural reforms to raise potential growth in both
advanced and emerging market and developing
economies. Within the euro area, these include
active labor market policies and better-targeted
training programs. Higher public investment in
some creditor economies, complemented by policies to encourage private investment, could boost
demand in the short term while raising potential
output over the medium term. More forceful structural reforms in Japan are also needed to increase
labor supply and raise productivity in some sectors
through deregulation. Other advanced economies
could also raise potential growth with measures to
augment human and physical capital and increase
labor force participation. Among emerging market
and developing economies, the priorities vary. These
include removing infrastructure bottlenecks; reforms
to education, labor, and product markets; and better government services delivery. While the current
account surplus in China has decreased markedly,
further progress to gradually shift its growth toward
domestic consumption and reduce reliance on credit

and investment would help forestall medium-term
risks of financial disruption or a sharp slowdown.
Joint efforts by both surplus and deficit economies
are needed to contribute to a further narrowing of

global external imbalances. Further diversification
and structural transformation remains a key priority
for low-income countries.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical
data as well as projections. It comprises six
sections: Assumptions, What’s New, Data
and Conventions, Classification of Countries, Key Data Documentation, and Statistical Tables.
The assumptions underlying the estimates and
projections for 2014–15 and the medium-term
scenario for 2016–19 are summarized in the first
section. The second section presents a brief description of the changes to the database and statistical
tables since the April 2014 World Economic Outlook (WEO). The third section provides a general
description of the data and the conventions used for
calculating country group composites. The classification of countries in the various groups presented
in the WEO is summarized in the fourth section.
The fifth section provides information on methods
and reporting standards for the member countries’
national account and government finance indicators
included in the report.
The last, and main, section comprises the statistical
tables. (Statistical Appendix A is included here; Statistical Appendix B is available online.) Data in these
tables have been compiled on the basis of information
available through September 19, 2014. The figures
for 2014 and beyond are shown with the same degree
of precision as the historical figures solely for convenience; because they are projections, the same degree
of accuracy is not to be inferred.

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced economies are assumed to remain constant at their average
levels during the period July 30 to August 27, 2014.
For 2014 and 2015, these assumptions imply average
U.S. dollar/special drawing right (SDR) conversion
rates of 1.537 and 1.534, U.S. dollar/euro conversion
rates of 1.354 and 1.344, and yen/U.S. dollar conversion rates of 102.4 and 102.3, respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average
$102.76 a barrel in 2014 and $99.36 a barrel in 2015.

Established policies of national authorities are
assumed to be maintained. The more specific policy
assumptions underlying the projections for selected
economies are described in Box A1.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that the
London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on six-month
U.S. dollar deposits will average 0.4 percent in 2014
and 0.7 percent in 2015, that three-month euro deposits will average 0.2 percent in 2014 and 0.1 percent
in 2015, and that six-month yen deposits will average
0.2 percent in 2014 and 2015.
With respect to introduction of the euro, on December
31, 1998, the Council of the European Union decided
that, effective January 1, 1999, the irrevocably fixed
conversion rates between the euro and currencies of the
member countries adopting the euro are as follows:

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: LEGACIES, CLOUDS, UNCERTAINTIES

What’s New
•• The WEO has adopted the sixth edition of the
Balance of Payments and International Investment
Position Manual (BPM6). Notable changes include
the following: (1) Merchanting has been reclassified
from services to exports of goods. (2) Manufacturing
services on physical inputs owned by others (goods
for processing in the BPM5) and maintenance and
repair services (repairs on goods in the BPM5)
have been reclassified from goods to services.
(3) Migrants’ transfers have been removed from capital transfers in the capital account because a change
in ownership is no longer imputed. (4) Reverse
investment in direct investment has been reclassified
so as to present assets and liabilities on a gross basis.
(5) A separate financial derivatives category is now
included in the financial account, whereas previously it was a subitem under portfolio investment.
In addition, the conventional sign for increases in
assets (and liabilities) within the financial account is
now positive, and balances are now computed as net
acquisition of financial assets minus net incurrence
of financial liabilities.
•• With the adoption of the BPM6, the Statistical
Appendix tables of the WEO have also been revised.
Table A13, which previously summarized data on
net and private financial flows in emerging market
and developing economies, is now a Summary of
Financial Account Balances. Table A14 has been
deleted because of data constraints. Table A15, Summary of Sources and Uses of World Savings, is now
A14, Summary of Net Lending and Borrowing, and
Table A16 has been renumbered as A15. Part B of
the Statistical Appendix contains most of the same
tables as previous WEO reports. Tables B16–B21
have been absorbed into a new Table B15, Summary
of Current Account Transactions, and into A13,
Summary of Financial Account Balances. As a result,
the subsequent tables have been renumbered, so that
the former Tables B22 through B27 are now Tables
B16 through B21.
•• Following the recent release of the 2011 International
Comparison Program (ICP) survey for new purchasing-power-parity benchmarks, the WEO’s estimates of
purchasing-power-parity weights and GDP valued at
purchasing power parity have been updated. For more
detail, see “Revised Purchasing Power Parity Weights”
in the July 2014 WEO Update, http://www.imf.org/
external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/update/02/index.htm.

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

•• As in the April 2014 WEO, data for Syria are
excluded from 2011 onward because of the uncertain political situation.
•• Because of the ongoing IMF program with Pakistan,
the series from which the nominal exchange rate
assumptions can be calculated are not made public,
as the nominal exchange rate is a market-sensitive
issue in Pakistan.
•• As in the April 2014 WEO, the consumer price
projections for Argentina are excluded because of a
structural break in the data. Please refer to note 5 in
Table A7 for further details.
•• Data for Latvia, which were previously excluded
from the euro area aggregates because of data constraints, are now included.
•• Projections for Ukraine, which were previously
excluded because of the crisis, are once again included.

Data and Conventions
Data and projections for 189 economies form the
statistical basis of the WEO database. The data are
maintained jointly by the IMF’s Research Department
and regional departments, with the latter regularly
updating country projections based on consistent
global assumptions.
Although national statistical agencies are the ultimate
providers of historical data and definitions, international
organizations are also involved in statistical issues, with
the objective of harmonizing methodologies for the compilation of national statistics, including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions, classifications, and valuation
procedures used in the production of economic statistics.
The WEO database reflects information from both
national source agencies and international organizations.
Most countries’ macroeconomic data presented in the
WEO conform broadly to the 1993 version of the System
of National Accounts (SNA). The IMF’s sector statistical standards—the BPM6, the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (MFSM 2000), and the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001)—have
been or are being aligned with the 2008 SNA.1 These
standards reflect the IMF’s special interest in countries’
external positions, financial sector stability, and public sector fiscal positions. The process of adapting country data
1Many other countries are implementing the 2008 SNA and will
release national accounts data based on the new standard in 2014.
A few countries use versions of the SNA older than 1993. A similar
adoption pattern is expected for the BPM6. Please refer to Table G,
which lists the statistical standards adhered to by each country.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

to the new standards begins in earnest when the manuals
are released. However, full concordance with the manuals is ultimately dependent on the provision by national
statistical compilers of revised country data; hence, the
WEO estimates are only partially adapted to these manuals. Nonetheless, for many countries the impact on major
balances and aggregates of conversion to the updated
standards will be small. Many other countries have
partially adopted the latest standards and will continue
implementation over a period of years.
Composite data for country groups in the WEO are
either sums or weighted averages of data for individual
countries. Unless noted otherwise, multiyear averages
of growth rates are expressed as compound annual rates
of change.2 Arithmetically weighted averages are used
for all data for the emerging market and developing
economies group except data on inflation and money
growth, for which geometric averages are used. The
following conventions apply:
•• Country group composites for exchange rates, interest rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates
are weighted by GDP converted to U.S. dollars at
market exchange rates (averaged over the preceding
three years) as a share of group GDP.
•• Composites for other data relating to the domestic economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are
weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parity
as a share of total world or group GDP.3
•• Unless noted otherwise, composites for all sectors
for the euro area are corrected for reporting discrepancies in intra-area transactions. Annual data are not
adjusted for calendar-day effects. For data prior to
1999, data aggregations apply 1995 European currency unit exchange rates.
•• Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual
country data after conversion to U.S. dollars at the
average market exchange rates in the years indicated.
•• Composite unemployment rates and employment
growth are weighted by labor force as a share of
group labor force.
2Averages for real GDP and its components, employment, GDP
per capita, inflation, factor productivity, trade, and commodity
prices are calculated based on the compound annual rate of change,
except in the case of the unemployment rate, which is based on the
simple arithmetic average.
3See Box A2 of the April 2004 WEO for a summary of the revised
purchasing-power-parity-based weights and Annex IV of the May
1993 WEO. See also Anne-Marie Gulde and Marianne Schulze-Ghattas, “Purchasing Power Parity Based Weights for the World Economic
Outlook,” in Staff Studies for the World Economic Outlook (Washington:
International Monetary Fund, December 1993), pp. 106–23.

•• Composites relating to external sector statistics are
sums of individual country data after conversion to
U.S. dollars at the average market exchange rates
in the years indicated for balance of payments data
and at end-of-year market exchange rates for debt
denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars.
•• Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes and
prices, however, are arithmetic averages of percent
changes for individual countries weighted by the
U.S. dollar value of exports or imports as a share
of total world or group exports or imports (in the
preceding year).
•• Unless noted otherwise, group composites are computed if 90 percent or more of the share of group
weights is represented.
Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few
countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F,
which lists the economies with exceptional reporting
periods for national accounts and government finance
data for each country. For some countries, the figures for
2013 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual
outturns. Please refer to Table G, which lists the latest
actual outturns for the indicators in the national accounts,
prices, government finance, and balance of payments
indicators for each country.

Classification of Countries
Summary of the Country Classification
The country classification in the WEO divides the
world into two major groups: advanced economies
and emerging market and developing economies.4 This
classification is not based on strict criteria, economic
or otherwise, and it has evolved over time. The objective is to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably
meaningful method of organizing data. Table A provides an overview of the country classification, showing
the number of countries in each group by region and
summarizing some key indicators of their relative size
(GDP valued by purchasing power parity, total exports
of goods and services, and population).
Some countries remain outside the country classification and therefore are not included in the analysis.
Anguilla, Cuba, the Democratic People’s Republic of
4As used here, the terms “country” and “economy” do not always
refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by inter­
national law and practice. Some territorial entities included here are
not states, although their statistical data are maintained on a separate
and independent basis.

Korea, and Montserrat are examples of countries that
are not IMF members, and their economies therefore
are not monitored by the IMF. Somalia is omitted
from the emerging market and developing economies
group composites because of data limitations.

General Features and Composition of
Groups in the World Economic Outlook
Classification
Advanced Economies
The 36 advanced economies are listed in Table B. The
seven largest in terms of GDP—the United States,
Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom,
and Canada—constitute the subgroup of major
advanced economies often referred to as the Group of
Seven (G7). The members of the euro area are also
distinguished as a subgroup. Composite data shown in
the tables for the euro area cover the current members for all years, even though the membership has
increased over time.
Table C lists the member countries of the European
Union, not all of which are classified as advanced
economies in the WEO.

Emerging Market and Developing Economies
The group of emerging market and developing economies (153) includes all those that are not classified as
advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging market and
developing economies are Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), emerging and developing Asia, emerging and developing Europe (sometimes also referred to
as “central and eastern Europe”), Latin America and the
Caribbean (LAC), Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP), and sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA).
Emerging market and developing economies are also
classified according to analytical criteria. The analytical
criteria reflect the composition of export earnings and
other income from abroad; a distinction between net
creditor and net debtor economies; and, for the net
debtors, financial criteria based on external financing
sources and experience with external debt servicing.

162

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

The detailed composition of emerging market and
developing economies in the regional and analytical
groups is shown in Tables D and E.
The analytical criterion source of export earnings
distinguishes between categories fuel (Standard International Trade Classification—SITC 3) and nonfuel and
then focuses on nonfuel primary products (SITCs 0, 1,
2, 4, and 68). Economies are categorized into one of
these groups when their main source of export earnings exceeded 50 percent of total exports on average
between 2009 and 2013.
The financial criteria focus on net creditor economies,
net debtor economies, and heavily indebted poor countries
(HIPCs). Economies are categorized as net debtors when
their current account balance accumulations from 1972
(or earliest data available) to 2013 were negative. Net
debtor economies are further differentiated on the basis of
two additional financial criteria: official external financing
and experience with debt servicing.5 Net debtors are placed
in the official external financing category when 66 percent
or more of their total debt, on average, between 2009 and
2013 was financed by official creditors.
The HIPC group comprises the countries that are
or have been considered by the IMF and the World
Bank for participation in their debt initiative known as
the HIPC Initiative, which aims to reduce the external
debt burdens of all the eligible HIPCs to a “sustainable” level in a reasonably short period of time.6 Many
of these countries have already benefited from debt
relief and have graduated from the initiative.
Low-Income Developing Countries (LIDCs) are
countries that were designated Poverty Reduction and
Growth Trust (PRGT) eligible in the 2013 PRGT
eligibility review and had a level of per capita gross
national income less than the PRGT income graduation
threshold for non–small states (that is, twice the World
Bank International Development Association operational threshold, or US$2,390 in 2011 as measured by
the World Bank’s Atlas method); and Zimbabwe.
5During 2009–13, 29 economies incurred external payments
arrears or entered into official or commercial bank debt-rescheduling
agreements. This group is referred to as economies with arrears and/or
rescheduling during 2009–13.

HIPC Initiative, IMF Pamphlet Series 51 (Washington: International
Monetary Fund, November 1999).

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions Underlying the Projections for Selected Economies
Fiscal policy assumptions
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in the
World Economic Outlook (WEO) are based on officially
announced budgets, adjusted for differences between
the national authorities and the IMF staff regarding
macroeconomic assumptions and projected fiscal outturns. The medium-term fiscal projections incorporate
policy measures that are judged likely to be implemented. For cases in which the IMF staff has insufficient information to assess the authorities’ budget
intentions and prospects for policy implementation,
an unchanged structural primary balance is assumed
unless indicated otherwise. Specific assumptions used
in regard to some of the advanced economies follow.
(See also Tables B5 to B9 in the online section of the
Statistical Appendix for data on fiscal net lending/borrowing and structural balances.)1
Argentina: The fiscal forecast is based on the projections for GDP growth, exports, and imports and the
nominal exchange rate.
Australia: Fiscal projections are based on the
2014–15 budget, Australian Bureau of Statistics, and
IMF staff projections.
Austria: Projections take into account the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework, as well as associated further implementation needs and risks. For
2014, the creation of a defeasance structure for Hypo
Alpe Adria is assumed to increase the general-government-debt-to-GDP ratio by 5½ percentage points and
the deficit by 1.2 percentage points.
Belgium: Projections reflect the authorities’ 2014
budget and the 2014–17 Stability Programme
objectives, adjusted for differences in the IMF staff’s
macroeconomic framework and assumptions about
1 The output gap is actual minus potential output, as a percent
of potential output. Structural balances are expressed as a percent
of potential output. The structural balance is the actual net lending/borrowing minus the effects of cyclical output from potential
output, corrected for one-time and other factors, such as asset and
commodity prices and output composition effects. Changes in the
structural balance consequently include effects of temporary fiscal
measures, the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and debt
service costs, and other noncyclical fluctuations in net lending/
borrowing. The computations of structural balances are based on
IMF staff estimates of potential GDP and revenue and expenditure elasticities. (See Annex I of the October 1993 WEO.) Net
debt is calculated as gross debt minus financial assets corresponding to debt instruments. Estimates of the output gap and of the
structural balance are subject to significant margins of uncertainty.

fiscal developments in the federal, regional, and local
governments.
Brazil: For 2013, preliminary outturn estimates are
based on the information available as of August 2014.
Projections for 2014 take into account the Third
Bimonthly Report adjustments to the original budget
(February 2014 presidential decree). In outer years,
the IMF staff assumes adherence to the announced
primary target.
Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts in the
Economic Action Plan 2014 (the fiscal year 2014/15
budget) and 2014 provincial budgets as available. The
IMF staff makes adjustments to this forecast for differences in macroeconomic projections. The IMF staff
forecast also incorporates the most recent data releases
from Statistics Canada’s Canadian System of National
Economic Accounts, including federal, provincial, and
territorial budgetary outturns through the end of the
fourth quarter of 2013.
Chile: Projections are based on the authorities’
budget projections, adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s
projections for GDP and copper prices. Projections
also include the official yield estimate of the tax
reform submitted to Congress in April 2014.
China: The pace of fiscal consolidation is likely
to be more gradual, reflecting reforms to strengthen
social safety nets and the social security system
announced as part of the Third Plenum reform
agenda.
Denmark: Projections for 2013–15 are aligned with
the latest official budget estimates and the underlying economic projections, adjusted where appropriate
for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions. For
2016–19, the projections incorporate key features
of the medium-term fiscal plan as embodied in the
authorities’ 2013 Convergence Programme submitted
to the European Union (EU).
France: Projections for 2014 reflect the budget law
and measures announced in the 2014 Stability Programme. For 2015–17, they are based on the 2013–17
multiyear budget and the April 2014 stability plan,
adjusted for differences in assumptions on macro and
financial variables, and revenue projections. Historical fiscal data were revised following a May 15, 2014,
revision by the statistical institute of both national and
fiscal accounts. Fiscal data for 2013 reflect the preliminary outturn published by the statistical institute in
May 2014.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: LEGACIES, CLOUDS, UNCERTAINTIES

Box A1 (continued)
Germany: The IMF staff’s projections for 2014 and
beyond reflect the authorities’ adopted core federal
government budget plan, adjusted for the differences
in the IMF staff’s macroeconomic framework and
assumptions about fiscal developments in state and
local governments, the social insurance system, and
special funds. The estimate of gross debt includes
portfolios of impaired assets and noncore business
transferred to institutions that are winding up, as well
as other financial sector and EU support operations.
Greece: Fiscal projections for 2014 and the medium
term are consistent with the policies discussed between
the IMF staff and the authorities in the context of the
Extended Fund Facility.
Hong Kong SAR: Projections are based on the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal projections.
Hungary: Fiscal projections include IMF staff projections of the macroeconomic framework and of the
impact of recent legislative measures, as well as fiscal
policy plans announced in the 2014 budget.
India: Historical data are based on budgetary execution data. Projections are based on available information on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments
for IMF staff assumptions. Subnational data are
incorporated with a lag of up to two years; general
government data are thus finalized well after central
government data. IMF and Indian presentations differ,
particularly regarding divestment and license auction
proceeds, net versus gross recording of revenues in certain minor categories, and some public sector lending.
Indonesia: IMF projections for 2014–18 are based
on a gradual increase in administrative fuel prices from
2015, the introduction beginning in 2014 of new social
protections, and moderate tax policy and administration
reforms.
Ireland: Fiscal projections are based on the 2014
budget, adjusted for differences between the IMF
staff’s macroeconomic projections and those of the
Irish authorities.
Italy: Fiscal projections incorporate the government’s announced fiscal policy, as outlined in the 2014
budget plan, adjusted for different growth outlooks and
estimated impact of measures. The fiscal impact of the
personal income tax credit is also included. Estimates of
the cyclically adjusted balance include the expenditures
to clear capital arrears in 2013, which are excluded
from the structural balance. After 2014, the IMF staff
projects convergence to a structural balance in line with

180

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

Italy’s fiscal rule, which implies corrective measures in
some years, as yet unidentified.
Japan: The projections include fiscal measures
already announced by the government, including
consumption tax increases, earthquake reconstruction
spending, and the stimulus package.
Korea: The medium-term forecast incorporates the
government’s announced medium-term consolidation
path.
Mexico: Fiscal projections for 2014 are broadly in
line with the approved budget; projections for 2014
onward assume compliance with rules established in
the fiscal responsibility law.
Netherlands: Fiscal projections for the period
2014–19 are based on the authorities’ Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis budget projections, after differences in macroeconomic assumptions are adjusted for.
Historical data were revised following the June 2014
Central Bureau of Statistics release of revised macro
data because of the adoption of the European System
of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and
the revisions of data sources.
New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on the
authorities’ Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2014
and on IMF staff estimates.
Portugal: For 2014, the general government fiscal
balance projection does not include one-off transactions arising from banking support and other
operations related to government-owned enterprises,
pending decisions on their statistical classification by
the Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE)/Eurostat.
Projections for 2014–15 remain consistent with the
authorities’ EU budgetary commitments, subject to
additional measures to be approved in the forthcoming 2015 budget; projections thereafter are based
on IMF staff estimates, under the assumption of
unchanged policies.
Russia: Projections for 2014–19 are based on the
oil-price-based fiscal rule introduced in December
2012, with adjustments by the IMF staff.
Saudi Arabia: The authorities base their budget on
a conservative assumption for oil prices, with adjustments to expenditure allocations considered in the
event that revenues exceed budgeted amounts. IMF
staff projections of oil revenues are based on WEO
baseline oil prices. On the expenditure side, wage bill
estimates incorporate 13th-month pay awards every
three years in accordance with the lunar calendar;

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1 (continued)
capital spending estimates over the medium term are
in line with the authorities’ priorities established in the
national development plans.
Singapore: For fiscal year 2014/15, projections are
based on budget numbers. For the remainder of the
projection period, the IMF staff assumes unchanged
policies.
South Africa: Fiscal projections are based on the
authorities’ 2014 Budget Review.
Spain: For 2013 and beyond, fiscal projections
are based on the measures specified in the Stability
Programme Update 2014–17; the revised fiscal policy
recommendations by the European Council in June
2013; the 2014 budget plan issued in October 2013;
and the 2014 budget, approved in December 2013.
Sweden: Fiscal projections are broadly in line with
the authorities’ projections based on the 2014 Spring
Fiscal Policy Bill. The impact of cyclical developments
on the fiscal accounts is calculated using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s
latest semielasticity.
Switzerland: Projections for 2012–19 are based on
IMF staff calculations, which incorporate measures to
restore balance in the federal accounts and strengthen
social security finances.
Turkey: Fiscal projections assume that both current
and capital spending will be in line with the authorities’ 2013–15 Medium-Term Programme based on
current trends and policies.
United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based on
the U.K. Treasury’s 2014 budget, published in March
2014. However, on the revenue side, the authorities’ projections are adjusted for differences between
IMF staff forecasts of macroeconomic variables (such
as GDP growth) and the forecasts of these variables
assumed in the authorities’ fiscal projections. In addition, IMF staff projections exclude the temporary
effects of financial sector interventions and the effect
on public sector net investment during 2012–13 of
transferring assets from the Royal Mail Pension Plan
to the public sector. Real government consumption
and investment are part of the real GDP path, which,
according to the IMF staff, may or may not be the
same as projected by the U.K. Office for Budget
Responsibility. Transfers of profits from the Bank
of England’s Asset Purchase Facility affect general
government net interest payments. The timing of these
payments can create differences between fiscal year

primary balances published by the authorities and
calendar year balances shown in the WEO.
United States: Fiscal projections are based on the
August 2014 Congressional Budget Office baseline
adjusted for the IMF staff’s policy and macroeconomic assumptions. The baseline incorporates the
key provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013,
including a partial rollback of the sequester spending cuts in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. The rollback
is fully offset by savings elsewhere in the budget. In
fiscal years 2016 through 2021, the IMF staff assumes
that the sequester cuts will continue to be partially
replaced, in proportions similar to those agreed upon
under the Bipartisan Budget Act for fiscal years 2014
and 2015, with back-loaded measures generating savings in mandatory programs and additional revenues.
Over the medium term, the IMF staff assumes that
Congress will continue to make regular adjustments
to Medicare payments (“doc fix”) and will extend
certain traditional programs (such as the research
and development tax credit). Fiscal projections are
adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s forecasts of key
macroeconomic and financial variables and different
accounting treatment of financial sector support and
of defined-benefit pension plans and are converted
to a general government basis. Historical data start at
2001 for most series because data compiled according to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM 2001) may not be available for earlier years.

Monetary policy assumptions
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the established policy framework in each country. In most
cases, this implies a nonaccommodative stance over the
business cycle: official interest rates will increase when
economic indicators suggest that inflation will rise
above its acceptable rate or range; they will decrease
when indicators suggest that inflation will not exceed
the acceptable rate or range, that output growth is
below its potential rate, and that the margin of slack in
the economy is significant. On this basis, the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on six-month
U.S. dollar deposits is assumed to average 0.4 percent
in 2014 and 0.7 percent in 2015 (see Table 1.1).
The rate on three-month euro deposits is assumed to
average 0.2 percent in 2014 and 0.1 percent in 2015.
The interest rate on six-month Japanese yen deposits is
assumed to average 0.2 percent in 2014 and 2015.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: LEGACIES, CLOUDS, UNCERTAINTIES

Box A1 (concluded)
Australia: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with market expectations.
Brazil: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent
with gradual convergence of inflation toward the
middle of the target range over the relevant horizon.
Canada: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with market expectations.
China: Monetary policy will remain broadly
unchanged from its current status, consistent with
the authorities’ announcement of maintaining stable
economic growth.
Denmark: The monetary policy is to maintain the
peg to the euro.
Euro area: Monetary policy assumptions for euro area
member countries are in line with market expectations.
Hong Kong SAR: The IMF staff assumes that the
currency board system remains intact.
India: The policy (interest) rate assumption is based
on the average of market forecasts.
Indonesia: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with a reduction of inflation by 2014 to within the
central bank’s targeted band.
Japan: The current monetary policy conditions are
maintained for the projection period, and no further
tightening or loosening is assumed.
Korea: Monetary policy assumptions are in line with
market expectations.
Mexico: Monetary assumptions are consistent with
attaining the inflation target.
Russia: Monetary projections assume increasing
exchange rate flexibility as part of the transition to

182

International Monetary Fund | October 2014

the new full-fledged inflation-targeting regime, as
indicated in recent statements by the Central Bank of
Russia. Specifically, policy rates are assumed to remain
at the current levels, gradually reducing the number of
interventions in the foreign exchange markets.
Saudi Arabia: Monetary policy projections are based
on the continuation of the exchange rate peg to the
U.S. dollar.
Singapore: Broad money is projected to grow in line
with the projected growth in nominal GDP.
South Africa: Monetary projections are consistent
with South Africa’s 3–6 percent inflation target range.
Sweden: Monetary projections are in line with Riksbank projections.
Switzerland: Monetary policy variables reflect
historical data from the national authorities and the
market.
Turkey: Broad money and the long-term bond yield
are based on IMF staff projections. The short-term
deposit rate is projected to evolve with a constant
spread against the interest rate of a similar U.S.
instrument.
United Kingdom: Projections assume an increase in
the monetary policy rate in the first half of 2015 and
no changes to the level of asset purchases.
United States: Given the outlook for sluggish growth
and inflation, the IMF staff expects the federal funds
target to remain near zero until mid-2015, consistent
with the Federal Open Market Committee’s forward
guidance and market expectations.

1Data for some countries refer to real net material product (NMP) or are estimates based on NMP. The figures should be interpreted only as indicative of broad orders of magnitude because
reliable, comparable data are not generally available. In particular, the growth of output of new private enterprises of the informal economy is not fully reflected in the recent figures.
2Georgia and Turkmenistan, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarity in economic structure.
3In this table only, the data for Timor-Leste are based on non-oil GDP.
4The data for Argentina are officially reported data as revised in May 2014. On February 1, 2013, the IMF issued a declaration of censure, and in December 2013 called on Argentina to
implement specified actions to address the quality of its official GDP data according to a specified timetable. On June 6, 2014, the Executive Board recognized the implementation of the
specified actions it had called for by end-March 2014 and the initial steps taken by the Argentine authorities to remedy the inaccurate provision of data. The Executive Board will review this
issue again as per the calendar specified in December 2013 and in line with the procedures set forth in the Fund’s legal framework.
5Data for 2011 exclude South Sudan after July 9. Data for 2012 and onward pertain to the current Sudan.
6Data for Syria are excluded for 2011 onward owing the uncertain political situation.

in consumer prices are shown as annual averages.
year-over-year changes and, for several countries, on a quarterly basis.
3For many countries, inflation for the earlier years is measured on the basis of a retail price index. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation data with broader and more up-to-date coverage are
typically used for more recent years.
4Georgia and Turkmenistan, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarity in economic structure.
5Consumer price data from January 2014 onwards reflect the new national CPI (IPCNu), which differs substantively from the preceding CPI (the CPI for the Greater Buenos Aires Area, CPI-GBA).
Because of the differences in geographical coverage, weights, sampling, and methodology, the IPCNu data cannot be directly compared to the earlier CPI-GBA data. Because of this structural
break in the data, staff forecasts for CPI inflation are not reported in the Fall 2014 World Economic Outlook. Following a declaration of censure by the IMF on February 1, 2013, the public release
of a new national CPI by end-March 2014 was one of the specified actions in the IMF Executive Board’s December 2013 decision calling on Argentina to address the quality of its official CPI data.
On June 6, 2014, the Executive Board recognized the implementation of the specified actions it had called for by end-March 2014 and the initial steps taken by the Argentine authorities to remedy
the inaccurate provision of data. The Executive Board will review this issue again as per the calendar specified in December 2013 and in line with the procedures set forth in the Fund’s legal
framework.
6Data for 2011 exclude South Sudan after July 9. Data for 2012 and onward pertain to the current Sudan.
7Data for Syria are excluded for 2011 onward owing the uncertain political situation.
8The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on IMF staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars. IMF staff estimates of U.S. dollar values
may differ from authorities’ estimates.

Note: The methodology and specific assumptions for each country are discussed in Box A1. The country group composites for fiscal data are calculated as the sum of the U.S. dollar values
for the relevant individual countries.
1Debt data refer to the end of the year and are not always comparable across countries. Gross and net debt levels reported by national statistical agencies for countries that have adopted the
System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong SAR, and United States) are adjusted to exclude unfunded pension liabilities of government employees definedbenefit pension plans. Fiscal data for the aggregated Major Advanced Economies and the United States start in 2001, and the average for the aggregate and the United States is therefore for
the period 2001–07.
2Percent of potential GDP.
3Figures reported by the national statistical agency are adjusted to exclude items related to the accrual-basis accounting of government employees defined-benefit pension plans.
4Excludes one-time measures based on the authorities data and, in the absence of the latter, receipts from the sale of assets.
5Includes equity shares.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the U.S. dollar
values for the relevant individual countries. Some group aggregates for the financial derivatives are not shown because of incomplete data. Projections for the euro area are not available because
of data constraints.
1In this table, Other Advanced Economies means advanced economies excluding the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and euro area countries. Group
aggregates for financial derivatives are not shown because of incomplete data.
2Georgia and Turkmenistan, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarity in economic structure.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the U.S.
dollar values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the WEO, in which the composites were weighted by GDP valued at
purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. The estimates of gross national savings and investment (or gross capital formation) are from individual countries’ national accounts
statistics. The estimates of the current account balance, the capital account balance, and the financial account balance (or net lending/net borrowing) are from the balance of payments
statistics. The link between domestic transactions and transactions with the rest of the world can be expressed as accounting identities. Savings (S) minus investment (I) is equal to the
current account balance (CAB) (S – I = CAB). Also, net lending/net borrowing (NLB) is the sum of the current account balance and the capital account balance (KAB) (NLB = CAB + KAB). In
practice, these identities do not hold exactly; imbalances result from imperfections in source data and compilation as well as from asymmetries in group composition due to data availability.
1In this table, Other Advanced Economies means advanced economies excluding the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and euro area countries.
2Georgia and Turkmenistan, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarity in economic structure.
