Foreword

Geography has always played a
central role in the organization of
economic activity. Cities first formed
as trading hubs for agricultural
and manufactured goods. Many of
them emerged where trading routes
intersected or where goods moved
from one mode of transportation to
another. With the onset of the industrial
revolution, cities became centers of
large-scale industrial production. As
industrialization advanced, some
expanded into megacities, while
others saw their fortunes decline.

Foreword

In the innovation-driven economy of the 21st century,
cities continue to play a pivotal role. However, the
forces shaping the geography of economic activity have
changed. Companies want to be in urban hotspots,
because that is where the most skilled and talented
workers live. Well-paying and rewarding jobs as well
as the buzz of city life, in turn, attract yet more highly
skilled individuals to those hotspots. Innovation also
relies crucially on the exchange of ideas among people.
Such exchanges usually happen best when people live
and work in close proximity to each other.
Yet, the economic geography of the 21st century has
another important dimension. Technology has facili­
tated new ways of collaborating and sharing knowl­
edge, connecting skilled individuals located far apart.
The emerging global innovation landscape is thus one
of geographically concentrated centers of excellence
around the world, which are embedded in a global
network carrying knowledge in many directions.
The evolving geography of innovation matters.
Governments around the world strive to promote a
policy environment conducive to innovation. Doing
so requires an understanding of the local dynamics
of innovation ecosystems. For example, where can
government-funded research best enhance nascent
technological capabilities? How can smart city plan­
ning encourage opportunities for knowledge sharing
and collaboration? More broadly, the spread of innova­
tive activity within economies increasingly affects the
regional distribution of incomes. Understanding the
driving forces behind this trend, in turn, enables better
policy responses.
Our World Intellectual Property Report 2019 offers
an empirical perspective on the global geography of
innovation. It does so by following the geographical
footprint that innovators have left in millions of patent
and scientific publication records over the past few
decades. WIPO’s Global Innovation Index has already
embraced this big data approach in identifying the
world’s largest science and technology clusters. This
report goes further. It employs more data going back
several decades, analyzes time trends and explores

in some detail how innovators from around the world
collaborate with each other. The emerging picture is a
complex one, with a limited number of global innova­
tion hotspots in a few countries accounting for most
innovative activity. Collaboration is widespread, taking
place in increasingly larger teams and – for most but not
all countries – it is increasingly cross-border in nature.
In addition to this economy-wide perspective, the
report includes two case studies that explore in detail
the evolving geography of innovation for two fields of
technology undergoing rapid change. One case study
focuses on autonomous vehicles technology. It details
how innovation is reshaping the car industry, with
information technology (IT) companies challenging
established carmakers. This transformation is broaden­
ing the innovation landscape, with several IT-focused
hotspots – which traditionally were not at the center of
automotive innovation – gaining prominence.
The other case study focuses on agricultural biotech­
nology. Scientific and inventive activity in crop biotechnology is concentrated in a few high-income
economies and China, and – within those economies
– mostly in large metropolitan areas. Relative to other
areas of innovation, however, it is more geographically
widespread, spanning many countries in Africa, Latin
America and Asia. This partly reflects a need to adapt
innovations to local conditions.
The evidence presented in this report highlights how
globally intertwined innovation has become. Crucially,
the ability of companies and researchers to collab­
orate across borders has relied on policies largely
favoring openness and international cooperation. The
report makes the case for maintaining policy openness
and further strengthening international cooperation.
Solving increasingly complex technological problems
will require ever larger and more specialized teams of
researchers. International collaboration helps form such
teams and will therefore be indispensable in continu­
ously pushing the global technology frontier.
While offering original insights, the analysis presented
in this report also comes with certain caveats. Patent

and scientific publication data provide rich and interna­
tionally comparable information on innovative activity.
However, they neither capture all such activity, nor
do they fully portray the rich interactions taking place
among innovators. In addition, the dynamic forces
that shape the direction of global innovation networks
are manifold and interact with one another in intricate
ways. Further research that offers empirical guidance
on these forces would be of much value.
We hope that this report contributes to a greater appre­
ciation of the importance that geography exerts on
innovative activity and, in doing so, that it helps in
refining policies to promote innovation and ensuring
that its benefits are widely shared.

Executive summary

The geography of innovation can
seem paradoxical: the generation of
scientific knowledge and innovation is
both increasingly global and intensely
concentrated in a few local hotspots.
New players, particularly Asian
countries, are responsible for more
and more scientific research and
inventions, which were once the almost
exclusive domain of a handful of rich
economies. At the same time, this
greater international spread has been
accompanied – at country level – by
increased concentration of innovative
activity within a few densely populated
areas. These urban areas are vibrant
innovation ecosystems, such as
Silicon Valley outside San Francisco
in the U.S or China’s Shenzhen–Hong
Kong, a more recent hotspot.

Executive summary

This paradox is more apparent than real, however;
the world’s most innovative urban agglomerations are
also the most open to the outside world. Sometimes,
they are better connected internationally than they
are to their national hinterlands. Together, they form
what economists have come to refer to as global
innovation networks. Skilled individuals and innovative
companies are at the center of these networks. Highly
skilled workers gravitate toward innovative urban areas
because they want to interact with one another and
enjoy the amenities of metropolitan life. Large cities
offer companies a large local market, specialized
suppliers and academic institutions that allow them
to reap economies of scale and scope. Knowledge, in
turn, flows more fluidly among company and university
researchers when they work in close proximity, fueling
the innovation engine.
This WIPO report analyses these dual trends, exploiting
a rich data set of millions of patent applications and
scientific publications. Its findings argue for increasing
openness and support for collaboration if innovation is
to continue to flourish.

Knowledge creation is spreading
to more and more countries
For most of the period from 1970 to 2000 only three
countries – the United States of America (U.S.), Japan
and Germany – accounted for two thirds of all patent­
ing activity worldwide. When the remaining Western
European economies are included the share reached
some 90 percent. But in the years since, the rest of
the world has come from almost nowhere to account
for almost one third of all patenting activity. Published
scientific data have spread even more widely, with the
rest of the world going from less than a quarter of all
such publication to around half over the last 20 years.
China and the Republic of Korea are largely responsible
for the rising share of new areas in knowledge produc­
tion and innovation; together, they account for over 20
percent of patents registered in the years 2015–2017,
compared to under 3 percent in 1990–1999. Other
countries, notably Australia, Canada, India and Israel,
have also contributed to the global spread of innova­
tion. Many middle-income countries, however, and all
lower-income countries, continue to have substantially
lower levels of patenting activity.

The increasingly dispersed and interconnected flow of
knowledge and innovation has mirrored the develop­
ment of complex global networks, or value chains, for
the production and delivery of goods and services.
In particular, multinational companies have located
knowledge-intensive production stages – most impor­
tantly research and development (R&D) – in urban
agglomerations that offer specialized knowledge
and skills. More generally, it is the need for greater
collaboration in the face of growing technologi­
cal complexity that has driven both the increasing
concentration of innovation in certain urban areas
and its global spread.

Innovation is increasingly local
On the basis of geocoded inventor and scientific author
data, this report explores the geography of innova­
tion within countries and identifies the world’s main
agglomerations of scientific and technological activity.
It looks at two types: global innovation hotspots, which
show the highest density of scientific publication or
patent activity; and specialized niche clusters, where
the density of inventors and scientific authors is high
in a given field but not high enough generally to be a
global hotspot.

Innovation is geographically concentrated
in a limited number of areas
The emerging landscape of global hotspots and niche
clusters shows that inventive and scientific activity
within each country is persistently concentrated in a
few large, cosmopolitan and prosperous urban areas.
In the U.S., hotspots around New York, San Francisco
and Boston accumulated roughly a quarter of all U.S.
patents filed from 2011 to 2015. In China, those around
Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen increased their share
from 36 percent to 52 percent of all Chinese patents
during the same period.
Less than 19 percent of all inventive and scientific output
worldwide is generated by inventors or researchers
located outside hotspots and niche clusters. Despite
this big change in the global innovation picture, more
than 160 countries – the vast majority – still generate
little innovation activity and do not host any hotspot
or niche cluster.

World Intellectual Property Report 2019

Big cities are not necessarily
hubs of innovation
Not all large metropolitan areas are innovation dense. For
example, North America hosts most hotspots in dense
urban areas along the east and west coasts, while many
dense inland urban areas do not have an equivalent
density of innovation. Asia, Latin America and Africa host
many dense urban areas with no corresponding innova­
tion density. Despite high populations, top metropoles –
for example, Bangkok, Cairo, Cape Town, Kuala Lumpur
and Santiago de Chile – only have a modest degree of
innovation density in some specialized fields.
And less dense urban areas can sometimes host
niche clusters. Some examples are Ithaca in the U.S.,
Stavanger in Norway and Bern in Switzerland, which
are highly innovative cities due to the strong innovation
footprint of local academic institutions, industries or,
sometimes, the presence of a key company.

Collaboration is increasingly the norm
Data show that teams are involved in an increasing
majority of scientific papers and patents. In the early
2000s, teams already produced 64 percent of all
scientific papers and 54 percent of all patents. By the
second half of the 2010s, these figures had grown to
almost 80 percent and 70 percent, respectively.

the U.S. and Western Europe accounted for 68 and
62 percent, respectively, of all international inventive
and scientific collaboration. Most of the collabora­
tion happens among inventors and researchers from
these countries. New entrants to these collaboration
networks, from countries such as China, India, Australia
and Brazil, still mostly collaborate with the aforemen­
tioned economies rather than with each other.

Hotspots and clusters drive international
collaboration and global networks
Most global innovation hotspots have increased their
international collaboration over the last two decades.
This collaboration – whether national or international,
patents or publication – forms a thick web of ties that
constitutes the global innovation networks. The shape
of these networks has evolved, typically with more
nodes and ties being added over time.
Inventors and scientists within hotspots and niche
clusters collaborate internationally more than those
outside, particularly in scientific articles. Over the last
two decades, the share of scientific publication involv­
ing international collaboration between scientists from
inside hotspots has been more than triple that between
scientists outside of them.

Collaboration is concentrated
Most high-income economies also show rising inter­
national collaboration. The forces pushing academia
and companies to cross borders seeking partners for
innovation are manifold. The scientific community has
a long tradition of engaging in international collabora­
tion, while multinational companies seek efficiency
gains from the international division of their R&D and
through international collaboration.
The main exceptions to the trend toward international­
ization are East Asia’s top economies where Japan, the
Republic of Korea and, more recently, China have seen
falling shares of international collaboration, though not
in absolute number terms.

A few countries account for
most of the international ties
Most international collaboration is concentrated among
a few main countries. In the period from 2011 to 2015,
10

Notwithstanding new network nodes and their ties,
the hotspots in the U.S., Europe and Asia remain the
core of the global networks both in terms of output and
connectivity. Overall, larger hotspots collaborate both
nationally and internationally, whereas niche clusters
and smaller hotspots collaborate predominantly at the
national level. For instance, many French and United
Kingdom (U.K.) hotspots connect with the rest of the
world mostly through Paris and London respectively.
In China, Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen act as the
top gatekeepers.
Yet, not all hotspots have the same relevance in terms
of connections. U.S. hotspots are among the most
connected nodes. Beijing, London, Paris, Seoul,
Shanghai and Tokyo are also highly connected, but
much less so. Interestingly, the high volume of inven­
tive and scientific activity of the U.S. hotspots does
not fully explain their higher connectivity. Many other
hotspots – for example, Tokyo or Seoul – show larger

Executive summary

or similar scientific or inventive output but are not so
highly connected.
The intensity of international collaboration varies
considerably across countries. For example, hotspots
in India and Switzerland are highly connected interna­
tionally, while those in the Republic of Korea and Japan
are weakly connected. In many hotspots, internation­
alization often goes hand-in-hand with an increase in
the share of local-only interactions. In many Chinese
hotspots the number of co-inventions within hotspots
has grown remarkably, leading to a decline in share of
both national and international collaboration outside
these hotspots.

Multinational companies lie
at the center of the web
Patent data shed light on the corporate R&D networks at
the center of global innovation networks. Multinational
companies from around the world increasingly list
foreign inventors in their patent applications and
those foreign inventors come from a widening set of
countries. In the 1970s and 1980s, only 9 percent of
patents filed by U.S. companies had foreign inventors;
by the 2010s, this share had risen to 38 percent. Western
European companies saw a similarly sharp increase,
from 9 percent to 27 percent in the same period.
Such international patent sourcing still mostly happens
between companies and inventors from high-income
economies. In the 1970s and 1980s, 86 percent of the
international patent sourcing was between multinational
companies and inventors from the U.S., Japan and
Western European countries. However, this share fell
to 56 percent in the 2010s.

Middle-income economies are
new players in MNC networks
Two main developments explain this fall. On the one
hand, multinationals from these countries increasingly
outsourced R&D activities to middle-income econo­
mies, particularly China, India and, to a lesser extent,
Eastern Europe. For instance, in the 2010s, more than a
quarter of all international patent sourcing by U.S. multi­
national companies had an inventor from China or India.
On the other hand, multinationals from middle-income
economies also actively participate in global innovation
networks. Companies from Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin

America and Africa rely intensively on the ingenuity of
U.S., Western European and Chinese inventors.

Innovation hubs move
and can disperse over time
Multinationals can have very different needs and strat­
egies as to where to source for talent, and these can
change over time. For example, Google and Siemens
have concentrated inventive activities within their top
hubs. In the 2010s, San Jose–San Francisco accounted
for 54 percent of Google’s patents, up from 36 percent
in the 2000s. Similarly, Nuremberg – the most important
source of patents for German manufacturing company
Siemens – accounted for 32 percent during the 2010s
against 27 percent in the 2000s.
The concentration is even greater in Asian companies,
though it has slightly decreased over time. Tokyo
and Shenzhen–Hong Kong were the most important
inventive sources for Sony and Huawei in the 2010s,
accounting for 71 percent and 81 percent of patents,
respectively. However, this is down from a respective
83 percent and 88 percent in the previous decade,
suggesting a relative dispersion of innovation.

Innovation is reshaping
the car industry
The report delves deeper into the evolving geography of
innovation by studying two industries seeing profound
change. One is the automotive sector, which is in the
early phases of technological disruption. New entrants
– from within the automotive industry and from the
information technology (IT) industry – are challenging
established players.
Fully autonomous vehicles (AV) have yet to reach the
market. Nevertheless, artificial intelligence (AI) data
analytics and the interconnectivity of devices and
components are reformulating the industry’s business
model toward services and the so-called “platform
economy.” Traditional automakers fear being displaced
in their core business of making and marketing cars.
Patent data suggest that traditional automakers and
their suppliers are at the forefront of AV innovation. Ford,
Toyota and Bosch – accounting for 357, 320 and 277
of AV patent families, respectively – are the top three
AV patent applicants. However, non-automakers also
11

World Intellectual Property Report 2019

feature in the list of top patent applicants. Google, and
its AV subsidiary Waymo, are in eighth position with 156
patents, ahead of traditional automakers like Nissan,
BMW and Hyundai. Uber and Delphi each have 62 AV
patents and are ranked joint 31st.

Incumbents and new entrants collaborate
among and between themselves
Neither the incumbents nor the new entrants currently
have all the required competencies for producing AVs.
They either need to join forces or else develop inter­
nally the respective skills they lack. AV innovation is
a long-term and costly endeavor. Stakeholders have
high incentives to collaborate and share risks and costs
with different type of partners. Three types of collabo­
ration are forming: between incumbent automakers;
between tech firms, and between automakers and
tech firms. The emerging collaboration network is an
amalgam of all the above: none is mutually exclusive,
and they coexist.

Automotive and IT firms stay tied
to their traditional clusters
The top automakers and top IT giants still strongly favor
home-based sites for their inventive activities. There is
some shift in geography at the margins, so it might be
too early to give a definitive answer as to whether AV
technology will change the geography of innovation in
the automotive industry.

Innovation is sown in biotech labs
and harvested in agricultural clusters
Crop biotechnology is an industry where innovation has
to be adapted to local agro-ecological conditions. While
most plant biotechnology inventions may come from
high-income countries – for example, the U.S., Western
Europe and East Asian countries – they still need adapt­
ing to different climate and soil conditions. Most of the
transgenic crops used in emerging middle-income
countries during the late 1990s were locally adapted
germplasms of their North American counterparts. As
a result, plant biotechnology innovation clusters exist
in many parts of the world. However, the data show
that crop biotechnology innovation in many countries
in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Asia
is geographically concentrated.
12

The landscape of plant biotech innovation
A handful of countries accounts for the bulk of biotech­
nology inventive and scientific output. The U.S.,
Germany, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea
accumulate more than 55 percent and 80 percent of all
crop biotechnology articles and patents, respectively.
Only Argentina, Australia, India, Israel, Mexico and
Singapore join them in the list of countries hosting plant
biotechnology clusters; and, except for Australia, they
all have only one.
There is a geographic divide between where plant
biotech innovation occurs and where transgenic crops
are farmed. In most cases, crop biotechnology hotspots
are located in large metropolitan areas, either in global
innovation hotspots or in specialized niche clusters
with strong biotech competences. This also holds for
developing countries, where national crop biotechnology
clusters are typically located in large urban areas, such
as São Paulo in Brazil and Cape Town.
Some clusters are close to rural areas – for example,
Viçosa in Brazil or Irapuato in Mexico. Wherever they
are, their presence is usually associated with influential
public institutions, such as universities, international
agricultural research centers and/or national agriculture
research systems.

Increasing private–public collaboration
Private firms, particularly the four major agrobusi­
ness companies – Bayer and BASF from Germany,
ChemChina and Corteva Agriscience from the U.S. –
undertake a large part of the R&D investment in plant
biotechnology. The need for access to proprietary
technologies has spurred collaboration within the
industry through cross-licensing, licensing-in, joint
research ventures and even mergers and acquisitions.
Nevertheless, there is an increasing need for collabora­
tion with the public sector to access, for example, pools
of germplasms and cultivars – crop varieties with desir­
able traits – often held by public research institutions.
For public institutions the high costs of commercializing
crop biotechnology products almost always require
collaboration with large multinational companies. Since
the 2000s, co-patenting between private firms and
public institutions has overtaken co-patenting among
private firms to become the main type of collabora­
tion. In fact, since the 2010s, co-patenting between

Executive summary

private firms has slipped to third in importance behind
co-patenting between public institutions.

Openness in pursuit of innovation
brings mutual gains
What does the global geography of innovation, as
portrayed in this report, imply for policymaking? The
growth of global innovation networks has relied on poli­
cies favoring openness and international cooperation,
but this should not be taken for granted – especially
as public perceptions have become more skeptical of
the benefits of globalization.
Economic theory offers good reasons why the free
exchange of knowledge is beneficial: it promotes the
specialization of different innovation clusters around
the world, leading to more efficient and diverse knowl­
edge production. The public good nature of knowledge
reinforces the benefits of openness: if knowledge flows
generate economic benefits abroad without diminish­
ing those at home, there are bound to be mutual gains
from openness.
Theoretically, there may well be circumstances in which
strategic restrictions on trade and knowledge flows
could benefit the growth paths of economies. However,
the experience of high-income economies over the past
decades suggests an overall positive impact from the
flow of knowledge about new technologies.

Making openness work requires
international cooperation…
International cooperation in relation to innovation has
many dimensions. It is needed to promote incentives
for investments in innovation that reflect the demands
and size of the global economy. It can also play an
important role in making it easier for innovators to do
business internationally. Lastly, governments can pool
resources and fund large-scale scientific projects that
exceed national budgets or require technical knowledge
available in different countries.

…and policies that address
growing regional divergence
One worrying trend of the past few decades is the
increasing inter-regional polarization of incomes, inno­
vative activity and high-skilled employment and wages
within countries. Openness strengthens the gravita­
tional pull toward champion regions. As this report
demonstrates, the most vibrant innovation hotspots,
which are embedded in global innovation networks,
tend to be located in what are already the richest
metropolitan agglomerations within countries.
Regional support and development policies can play an
important role in helping regions that have fallen behind.
While not reversing the gravitational pull of successful
regions, they can promote innovation-driven growth
that benefits economies as a whole.

Falling R&D productivity reinforces
the case for openness
Continuously pushing the technological frontier is
becoming exceedingly difficult. Evidence suggests that
achieving the same level of technological progress as
in the past requires more and more R&D effort.
Falling R&D productivity calls for constantly increasing
investments in innovation. It also calls for collabora­
tion and openness. Finding solutions to increasingly
complex technological problems requires larger teams
of researchers and greater specialization in research,
both of which can be promoted by openness and
international collaboration.

The changing global
geography of innovation

Technological innovation is the engine that
propels economic growth and fosters higher
living standards. As described in WIPO’s World
Intellectual Property Report 2015, the growth
record of the past 200 years has been historically
unprecedented. A series of technological
breakthroughs have greatly improved the quality
of life and generated widespread material
prosperity. Even so, some national economies
have seen faster and more sustained growth
than others. The geographical distribution and
the spread of innovation activities – whether
technological or knowledge-generating – go a
long way to explaining why some economies
have developed faster than others. New
technologies, in turn, have shaped where and
how innovation has taken place.1

The first industrial revolution – spurred in the
late 18 th century by new manufacturing process­
es powered by steam – concentrated the world’s
industrial output in Western Europe, particularly,
the United Kingdom (U.K.). 2 It changed the face of
the world economy, generating a different global
development hierarchy. Equally important, it also
led to persistent regional divergences within Europe,
with a select set of regions and cities – such as
Manchester and London in the U.K., Normandy, Paris
and Lyon in France, the Ruhrgebiet in Germany, Liège
in Belgium or the Franco-German region that included
Lorraine, Saarland and Luxembourg – constituting
the “European core.”3
The second industrial revolution – driven by a broad
array of electro-mechanical inventions in the second
half of the 19th century – witnessed the entry of North
America into the high-income club of the world, while
broadening the industrialized regions of Europe. There
was not a perfect overlap between the countries, cities
and regions at the core of the two revolutions. Some
previously core regions declined while others thrived.
In Europe, the waves of industrialization expanded
concentrically, taking in, among others, southwest
France, northeastern Spain, the Milan–Venice corridor
in northern Italy, Berlin, Vienna, Krakow and Prague, as
well as moving north to Oslo and Sweden’s Gothenburg.
In the United States of America (U.S.), northeastern
cities – such as Boston, New York and Baltimore –
remained industrially important, but industrialization
expanded to several Midwest cities, such as Chicago,
Detroit, Minneapolis and Cleveland.
Starting in the 1970s and 1980s, a third industrial revo­
lution has occurred, broadly involving digital technolo­
gies, life-science and biological technologies, financial
engineering and significant breakthroughs in transport
and logistics. It has coincided with major increases
in global trade and investment flows. Innovation and
economic development has spread to northeast Asia,
moving from Japan to the Republic of Korea and later
to China. Tokyo, Seoul, Shenzhen and Beijing have
grown into megacities shaping the direction of techno­
logical progress today. The “incumbent” high-income
15

World Intellectual Property Report 2019

economies in Europe and North America continue to
be at the forefront of innovation, but again with a new
geographical landscape within them.
What forces can explain why innovation has concen­
trated in certain geographical areas and has spread
only unevenly? Going beyond the broad patterns
outlined above, how exactly is the global geography
of innovation changing? How do companies in today’s
globalized age organize their innovation activities
across the world?
This report endeavors to provide a perspective on
these questions. It does so in three parts. First, it
reviews economic thinking and empirical evidence
explaining the geographical distribution of innovative
activity – a task performed in this opening chapter.
Second, it draws on patent and scientific publication
data with geocoded inventors and scientific authors
from around the world to show how this geography
of innovation has evolved over the past decades.
The discussion of the emerging trends – presented
in Chapter 2 – will portray this geography in terms
of global innovation networks (GINs), geographically
concentrated innovation hotspots and niche innova­
tion clusters connected to one another, which are
increasingly leading the way. The report will also
illustrate the operation of such GINs through two case
studies – one on autonomous vehicles and the other
on agricultural biotechnologies. These case studies
will be presented in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively.
Finally, the report concludes – in Chapter 5 – with
policy perspectives on its main findings. They empha­
size, in particular, the benefits of national innovation
systems remaining open to the international exchange
of knowledge.
This opening chapter discusses the main economic
forces behind both the geographical concentration
and spread of knowledge creation and diffusion. The
following section reviews the main economic theo­
ries and existing evidence behind the geographical
concentration of innovative activities. It shows that the
processes of knowledge creation and flow, investment
and appropriation are reinforcing global innovation and
economic hierarchies and how they are concentrating
innovation within geographical hotspots or clusters,
most of them metropolitan. Section 2.2 considers
how these processes are at the same time leading to
an increased dispersion of hotspots at a global scale.
It explores the main forces – operating principally
through global networks of firms, researchers and
16

entrepreneurs – which are linking the main innovationcreation centers around the globe. The final section
explores some of the consequences arising from
today’s global network of highly concentrated innova­
tion hotspots.

1.1
Concentration of
innovation in urban hotspots
Framing the geography of global innovation requires
understanding both the forces driving innovation’s
concentration and its spread. One prominent feature
of the geography of economic development is common
to both established high-income economies and
successful emerging middle-income ones: the geog­
raphy of high incomes is increasingly metropolitan,
reflecting renewed inter-regional divergence within
countries. These metropolitan areas are also hotbeds
for the formation of ecosystems of innovation. In
the U.S., two prominent examples are the south­
ern part of the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern
California and the Greater Boston metropolitan region
in Massachusetts, often dubbed Silicon Valley and
Route 128, respectively.

What economic forces explain the
agglomeration of innovation?
One of the toughest questions for geography, econom­
ics and development studies is to ascertain why such
hotbeds, or agglomerations, of innovation arise and
flourish where they do. This question goes from the
general factors that lie behind the clustering of inno­
vation to the specific geographies of those agglom­
erations.4
Several different economic theories address this ques­
tion. These most commonly consider the economic
forces relating to pools of skilled labor, market scale
and knowledge spillover – where highly innovative
firms are concentrated, knowledge can filter, or “spill,”
from one to another. Historical accidents or deliberate
policy can affect all these, but none succeed entirely
in answering the question. At the same time, there
are forces pushing in the opposite direction, toward
geographical dispersion, but all accounts indicate
these are not as a strong.
Figure 1.1 provides a graphical summary of the main
forces driving concentration, discussed below.

Does skill supply help drive
innovative agglomeration?
Mainstream economic theory offers a number of ways
in which the geographical concentration of innovation
can be an indirect outcome of labor supply – both
quantity and quality.5
These theories assume that workers with different skills
gravitate toward different regions. In basic terms, highly
skilled workers cluster together, because they want to
interact with one another, so the education and skills
of the workforce in a given region can act as a force
of attraction. At the same time, migration can change
the skills base of the workforce of the receiving region,
reinforcing the agglomeration effect.
The preferences of highly skilled workers for vibrant
agglomerations and to work in innovation are part of
this picture. Innovation-generating occupations offer
career trajectories and life-long learning, which secure
future employment opportunities at a time when auto­
mation increasingly seems to threaten many traditional
white-collar occupations. Such work also offers high
wages that compensate for rising costs of living and
housing. Cost pressures also push less well-paid,
unskilled workers to the urban periphery.

The changing global geography of innovation

Empirical evidence shows that regions that had a
higher-than-average concentration of college-educated
workers in the past observe further growth in the share
of college-educated workers, per capita incomes,
patents and other direct and indirect proxies for inno­
vation. The characteristics of the local labor supply
seem to influence the development trajectory of
innovation-generating agglomerations and impact
regional innovativeness, both in the U.S. and in the
European Union (EU).6
However, what explains the origin of a singularly skilled
workforce in a given region? At some points in history,
skilled workers have changed their geographical distri­
bution, favoring spatial spread. Why has the behavior of
the skilled workforce spontaneously changed in favor
of geographical concentration? This was the case in
the maturing phase of the second industrial revolution,
when there was a massive migration of skilled workers
– together with unskilled ones – from all over the world
to the leading developed countries from 1940 to 1980.7
Historical accidents involving unusual individuals can
be partial explanations for the location of innovative
agglomerations, especially those involving first-mover
regions in the key technologies of each industrial
revolution. Thus, by some accounts, Silicon Valley
is where it is, because William Shockley – the inven­
tor of the silicon-based semiconductor – decided to
relocate from New Jersey to be near his aging mother.
Another anecdote concerning Shockley is that after he
attracted top-quality associates to his first-mover firm,
his difficult management style caused them all to quit
on the same day. This event – known as “Shockley’s
massacre” – created a first and unexpected example of
the spin-offs that have become so typical in the Silicon
Valley process of development. The annals of innova­
tion contain plenty of other such people-based stories.
Nevertheless, the randomness of such “great inven­
tor presence” stories raises some doubts. There are
so many famous individuals associated with Silicon
Valley – from Shockley and Frederick Terman, one of
the acknowledged “fathers” of Silicon Valley, to Apple’s
Steve Jobs and Google co-founders Sergey Brin and
Larry Page – that it seems unlikely that all could be there
by coincidence. Moreover, Saxenian (1994) powerfully
argues that the mere presence of early innovators
is not enough. Plenty of the early great information
technologies (IT) innovators were located in Boston,
but they did not stay. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg
left Boston for Silicon Valley, because Boston was not
17

World Intellectual Property Report 2019

the right place to transform a breakthrough invention
into a fully fledged innovation, just as had happened
to New Jersey decades earlier, when William Shockley
left for the Bay Area.
In addition, “skill” is not a uniform entity and different
technologies may need different sets or combinations
of skills that may not always overlap. A finance worker
will be attracted to different locations than an IT engi­
neer, and these locations and jobs are not interchange­
able. But at the same time, different professions and
skills may be complementary for the production of a
given innovation.

Demand side: how market forces
generate innovation hubs
Market economic forces complement labor supply
ones as drivers of the geographic concentration of
innovation activities. The main market economic forces
are generated by the “pool” of organizations – notably
private firms – within a market and the consequent
economies of transport, scale and scope.
This pool is at the heart of productivity differences across
regions. As with the “unusual individual cases,” histori­
cal accidents involving innovation breakthroughs by a
key firm within a local economy, a so-called “anchor”
firm, can be equally important in starting an innovation
ecosystem that then organically grows as both skilled
labor and related activities relocate. At such moments,
key firms can have an idiosyncratic influence on agglom­
eration. But this is not always the case. Motorola located
the largest early semiconductor facility in the world in
Phoenix, Arizona, in the 1950s, for example, but this did
not establish that U.S. city as a subsequent center for
IT industries.8 Motorola had believed that it could be a
geographically isolated first-mover in a technologically
innovative industry. It turned out that only those firstmovers that did not isolate themselves from the open
source networks of the emerging Silicon Valley – such
as semiconductor firm Fairchild and computer company
Hewlett-Packard – were able to keep up with the rapidly
rising technology curve.
Regions with industrial concentration benefit from
more complete local labor markets. Firms can find
specialized skills more easily, reducing costs related
to employees’ skill conversion or relocation. Similarly, a
higher concentration of firms is more likely to generate
new firms. These spin-offs are more likely to be more
18

productive the higher the productivity of the original
pool of firms. The agglomeration and innovativeness of
the car industry in Detroit in the first quarter of the last
century was due to a great extent to spin-offs carry­
ing on the technological and organizational practices
of their parents.
Academic institutions – such as universities – are also
important factors in concentration. The concentration
of university graduates and science, engineering and
technology workers mirrors the spatial concentra­
tion of innovation activities. In the U.S., skilled work­
ers, particularly in the services sector, relocate to
larger cities and away from small and medium-sized
ones. Academic research is also more productive and
creative – i.e. more unconventional – in larger and more
diverse agglomerations.9
New theories of economic geography have extended
and perfected the argument of the pool of organizations.
Unlike most traditional spatial analysis, they identify
geographical concentration as a snowball process
whereby regions progressively draw in supplier firms
and human talent. In its simplest version, regional differ­
ences in productivity or economies of scale alone can
explain the divergence in geographical concentration
between two equivalent regions, or explain the reinforce­
ment of the concentration in core regions vis-à-vis the
periphery. The basic mechanism is that any confirmed
difference in productivity or innovation levels in a given
region accrues to generate or confirm the leading posi­
tion of the more innovative or productive region.10
According to these theories, agglomerative market
forces are at work when both firms and consum­
ers can take advantage of clustering in one location.
Agglomerations with large local markets are preferred
sites for the production of consumer goods due to
the economies of transportation, scale and variety.
Transport economies are in place when local firms
can serve a large local market faster and cheaper than
distant ones. Similarly, firms supplying large markets
benefit from economies of scale by splitting the sunk
investment costs over more units sold and optimiz­
ing production processes through several iterations.
Consumers in larger markets enjoy a higher variety of
goods. Not only can consumers find the exact variety
of product they are looking for in a larger market, firms
can specialize in delivering it. These three mecha­
nisms – transport, scale and scope – also affect firms
producing intermediate goods locally, which reinforces
economies downstream in the local supply chain.11

1

Do knowledge spillovers and technological
conditions attract concentration?
But market scale and the availability of a skilled work­
force do not lead straightforwardly to a region master­
ing the next wave of innovation. Advantages obtained
from previous successful innovation processes do not
assure future technological advantages.
As with large markets and complete labor markets,
so-called information and knowledge spillovers are also
positive externalities favoring co-location of innovative
firms, academic centers and talented human resourc­
es.12 Knowledge is not restricted to the technological
and organizational practices of an existing organiza­
tion or individual; it may spill from one to the other.
Firms more successfully exploit economies of scale
and scope if they learn from the experience of other
firms. Skilled workers disseminate tacit knowledge
when they interact with other skilled workers, change
organizations or migrate.
Most empirical evidence points to knowledge spillovers
being extremely geographically concentrated. This is
mainly due to the high costs associated with codifying,
exchanging and absorbing knowledge. While informa­
tion, such as data, flows increasingly freely across orga­
nizations and regions, spillovers of knowledge – what is
needed, for example, to interpret data – are “stickier.”
Firms, academic organizations and individuals have to
actively interact, collaborate and, sometimes, move to
make knowledge flow. The concentration of knowledge
spillovers can, therefore, be both a consequence and
a trigger of the agglomeration of innovation. Innovative
firms will move to where knowledge spillovers are higher,
reinforcing spillovers in that region and crowding out
non-innovative firms to the periphery.13 This joint innova­
tion and spatial co-evolution can determine a regional
development path, which can be largely irreversible.
While previous regional technological endowments
are likely to shape subsequent creation of innovation,
not all innovative regions follow the same trajectory. In
the 1930s, both Princeton, New Jersey – site of RCA
Laboratories – and Silicon Valley were home to close
technological antecedents of the IT industry; but they
developed very different innovative paths. Silicon
Valley’s remarkable IT innovation trajectory grew out of
the pre-existing and mutually supporting manufactur­
ing industries of power grid tubes, microwave tubes
and silicon components. These industries enriched
the northern Californian IT innovation ecosystem with

The changing global geography of innovation

related technological capabilities and new manage­
ment approaches easily transposable to the nascent
IT industry. Princeton and other East Coast hubs had
a much narrower technological IT ecosystem based
on few large companies.14
In this sense, more diversified agglomerations have
a greater probability of successfully transitioning to
a new technological capability than narrowly special­
ized ones.15 The literature abounds with stories of
how narrowly specialized economies are locked into
their technologies and do not transition after negative
demand shocks or technology shifts. It seems that
technological innovation is more likely to occur in
regions with a broader portfolio of technical compe­
tences, especially when it is easy to recombine these.
Dominant industries tend to monopolize talent, supplies
of economic factors of production, such as capital
or entrepreneurship, and attention. Such resource
concentration potentially crowds out other activities and
can channel the evolution of regional economies down
different pathways. For instance, Detroit – the “Motor
City” – is held up as a case of over-specialization. And
yet there are highly specialized centers of mechani­
cal engineering and automotive technology that have
mastered subsequent waves of technology, such
as Stuttgart in Germany. Boston was once narrowly
specialized in mill-based industries, but is now a hightech center. The capacity for regional economic evolu­
tion is governed by possibilities for moving into related
varieties of technologies and technological capacity.16
However, technological relatedness and complementar­
ity are not the entire story. There are many examples
of regions that capture major new sectors with little
technological relation to their previous activities. Los
Angeles was not a major mechanical engineering region
in the 1920s and 1930s when it became the aircraftengineering center of the U.S. and, by the 1940s, the
world’s biggest aerospace cluster. Los Angeles also
had no background in the entertainment industry when
the movie studios were established there around 1915.
Detroit had fewer antecedents in mechanical equipment
than Illinois in the 1890s, but rapidly became the center
of U.S. car technology and manufacture.
In these, and many other examples, there were techno­
logical windows of opportunity. These ruptures in tech­
nological relatedness largely obviate the advantages
of pre-existing agglomeration and create a relatively
flat playing field for a short time in the early days of a
technology’s existence.
19

World Intellectual Property Report 2019

To sum up, the interaction between innovation and
geography reflects the juxtaposition of individual,
organizational and technological antecedents.
Saxenian’s (1994) seminal comparison of Boston’s
Route 128 and Silicon Valley shows that the types of
entrepreneurship, production organization and system
coordination experienced by existing firms and actors
in a region will shape how that region evolves economi­
cally and what kinds of new activities it can generate
and capture.

Can policy mold the forces of
innovation agglomeration?
There is little systematic, large-scale evidence for the
success of policies trying to create new local clus­
ters. The last several decades are littered with failed
“technopolis” or “the next Silicon Valley” policy initia­
tives. Government subsidies might actually attract the
“wrong” kind of firms that have low productivity and
depend on subsidies for survival or which are not in fact
open to creating networks among local firms for fear of
leaking intellectual property (IP). Because of the path
dependency of industry growth and cluster creation,
it is questionable how much policy can achieve. As in
nature, firms form innovation ecosystems that are not
easily transplantable or reproducible, as they develop
embedded in territorially-specific institutional settings
and social fabrics.17
Nevertheless, the above does not mean that all policy
has failed in influencing cluster formation. Indeed, a
common feature of any national innovation system
is that market forces of agglomeration are not the
only factor shaping the geography of innovation. The
public sector, as well as the higher-education sector
and academic institutions are also key actors that
shape the innovativeness of countries and regions.
This is particularly true in developing economies
where public investment is the main driver of research
and development (R&D) expenditures.18 A variety of
circumstances motivates public sector support for
innovation. In some countries and regions, stagnat­
ing productivity has stimulated a revival of industrial
policy. In many of the most successful former middleincome economies, industrial policy with a strong
innovation component was in evidence during their
economic ascent.
In the U.S., a notable successful policy story is the
Research Triangle Park in North Carolina. While perhaps
20

not equivalent to Boston or Silicon Valley, the Research
Triangle Park is known as a leader in a wide variety of
high-tech fields and as a model of one of the first and
most successful research parks.19 Public policy can
also affect the geography of innovation more indirectly
through the R&D system and, in particular, the role
of universities and public research laboratories and
organizations. In the U.S., from 1875 to 1975, the federal
Land Grant Colleges system extended the geographical
spread of research universities, while federal funding for
universities reinforced the proliferation of universities.
The California system is perhaps the most successful of
all, with the public University of California system having
six of the world’s top universities. The same applies to
the geographical distribution of public sector labora­
tories, such as the national laboratories in the U.S. or
the Conseil National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)
labs in France.
Analogously, most of the former middle-income econo­
mies that are now high-income and highly innovative
regions of the world – such as the Republic of Korea,
Singapore or Israel – made a successful effort to
build top-ranked research universities.20 In China, it
seems likely that the appearance of top world innova­
tion clusters is related to the investments in top world
research universities.
There are also selective examples of successful
government intervention to generate clusters in
middle-income economies. For example, in 2008,
the municipal government of Chongqing, China,
successfully helped to transplant several smaller
coastal notebook computer manufacturing clusters
into the city. Their policies targeting investments in
infrastructure, labor market organization and other
business-friendly actions incentivized new busi­
nesses, initiatives and entrepreneurship. However,
the policy moved existing clusters rather than grow­
ing new ones organically. Other initiatives in China
have taken different approaches, depending on the
capabilities and powers of the local administration.
India’s investment in a space program located in
Bangalore incubated an IT cluster in the same area.
Then, with the policy support provided by investment
in infrastructure and human capital, the new cluster
grew organically. All of these clusters started as
manufacturing hubs and became innovative to varying
degrees as the manufacturing phase matured. But
the process also involved a significant contribution
from multinational companies, whose role in global
innovation networks will be examined below.21

1

All the public investments required to carry out such
strategies are large and must be long-term and appro­
priately institutionally organized. However, there is an
inherent tension between inter-regional equity and the
excellence that is present in virtually every large country
with a public higher education system today. As it is
not practical to have equally well-endowed research
universities in every locality, any successful innovation
policy eventually leads to some internal concentration.
In addition, in today’s agglomerated innovation envi­
ronment, certain public sector institutions – especially
universities – are strongly reinforced by market forces
that make some more attractive to students, faculty and
funders. This reduces the efficiency of public sector poli­
cies for spreading innovation around different regions
and creates the risk that public entrepreneurship will
follow the geographical patterns of the private sector
and largely benefit those regions with strong institutions
and favorable conditions. Unfortunately, innovation
or industrial policy frameworks have only rarely been
able to both raise the national level of innovation and
distribute it relatively evenly within the national territory.
Other policies – or a lack of these – can also indirectly
affect the forces behind the agglomeration of innovation.
The preferences of highly skilled workers, entrepreneurs
and innovative companies for certain agglomerations
may reflect deliberate cluster policies, but they are also
not unconnected to tax, social security and education
policies, among others. 22 For instance, successful
innovative regions with highly unregulated real-estate
markets will likely observe a housing price uptick,
which will exclude low-skilled workers and drive them
to regions with lower-cost housing, as noted above.

Why do geographical concentration
and spread coexist?
Threaded throughout the discussion above there is
considerable reference to regional concentration within
a process of global dispersion. This is the other major
defining characteristic of the contemporary geography
of innovation. While innovation activity is increasingly
concentrated in metropolitan areas, it is also gradually
spreading to hubs outside the traditional centers in the
U.S. and Western Europe.
The empirical evidence simultaneously points both
to the importance of the increasing global nature
of innovation and to the growing forces driving the

The changing global geography of innovation

agglomeration and concentration of innovation in
specific – often metropolitan – areas. Rather than
being antagonists, these trends are complementary,
reinforcing each other. If there is any single image that
can capture this emerging geography it is that of a
globalized hub-to-hub system. The world system of
innovation links national systems of innovation and
global firms through a spiky geography of knowledge
creation. The result is a global network of these spikes
or hubs, many of which are better connected to one
another than they are to their national hinterlands in
terms of knowledge creation and diffusion.
International openness is a distinctive trait of leading
agglomerations of geographically concentrated innova­
tion today. But long-distance exchanges of knowledge
are not a new feature of the economic system. In the first
and second industrial revolutions, knowledge and hard­
ware travelled, international imitation and rivalry were
active parts of the landscape, and there were always
networks of people who helped along such knowledge
exchange. In the past, however, such exchanges often
involved the display and then possible imitation of what
was created in a rival agglomeration.
Contemporary knowledge clusters have long-distance
ties which have become more organized and extensive
over time, and which often involve the co-development
of technologies across agglomerations, both within
firms and between competing firms.
Thus, knowledge-generating agglomerations today are
not self-contained local systems, but rather consist of
key nodes in dispersed and global networks of inno­
vation.23 Indeed, highly productive localized innovation
systems are also those that are most tied into longdistance relationships of various sorts. New knowledge
may be brought into a region through the establishment
of these linkages. Innovators rely on collaborations both
inside and outside the organizations and the regions
where they work.
These networks of geographical spread of innovation
will be discussed in the following section.

1.2
Networks and the global
spread of innovation
In recent decades, global networks for the production
and delivery of goods and services have expanded
greatly. In comparison to previous globalization waves,
21

World Intellectual Property Report 2019

The current globalization, in other words, involves
intricate forms of interdependency, not just between
economies as a whole, but inside the most delicate
plumbing of the economic system, within and between
firms and industries. This is also true of the underlying
innovation networks and ecosystems, which are both
a consequence of global productive integration and,
increasingly, a cause of it.
Mirroring the growing globalization and complexity of
production systems is an increasingly dispersed and
complex plumbing system for knowledge produc­
tion. The globalization of innovation is a result of
an increased international integration of economic
activities and the rising importance of knowledge in
economic processes.25
From the mid-20th century until the Great Recession,
beginning around 2008, technological activity was
also steadily internationalizing, with new countries
emerging in the international system of innovation.
More recently, there is some evidence of the selective
reshoring of some key R&D and innovation activities
back to home countries. At the same time, however,
the post-recession period has seen a growing articula­
tion of value chains beyond national borders, involving
an increasing share of intra-firm trade flows, with the
knowledge flows they entail.26

What economic forces explain
the spread of innovation?
The economic forces driving the spread of innovation
are very similar to those stimulating its concentration in
specific clusters. Economic agents in a given innova­
tion hotspot spread innovation to other regions of the
world and vice-versa, which is why the spread of global
innovation can be thought of as a bidirectional network
of knowledge and technological flows.
22

It is worth recapitulating that the geographical spread
of innovation to peripheral areas of a region or coun­
try is often limited, because the forces pushing for
concentration are too strong. Nevertheless, the same
strong concentration forces operating in one urban
cluster are at work in others. This can lead to reciprocal
relationships that generate a further spread of innova­
tion and knowledge. Regions spreading and receiving
innovation are likely to remain connected, but these
knowledge and technological flows often skip the
peripheral regions of the world and link directly to the
main economic agglomerations.
Figure 1.2 sums up the three main bidirectional econom­
ic forces forging the links of an international or interregional network – market, skilled labor and knowledge.

the current globalization has a much higher proportion
of intra-industry exchange of both components and final
goods within global value chains. Prior to 2000, most
of such intra-industry trade took place among a few
countries, most notably in the northern hemisphere. But
since then, it has more and more concerned the rela­
tionships between developing economies and the rest
of the world. Global production networks often involve
multiple or circular trade flows, with exports wrapped into
subsequent outputs and ending up as imports, blurring
the line between foreign and domestic production.24

The international and inter-regional mobility of skilled
innovators is a key feature of the contemporary inno­
vation environment, creating an interpersonal link
between hubs. This mobility may positively stimulate the
international dispersion of innovation by strengthening
these innovation networks.27
The global diffusion of knowledge does not take place
through random mobility of people, of course, but by
their moving between places in which they are likely
to find the right conditions and the right people to

1

unleash their innovativeness. As noted, these networks
serve not just as a means of dispersion and mobility,
but as key points of attraction for the skilled. This
talented workforce can reap learning and experience
premiums by being in geographical hotspots with
key network nodes and whose networks are deep.
The ability to acquire more experience and improve
skills is considered one of the main reasons why the
skilled continue to move into the most expensive
cities, in spite of high costs of living, contributing to
the rapid growth in geographical differences in the
wages of the skilled. Evidence that both international
and inter-regional “brain drain” is at a very high level
today complements this picture.
Labor mobility can take various directions. After
concentrating in a region, skilled migrants often gener­
ate a diaspora network linking the origin and destination
regions. Moreover, many highly trained migrants return
to their original region to apply their higher skills there
as entrepreneurs.
Saxenian (1999) explores the interaction of people and
investment networks through the mobility of skilled
Asian entrepreneurs from and to Silicon Valley. She
explains how skilled workers come to Silicon Valley and
acquire human capital and experience; they become
integrated into local networks while continuing to
maintain links back home. For example, Chinese and
Indian U.S.-trained engineers coordinate activities
between Silicon Valley technology producers and the
manufacturing and design expertise in their home
country regions. As skilled Asian entrepreneurs move
around, they engage in knowledge-sharing, leading
to what is termed “brain circulation.” By drawing on
their networks, they also seem to be able to facilitate
investments in new business ventures, highlighting
the parallel movement of networks and foreign direct
investment (FDI) channels.
Equally, multinational companies (MNCs) relocating
R&D sites offshore in order to benefit from an extraor­
dinary – or cheaper – research labor supply also gener­
ate bidirectional knowledge flows, at least with the
headquarters’ region. Access to talent and R&D cost
are among the main known MNC motivations to interna­
tionalize R&D. Global patenting is increasingly the result
of the collaboration of large teams operating within the
organizational boundaries of MNCs. For instance, a
significant share of Chinese and Indian patents at the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) are the
result of collaborations of this type.28

The changing global geography of innovation

Market forces and role of MNCs in
internationalization of networks
The forces at work in market agglomeration and spread
create links within a firm, among different firms or
across different organization types. For example,
market size can make a firm relocate production to
reduce transport costs and benefit from economies of
scale. Technology transfers will necessarily be involved
in putting in place the new production site, while inverse
knowledge flows will also happen when adapting the
product to local taste or regulations.
A key agent in all of these long-distance technological
interactions is the multinational. In addition to access
to lower costs and foreign talent, MNCs opt to inter­
nationalize their R&D activities to benefit from other
market externalities, such as shorter times to bring
products to market and to tap into localized areas of
technological excellence. Reversed flows of FDI can
also benefit established innovation centers. MNCs
from middle-income economies are increasingly using
outward FDI to expand market reach and to capture
strategic assets, such as technologies, skills, commer­
cial knowledge and brands. Clearly, local technological
competence is only important for attracting FDI of this
kind if the prospective subsidiary is going to engage in
technology-intensive activities.
Intra- and inter-firm offshoring of R&D increase
corporate innovation performance.29 Key knowledgegenerating territories around the world are usually both
home to key firms that construct and participate in
these international networks and hosts to foreign firms
wishing to get access to their knowledge-generating
ecosystems, talent pool and researchers.
The existence of a pool of specialized suppliers is also a
motivation to connect to another region. A given region
may specialize in a certain technology that can benefit
complementary industries, even if located in other
regions. Bidirectional knowledge flows will be estab­
lished between the buyer and specialized supplier in the
form of technical specifications and goods with embed­
ded technology. In industries with a complex supply
chain, these links can involve several hubs, building
complex and often international production networks.
Arguably, the forces driving agglomeration success­
fully attract MNCs and other firms – especially high
value-added ones – to particular locations in both
developed and developing economies. The resultant
23

World Intellectual Property Report 2019

clustering makes these destinations progressively less
dependent on purely cost-based and relative techno­
logical endowment considerations. Intangible location
advantages, such as knowledge spillovers, are highly
concentrated within specific regions, cities and local
systems. The advantages arising from newly vibrant
local innovation ecosystems may benefit the MNCs at
this location, their headquarters and their entire value
chain. The resulting knowledge flows are, therefore,
eminently bi- or multidirectional between so-called
home and host locations.30

Knowledge spread: organization
and person-based interactions
Geographical proximity is not the only source of
knowledge spillovers today.31 Knowledge externalities
become forces promoting the spread of innovation
through organization-level interactions and inter-person
or professional-level networks. These organizational
and professional connections may be made stronger
by geographical proximity, but the latter is not neces­
sary for them to exist.
Long-distance organization-level interactions – for
example, interactions within global value chains or
across international scientific networks – lower trans­
action costs within firms and research organizations.
These organized structures can facilitate deep knowl­
edge interactions without the requisite of co-location.
The effect is enhanced if actors operate within stan­
dardized rules or routines set by their organization or
pool of organizations. In 1981, Microsoft opened a
campus in Silicon Valley just to connect their Seattle
operations in Bellevue (and later Redmond) with the
effervescence of the Bay Area.
Likewise, more people-based and less institutional­
ized relations – for example, professional and scien­
tific communities – can also effectively exchange
knowledge with a commonly agreed set of rules and
routines. This establishes a social proximity – ranging
from inter-personal to being part of the same culture
or group – among innovators, which lowers interac­
tion costs, eases verification and increases trust to
exchange and produce new knowledge.
These economic forces overlap and intertwine to the
extreme point of being inseparable. Similar to the
forces driving knowledge agglomeration, knowledgespreading forces are an intrinsic part of the underlying
24

reasoning behind the previously discussed skilled
labor- and market-spreading forces.
As seen, the internationalization of corporate R&D
plays a key role in all of these long-distance techno­
logical interactions, making MNCs one of the most
important types of organization and network node in
the international spillover of new knowledge. MNCs’
international affiliates are gaining more autonomy and
becoming – where the right incentives are in place
– more embedded in regional and local innovation
systems. Increasing autonomy for international affiliates
also means that the choice of the specific subnational
location becomes more important and driven by a wider
range of factors other than costs.32 Characteristics of
the regional innovation ecosystem – including its institu­
tions – are particularly important for attracting foreign
investment in innovation and technological operations
and become relevant factors in attracting investments
at more advanced and knowledge-intensive stages of
global value chains.

The rise of global innovation networks
Knowledge and innovation production have been inter­
national phenomena for a long time, but only recently
have they become really global.33 Nowadays, actors
located in different countries can carry out innovation
activities in a truly integrated form. Innovation has
become increasingly the outcome of global networks
connecting dispersed knowledge centers.34
It is against this general backdrop of globalization of
knowledge and innovation – where their production is
done with a higher degree of functional integration – that
the concept of global innovation networks has emerged.
A global innovation network is a globally organized
web of collaboration between organizations – firms
and others – engaged in knowledge production that
results in innovation. The networks are characterized
by (1) their really global spread – and not confined to
networks based in high-income countries; (2) their
networked nature; and (3) the outcome, i.e., innovation.35
Their formation is the result of a knowledge-seeking
strategy by the organizations involved, which makes
global innovation networks different from global
production networks that follow more efficiency- and
market-seeking strategies. The focus of global innova­
tion networks is, therefore, knowledge exchange and
integration, and subsequent innovation, but not in

1

production or simple manufacturing.36 Global innovation
networks happen largely through the internationaliza­
tion of corporate R&D.
From this perspective, the MNCs can exert a strong
influence on the geographical concentration and global
spread – the shape – of global innovation networks by
deciding where to locate investment, production and
knowledge sourcing.37 Geographical conditions and
the existing sectoral innovation system are particularly
important as drivers for the most sophisticated and high
value-added stages of supply chains, such as R&D,
design or advanced business services.38 The offshor­
ing of R&D activities has created new interconnected
architectures of innovation and research as well as
new co-location patterns with production activities.
This has offered new opportunities for regions and
cities to link up to different parts or functions of global
supply chains in ways that promote economic upgrad­
ing and innovation.
At the same time, global participation is a challenge
for weaker regions, given the risk of being locked into
low value-added and low-innovation activities. The
geographic unevenness in participation and embed­
dedness in global production networks and value
chains generates new core–periphery patterns in the
global geography of innovation.
Most of the related literature in the field of international
business indicates that organization-based linkages
– both intra and inter firms – are behind the forma­
tion of global innovation networks.39 International coinventions – the archetypical indicator for global inno­
vation networks – have expanded greatly to India and
China since the 2000s, but a large proportion remains
under the control of firms in the U.S., Japan and a
few Western European countries. This suggests that
companies can and do slice the R&D process in multiple
stages/segments – as they do for goods – allowing
new countries to participate in the different segments
according to their comparative advantage.40 This facili­
tates the transformation of existing global value chains
or production networks into global innovation networks.
Furthermore, an increasing number of studies suggest
personal relationships, aside from organization-based
ones, are also critical drivers of the formation of global
innovation networks.41 These relationships range from
direct person-to-person innovation-related interna­
tional collaborations, to the international mobility of
scientists, innovators and entrepreneurs.42 However,

The changing global geography of innovation

organization-based interaction is often the framework
where this people-based collaboration can take place.
Traditionally, multinationals’ internal networks have
been a suitable means to partially overcome barriers
related to both geographical distance and differ­
ing national cultures. But the more recent decline in
the costs of travel and communication has certainly
favored the rise of person-based international link­
ages without necessarily an accompanying organi­
zational structure.43

1.3

Conclusions

Innovation has always had geographical concentra­
tions or hotspots: Manchester was to the first industrial
revolution what San Francisco is to the third. However,
for a long period between these two revolutions, it
appeared that within the advanced economies the
spread of the capacity for innovation was incremental.
The strong concentration of innovation since the end of
the 20th century thus requires additional consideration.
Firms used to cluster along supply chains. In the first
and second industrial revolutions, innovation activity
clustered together with leading production activities,
making for large industrial cities, some of which also
concentrated R&D and product development. Over
the last century, these patterns of agglomeration have
slowly changed. Location choices have become more
determined by shared skill requirements – especially
in the services sector – such as labor market pooling
across different but related innovation sectors.44 In
the third industrial revolution, many industries are not
heavily capital-intensive in their production activities,
and global supply and value chains are far longer and
more complex. As a result, leading urban agglom­
erations of innovation today specialize in the abstract,
cognitive and conceptual tasks of R&D and innovation.
These highly specialized sectors and complementary
broad service sectors have displaced the tradition­
ally co-located routine production tasks observed in
the past.45
The consequences of this new concentration of innova­
tive activity are far reaching. Ultimately, the geographi­
cal distribution of innovation shapes the economic
development path of cities and broader regions. One
prominent feature of the geography of economic devel­
opment in recent times is the inter-regional divergence
of incomes within countries (see Chapter 5). Generally
speaking, large metropolitan areas – the hotbeds of
25

World Intellectual Property Report 2019

agglomerated ecosystems of innovation – are increas­
ingly outpacing other regions in terms of income growth.
Yet, there is also divergence within these large metro­
politan areas. Jobs in innovation-related activities tend
to pay higher wages than others. Rapid growth in a
concentrated geographical area and within a particular
sector may have further effects on the local economy.
While high-skilled jobs create a larger number of lowskilled jobs, inflows of high-earners, combined with
limited housing supply, often result in growing inequality
and falling disposable income for low-earning house­
holds.46 Ultimately, this may lead to increased sorting
by skill groups into innovative, high-earning areas and
non-innovative, low-earning areas, excluding the lowskilled from the opportunities and amenities of living
and working in an innovative environment.47
These patterns seem to prevail in the largest global
innovation hotspots around the world. They are the
primary homes and hosts of major knowledge-based

26

multinational corporations and the true beneficia­
ries of globalization, being centers of corporate
decision-making and control, knowledge generation
and exchange, skills and jobs. But their prosperity is
accompanied by high levels of income inequality and
spatial segregation, leading some to speak of a new
“urban crisis.” 48
There is still limited evidence on which to draw firm
conclusions as to the causes and consequences of the
concentration and spread of innovative activity. This
may partially reflect the complex nature of innovation
processes and their uncertain impact. However, the
long-term consequences deserve careful consider­
ation, even with partial knowledge.

Chapter 2

Global networks of
innovation hotspots

For much of the 20th century, multinational
companies (MNCs) from high-income countries
restricted their foreign-based research and
development (R&D) operations to other rich
economies, notably the U.S., Western European
countries and, later, Japan. This was in marked
contrast to the trend in manufacturing activities,
which saw increasing outsourcing from richer to
middle-income and developing economies.1

Starting in the 1980s and 1990s, the situation changed.
The creation of new scientific and technological knowl­
edge increasingly required interaction between insti­
tutions and organizations, whether public or private,
national or multinational, irrespective of their location.
Gradually, China, India, Eastern Europe and other
middle-income economies gained in importance both
as targets for R&D-oriented foreign direct invest­
ment (FDI) by multinational firms and as sources of
new knowledge.
The rising need for complex and specialized knowledge
and technological interaction at both national and
international level has resulted – paradoxically – in both
geographical concentration and dispersion of innova­
tion creation, as highlighted in Chapter 1. On the one
hand, organizations have sought to locate innovation
activities and interactions wherever high quality and
lower costs are available. On the other, market forces,
economies of scale and the need for more face-toface communication and multidisciplinary interaction,
because of the complexity of the interactions, have
pulled in the direction of geographical proximity.
Global innovation networks have been a key centrifugal
force in the geographical distribution of knowledgecreation activities. Knowledge-seeking FDI does not
target whole countries, but specific locations within
them. Most international collaborations, investments or
movements of skilled workers occur between specific
knowledge-production centers. But global innova­
tion networks do not merely span frontiers, they link
specific locations within countries and reinforce the
national prominence of these locations; within national
borders, inter-regional innovation subnetworks coexist
with global ones.
In view of these considerations, it is crucial to under­
stand empirically the geographical concentration and
spread of the world’s scientific and technical knowl­
edge production and interactions. This requires finegrained mapping of innovation activities within national
borders and how these contribute to the worldwide
dispersion of knowledge exchanges. In particular, it is
important to examine whether the growth of national
31

World Intellectual Property Report 2019

knowledge-production centers or hubs results in an
overall increase in international collaboration and
investment or whether they simply suck-in innovative
activities to the detriment of other areas in the country
or beyond in a zero-sum game. This may be especially
relevant for developing economies, whose national
innovation systems may become less dependent on
the R&D operations of foreign MNCs, thanks both to
the strengthening of local firms and the implementation
of specific public policies to promote local innovation,
either substituting or leveraging their national and
international collaborations.
Moreover, the globalization of knowledge produces
imbalances in the distribution of innovative activities
within countries. As knowledge-production centers
worldwide gain in importance and intensify their
exchanges, cities and regions that do not participate in
such exchanges risk being marginalized (see Chapter 5).
This chapter documents the evolution of global knowl­
edge-creating interactions and how the centrifugal
and centripetal forces described in Chapter 1 generate
global networks of extremely concentrated innovation
hotspots and specialized niche clusters. It uses a
novel database of geocoded scientific publication –
scientific articles and conference proceedings – and
patent data to track developments (see Box 2.1) and
emphasize a series of long-term trends, starting from
the mid-1970s.
The chapter is organized in four sections. The first
section examines how internationalized the produc­
tion of scientific and technological knowledge has
become, with a focus on the rise in the participation
of middle-income countries, notably China. It also
provides complementary evidence on how knowledge
production is becoming increasingly concentrated
geographically by identifying the main innovation
agglomerations – hotspots and clusters – within each
country. The second section analyzes the scientific
and technological interactions between countries,
providing further evidence for the globalization of inno­
vation. It highlights the role of international knowledge
outsourcing by companies as a driving force behind
the development of global innovation networks. The
third section explores to what extent the two types of
agglomerations concur to form an innovation network
that is properly global. The final section spells out the
chapter’s main findings.

Box 2.1 Patent and scientific publication
geocoded data
Patent data
The patent data used in this report cover all patent
documents – granted or not – filed from 1970 to 2017
in all patent offices worldwide and available in the
European Patent Office’s (EPO) PATSTAT database
and WIPO’s Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) collec­
tions. The unit of analysis is the first filing for a set
of patent documents filed in one or more countries
and claiming the same invention. Each set containing
one first and, potentially, several subsequent filings
is defined as a patent family. In the analysis, patent
families are split into those oriented internationally
and those oriented only domestically. Internationallyoriented patent families refer to applicants seeking
patent protection in at least one jurisdiction other
than their country of residence. These include patent
families containing only patent documents filed at
the EPO or through the PCT. Conversely, domestic
patent families refer only to filings in a home country,
for instance, a Japan-based applicant filing only at
the Japan Patent Office.
As far as possible, the geocoding – attributing
the geographical coordinates to a given location –
relates to the inventor’s address based on the best
available data source within a patent family.2 Many
addresses are geocoded at a very precise level – i.e.,
street or block – but others only at the postal code
or other sub-city level. To remain internationally
comparable, but also due to the limited coverage
of inventors’ addresses in some national collections,
the clustering analysis relies only on internationallyoriented patents.
Scientific publication data
The scientific publication data used in this report
comes from records from 1998 to 2017 in the
Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) of the Web
of Science, the citation database operated by the
Clarivate Analytics company. The analysis focuses
on observations referring to scientific articles and
conference proceedings, which are the bulk of
these data.

2

The report assumes that research conducted for any
publication has taken place at the institutions and
organizations to which the authors declare their affili­
ation. Virtually all of these locations were geocoded
at the postal code or sub-city level. In the case of
authors with more than one affiliation in the same
publication, all different addresses are considered.

The two sides of global
knowledge production
The accelerating international
spread of knowledge creation

For most of the period from 1970 to 2000 only three coun­
tries – namely, the U.S., Japan and Germany – account­
ed for two-thirds of all patenting activity worldwide
(Figure 2.1). Adding the remaining Western European
economies – particularly, the U.K., France, Switzerland
and Italy – takes the figure to around 90 percent.
Still, the rest of the world’s share in the production
of new technologies, as reflected in the number of
patents, slowly rose over the three decades, mostly at
the expense of several Western European economies.
The rest of the world passed from less than 6 percent
at the beginning of the 1970s to more than 13 percent
in the early 2000s. And only a fraction of this spread
was due to the Republic of Korea and China.
In the last two decades, the trend has accelerated
remarkably for both technological (patents) and scien­
tific outcomes. The rest of the world accounts for
almost one-third of all patenting activity in the decade
starting in 2010. Published scientific data has spread

Where does knowledge production take place? Is
the geographical spread of such output different to
that of other economic activities? Empirical evidence
indicates that activities related to knowledge produc­
tion – such as R&D expenditure, patent generation or
scientific publication – are typically more geographically
concentrated within countries than is the case for other
key economic activities, the overall population, trade
or FDI. Despite this higher concentration, the global
tendency is for the degree of international geographic
dispersal of innovation over time.3

innovation production shares, but in different locations.
This reconcentration coincides with a similar trend
observed for R&D expenditure shares after 2008 at
the onset of the Great Recession, with both China and
the Republic of Korea increasing their share of global
R&D expenditure. All in all, innovation production has
increased in volume and spread more globally, but
there is still a limited set of countries that produces
the bulk of it.

Increasing concentration: a local affair
The geographical distribution of inventive and scientific
activities within each country is uneven. In the context
of the increase of innovation production and its inter­
national spread, an interesting phenomenon occurs –
there is no clear evidence that knowledge production
has spread within countries.
A few administrative areas in each economy often
accumulate the lion’s share of scientific and techno­
logical production (Table 2.2). In the U.S., three out of

50 states concentrate almost 40 percent of inventive
production (patents) and almost 30 percent of scien­
tific production (publication). And the U.S. is the least
geographically concentrated among the largest econo­
mies. In Japan, three out of 47 prefectures concentrate
56 percent of patents and 35 percent of scientific
publication. In China, three out of 33 provinces gather
60 percent of patents and almost 40 percent of scien­
tific publication. In Europe, concentration is higher, but
the number of regions is smaller. In Germany, three
out of 16 states concentrate two-thirds of the patents
and half the scientific publication. Similarly, three out
of 18 French regions accumulate about 60 percent of
knowledge production.
Regional concentration of patents within these econo­
mies has increased over the last decade. In all cases
but France, the top three regions (Table 2.2) accu­
mulate more patents in the latter 2011–2015 period,
evidencing within-country concentration, not disper­
sion. Interestingly, the top three regions are not neces­
sarily the same in the two periods, but the changes
are small. For scientific publication, however, the

top three regions show little change during the two
periods shown in the figure. China’s top three prov­
inces are the only ones to evidence some noticeable
geographical spread of scientific production. The fact
that the location and budget of academic institutions
are the result of complex and long decision-making
processes can partially explain these stable scientific
publication trends.
These trends apply not only to the main innovative econ­
omies described in the previous section. In most coun­
tries, a few areas have become truly innovation hotspots,
way ahead of the rest of the country. This is the case in
India, Australia and several countries in Southeast Asia,
the Middle East, Latin America and Africa.
However, there are substantial difficulties – common
to all questions of economic geography – in making
comparisons across countries based on existing
subnational administrative areas. Administrative areas
can differ markedly in size, population and density of
innovative activity, all of which complicate comparison.
In addition, the administrative borders may not coincide
with the limits of the innovation agglomeration or hub.5
A given administrative area may even encompass
two or more agglomerations, or the agglomeration or
agglomerations may span several administrative areas,
even crossing country borders.
A vast literature in spatial analysis documents this
well-known issue, which goes under the name of the
modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) and its resulting
statistical distortions.6 The solution requires creating
ad hoc comparable areas that can be used in place
of administrative ones. Box 2.2 provides a detailed
explanation of the solution.

Global networks of innovation hotspots

density-based algorithms from the economic geog­
raphy literature.7 In a nutshell, the report uses the
DBSCAN – Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise – clustering algorithm to identify
“clusters” separately from the geocoded patent and
scientific publication data. The borders of each
scientific publication and patent agglomeration are
determined using a concave polygon approach. The
overlapping polygons are merged keeping only the
outer borders of all concerned agglomerations. The
resulting outer areas are referred to as global innovation hotspots (GIHs) or, more plainly, hotspots.
To allow for scientific and technological specializa­
tion, the above method is repeated for 25 subsam­
ples of the same publication and patent data, which
refer to 12 scientific fields and 13 technological
ones, respectively.8 Only the resulting polygons of
these 25 iterations not contained within a hotspot
are kept. From these, the overlapping polygons are
merged in the same way as for hotspots. The final
outer areas are referred to as specialized niche
clusters (SNCs) or, more plainly, niche clusters.
By definition, the resulting areas: (1) are internationally comparable, i.e., the same scientific publica­
tion or patent (specialized) density would have
determined the same hotspot (cluster) anywhere
in the world; (2) can have different scientific and
technological density, i.e., hotspots and niche
clusters need only scientific publication or patent
high concentration, but not necessarily both; (3)
have different specialization density, i.e., niche
clusters are defined with lower density thresholds
than hotspots; (4) are distinct geographical areas,
i.e., the polygons are non-overlapping within and
across hotspots and niche clusters; and (5) have
non-predefined boundaries, i.e., hotspots and
niche clusters can have different sizes and include
more than one city, state/province or country.

clusters outperform metropoles with much higher urban
and overall innovation densities.
Figures 2.4 and 2.5 expand this comparison globally,
based on the world distribution of nightlight as a proxy
for urban-dense areas.9 As shown in Figure 2.4, the
nightlight is not well distributed across the world or within
borders. Innovation follows a similar pattern of agglom­
eration, but it is even more geographically skewed. These
agglomerations or hotspots – which are by definition
denser in scientific knowledge or patent generation –
typically coincide with the brightest – in terms of night­
light – areas in the world. Niche clusters also coincide
with bright locations, although their specialist nature
means the urban areas can be less dense.
Europe – particularly the west – has the most homoge­
nous territorial distribution of nightlight and, not surpris­
ingly, concentrates more than one-third of all global
innovation hotspots and specialized niche clusters in
the world. Despite this, there are still several illuminated
areas without a corresponding innovation agglomera­
tion. In Europe, Germany, the U.K. and France lead in
quantity of innovation agglomerations, but even they
have several dense urban areas without any corre­
sponding scientific publication or patent density.
North America hosts more than a quarter of hotspots
and niche clusters, mostly in dense urban areas along
the east and west coasts. Most of the main cities in the
center and south of the country also host innovation
agglomerations; but many dense urban areas – particu­
larly in the Midwest and southern U.S. states – do not
have sufficient innovation to host a global innovation
hotspot or niche cluster.
Asia hosts slightly more than a quarter of the total
hotspots and niche clusters. Japan, China, the Republic
of Korea and India account for the bulk of Asia’s inno­
vation agglomerations. In Japan, and to some degree
the Republic of Korea, there is a high correspondence
between nightlight and innovation agglomeration.
Despite their numerous innovation agglomerations,
China and India still have many dense urban areas with
no corresponding innovation density.
The large continental territories of Oceania, Latin
America and Africa host vast areas without dense
urban locations. Within the former, Australia has a high
co-location of urban and innovation-dense areas, with
virtually no bright locations without a corresponding
global innovation hotspot or niche cluster. On the

contrary, Africa and Latin America have mostly dense
urban areas with no corresponding innovation density.
As shown in Table 2.3, the inventive and scientific activi­
ties across locations are highly skewed at all levels of
innovation density. The 174 hotspots represent the
most innovative-dense areas in the world; nonetheless,
a limited number – mostly in high-income and middleincome countries – consistently produce most of the
scientific and technological knowledge created within
global innovation hotspots.
Only 30 hotspots in 16 different countries are respon­
sible for the creation of almost 70 percent of the
patents and around 50 percent of the scientific arti­
cles produced.
Very little inventive and scientific activity is produced
outside the hotspots and niche clusters, and even less
is produced outside the few countries hosting these.
Indeed, there are more than 160 countries not hosting
any hotspot or niche cluster. Even in these less inno­
vation-dense areas, most of the knowledge produced

is generated in just a few dense urban areas. Just 30
agglomerations located in only 24 different countries
produce roughly 64 percent of patents and 61 percent
of scientific articles within these non-innovation-dense
countries (Table 2.3). Despite this concentration in a few
agglomerations, the gap with the world’s top hotspots is
huge. The volume of patents and scientific publication
of the top 30 agglomerations in less innovation-dense
countries is only 0.4 percent and 4 percent, respectively,
of that of the world’s leading 30 hotspots.
But even within innovation-dense areas strong national
differences emerge. Table 2.4 looks at the top three
hotspots and niche clusters for selected countries in
two different periods and the share of patenting and
scientific publication they accumulate in their respective
countries. First, the list of top three innovation-dense
areas barely differs in time and between patents and
scientific publication, showing the stability of the
concentration phenomenon. Second, in all countries
shown, the share the top three accumulates is quite
high, ranging from around 20 percent up to more than
80 percent. Next, in the majority of countries the share
of the top three patenting hotspots either remains quite
stable or increases, showing that, within countries,
inventive activities do not spread much geographically
and in some cases even reconcentrate. Germany and,
to a lesser extent, France are exceptions where the top

three patenting hotspots concentrate less inventive
activity than two decades earlier.
Overall, concentration of scientific publication has
also remained relatively stable at high rates. Within
these selected economies, only China and, to a lesser
extent, India show some tendency to dispersion, but
their top three hotspots still hold at least a quarter and
a third of all national scientific publication, respectively.
Comparing publication and patents, it is interesting to
observe (Table 2.4) how in certain countries, scientific
publication is more concentrated than patents (which
is not the general rule). This is the case of the U.K. and,
to a lesser extent, France. Both countries host capital
cities that are worldwide centers of scientific production
and which lead the way in their respective countries.

2.2
Global networks of
collaboration and sourcing
Just how globalized is collaboration?
The production of scientific and technological knowl­
edge is increasingly collaborative. Already in 1998,
teams produced the majority of scientific papers. By
2017, lone wolf scientists had become half as important

countries show a large international co-inventorship

show mostly a rising trend. Smaller economies with
internationally linked and dense urban and innovation
areas – such as Switzerland – are very prone to engag­
ing in international collaborations. India also shows a
high rate of international co-inventorship. In East Asia’s
top economies things are different. Before the 2000s,
the share of international co-inventorship in China
was extraordinarily large, but the volume was small.
Thereafter, when the volume of Chinese patenting
picked up, the share of international co-inventorship
dropped dramatically, becoming comparable to the
very low shares of Japan and the Republic of Korea.

Trends for international co-publication reveal a very
different picture. All main scientific publishing countries
have larger shares of international co-publication than
co-inventorship, with the exception of India. Moreover,
these shares increased steadily over the period.
However, the figures show East Asian countries being
less internationally open than the U.S. and Western
Europe when it comes to scientific publishing too.

2.3
Local innovation and global
networks of innovative hubs

The globalization of agglomerations
Not only do hotspots and niche clusters concentrate
more scientific publication and patent output, they also
collaborate more internationally (Figure 2.11). The differ­
ence is even greater for highly cited patents and scientific
articles. During the last two decades, international scien­
tific collaboration went from 19 percent to 29 percent of
all scientific articles produced inside innovation-dense
areas and the most-cited within this international collabo­
ration went from 28 percent to 43 percent.

Since around 2005, however, there has been a fresh
rise in the share of local-only patents. This change
coincides with a slowdown in the pace of globaliza­
tion and internationalization generally, as reflected
in slower growth of trade, FDI flows and financial
integration. It also coincides with a decrease in the
share of patents generated by teams that are national
but not just local. The explanation for the latter could
be that part of the slowdown in the globalization of
knowledge creation and innovation has to do with
the rise of local hotspots rather than with the devel­
opment of new national innovation systems. As will
be shown, this pattern is stronger in some specific
Asian countries.

World Intellectual Property Report 2019

Global network of hotspots
and niche clusters
Innovation-dense agglomerations worldwide form a
network – within and outside their own countries – that
concentrates most inventive and scientific activities, to
the possible detriment of non-agglomerated actors.16
In particular, these innovative agglomerations form a
thick web of national and international ties between
hotspots and niche clusters in the U.S., Europe and
Asia. Only 10 hotspots account for 26 percent of all
international co-inventions between hotspots of the
world (Figure 2.15). These are San Jose–San Francisco,
New York, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Boston, Shanghai, London,
Beijing, Bengaluru and Paris.

international gatekeepers. With obvious proximity
advantages, Canada has a national network well inte­
grated to the U.S. one. The role of Canadian hotspots
in the overall North American network contrasts with
the absence of equivalent Mexican co-invention ties.
Notwithstanding the dominance of Bengaluru, India has
a fairly active national innovation network, with sever­
al hubs directly connecting internationally. Similarly,
despite its remote location and vast territory, Australia
manages to have several hotspots that connect inter­
nationally and a fairly interconnected national network.
One region less connected than the rest is Latin
America, where the large majority of connections of
its few hotspots and niche clusters are with leading
economies outside the region. There are no national
or regional networks in Latin America comparable to
those depicted for other regions and countries.

Figure 2.15 also depicts the top 10 percent co-invention
links between all the world’s global innovation hotspots
and specialized niche clusters. Even in the U.S., niche
clusters and smaller hotspots often have only national The above discussion demonstrates that it is not only

in the center and scattering the less connected ones.
In Europe, a similar pattern can be detected. A few
large hotspots in each country act as gatekeepers
that connect the national innovation system to global
innovation networks. Clear examples can be found in
France, with Paris connecting other French cities with
the rest of the world, and in the U.K., with London
being a central actor. Germany shows some hier­
archical structure too, though access points to the
global innovation networks are more numerous and
the national innovation network is very dense. Japan
and the Republic of Korea also stand out, with very
dense national innovation networks, although their
international connections are less widespread and
mostly directed to the U.S. and the main Western
European hotspots.
Hotspots and niche clusters in the remaining regions
of the world have substantially fewer connections
than those in the U.S., Western Europe, Japan and
the Republic of Korea, although among those that do,
China, India, Canada and Australia stand out. China
has a dense national innovation network where a
hierarchical structure is also evident, with Shanghai,
Beijing and Shenzhen–Hong Kong acting as the top
56

As noted, U.S. agglomerations are among the more
connected nodes, hence more central in the networks
in both of the periods (Figure 2.16). In the center of the
picture are other global innovation hotspots which are
arguably highly connected, such as Tokyo, London,
Shanghai, Beijing, Seoul or Paris. But they are much
less central than the U.S. hotspots. The network also
evolved over time, getting more nodes and more
connections and denser at its center.
Size plays only a limited role. Smaller clusters are
connected to big and highly connected ones in the
same country, reflecting the hierarchical pattern
discussed earlier. This is clearly the case for agglom­
erations in the U.K., Japan and the Republic of Korea.
On the other hand, several hotspots that are larger
or similar in size to the top U.S. agglomerations – for
example, Tokyo – fail to occupy the same kind of central
position in the global network. This reflects the lower
international connectivity of Japanese hotspots.
Figure 2.17 depicts subnetworks of the same 2011–2015
co-invention network presented in Figure 2.16. It shows
the subnetwork of all niche clusters by graying the

2

network connections of all hotspots. As is apparent,
these specialized innovation-dense areas cannot
compete with the hotspots in volume of connections.
The few connections among niche clusters are virtually
always within the same country.
The figure also depicts the specific subnetworks of two
hotspots – Los Angeles and Daejeon in the Republic
of Korea – which are of equivalent size in terms of the
number of patents they generate. The Los Angeles
hotspot is highly connected – both nationally and inter­
nationally – making it a relatively centered node in the
global network. Daejeon is not as central, because it is
mostly connected only to other Korean agglomerations.
Daejeon’s international connections are largely limited
to Shanghai, San Francisco and New York.
Geography alone, therefore, does not determine the
importance, or the “centrality,” of a top innovation
agglomeration within a network. Many other factors
also have to be considered.

2.4

Conclusions

This chapter exploited a rich data set of patent appli­
cations and scientific publications in order to answer
several questions arising from two current phenomena
connected to the way knowledge is produced and
shared worldwide – its geographical spread interna­
tionally and – at the same time – its concentration in a
few geographical hotspots.

Global networks of innovation hotspots

Part of this limited geographical spread of knowledge
activities is due to the emergence of global innovation
networks, which first link more traditional innovation
countries and then bring in middle-income econo­
mies. However, networks among core countries domi­
nate and innovation networks involving only non-core
economies are of marginal importance for patents. For
scientific publication, some middle-income economies,
and even subnetworks among these, are beginning to
play a larger role.
Overall, knowledge production and interactions are
becoming increasingly global in terms of their reach,
through the spread of knowledge-creating hubs and
the formation of international teams. There has been
some stagnation of co-inventorship networks, reflect­
ing a more general slowdown on globalization, but
no let-up in international teamwork for the publish­
ing of scientific articles. However, as discussed in
Chapter 1, truly global innovation networks cannot
be confined to networks based mostly in a few highincome countries. Several regions of the world still
have much work to do to integrate themselves into
international networks and, eventually, become part
of global innovation networks. Certainly, international
collaboration with top innovation hotspots is a way
forward. It has worked to some extent for East Asian
economies, notably China.
Another important message relates to the geographical
distribution of knowledge production within countries
(both within well-established knowledge producers
and emerging ones). Despite the increasing world­
wide spread of knowledge production, there is no
equivalent spreading within countries; there is even
increased concentration in some. This may have, of
course, important consequences for the distribution
of economic benefits within countries, which will need
to be addressed properly (see Chapter 5).

The production of patents and scientific articles
has not stayed within the traditional knowledgeproducing economies (Europe, Japan and the U.S.).
This is a notable development as knowledge-related
phenomena, such as patenting, scientific production,
R&D investment and so on, have always been more
concentrated than other aspects of globalization, like
trade or FDI.
These agglomerations – identified as hotspots and
niche clusters – do not only keep concentrating a

Auto and tech companies – the
drive for autonomous vehicles

In 2004, the United States (U.S.) Defense
Department staged a novel off-road race in the
Mojave Desert. The novelty lay in it being open
only to driverless or self-drive cars. First prize
for winning the “Grand Challenge” over the
240km course was $1 million. Nobody lifted the
prize, because nobody finished the race.1
But a year later, the Department’s Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
staged the competition again and doubled the
prize. It attracted dozens of entrants and this
time a number completed the course. The desert
race was won by “Stanley,” an autonomous
vehicle (AV) entered by Stanford University, with
vehicles from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
taking second and third places.

The automobile industry has been envisioning selfdriving2 or autonomous vehicles at least since General
Motors presented its “Futurama” concept at the 1939
World’s Fair. Even in those early days, GM was not
the only one dreaming of a self-driving future, and
several attempts toward realization of AVs were made
in subsequent years. But it is since the mid-2000s that
huge advances in robotics and, particularly, artificial
intelligence (AI)3 have begun to turn a long-held aspira­
tion into something closer to reality.
The AV industry is still in its infancy and fully autono­
mous vehicles (Level 5) are years from reaching the
market. Nevertheless, robotics and AI are already
reshaping the car industry – so much so that new
technologies are posing a significant existential threat
to the incumbent automakers. AI, data analytics and
a slew of connected devices and components are
reformulating the industry’s business model toward
services and the so-called “platform economy.”
Traditional automakers fear being supplanted and
reduced to bit-players in their core competency – the
making and marketing of cars. To tackle these chal­
lenges a menu of options is available to them – from
investing in internal knowledge development, recruiting
human capital and strategic alliances, to acquisitions of
new entrants, or a combination of these.4 It is not clear
which single or combination of the above strategies will
yield the most successful results. What is clear though
is that neither the incumbents nor the new entrants, on
their own, currently have all the required competencies
for producing AVs. They either need to join forces or else
develop internally the respective skills they now lack.
Against this background, this chapter seeks to analyze
current innovation clusters in the automotive industry
and understand how AV is affecting the geographical
spread and concentration of innovation (see Chapter 1).
Understanding the relationship between the new
entrants and the incumbents can offer pointers to the
evolution of current innovation clusters. How firms
react to AV technology will determine which firms will
be the market leaders and which regions will be the
AV technological hubs.

In the following sections the chapter looks into the
contemporary evolution of AV technology and its key
players. It also briefly discusses two other related tech­
nologies: mobility and connectivity. Next, it explores
the impact of AV technology on the automotive industry
from two perspectives. First, whether AV technology
is changing the nature of innovative collaborations
between and within incumbents and entrants. Second,
whether it is changing the geography of innovation. It
concludes with a discussion on potential positive and
negative impacts.

3.1

Definitions

Basic components of a driving
automation system
There are three basic functional components of any
computer-automated system: monitoring, agency,
and action – as depicted in Figure 3.1. Monitoring
can be understood as sensing and paying attention,
while agency consists of decision-making, and action
involves implementing decisions. Furthermore, auto­
mated systems can also include various feedback loops,
possibly including machine learning.

Levels of driving automation
The established Society of Automotive Engineers (SEA)
industry standard for terms relating to automated
vehicles is Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related
to Driving Automation Systems for On-Road Motor
Vehicles (SAE J3016). It was initially published in 2014
and substantially revised in 2018.
The SAE standard introduced and defined six levels
of driving automation (Figure 3.2), including level 0 for
systems that perform no sustained dynamic driving
tasks. Levels 1 and 2 are termed driver assistance
and partial driving automation, respectively. The lower
levels of automation require the driver to at least actively
supervise the driving automation system. Driving
automation systems that assume the entire dynamic
driving task are classified as SAE levels 3, 4 and 5
and are collectively described as automated driving
systems (ADS). While the main focus of this chapter is
on level 3+ technologies, in the empirical analysis we
do not exclude the historical innovations of the 1980s,

1990s and early 2000s that were the building blocks
of modern AV technology.

3.2
Technological evolution
of the automotive industry
Industry evolution literature5 divides the life cycle of
any given industry into five stages: the introductory
embryonic stage, growth, shakeout, maturing and
decline. The early stages are ripe with high uncertainty
and numerous entries and exits. Later on, the emer­
gence of a dominant design will leave only a handful of
firms standing. Names like Sprite, Unito, Wolfe, Angus,
Empire do not exactly ring a bell and that is because
these early car companies were some of the thousands
that exited the industry more than a century ago when
the first automobiles started mesmerizing the world.
Until a few years ago, the automotive sector was
considered a mature industry with well-established
players and for which the key technological questions
had been answered in the 1930s.6 The initial innovations
were fundamental as they defined the basic structure
of the automobile. These included the development
of water-cooled engines placed in the front of the
car, shaft-driven transmissions, streamlined bodies
and pressed steel frames.7 The remaining product
and process innovation in the years after the Second
World War, and particularly after the 1970s, was attrib­
uted to rising oil prices, cost pressure arising from
intensifying international competition and changes in
consumer demands.
At the turn of the millennium this picture changed;
the increasing processing power of computers in

conjunction with the widespread adoption of the
Internet and, consequently, smartphones, opened
several avenues for innovation. Many established oldline industries – like newspapers, the music business,
TV and retail – woke up to the waves of technological
disruption that advances in software and the hardware
side of computer technology had triggered. These
affected not only their core competencies, but also their
complementary assets – those needed to commer­
cialize and market products – and their distribution
channels. Many of these industries were rattled and
reshuffled by the digital era. The automotive industry
– although with some lag – has not been untouched by
the waves. For instance, in 2018, the global electric
vehicle fleet exceeded 5.1 million,8 achieving almost
2.1 percent of market share. This number is expected
to increase to around 30 percent by 2030.
Industry life-cycle literature discusses how industries,
as they reach maturity, are subject to new technological
shocks which can be the seeds for the beginning of a
new cycle. Whether the new cycle is actually realized or
not depends on the existence of various technological
and non-technological competencies. The participants
in the new cycle may be from within the same industry
or from previously non-competing industries whose
competencies meet the technological requirements
for entering the new cycle.

Auto and tech companies – the drive for autonomous vehicles

main ingredients for the realization of AVs are both the
“V” and the “A.” An AV unit is basically chassis and
engine, plus an intelligence that brings full autonomy to
the physical aspect. The incumbent automakers’ core
competency9 lies with the “V.” Creating all the software
(e.g., artificial intelligence) and hardware elements (e.g.,
sensors and cameras) required for autonomy – the “A”
– is within the core competencies of the tech companies.
The incumbent automakers’ core competencies are
mass manufacturing, mechanical engineering and
jumping through the thousands of regulatory hoops
that lead to the final car being on the road. They are
the result of decades of accumulated tacit knowledge
– knowledge that is not easily replicable – and knowhow. Mastering these competencies is not immediate
and straightforward.
New entrants’ technological competencies are in
hardware and software, especially the deep-learning
and real-time control algorithms needed for vehicle
autonomy. They are beyond the spectrum of expertise
of most automakers and their suppliers, which have
little prior knowledge of them.
Core competencies of the automakers are more or less
familiar to most people, but not so the technological
waves that are transforming the industry. The following
sections will briefly discuss three technological waves
that are somewhat related. A fourth wave, electric
vehicles, although equally affecting the industry, is not
within the focus and scope of this chapter.

Autonomous vehicles: scientists
behind their contemporary rise
The genesis of a set of AV-related startups and tech
firms stems from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT). MIT has been a global leader in
robotics technology for decades and has contributed
to an agglomeration of firms specializing in AV-related
robotics technology in the Cambridge and Boston area.
MIT graduates have also produced several roboticsrelated spin-offs, including a few specifically interested
in deploying autonomous vehicles.

In 2007, DARPA held a follow-up competition to its

fully autonomous vehicles that require no driver. The traffic laws. CMU and Stanford again led the pack,

with CMU’s “Boss” taking first place. In all, six teams
completed the 2007 course – demonstrating the rapid
development of self-driving technology within several
universities. Silicon Valley tech giants, notably Google,
later recruited many Stanford and CMU participants
of the DARPA challenges. (Waymo originated as a
self-driving project of Google before it became a standalone subsidiary.) Most of the scientists involved subse­
quently have founded their own spin-offs, including
such tech startups as Aurora, Udacity, Nuro and Argo
AI, all of which are at the forefront of the AV industry
(see Figure 3.3).
The DARPA challenges have been a milestone in the
history of modern AV technology. Although there’s
no evidence of their causal effect, we observe an
increasing trend in innovative activity in AV technology
(measured by patents, see Box 3.1) in the mid-2000s
that coincides with the DARPA initiatives, with a major
innovative spike after 2010. Despite this upward trend,
AV technology is still very niche and comprised less
than 0.1 percent of total patent filings globally even at
the height of that spike in 2016 (see Figure 3.4).

64

Box 3.1 The AV patent mapping strategy and
its limitations10
The AV industry is a combination of various tech­
nologies applied to a specific use – automating the
operation of ground-based vehicles. Thus, search
strategies to identify AV-related technologies and
scholarship are inherently imprecise and require
creativity and several iterations. Defining clear-cut
boundaries is very difficult.
Against these limitations, this chapter makes use
of technological codes of the Cooperative Patent
Classification (CPC), an international system for
classifying patent documents. A list of CPC classes
that corresponds to the technologies used in AV
was compiled. The list was divided into two groups.
First, the smaller number of niche classes where it
is relatively safe to say the entirety were relevant
to AV. Second, the classes that were broader and
had patents that may not be relevant to AV. For this
second group, a list of keywords was added to the
search. These keywords were some permutation

of autonomous vehicle, car, taxi, truck, etc. These
keywords were used to identify the patents that
belonged to the selected CPCs and had one of
these keywords mentioned either in their patent
abstract or title.
The same list of keywords was used to search for
scientific publications that had mentioned some
permutation of the keywords in their abstracts
or titles. From these selected sets of papers a
new list of keywords was compiled, for example,
predictive cruise control. As publications only have
broad categories, with no level of granularity similar
to CPCs, the subject-level category was used to
eliminate those false positive articles that belonged
to areas that are intuitively far from AV technology
– microbiology, zoology, etc.

Mobility as a service
Parallel to these efforts, Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS),
which integrates various transport services into a
single service available on demand, became a popular
concept. Companies like Uber (founded in 2009) and

Lyft (founded in 2012) in the U.S. came to fruition.
Soon, others with similar business models started
popping up all around the globe: Ola Cabs in India
(founded in 2010), Grab (founded in 2012) in Singapore
and DiDi Chuxing (founded in 2012) in China. These
companies provided services like ride-hailing and/
or car-sharing. Many of them have expanded their
businesses to other services, including deliveries,
logistics and bike-sharing.
Uber’s former CEO, Travis Kalanick, described the
development of “robotaxis” (self-driving taxis) as “exis­
tential” to the company. If the future of automobiles is
driverless, mobility companies have a vested interest
in AV technology for multiple reasons. First, removing
the driver from the equation will reduce their costs.
Second, their business model has the potential to
change the economics of the automotive industry.
The MaaS business model can lead to a reduction
of private car ownership and a shift to a more fleetoriented system, where the revenue model would be
based on mileage instead of the number of cars sold.
AV technology can enable a system where people
buy access to transportation as opposed to owning
vehicles. A rough calculation based on the number
of cars on the road and their average annual mileage,
compared to what mobility companies charge per mile,
65

Third, mobility companies are sitting on abundant data
and information about customer behavior and prefer­
ences, which would give them a significant advantage in
a sales environment that is increasingly about custom­
ized and bespoke experience.

Collaboration among auto companies

Tech firms also would need to collaborate with each
other to share the technology’s large risks and costs.
Most tech firms, especially the smaller startups, occupy
niches, focusing on hardware, software, mobility services,
connectivity, communications and many more (see
Figure 3.7 below). With the exception of Waymo –
which develops all its hardware and software stack16
in-house – no single tech company has the necessary
expertise in all these areas. So, collaboration among
tech companies is not uncommon. Taiwan-based VIA
2018
Technologies Inc. announced in 2018 that it is partner­
ing with AI vision startup Lucid to deliver AI-based
depth sensing in dual- and multi-camera devices
for use in security, retail, robotics and autonomous
vehicles.17 This is just one of a long list of examples of
collaboration between tech companies.

In the face of the AV technological shock, auto compa­
nies have an incentive to join forces to share the costs
and risks but also defend their market position, which
is being threatened by outsiders. The common threat
they are facing is “commoditization” of their core
competency; that is, becoming simply a supplier of
a commodity good, which in this case is a car. The
tech companies would be the ones generating the
value added and therefore reaping the largest benefits.
Global automakers Daimler and BMW announced
they would partner in a new long-term partnership to
co-develop automated driving technologies.

Some tech companies have also decided to give open
access – free of cost or other access barriers – to their
closely guarded data and technologies. For instance,
Waymo has decide to sell one of its three LIDAR
sensors – called Laser Bear Honeycomb, which uses a
laser to measure distances – to third parties interested
in using the technology for purposes other than selfdriving cars. Some believe the LIDAR sensor devel­
opment curve is similar to Moore’s Law in computer
chips – every 18 months, resolution will double and the
price drop by half18 – so granting open access offers
the chance to scale up with reduced costs.

The joint effort will involve 1,200 technicians from both
companies. The technicians will be based at BMW’s
autonomous driving campus in Unterschleissheim, near
Munich, its Mercedes subsidiary’s technology center
in Sindelfingen, near Stuttgart, and Daimler’s testing
and technology center in Immendingen in southern
Germany. The two companies aim to launch their nextgeneration, self-driving passenger cars by 2024.14 Audi,
another German automaker, has announced that it is
to join forces with them.15

Waymo is making some of the high-resolution sensor
data gathered by its fleet of autonomous vehicles avail­
able to researchers for free. It is not the first company
to release an open dataset. In March 2019, global
technology company Aptiv was one of the first large
AV operators to publicly release a set of its sensor data.
Uber and Cruise, the autonomous division of General
Motors, have also released their AV visualization tools
to the public.19

While some may be surprised to see long-time foes
becoming friends, it is not rare in AV development. The

These decisions are in line with the “open innovation”20
strategies that firms adopt as a response to highly
complex innovative ideas.

Collaboration between tech
and auto companies
AV technology is not rendering the upstream core
knowledge of automakers completely obsolete. In
fact – at least for now – AV is a type of technologi­
cal discontinuity that needs the incumbent’s core
competency to achieve its goal. Research shows21 that
– historically – incumbents can survive the discontinuity
if they cooperate with the entrants challenging their
core knowledge. In presence of strong “appropri­
ability regimes,” the new entrants have the incentive
to license out their technologies. The literature 22
defines strong appropriability regimes as environ­
mental factors – legal protection (e.g., patents) or
the needed knowledge is difficult to pass on (tacit) or
codified – that allow the tech company to recuperate
its investment.

While it seems logical for auto companies to collaborate
with tech companies, the reverse is not so straight­
forward. Some might even argue that tech giants do
not need auto companies and that they can, and will
eventually, directly enter the auto sector.24 Their argu­
ment focuses on the costs. Since IT giants like Alphabet,
Amazon and Apple in the U.S. and Alibaba, Baidu and
Tencent in China have deep pockets they can easily
afford the costs of designing and manufacturing a car.
Others do not agree.25 Excelling at complex mass manu­
facturing, organizing quality value chains, dealing with
complex regulatory issues is neither trivial nor negligible.
U.S. energy and automotive company Tesla’s financial
losses and struggles to keep up with delivery schedules
of its Model 3 electric sedan car attest to this issue. The
ecosystem in which automakers operate and lobby is
their stronghold. Even if the tech companies had the tech­
nological capacity to produce cars, they would still have
difficulties challenging the current socio-technical regime
unless they collaborate with the incumbent automakers.

AV technology shows characteristics of strong appro­
priability. This allows the new entrants to cooperate
with incumbents while securing their benefits without Therefore, tech companies also have an incentive to
fear of imitation.23 By partnering with tech companies, collaborate and see where their strengths complement

The types of collaboration outlined are not mutually
exclusive and they coexist. The high uncertainty makes
firms simultaneously bet on multiple combinations of
the three options – “build,” “borrow” and “buy.”26
By default, much of the above collaboration may not be
captured by patent or scientific publication data. The
main reason is that most are formal partnerships and
alliances, joint ventures, investments or acquisitions.
Out of more than 100 formal collaborations identified,27
in terms of frequency, the largest share belongs to
auto–tech, followed by tech–tech and auto–auto. Finally,
a small portion of the collaboration is between tech
companies and national or regional government enti­
ties. For instance, Detroit-based Quadrobot and the
Chinese Postal Service are partnering to produce
autonomous delivery vans.

of driving automation (See Figure 3.2).
In the later years, we observe some developing coun­
tries that are not traditional automaking countries
also engaging in this technology. The most notice­
able change is the emergence of China and India. As
discussed earlier, the changing nature of technology
can be one explanation of this expansion. The new sets
of technologies – AI and robotics – allow for “leapfrog­
ging” of countries/regions with no longstanding ties to

countries involved are still the U.S., Japan, Germany,
the Republic of Korea and Sweden, with the U.S. and
China latterly being the most active.
When looking at scientific publication we observe that
more developing countries in the Middle East, Latin
America and Africa – that are not captured in the patent­
ing data – are highly active in generating basic research
and scientific articles. Iran would be an example of a
country highly active in scientific publication but with
almost no patenting presence in this field. Scientific
publication data complements patents in giving a better
picture of the innovation landscape in AV technology.

Silicon Valley, California
It now feels as though Silicon Valley (the area surround­
ing San Francisco, California), has always been the
center of the AV industry. However, it began with
Google (now Waymo) taking an interest in on-road
autonomous vehicles following the DARPA grand
challenges. Google started to hire grand challenge
participants in 2009, including CMU team leader Chris
Urmson, who became chief technology officer (CTO)
of the project. Other researchers were available locally.
Stanford University had an established robotics and
automated-driving research program on the same
level as CMU and otherwise unparalleled in the world.
Google announced its self-driving project in 2010 with
a compelling video of a blind man taking a self-driving
car to a Taco Bell restaurant. The video did not convey
the extent of preparation required for the demonstration,
but it did show a level of driving automation capability
that surprised the automotive industry and sparked a
movement of industry stalwarts and startups to catch
up and get in on the self-driving action.
Google’s self-driving car project, combined with the
pre-existing pool of AI and software engineers, cata­
lyzed the development of Silicon Valley as a global
leader in AV development.
It would be difficult to tabulate the number of firms
pursuing automated driving in the Valley. But as of
early 2019, 62 entities have received a permit from
the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test
prototype ADS on public roads in the state.49

assistant called Tmall Genie. Tencent, another tech
giant, has its own system called “AI in Car.”
Moreover, the Government’s New Generation Artificial
Intelligence Development Plan,51 announced in 2017,
shows China’s determination to become a global leader
in artificial intelligence, including autonomous driving
technology. China also heavily invests in infrastructure
and building roads and streets that are compatible
with connected and autonomous vehicles. Roads in
Beijing’s E-Town52 are among 44 roads (total 123 km)
marked out for testing AVs. Besides Beijing, extensive
testing is also taking place in 15 other cities around
China, including Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou
in Guangdong province, Hangzhou in Zhejiang province,
Wuhan in Hubei province and Chongqing.53
Baidu, Pony.ai and WeRide are the leaders in self‐
driving technology in China.54 However, even Baidu
is not yet considered to be among the top 10 globally.
In California, Baidu’s test vehicles required human
intervention every 41 miles driven, compared with
every 5,596 miles driven by Waymo’s vehicles.55 The
Baidu Apollo Automated Vehicle Platform has, however,
attracted more than 100 global partners. Apollo has
an AV simulation system, vehicle test data and highdefinition maps.56 Both CarLife and DuerOS are incor­
porated in Apollo. Further, Baidu has pledged to deploy
self‐driving taxis in geo-fenced areas of Changsha,
Hunan Province, in 2019.57 Baidu is attracting the major­
ity of investment and attention in the Chinese market
for autonomous driving. However, the city govern­
ment of Beijing, which has begun requiring reporting
for testing of automated vehicles on city streets, has
received reports from seven other companies in addi­
tion to Baidu.58 Many Chinese companies also maintain
research facilities in Silicon Valley, including Baidu.59
Chinese companies, including Baidu, NIO, Tencent,
Alibaba, FAW, SAIC, ChangAn, BAIC, Great Wall, GAC,
Dongfeng, Geely, BYD and Lifan have started testing
their vehicles in China. Waymo has also opened a
subsidiary in Shanghai, although the filing says the
subsidiary will focus on logistics consulting, supply
chain and AV parts and product design and not AVs.60

The three waves of technological disruption discussed
earlier (AV, MaaS and connected cars), have created a
window of opportunity for Chinese auto firms as they
have no legacy disadvantage vis-à-vis foreign multi­
nationals.50 Even in China, however, local tech giants
have the upper hand over the auto sector. Chinese

3.7
Is AV technology changing
the geography of innovation in
the automotive industry?
Innovation has a geographical dimension.98 Research
has shown that industries tend to co-locate in the
vicinity of each other (see Chapters 1 and 2). The two
types of players in the auto industry, the incumbents
and the new entrants, have their own geographical
clusters. The new entrants belong to the tech clusters
of the world (e.g., Silicon Valley), whereas the incumbent
automakers are well established in their manufacturing
clusters (e.g., Detroit). The key question is whether the
emergence of AV has made the automakers and tech
companies seek greater geographical proximity. If the
answer is yes, in which direction? The automakers are
appearing in the tech clusters or vice versa.
While it is too early to give a definitive answer to the
above questions, evidence based on patent data
can shed some light. This section looks at the top
global auto industry companies’ patents, selected
from three geographical areas: the U.S. (Ford and
GM), Germany (Daimler, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen and
Bosch) and Japan (Toyota, Honda and Nissan). These
companies’ total patent portfolio was examined, and
a subset of patents related to AV technology identified
and flagged. Based on this data the share of each
company’s total patenting for different clusters is
calculated together with that of AV patents. For instance,
72.6 percent of Daimler’s total patents are in Stuttgart,
with 76.9 percent of its AV patents also being there.
The major chunk of automakers’ AV patents is still
generated in the same main clusters where most
of their patenting happens. Nevertheless, there are
also important variations. More than 82 percent of
Japanese automakers’ total and AV patents belong
to their primary, Japan-based clusters, a far higher
percentage than that of the two U.S. companies, as
can be seen from Table 3.1 below.

have 16.1 and 9.7 percent of AV patents but only 1 and
4.8 percent, respectively, of general patents.99
In order to test whether tech companies have moved
physically closer to automakers, the same exercise
was repeated100. The selected companies were
Google, Waymo, Delphi, Mobileye, DeepMap, Magna
Electronics, Qualcomm, Uber and Apple. No systematic
trend toward auto clusters was observed. As with auto­
makers, the lion’s share of both total and AV patenting
happens in the same top cluster.
The geography of Uber’s AV patents is interesting.
While 39.6 percent of its patents are in San Francisco,
Silicon Valley is not its top cluster when it comes to
AV. Around 48.5 percent of Uber’s AV patents are in
Pittsburgh, where it has been hiring and collaborating
with CMU researchers. Uber has also been testing AVs
in Pittsburg since late 2018.
These results indicate that, while there is some shifting
geography at the margin, auto and tech companies’
innovation is still largely home based. However, the
evidence available, although interesting, should be
treated with caution. The numbers, particularly for AV
patents, are very limited and the weight of this limited
set of patents may distort the overall picture. Moreover,
patent data is made public with at least 18 months’
delay after being first filed. And the actual innovation
may have been developed months, if not years, before
the patent request was made. Finally, applicants’ name
disambiguation issues may have impacted the results
for some companies.

Potential positive and
negative impacts of AVs

Despite the high anticipation that surrounds them,
fully autonomous vehicles are, if not decades, defi­
nitely years away.101 Multiple intertwined technological
advances are creating new rules for an industry that
had not changed its way of doing business for almost
a century. Key players from the tech and traditional
automobile sectors – although with different incentives
– are pooling resources to realize the goal of self-driving

Note: The sum of the percentages may be more than 100 percent, due to the fact that a single patent can be assigned to more than one cluster so
there is double counting.

The current ecosystem of the automotive industry –
its market power and its social and political position,
for example – has been in place for decades and is
very strong. This ecosystem is not so likely to change
easily unless the key players in the industry change
(i.e. existing automakers exit the market or the market
is totally taken over by the tech companies), there is a
drastic transformation of policy and regulatory issues or
customer demand and preferences shift considerably.
At the same time, public opinion is still split over AV.

Advocates of AV technology see it solving several
grave urban problems. For example, it could reduce
traffic jams and air pollution and improve road safety.
Increased precision in the movement of vehicles and
the elimination of human error can reduce traffic fatali­
ties. Connected “smart” vehicles can safely travel much
closer together – a technique known as “platooning.”
This, together with automated highway systems, should
increase road capacity and lead to other efficiency
gains, such as lower fuel consumption and better
77

World Intellectual Property Report 2019

energy efficiency, which will also have a positive impact
on the environment.
Hours would no longer be wasted “behind the wheel”
and those who would once have been driving could
instead dedicate time to relaxing, working or even sleep­
ing. Children, senior citizens and disabled people would
have more independence and mobility. Land currently
devoted to parking lots could be put to other uses.
Not everyone is so positive about self-drive cars,
however. In 2018, the death of a pedestrian in Arizona
in an accident involving a test vehicle operating in selfdriving mode was a huge setback. Some companies
temporarily halted road testing. Whatever the state of
play technologically, the general public may not yet be
ready for AVs to go mainstream. Some critics question
whether AVs would really help solve urban issues such
as traffic jams and pollution. The new technology could
simply increase the number of vehicles on the road, and
therefore congestion. And with cars being self-driving,
commuters might be prepared to “drive” further to work
rather than take a train, which is less polluting.
Privacy and cyber-security are also major concerns.
Data about drivers collected through autonomous,
connected vehicles and other “intelligent transport

78

system” applications could potentially be used for
purposes not related to driving. The ability of hack­
ers to crack the system, and alter information or the
identity of another vehicle is one of the many serious
security worries. Legal and regulatory systems already
have trouble keeping up with the fast pace of change
in the automotive industry. It is still not clear, in the
case of an accident, who would be legally liable – the
company that runs the software system, the hardware
or the mobility platform.
Moreover, countries and regions are at different levels
of infrastructure readiness for AVs. Uneven degrees
of preparedness may exacerbate inequality between
richer and poorer areas within countries and between
regions. All these changes will ripple through other
industries – from insurance to repair, trucking to taxi
driving. AV technology has an impact that goes beyond
the boundaries of a single industry.
Until the auto and tech world can address all these
technical, ethical, security and legal issues, the AV
future will continue to be a dream.

Plant biotechnology – connecting
urban innovation and rural application

Humans began making genetic improvements
to plants thousands of years before anyone
even knew what a gene was. Starting circa
10,000 BCE, they initially began by selecting and
domesticating crops from the natural biological
diversity of plants. These crops differed from
their wild predecessors through the propagation
of carefully chosen specific plant materials,
which were cultivated for human consumption
and use.1
The techniques used to select and propagate
crop varieties with desirable traits – known
as cultivars – can generally be divided into
three categories: the traditional, which began
with domestication, the conventional and the
modern. All three methods are in use today to
varying degrees.

Conventional breeding of new crop varieties and traits
involves the sexual reproduction of two compatible
crop varieties to produce a mutated offspring with the
desired biological traits.2 This method often requires
many crosses to get to the right combination of genes
to produce the desired crop. It also needs the crops
to be sexually compatible.
Today, new crop varieties can be achieved by biotech­
nology. This modern technique relies on an understand­
ing of a plant’s genetic make-up and uses different
methods of genetic engineering to make changes to its
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), molecules of nucleotides
which carry the genetic instructions for the develop­
ment, functioning, growth and reproduction of all
known organisms.
Biotechnology refers to “any technological applica­
tion that uses biological systems, living organisms,
or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or
processes for specific use.”3 It can also involve the
implementation of advanced molecular and cellular
technologies and techniques. In both the broader and
narrower sense of its application, agricultural biotech­
nology relies on the discoveries and research tools of
a relatively new science field.
It is changing the agriculture industry.4 Advances
have produced crops that are resistant to certain
diseases, that result in higher yields than before, that
can grow in extreme soil conditions, such as in arid
and salty environments, and that are even infused
with nutrients.5
Biotechnology innovation has the potential to increase
agricultural productivity and quality, ultimately rais­
ing incomes for farmers across the world. It can also
address environmental concerns about the use of
chemical pesticides. Klümper and Qaim (2014) show
that genetically modified technology had increased
farmer profits worldwide by 68 percent, crop yields
by 22 percent and reduced use of chemical pesticides
by 37 percent. Brookes (2018) estimates that each

containing genes from another organism – relative

in the industry.
Table 4.1 lists a few breakthrough discoveries as well as
innovations that form the basis of biotechnology meth­
ods and their application in plant biotechnology today.

4.1
The rising importance
of plant biotechnology

Plant biotechnology generally involves three areas
of the farming industry: (i) plant breeding and
seeds, (ii) soil health and fertility and (iii) pest control
and pesticides.
The application of biotechnology in plant breeding and
seeds refers to the development of new varieties and
traits through hybridization, outcrossing (interbreeding),
mutation, tissue culture, grafting and cloning of plants,
genetic engineering and editing of the genome, which
is the whole of the hereditary information encoded in
a plant’s DNA, to name a few. Most innovation is in
this area.
For soil health and fertility, biotechnology involves using
biofertilizers – the culturing and use of microbes for soil
amendment and plant growth. Lastly, biotechnology for
pest control and pesticides deals with biocontrol strate­
gies, biopesticides, breeding and genetic engineering
of pest resistance traits in crops, as well as mutation
and genetic engineering for herbicide tolerance.
88

The commercial application of biotechnology tools and
techniques first found its way into the field of medicine
in the mid-1970s; agricultural use began a few years
later.7 This was primarily because molecular biology
was mainly developed in medical schools and universi­
ties, which were not much concerned with agriculture.8
However, as the use of biotechnology in medicine and
for human health became more prominent, scientists
began to apply biotechnology to veterinary science
for animal health and then to plant breeding. Animals
came first, because of their relative genetic proximity
to humans.9
By the mid-1980s, the crop biotechnology industry
had begun to grow. Several landmark legal decisions
in the U.S. regarding whether living organisms may be
patented led to the granting of patents on genetically
engineered plants.10 Toward the end of the decade, field
trials of transgenic plants were underway in Australia,
Canada, the U.S. and some European countries.
Mexico, a developing economy, also began conduct­
ing field trials of transgenic crops around the same

time.11 Meanwhile, China became the first country to
commercially farm a pest-resistant, transgenic tobacco
plant in 1988. However, Chinese farmers stopped
farming the plants in the mid-1990s as many tobaccoproducing companies expressed concerns about using
these genetically improved organisms (GIOs) in their
products. In particular, consumers were apprehensive
about consuming GIO cigarettes. These landmark
events coincided with a rise in the number of special­
ized agricultural biotechnology startups, particularly in
the U.S., during the 1980s and 1990s.
Figure 4.1 plots the rising global demand for patents
for plant biotechnology inventions from 1970 to 2016.
The red line shows the total number of patent applica­
tions in the field filed at different intellectual property
(IP) offices worldwide.12 By contrast, the dark red line
represents the number of initial filings for new plant
biotechnology patents, also known as first filings. The
difference between the total number of patent filings
and the first filings is referred to as the subsequent
filings. The subsequent filings represent the number of
applications filed in multiple countries, or jurisdictions,
for the same inventions. The widening gap between
the two lines from the 1980s onward shows how inven­
tors increasingly requested patent protection for their
inventions from competitors in more than one market.
More importantly, it illustrates the growing commercial
importance of plant biotechnology inventions globally.

What shapes innovation in the field?
Policies, rules and regulations shape and affect innova­
tion in the plant biotechnology industry. They include
the availability of IP rights as a mechanism for ensuring
a return on investment in innovation, and regulations on
health and safety and on protecting the environment,
among others.

Appropriate returns on investments
Most jurisdictions do not allow for the patentability of
things that exist in nature, including biological organ­
isms. However, the lines have become blurred with new
technological advances in biotechnology.13
Concerns with patentability on agricultural biotechnol­
ogy innovation are similar to those expressed about
patenting in the biotechnology field generally.14 Granting
exclusive rights on research tools may dampen followon innovation.15 In crop biotechnology, patents could
make it difficult for poorer economies to benefit from
research that could alleviate poverty and address
world hunger problems. In addition, critics have argued
that most of the patents granted are too broad and
are likely to infringe on other proprietary technology,
resulting in the relatively high amount of litigation seen
in the industry.

Box 4.1 Key differences between
breeding techniques
There are two ways to introduce desired traits into
plants and they differ according to plant type. Dicots,
or broad-leaved crops, such as cotton, soybean and
tomato, rely on the transformation brought about by
a bacterium known as Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
In nature, this bacterium infects plants, inserting
some of its own DNA directly into the DNA of the
plant. By modifying the bacterium to exclude its
unwanted traits and include the gene of interest, a
crop may be transformed through bacterial infection.
The cells containing the new gene subsequently
can be identified and grown using plant cell-culture
technology into a whole plant that now contains the
new transgene incorporated into its DNA.
Monocots, or grass species, such as maize, wheat
and rice, are transformed by physically shooting
small tungsten balls coated with an external DNA
into the plant’s genome. Some of the DNA comes
off and is incorporated into the DNA of the recipient
plant. Those cells can also be identified and grown
into a whole plant that contains the foreign DNA.
The differences between traditional and conven­
tional breeding and their modern counterpart boil
down to the control over the breeding process. The
outcomes of plants bred through the traditional

(i) approvals to conduct field tests, (ii) approvals to
farm for commercial purposes and (iii) approval to sell
and market to consumers. In the U.S., the agencies
include the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
for field trial approval and the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for commercial approval.
Europe was responsible for some important break­
throughs in plant biotechnology. In the early 1990s,
Belgium, France and the U.K. were among the top five
countries in the industry, which together accounted for
nearly 95 percent of transgenic crops released – the
other two were Canada and the U.S. However, by the
turn of the century, European sentiment toward trans­
genic crops had changed significantly.22
Between 1998 and 2004, the European Commission
(Commission), the European Union’s executive arm,
and five EU member states imposed a de facto mora­
torium on the approval of GMOs.23 From 2003, the
Commission then put in place several regulations and

and conventional methods are often unpredict­
able. Breeders choose the parents with the desired
traits to cross but the progeny may not carry the
genotype with the desired traits or display it,
the phenotype.
Modern breeding techniques, such as genetic
engineering, allow for targeted transfer of desir­
able crop traits – the transgene – and the breeding
of new transgenic plants in an efficient and fast
manner. These transgenic crops are also known
as GMOs. The modern techniques simplify the
breeding process by bypassing the need for the
sexual compatibility of the plants with the desired
traits and allow for the selection of desirable traits
from any living organism. The desired traits can
come from the same species or a cross-species;
they can even come from a modification of the
expression of the plant’s own genes. Targeting of the
desired gene, tracking it and inserting it into a crop’s
DNA ensures a clean breed of the crop and excludes
the potential for unwanted, ancillary traits, which are
often a by-product of traditional and conventional
breeding. Moreover, there is a faster turnaround in
the development of new crop varieties in modern
breeding techniques than its predecessors.

directives on GMOs. 24 During the moratorium, the
Commission differentiated between plants whose
genes had been edited with conventional breeding
methods and those that had been genetically edited
using biotechnology tools (see Box 4.1). The measures
established specific requirements for conducting field
tests and planting of transgenic crops, their import and
use and the labeling of GMO products.
Several commercial explanations have been put
forward for this change in the continent’s attitude
toward transgenic crops, besides the strong political
campaigns against GMOs mounted by environmental
and consumer groups. Graff and Zilberman (2007)
argue that Europe’s strong agrochemical businesses
enjoyed a comparative advantage in chemistry and
wanted to prevent their competitors from entering the
market. Sheldon (2004) proposed that EU farmers
saw the measures limiting the approval of genetically
engineered plants as an opportunity to prevent agri­
cultural commodities from the rest of the world from
entering the market.

Regardless, the EU regulations have arguably had a
cooling effect on research and development of agri­
cultural biotechnology on the continent.
Figure 4.2 shows the share of patent filings by the U.S.
(in dark red) and several European countries (in red and
light red) of the total plant biotechnology filings world­
wide.25 Until the late 1990s, the share of plant biotech­
nology patents filed in the U.S. and the EU rose more
or less in parallel. However, from 1997 onward there is
a widening gap between patent filing growth rates in
the U.S. and the EU. It is difficult to say conclusively if
this is due to Europe’s de facto moratorium. But since
1998, EU countries have been filing crop biotechnology
patents at a relatively similar – if not slower – rate than
the total patent filing rate.
Industry has reported that the EU stance on transgenic
crops has affected companies’ business strategies.
A study conducted by the USDA Foreign Agricultural
Service showed that many European companies have
shifted their research and development (R&D) outside
of Europe, relocating to places such as the U.S. While
public institutions and universities in Europe continue
to conduct basic research into plant genetics, the
likelihood of these outputs reaching the EU market is
small. In addition, the report noted that many European
biotechnology firms have shifted their focus away from
92

agricultural uses toward medicinal and biofuel indus­
trial applications.26 One of the major European MNCs
in the industry, BASF, a German chemical firm, halted
the development and marketing of its transgenic crops
for the EU in 2012.27

Who drives innovation?
Innovation in the plant biotechnology industry is driven
by investments by both the public and private sectors.

Strong public sector push in
agricultural research
The public sector plays a pivotal role in plant biotech­
nology research by funding and providing important
infrastructure necessary for research. In Europe as
well as the U.S., key policy documents and published
reports underscore the importance of investing in
genetic engineering research.28
Scientists and researchers in public research institu­
tions have made important discoveries that paved the
way to genetic engineering. The importance of basic
science to innovation in the plant biotechnology field
continues today. For example, fundamental advances

4

in molecular biology and genetics have created more
efficient ways to identify and target specific genotypes
in organisms. Moreover, the development of CRISPRCas9, a gene editing technology, has significantly cut
costs in the field of genetic engineering.29
Agricultural research centers and universities specializ­
ing in agricultural science play a pivotal role in adapting
research and diffusing crop biotechnology innovations.
These research centers are mandated to conduct and
develop work that would improve agronomics and
advance genetic improvements in crops and agricul­
tural innovation in general. Moreover, support for their
research work includes funding from governments,
foundations and various intergovernmental and not-forprofit organizations and agencies. The strong mandate
and financial support help ensure the continuity and
importance of these institutions’ work.
In the U.S., the 1862 Morrill Act established Land-Grant
colleges by allocating 30,000 acres (nearly 121.5 km2)
of federal land across the country to build colleges
and universities that would teach and promote the
development of agriculture, among other things. The
second Morrill Act, passed in 1890, ensured that these
colleges had regular federal funding.
The success of Land-Grant colleges laid the foundation
for establishing similar research centers in emerg­
ing economies.30 The International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico City, Mexico,
and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)
in Los Baños, the Philippines, were the first two
such establishments. These two national agriculture
research systems (NARS) would later become part of
the Consultative Group for International Agricultural
Research (CGIAR), an umbrella organization of 15
independent, non-profit research centers focused
on innovation in agriculture. The CGIAR has shaped
the historical evolution of innovation in agricultural
biotechnology, particularly in crop genetic development.
Agriculture requires innovation to be adapted to differ­
ent regional agro-ecological conditions, which include
the combinations of soil, landform and climatic char­
acteristics.31 This means that transgenic crops should
be bred with local cultivars and tested in local fields.
In many developing countries these cultivars and
germplasms – living genetic resources held for animal
or plant breeding or preservation – are kept by public
institutions, such as the NARS or international agricul­
ture research centers (IARCs).32

Plant biotechnology – connecting urban innovation and rural application

Collaboration between public institutions is important,
especially when trying to commercialize GIOs in less
developed economies. Most of the transgenic crops
planted in these economies during the late 1990s were
locally adapted germplasms of their North American
counterparts.33 In poorer countries, IARCs can act as
nodes in global networks of innovation by connecting
agricultural scientists and breeders across many NARS,
including agricultural research universities in the world.
Plant biotechnology innovation has the potential to
address food scarcity and food security issues.34 Thus,
advances find strong support from the public sector,
including intergovernmental organizations and notfor-profit institutions and agencies, to promote their
diffusion to the rest of the world.35
Governments fund most of the agricultural research
in many emerging economies. In a few cases, such
as China, India and Brazil, public sector R&D spend­
ing in agriculture has increased rapidly. From 1990 to
2013, China’s public sector agricultural R&D spend­
ing grew nearly tenfold, from USD 1 billion to more
than USD 9 billion.36 At the same time, India’s spend­
ing tripled, from less than USD 1 billion to almost
USD 3 billion and Brazil’s almost doubled, from less
than USD 2 billion to almost USD 3 billion. By contrast,
public sector spending in agriculture in the U.S. grew
only moderately from about USD 4 billion in 1990 and
declined from 2003 onward.
But many emerging economies, especially those with
limited capacities to innovate in plant biotechnol­
ogy and/or those that lack the financial resources to
conduct research in the field tend to rely on the work
of NARS and/or IARCs.37

Incentives backed by market consolidation
Small, university-based startups initially dominated the
plant biotechnology market in the early years. However,
from the 1990s onward, MNCs bought many of them
out. One study estimated that nearly 90 percent of
all research and development agreements on agri­
cultural biotechnology were between startups and
large MNCs.38
At the same time, firms in the seed, chemical and
fertilizer industries, both in richer and poorer coun­
tries, have experienced significant market concentra­
tion.39 There are many reasons. The high fixed costs
93

World Intellectual Property Report 2019

of commercializing transgenic plants require large
financial resources, which many startup companies
may not have. Second, the high fixed costs also neces­
sitate increasing reliance on IP rights to ensure a return
on investment. Accumulated proprietary technologies
in plant biotechnology can be a barrier to innovation,
as they are in the semiconductor industry. Firms that
collaborate are less likely to infringe on one another’s
IP. For example, Monsanto, BASF, Dow, Bayer, DuPont
and Syngenta cross-licensed one another’s IP rights
on transgenic crops.40
By 2001, 30 separate firms in the seeds and agrochemi­
cal industries had been reduced to six – Monsanto,
DuPont, Swiss-based Syngenta, Bayer, Dow and
BASF. The four biggest account for almost 60 percent
of the agricultural biotechnology market. The major
agrochemical-seed groups are: Bayer CropScience
and BASF in Germany, Corteva Agriscience in the
U.S. and ChemChina, which purchased Syngenta in
2017, in China.
This consolidation of crop biotechnology innovation in
the hands of a few has not necessarily translated into
a reduction of innovative activities in this field.41
Table 4.2 lists selected alliances, including mergers and
acquisitions, of the multinational seed and agrochemi­
cal companies. It shows how the industry has become
more concentrated since the 1990s.

Need for public–private collaboration
Zilberman et al. (1997) conducted a survey of plant
biotechnology firms in the U.S. and found many cases
of collaboration between the public and private sectors.
In particular, they reported that in most patterns of
plant biotechnology innovation the universities made
the important discovery and the private sector then
developed and commercialized the innovation. This
pattern of collaboration between the private and public
sectors continues.
Large chemical and seed MNCs commercialized and
cultivated all of the major transgenic crops bred through
genetic modifications in the early years.42 The only
exception was Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton, which
was developed by a Chinese public research institu­
tion, the Biotechnology Research Center of the China
Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) in Shenzhen.
However, CAAS entered into a joint venture with U.S.

In addition, Figure 4.4 also shows how some regions
lean more toward patenting, while others toward scien­
tific publication. The U.S., Europe, Japan and China
show more patenting, while developing countries
generally have more regions featuring scientific publi­
cation work.49
The difference in innovative output as captured by
Figure 4.4 for patents and scientific publication can
be quite significant for plant biotechnology. There are
two reasons for this.
First, patenting of plant biotechnology inventions is
subject to different criteria across jurisdictions. Hence,
using patenting as the sole indicator of crop biotech­
nology innovation may miss important research work
carried out by scientists in countries where patenting
possibilities are limited.
Second, while both patented inventions and scientific
publication are used to measure innovative activities,
there are important differences. For example, inven­
tions disclosed under patenting requirements may be
closer to the commercialization stage than research
published in scientific publications, which may be
more “upstream” and science related.50 Moreover, most

innovative activities in the U.S. are carried out by the
private sector, which tends to rely on patents, while in
China, universities and public institutions are the main
sources of such activities.
Figure 4.5 maps the international and national clusters
of crop biotechnology across the world. These clusters
are determined by the relative significant co-location of
inventors and authors of plant biotechnology outputs
across countries (international clusters) and within
countries (national clusters).
Box 4.2 highlights the method used to identify these
clusters. It emphasizes how only international plant
biotechnology clusters are comparable across coun­
tries, while national clusters are only comparable across
regions in one country.
The international clusters of plant biotechnology show
how geographically diverse is its innovation land­
scape. The clusters include the three main corridors
of innovation, namely the U.S., Europe and East Asian
countries, Japan and the Republic of Korea. They
further include India, Israel, China and Singapore in
Asia, Australia in Oceania, and Argentina and Mexico
in Latin America and the Caribbean. But at the same

time, these international plant biotechnology clusters
mirror their related biotechnology field clusters.
Not all countries with significant innovative activities
have international clusters. Brazil, for example, is a
leading developing economy with important innova­
tive activities in the field, but with no international
cluster. The main reason for this is that its innovative
activities in plant biotechnology are spread across
seven different regions that individually do not reach
volume thresholds for the production of patents
and scientific articles (see Box 4.2). The Brazilian
Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), its
NARS, mandates that its research activities should
be scattered across its different research campuses
and not just concentrated in its main office in Brasilia.
There are two notable insights from the global mapping
of plant biotechnology’s international and national
clusters. First, there is an urban–rural divide between
the location of innovation centers and the farming the
innovation is aimed at.51 Most innovation in the plant
biotechnology industry is conceptualized, researched
and developed in urban areas rather than in farming
100

areas. However, field trials are conducted in rural areas,
which may require some innovative activities to adapt
the genetically engineered crop to local agro-ecological
conditions – to the local combinations of soil, landform
and climatic characteristics.52
Figure 4.6 maps the international and national crop
biotechnology clusters against the crop areas (shaded
green) of the world for four regions: North America,
Europe, Asia and Latin America. Most of the interna­
tional clusters tend to be in urban areas. In the U.S., for
example, they are in such places as San Jose, Boston
and New York City.
However, there are some clusters that are adjacent
to crop areas. The location of these clusters is not an
accident. Most of these clusters are located in major
agriculture-related universities, for example the U.S.
Land-Grant colleges already mentioned. One notable
example is Des Moines, Iowa, which is both a farming
area and an international plant biotechnology cluster.
Des Moines is home to Iowa State University, a LandGrant university, and Pioneer Hi-Bred, one of the first
startups specializing in agriculture biotechnology.

4

Box 4.2 Identifying the international and
national clusters of crop biotechnology
Identifying international and national clusters of agri­
cultural biotechnology involves at least three steps.
Step 1: Identify plant biotechnology patents and
scientific publication
Patents: use a combination of two international tech­
nological classification schemes, the International
Patent Classification (IPC) and the Cooperative Patent
Classification (CPC) codes, and keywords to arrive
at crop-specific agricultural biotechnology (see
Technical Notes for the complete list of codes and
keywords used in the search strategy). The cate­
gories for crop patents include: (i) crops’ genetic
improvement; (ii) pest control in crops; (iii) soil fertil­
ity; and (iv) climate change.
Scientific publication: use a combination of wellknown top journals in agricultural biotechnology,
combined with relevant plant biotechnology-specific
keywords (see Technical Notes for details).
Step 2: Geocoding the addresses of inventors
and authors
The addresses of authors of patented inventions
and scientific articles related to plant biotechnol­
ogy are geocoded and mapped. Inventors’ resident
addresses, as listed in the patented documents, are
used, while for scientific publication, the authors’
addresses are usually not disclosed. Instead, the
location of the authors’ affiliation is employed.
Step 3: Differentiating between national and
international clusters
Once the location of both patented inventions and
scientific publications are mapped out, two differ­
ent thresholds are used to identify international and
national clusters. For international clusters, only
foreign-oriented patent families are considered,
in combination with published scientific articles.
These patents must be either filed in an IP office
different from the applicant’s residence or in at least
one foreign IP office, for example, at a national IP
office and a foreign IP office. Patents filed at an
international patent office, such as the European
Patent Office or through the Patent Cooperation
Treaty (PCT), are also considered as foreign-oriented
patent families.

Plant biotechnology – connecting urban innovation and rural application

For national clusters, all patent families, along with
scientific publication, are used. The patent families
include singletons, which are patents filed in the
same IP office as the applicant’s residence and
nowhere else.
Classification as an international cluster is based
on a global threshold combining foreign-oriented
patents and scientific publication. National clusters
are based only on a country-specific threshold.
Therefore, international clusters differ from national
clusters in two main ways. First, international clusters
are calculated by only considering foreign-oriented
patent families. National clusters, by contrast, are
based on all patents filed by the residents of a coun­
try, including both singletons and foreign-oriented
patents. Second, the threshold criterion determined
at the international level is based on the average
volume of patents and scientific articles attributed
to one region, across the globe. The threshold at the
national level is measured by the average volume of
patents and scientific publication attributed to one
region in a country.
Only the international clusters are comparable
across countries.
Note: See Box 2.1 and Box 2.2 of Chapter 2. See also the glossary
list in the annex of WIPO (2018).

For many developing economies, the relevant inter­
national and national clusters of plant biotechnol­
ogy are close to their respective NARS, which tend
to be located in farming areas. The CIMMYT in
Texcoco is approximately one hour away from Mexico
City, while Buenos Aires is home to the National
Agricultural Technology Institute (INTA) of Argentina.
The International Crops Research Institute for the
Semi-Arid Tropics, a CGIAR institute, is located in
Patancheru, close to Hyderabad, in India, while the
IRRI in Los Baños, the Philippines, is around one hour
from Dasmarinas City. In Brazil, the national clusters
coincide with the locations of EMBRAPA centers. All
of these NARS are within a 50-km radius of national
crop biotechnology clusters.

The presence of these agricultural institutions is likely
to create regional ecosystems that are conducive to
startups as well as R&D facilities of companies in the
industry. Samad and Graff (2020) show that the single
most important determinant of the number of inven­
tions to come from a given region is the number of
inventions that have come from that region in the past.

Second, as noted, most of the international plant
biotechnology clusters are concentrated in metro­
politan areas. Figure 4.7 plots the location of these
international clusters alongside global innovation

Patents are territorial in nature.
This means that a patent granted
in one country or jurisdiction
is not necessarily enforceable
in another. Inventors who want
to ensure that their invention is
protected from imitation across
countries would have to file
patent applications for the same
invention in those jurisdictions.

Plant biotechnology – connecting urban innovation and rural application

See International Potato
Center (1995).
Co-applications refer to patent
applications where there are at
least two listed applicants on
the document.
It is plausible that there are
more regions that should be
included rather than those
displayed in this chapter. In other
words, the regions covered
by scientific publication may
be an underestimate. This is
because identifying articles on
plant biotechnology is sensitive
to the method used. Here it is
based on the top journals in plant
biotechnology. Other journals
that are not as well known, but
which may have equally relevant

contributions, are excluded.

Policy perspectives:
the case for openness

Innovation has always spanned countries and
continents. At the turn of the 20th century,
the Wright brothers in the United States of
America (U.S.) and Alberto Santos-Dumont
in Brazil invented the first airplanes to fly
successfully. Yet, the development of the modern
airplane owes much to scientific advances in
Europe that explained why heavier-than-air
machines could fly.1 The development and
dissemination of the agricultural technologies
that unleashed the green revolution after the
Second World War relied on partnerships
between the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations
in the U.S. and a large number of agricultural
research institutes in developing economies.2
Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide
Web at the European Organization for Nuclear
Research (CERN) – a research consortium on the
Franco–Swiss border sponsored by 23 (mostly)
European countries.3

As documented in this report, innovation today is
both highly localized and international at the same
time. Different agglomeration forces have favored the
formation of innovation hotspots that typically fall within
large metropolitan regions. A limited set of hotspots
lead the way and are at the center of global innovation
networks. Various formal and informal links connect the
nodes of these networks, with multinational companies
playing a key role within them. Evidence from patent
and scientific publication records suggests that the
cross-border dimension of these links has increased
over the past decades.
The growing internationalization of innovation owes
much to technology itself. Advances in information
and communication technologies (ICTs), in particular,
have fueled the flow of knowledge over long distances.
Crucially, however, the growth of global innovation
networks has relied on policies favoring openness
and international cooperation. Such an environment
of openness and cooperation should not be taken
for granted – especially, as public perceptions have
become more skeptical as to the benefits of globaliza­
tion in general in recent years.
This closing chapter therefore reviews the case for
openness in the pursuit of innovation. It does so primar­
ily from an economic perspective. At times, whether
and how to partner with foreign innovators involves
questions of national security, which go beyond the
scope of the chapter’s discussion.

5.1

The economics of openness

Openness of national innovation systems entails the
free exchange of knowledge between economies.
Knowledge may flow across borders when research­
ers communicate with each other, or when they read
scientific journals and patent documents published
abroad. It may also occur through international trade,
when knowledge is embedded in goods and services;
and it may occur through migration, when it is embed­
ded in people.

113

World Intellectual Property Report 2019

How do restrictions on the international flow of knowl­
edge affect national economies and the world as a
whole? The answer depends crucially on which knowl­
edge flows the restrictions target, the capabilities of
national innovation systems, patterns of production
and employment, and the nature of the economic
growth process. While not offering a definite conclu­
sion, the economic literature offers some guidance on
the effects of knowledge flow restrictions, which this
section strives to summarize.

Gains from specialization
One simplified way to approach the question is to view
knowledge like any other good. Just as the production
of cars requires capital and labor inputs, so does the
production of new knowledge through innovation.
Restricting international knowledge flows then affects
how economies allocate resources toward different
production activities. Viewed this way, the traditional
predictions of international trade theory apply. Above
all, openness leads to production and trade patterns
that allow economies to specialize based on their
comparative advantage. Trade economists usually
consider two forces that give rise to specialization:4
• Differences in factor endowments. An economy
richly endowed with capital will specialize in and
export goods that are capital-intensive to produce.
Conversely, an economy richly endowed with labor
will specialize in and export goods that are laborintensive to produce.
• Differentiated varieties and economies of scale.
Where goods come in differentiated varieties – say,
different car brands – and production of those
varieties entails economies of scale, economies
will specialize in and export some varieties and
import others.
These predictions can shed light on important facets
of the global geography of innovation. Innovation
requires highly skilled labor, which explains why most
innovative activity takes place in high-income countries
where such labor is relatively abundant. At the same
time, the decision by multinational companies to locate
some research and development (R&D) activities in
certain developing economies, such as China and
India, reflects the availability of highly skilled labor at
lower wages – fully in line with patterns of compara­
tive advantage.5
114

The notion of differentiated varieties, in turn, finds its
equivalence in the specialization of different innovation
clusters around the world. For example, there are many
innovation clusters focusing on medical technology,
with each offering specialized knowledge not avail­
able elsewhere. This generates bidirectional knowl­
edge flows, even among otherwise similar economies.
Global innovation networks act as a broker for such
knowledge flows.
Trade theory holds that there are mutual gains from
comparative advantage-based trade. These gains
take the form of increased economic efficiency and
a wider variety of goods available to businesses and
end-consumers. Given the highly specialized nature of
innovative output, the variety effect seems particularly
important to knowledge trade.
Notwithstanding these mutual gains, trade theory
also holds that open trade affects the distribution of
incomes within economies. Such distributional effects
are stronger if differences in capital and labor endow­
ments give rise to international trade. In other words,
they are more important for trade between dissimilar
economies – notably between economies at different
levels of development. As will be further discussed
below, these distributional effects matter for policy.

Innovation as a global public good
Viewing knowledge like any other good helps explain
important aspects of the global innovation landscape.
However, it is a highly simplified view that fails to
account for the unique characteristics of knowledge
production and knowledge consumption.
Above all, knowledge has attributes of what economists
refer to as a public good: many people can use it at the
same time, without diminishing the use of the knowl­
edge by those who produce it.6 For example, the basic
science behind artificial intelligence emerged from a
limited number of scientific organizations, yet a large
number of innovations employ this science for a wide
variety of applications around the world.7
In practice, there are limits to how widely knowledge
can be shared. In fact, a central tenet of economic
geography research is that knowledge does not flow
freely within and across economies; knowledge flows
have distinctive geographical patterns and biases.8 One
reason is that absorbing and applying cutting-edge

5

knowledge often requires highly specialized skills
that are in scarce supply.9 Moreover, for some forms
of knowledge to flow, human interaction is required,
which is precisely a key reason for innovative activity
to agglomerate (see Chapter 1).10
Yet, to the extent that knowledge lives up to its public
good potential, does this change the case for open­
ness? In fact, it strengthens it. If knowledge outflows
generate economic benefits abroad without diminishing
the use of knowledge at home, there are bound to be
mutual gains from openness.

Innovation and growth
Innovation differs in another important way from other
goods produced in the economy. Through innova­
tion, companies can create a competitive edge over
their rivals. A successful innovator can gain market
share at the expense of a company that fails to be
cutting-edge. Competition based on innovation, in
turn, drives productivity enhancements and long-term
economic growth.
As companies compete on the global stage, commen­
tators have applied the same logic to economies as a
whole. Accordingly, those economies that are success­
ful at innovating grow faster at the expense of econo­
mies that do not innovate successfully.11 In such a zerosum world, restricting knowledge outflows would help
economies retain an innovative edge and avoid “falling
behind” other successfully innovating economies.
At the outset, the international economics literature
would dismiss such “simplistic” zero-sum scenarios.
Economies as a whole differ from companies in impor­
tant ways. For one, economies as a whole cannot go
bankrupt. If companies in a particular sector exit the
market or lose market share due to foreign competition,
they free up labor and capital that can be deployed
elsewhere in the economy.
The reverse happens in sectors gaining international
market share – they attract labor and capital from else­
where in the economy. In addition, faster productivity
growth in successfully innovating economies enlarges
their size and increases demand for foreign products.
Overall, innovation leads to adjustments in prices,
wages and exchange rates, which prompt shifts in
production and trade patterns. Clearly, economies

Policy perspectives: the case for openness

that are successful at innovating will, in the long term,
experience faster overall economic growth than those
that fail to do so. However, this does not necessar­
ily mean that one economy’s success constrains
another economy from being equally success­
ful. In fact, the public good nature of knowledge
suggests that innovation can contribute to productivity
growth everywhere.
Notwithstanding this general optimism, as national
innovation performance shapes patterns of production
and trade, it is conceivable for one economy to end up
specializing in activities that put it on a permanently
faster or slower growth path. Strategically restricting
trade and knowledge flows could then tilt production
patterns in such a way as to favor faster growth at
home. Box 5.1 summarizes theoretical research that
identifies the conditions in which such “zero-sum”
outcomes can arise.
Whether such conditions prevail in practice is ulti­
mately an empirical question. Rigorously answering it
is not easy, given that one does not know how differ­
ent economies would fare under different trade and
knowledge-flow policies. However, one can look at the
actual growth experience of economies around the
world over the past decades. One important pattern is
that today’s high-income economies have experienced
remarkably similar growth over the past 40 years.
Before 1980, per capita incomes of poorer high-income
economies saw faster growth than those of richer highincome economies. But this convergence process
eventually slowed (Figure 5.1). While differences in per
capita incomes persist, the most advanced economies
have grown largely at a similar pace since the 1990s
(Figure 5.2). This may suggest that new technologies
have spread seamlessly across the set of economies
already at the technology frontier and they have stimu­
lated growth in comparable magnitudes.
Beyond the group of high-income economies, the
growth experience has been mixed. For a long time,
incomes across the world diverged.12 In 1870, the
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of the richest
economy was around 10 times that of the poorest one;
by 2008 this gap had widened to a factor of 126.13 For
a very long time, poorer economies did not grow any
faster than richer ones. More recent data – starting
from the 1990s – suggest a reversal of this trend, with
incomes converging across economies. In other words,
since the 1990s, poorer economies have, on average,
grown faster than richer ones.14

Box 5.1 Theoretical foundations of
strategic trade policy
A branch of trade theory in the 1980s and early 1990s
was devoted to analyzing the circumstances in which
departures from free-trade policies may be welfare
enhancing. Many underlying models focused on
imperfectly competitive markets and trade policies
that might increase the share of excess economic
profits flowing to the domestic economies.15 Some
more complex theories also accounted for the
role of innovation in driving long-term growth. The
book by Gene Grossman and Elhanan Helpman
(1991) provides the most detailed treatment of these
latter theories.
In relevant models, firms invest in R&D with the
prospect of reaping economic rents in imperfectly
competitive product markets. Competitive market
forces, in turn, sustain incentives to continuously
invest in R&D, thereby generating the productivity
gains that sustain growth in the long run. Mindful
that companies compete in a global arena, the
models then analyze the interdependence of growth
processes in different countries.
The predictions stemming from these models
confirm, first of all, the general optimism expressed
in the text: global interactions generate forces that
accelerate growth in every country. But they also
point to reasons why this may not always be the
case. For example:
• Suppose that an economy has a comparative
disadvantage in research due to limited highskilled labor. Integration with the rest of the world
could then lead it to specialize in more stagnant
activities, with overall output growing more slowly.
• Suppose that knowledge does not easily flow
across borders, because it is difficult to reverse
engineer or it requires critical skills not available
in recipient countries, as described in the text.
Integration may then lead economies that are
small in size – or that historically have conducted
little research – to specialize in manufacturing
activities, preventing the onset of innovative
activity. In fact, small differences in initial condi­
tions between economies can lead to perpetual
differences in productivity growth.

116

In the presence of such forces, strategic trade
and related policies could well reshape patterns of
production and alter an economy’s growth path. In
practice, successfully implementing such policies is
difficult. The choice of policy instruments depends
critically on initial conditions, the evolving nature of
competition and technological opportunities. Given
that the future path of technology and its implica­
tions for markets are highly uncertain, choosing
the right policy mix in a forward-looking way is a
formidable challenge.

Notwithstanding this trend reversal, average conver­
gence does not mean universal or automatic conver­
gence. Some poorer economies have been more
successful at catching up to the richer ones than
others. Developing countries in East Asia and, more
recently, India, have been particularly successful
at doing so. Given their central role in the growth
process, knowledge flows and innovation must be
part of the explanation behind these trends. However,
which precise structural forces and economic policies
have favored catch-up growth remains the subject of
considerable debate.16 A pessimistic view is that the
historical concentration of innovative activities in a
limited set of economies and the strong agglomera­
tion forces associated with such activities reinforce a
global core–periphery division. Even if policies do not
restrict knowledge flows, this division fosters diverg­
ing development paths. A more optimistic view is that
innovation eventually spreads beyond the core group
of innovators; with the right policies, economies in the
periphery can absorb foreign knowledge and catch up.
In conclusion, the economic literature offers good
reasons why openness is bound to be beneficial in
the pursuit of innovation. Theoretically, there may
well be circumstances in which strategic restrictions
on trade and knowledge flows could alter the growth
paths of economies. However, it is difficult to trans­
late this theoretical possibility into concrete policy
proposals. As pointed out in Box 5.1, adopting the
right policy instruments in a forward-looking way is
a formidable challenge. Practically, it may be difficult
to prevent knowledge from flowing abroad, without at
the same time restricting knowledge circulating within
economies. In addition, one economy’s policy choices
may prompt policy responses from other economies.

The case for openness becomes even stronger when
the context in which innovation takes
place today. Continuously pushing the technological

suggests that achieving the same level of technological

effort. For example, Gordon Moore – the co-founder

cal R&D to achieve similar increases in life expectancy
as in the past; investments in agricultural R&D have
grown more rapidly than increases in agricultural crop
yields.18 More generally, most high-income economies
have seen a gradual decline in the growth of economic
productivity over the last half century. Economist
Robert Gordon has prominently attributed this decline
to innovations of the recent past boosting productivity
growth by less than innovations of the more distant
past.19 In particular, he argues that the innovations asso­
ciated with the second industrial revolution supported
fast productivity growth in high-income economies
until the 1970s; the innovations associated with the
third (digital) industrial revolution have not been able
to sustain such fast productivity growth.
Policies cannot alter opportunities for technological
progress. However, policies shape to what extent those
opportunities are realized. They determine how much
resources are invested in R&D, how R&D is performed
and how innovations find their way into the economy.
Falling R&D productivity calls for constantly increasing
investments in innovation – both scientific research and
applied R&D. It also calls for collaboration and open­
ness. Finding solutions to increasingly complex techno­
logical problems requires larger teams of researchers
117

(see Chapter 2) and greater specialization in research.
Openness and international collaboration promote
such specialization and can thus help slow declining
R&D productivity.

and the Hague System – facilitate the acquisition of IP
rights in many countries by filing a single international
application; the ultimate grant of IP rights remains a
national decision.

For openness to work, policymakers need to go beyond
simply dismantling border barriers. There is an impor­
tant role for international cooperation to support open­
ness. Equally important, policymakers need to address
regional imbalances that openness may partly foster.
The final part of this chapter looks at these two criti­
cal dimensions.

Finally, governments can pool resources and fund
large-scale scientific projects that go beyond the
envelopes of national budgets or require technical
knowledge available in different countries. CERN –
mentioned at the outset of this chapter – is a good
example of such cooperation. The International Space
Station is another one. It is a joint project between the
national space agencies of Canada, Japan, the Russian
Federation and the U.S., as well as the European Space
Agency. Launched in 1998, it has hosted more than 200
visitors from 18 different countries.20

Fostering international cooperation
International cooperation in relation to innovation has
many dimensions. An important one is to promote
incentives for innovation investments that reflect the
demands and size of the global economy. Setting
international rules for the protection of intellectual
property (IP) rights serves this purpose. In practice,
international treaties on IP typically establish the prin­
ciple of nondiscrimination, namely that national laws
treat domestic and foreign IP owners equally. They
also set certain standards for the protection of differ­
ent types of IP – for example, which inventions should
be eligible for patent protection or how long copyright
should last. At the same time, these standards do not
fully harmonize IP protection across the world and
leave room for national policies to tailor IP protection
to national needs.
A second important dimension is to promote the ease
of doing business internationally. Innovating compa­
nies and knowledge workers face a variety of regula­
tory measures when operating in markets around the
world. Promoting the compatibility of national regula­
tory systems can help reduce the costs of regulatory
compliance. For instance, some level of recognition of
foreign regulatory standards can reduce the wasteful
duplication of product testing and associated paper­
work, without necessarily compromising regulatory
objectives. Recognition of foreign qualifications in line
with domestic standards can help facilitate the interna­
tional mobility of knowledge workers. Regular dialogues
between national regulatory agencies underpin such
recognition frameworks. Similarly, setting technical
standards at the international level can avoid the costly
adaptation of products to different markets. In the area
of IP, WIPO’s international filing treaties – in particular,
the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the Madrid System
118

Addressing regional imbalances
As discussed in Chapter 1, one worrying trend of
the past few decades is the increasing inter-regional
polarization of incomes, innovative activity, high-skilled
employment and wages within countries. Up to the
1980s, most high-income economies saw a steady
convergence of incomes across regions.21 Poor regions
of countries caught up with rich ones. Since then, interregional convergence has slowed and, in some cases, it
has even reversed. In the U.S., the convergence process
slowed markedly starting in the 1990s.22 European
economies have similarly seen slowing regional conver­
gence and, since the onset of the great recession in
2008, outright divergence. A few “champion” regions
within European economies with already high levels
of income have seen substantially faster growth than
many of the poorer regions.23
There are many reasons for the polarization of econom­
ic activities within countries. The declining impor­
tance of agriculture and mining activities in economic
output has long favored a gravitational pull toward big
cities. In a knowledge-based and services-dominated
economy, businesses have strong incentives to locate
within large metropolitan areas. Openness arguably
strengthens the gravitational pull toward champion
regions. The most vibrant innovation hotspots, which
are embedded in global innovation networks, tend to
be located in what already are the richest metropolitan
agglomerations within countries. Their international
success reinforces their domestic lead. As described
in Chapter 1, successful innovation agglomerations
may also see diverging incomes within them, with

5

fast growth of high-skilled jobs placing pressure on
disposable income in low-skilled occupations. Israel
offers a good example of how burgeoning innovation
activities have raised concerns about a dual track
economy (see Box 5.2).
Addressing such rising regional imbalances is one of
the most difficult challenges for policymakers. Trying
to reverse the gravitational pull of successful regions
may be neither feasible nor desirable. Restricting
participation in global innovation networks, in particu­
lar, would undercut an economy’s ability to generate
cutting-edge innovations. In any case, openness is but
one contributing factor to regional imbalances.24 The
long-term structural transformation of economic activity
is arguably the fundamental driving force behind such
imbalances. Internal migration from lagging to thriving
regions only offers a partial solution to regional diver­
gence. Individuals may not have the capacity or willing­
ness to move. High housing prices in thriving regions
alone pose a significant barrier to internal migration.25
Policy can play an important role in supporting regions
whose fortunes have fallen behind. Development
support for weaker regions has, of course, a long
history, with mixed success. A full review of historical
policy initiatives is beyond the scope of this report.
Nonetheless, recent research points to a few consid­
erations that are important when designing regional
support policies:26
• Ideally, regional development strategies should seek
to build on existing capabilities and advantages
of regions and aim at amplifying them through
investments in infrastructure, education and tech­
nology. Existing capabilities and advantages can
take the form of relatively cheap land and labor
and prevailing industrial capabilities, as well as
reputational assets.
• Policy formulation should identify the key barriers
toward growing existing capabilities and rely on the
input of all relevant local stakeholders.
• Resulting development policies should undergo
regular evaluation. The resulting evidence should
guide the adaptation of future policies.
While not reversing the gravitational pull of successful
regions, such policies can ensure that innovation-driven
growth benefits economies as a whole. As such, they
critically underpin the openness of national innova­
tion systems.

Policy perspectives: the case for openness

Box 5.2 Israel’s thriving innovation system:
startup nation or startup region?
Israel has a thriving innovation economy. Relative to
the size of its GDP, no other country spends more on
R&D and attracts more venture capital investments.
Most of the world’s leading technology companies
have established R&D centers in Israel to draw on
the skills and experience available in the country’s
dynamic research community. In many fields –
notably cybersecurity – Israeli companies set the
trend. Its lively startup scene has earned Israel the
nickname “Startup Nation.”
Israel’s vibrant innovation economy has been a
key driving force behind the growth of the overall
economy. From 2008 to 2018, Israel’s economy
grew by an average annual rate of 3.5 percent –
again, far surpassing most developed economies.27
Unemployment fell to a record low of 4 percent
in 2018.28
Yet, the nickname masks the high geographical
concentration of innovation activity in Israel. The
Tel Aviv metropolitan area stands out as the clear
champion region. It accounts for 77 percent of all
startups and 60 percent of all high-tech jobs.29 It
hosts more than half of Israel’s inventors listed in
patent applications (see Figure 5.3).
Wages in the peripheral regions are around 35
percent lower than in Central Israel. Tel Aviv’s domi­
nance has even intensified in recent years. The region
was responsible for more than two-thirds of the
growth in high-tech employees between 2015 and
2017.30 Tel Aviv is also highly connected to leading
innovation hotspots around the world, offering, for
example, nonstop flights to San Francisco.
As in other global innovation hotspots, Tel Aviv has
seen rising concerns that the expansion of technol­
ogy companies is driving up housing prices and
widening income disparities.31
The Government of Israel recognizes that the gravi­
tational pull of the Tel Aviv region reflects relative
regional advantages and natural agglomeration
forces. Yet it also realizes that this regional imbal­
ance creates economic and social challenges. As
a result, Israel’s Innovation Authority has adopted
a Strategy for an Innovation-Driven Economy in
the Periphery.
119

World Intellectual Property Report 2019

This strategy has four central pillars:32
• Connecting human capital in the periphery to
leading high-tech companies;
• Promoting technological innovation in the
periphery in the manufacturing, agriculture and
food sectors;
• Encouraging entrepreneurship that draws on local
academic institutions and other sources of homegrown knowledge and industrial expertise; and
• Strengthening the high-tech ecosystem in
those regions – namely, Haifa, Jerusalem and
Beersheba – that have the essential foundations
for such an ecosystem.

The greater Tel Aviv area hosts
most of Israel’s inventors
Figure 5.3 Heat map of inventors listed
in patent applications, 2008–2018

These pillars seek both to reduce a growing shortage
of high-skilled workers in the innovation economy
and to promote the development of regions that
currently are lagging to produce more balanced
national growth.

Geocoding
The geocoding – i.e., attributing the latitude and longi­
tude to a given location – of the scientific publication
and patent data was performed using all available
information on addresses and already existing geocod­
ing exercises for these data.
In the case of scientific publications, the report assumes
that research conducted for any publication takes
place at the institutions and organizations to which the
authors declare their affiliation. Ninety-seven percent of
all the available affiliation addresses were geocoded at
the postal code or sub-city level. In the case of authors
with more than one affiliation in the same publication,
all different addresses were considered.

areas to be used in place of administrative ones (see
Ester et al., 1996). A first set – named global innovation
hotspots (GIHs) – captures the most innovation-dense
geographical areas of the world in terms of scientific
articles or patent families per square kilometer (km).
By definition, these areas are internationally compa­
rable and geographically distinct. The same scientific
publication or patent density determines the same
hotspot anywhere in the world, although the threshold
is different for scientific publication and patent data.
No patent or scientific publication address can be in
two hotspots at the same time.
A second set, named specialized niche clusters (SNCs),
was created to avoid biases arising from some scientific
or technological fields being overrepresented in the
scientific publication and patent data, respectively. The
SNCs capture areas with high innovation density in one
or more specific scientific publication or patenting fields,
and that otherwise have not met the criteria to be a
global innovation hotspot (GIH). The resulting clusters
are also distinct geographical areas, as the overlapping
clusters for different fields are consolidated into one
cluster. But they are only internationally comparable
within their specific scientific or technological field
(or fields).

In the case of patents, 87 percent of the international
patent families filed from 1976 to 2015 were geocod­
ed. Most of the non-geocoded cases had no usable
address information. As far as possible, the geocod­
ing was applied to the inventors’ addresses by using
the most complete and reliable data source available
within each patent family. In addition, the data were
enriched with exiting geocoded patent data (see Yin
and Motohashi, 2018; Ikeuchi et al., 2017; Li et al., 2014;
de Rassenfosse et al., 2019; Morrison et al., 2017). All
these sources and WIPO’s geocoding were analyzed
and consolidated to get the best possible geocoded As a result, the report identifies 174 GIHs and 313 SNCs
