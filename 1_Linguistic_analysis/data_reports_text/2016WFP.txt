THE YEAR IN REVIEW 2016
YOU TRUSTED US.
WE DELIVERED.

The year 2016 saw great achievements,
but also intense strain – on our hearts
and on our finances. Our compassion
is boundless: in many parts of the globe,
it powered us through heart-breaking
crises. But our budgets, unfortunately,
are limited. Matching our funding to our
vision remains our long-term objective.
Even so, we received almost US$6
billion last year – an all-time record.
It is a humbling amount. It speaks to the
international community’s unshakeable
faith in WFP and its continued
dedication to helping those in need
So if you are a donor – government,
corporation, foundation or individual –
I thank you.

If you represent one of the nations
we operate in, I also thank you.
You worked with us to keep your
citizens fed and hopeful, often in the
face of overwhelming odds.
Finally, if you are a member of the
public, our journey is your journey.
Thank you for sharing our commitment
to achieving Zero Hunger by 2030.
Follow the publication to see how
in 2016, we continued to assist
millions amid conflict, disasters
and migration-related crises.
How we worked at the grassroots
to change lives. And how, through
it all, we delivered value for the
generous contributions we received.

Goal 2 – Zero Hunger – of the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is both a collective endeavour by the
international community and an individual commitment
by all national governments. By 2030, no one – woman,
man, girl or boy – should go hungry. The ambition is vast.
The task is monumental. And as the world’s leading body
dedicated to fighting hunger, our role – with partners
in government, sister UN agencies, NGOs and the private
sector – is crucial. The full Agenda 2030 alignment will
only take effect from 2017. But our 2016 results already
show progress against four of Goal 2’s targets:

(levels 2 and 3) in 2016

Countries where staff were
deployed in emergencies

Level 2 emergencies require regional WFP resources to be mobilized.
Level 3 emergencies require global resources.

As we look to the future, we continue to capitalize
on our strengths. In 2016, feeding hungry people in
emergencies remained the core of WFP’s engagement.
Even with record funding, overlapping crises
– conflict, drought and record numbers of refugees
and displaced people – meant we had our
work cut out.
In some of the world’s most insecure places,
we saved life after life. But with global challenges
continuing at this level, resources will need to be vastly
increased and diversified for WFP to go on delivering.

SYRIA
In 2016, Syria entered its sixth year of conflict.
By now, the fighting has gone on longer than
World War II. Diplomatic initiatives have come
and gone. Meanwhile, half of all Syrians have
been forced out of their homes or out of
their country.

Livelihoods have been
crushed. Development has
been knocked back decades.
Syrians requiring humanitarian assistance
outnumber those who do not. Inside and
outside the nation’s borders, from debit cards
for refugees in Turkey to air drops in the
besieged city of Deir-Ezzor, WFP used every
means at its disposal to keep Syrians alive.

Yemen’s conflict has further exhausted what
was already one of the Arab world’s least
developed economies. Society has been
ripped apart. Hunger has spread to affect
some two-thirds of the population.

Many have been plunged
into extreme hardship.
Availability of the next meal
is a matter of luck.
The impact on children, in particular, has
been devastating; malnutrition has soared.
Throughout 2016, WFP worked hard to reach
millions of Yemenis in desperate need, while
advocating for peace and safe access.

IRAQ
Large parts of Iraq’s territory remained gripped
by instability and conflict in 2016. In October,
the offensive to recapture Mosul piled further
financial pressure on a WFP operation which
was already feeding hundreds of thousands of
people.

"Having a proper meal was
something we hadn’t thought
was possible again."
The words belong to Samba. She had been
keeping her child alive on bread and water,
plus the odd sip of tea, when she came to
us. Once the offensive began, life-saving food
was provided as soon as families displaced by
fighting reached safe areas.

NIGERIA
Although 2016 saw Boko Haram expelled
from many parts of north-eastern Nigeria, the
insurgency continues to pose an existential
threat. In 2016, nearly two million displaced
people, often survivors of extreme violence,
were still unable to go home. Many more
struggled to feed themselves.

A number of areas remained
highly dangerous. Some were
entirely cut off, and likely saw
famine or near-famine.
WFP used a mix of in-kind food and cash
payments to assist hungry Nigerians wherever
possible and developed a land-and-air Rapid
Response Mechanism for flash humanitarian
incursions into unstable areas.

Ranked the world’s most fragile state
– as well as its newest – South Sudan has been
plagued by civil conflict for four of its six years
of independence. Political and inter-communal
tensions fuel continued violence.

The fighting has killed
and uprooted many, wiped
out crops, destroyed markets
and created the premise
for famine.
In 2016, WFP staff braved severe insecurity
to assist South Sudan’s hard -pressed citizens–
often by means of the humanitarian air service
we manage, UNHAS.

In 2016, a virulent episode of El Niño brought

Poor or failed crops left millions facing hunger
in Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique,
Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Through concerted action
and despite tight funding,
WFP and partners staved
off famine in the region.
In southern Madagascar, many residents
had been reduced to eating cactus fruit to
survive. In hardest-hit Malawi, WFP launched
the country’s largest humanitarian
operation to date.

CHANGING
LIVES IN
A CHANGING
WORLD

Recent years have felt intensely
transitional: a resurgence of
conflict and instability has
coincided with a great reduction
in extreme poverty.
But aggregates only tell half the
story. Inclusive progress is to be
measured by the extent to which
all lives are unshackled from
poverty and hunger.
In 2016 – perhaps more than
ever before – we concentrated
on the last mile: a dedication
to ensuring that each person
and family actually has food
on the table.

SCHOOL MEALS
In poor countries, school meals are often the
only hot food a child will get. Good nutrition in childhood
translates into better school attendance, higher grades,
stronger industrial productivity and less pressure on health
systems. WFP research has established that every year African
countries lose as much as 16.5 percent of potential GDP
to child malnutrition. Both a social safety net and
a development trigger, school meals change the lives
of individuals, families, communities and nations.

CASH TO BUY FOOD
In 2016 we pursued a trend towards giving people cash
to buy their own food. Cash offers greater choice
and access to a more diversified diet. It also stimulates local
trade and services. Last year saw WFP act as the largest
cash provider in the humanitarian community.
As well as growing significantly in 2016, both in overall
volume and as share of WFP’s portfolio, cash benefits
increasingly took the form of mobile credit or
electronic vouchers.

RESILIENCE AND RISK REDUCTION
One of WFP’s aims is not to assist the same people year in, year
out. Emergency work aside, we are digging the foundations
today that will avert crises tomorrow. We offer food incentives
for communities to build or repair long-lasting assets – schools,
roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure. We try to factor
into our projects the inevitability of more frequent droughts,
floods and other natural disasters. And we work to climate-proof
farming practices and food production systems.

CAPACITY BUILDING
If we are serious about not having to assist the same people
year in, year out, we must reduce their dependency on
external assistance. Our various resilience projects help. But
we also work with governments to enable them, over time,
to meet their citizens’ food and nutrition needs themselves.
In 2016, we shared vast amounts of skills, competences and
technical capabilities – and continued to tailor our offer to
different national contexts and food systems.

FEEDING DREAMS:
A FUTURE WITHOUT
HUNGER

Keeping people alive
is essential but not enough.
WFP also empowers individuals
and communities to live healthy
and productive lives. At stake is
their ability to make choices
for themselves and contribute
to the prosperity of their nations.
For everyone to have a fair
chance, we must lift first
those furthest behind, ensure
assistance reaches people fast,
and harness technology
to support the widest possible
access to food.

EMPOWERING WOMEN AND GIRLS
Discrimination against women and girls means that in many
places, they are the last to eat. It may be that they cannot own
land. Or that despite their traditional role in handling food,
cultural norms deny them a say. Or else that the lion’s share
of resources is reserved for men and boys. Or even that the
process of obtaining, say, firewood for cooking may expose
women and girls to sexual violence. Whatever the roots of this
imbalance, WFP systematically works to redress it and places
gender concerns at the heart of its work.

EARLIER AVAILABILITY OF FOOD
Donors’ pledges often take a while to process.
But hunger does not wait. It does not move in tandem
with budgets. Nor does malnutrition: with every day lost
in fighting it, repercussions worsen over time. For WFP,
prompt intervention is a constant pursuit. Whether we have
the cash in hand or not, we must act fast. By 2016, advanced
financing tools allowed us to deliver the food nearly
two months ahead of the funds being cleared.

INNOVATING AGAINST HUNGER
Ending hunger by 2030 is a vision to inspire a
generation. But this vision will not come to life if the
world limits itself to tried and tested methods.
This is why WFP has set out on a path of constant
renewal. Last year saw a large expansion of our
new SCOPE platform – an end-to-end digital system
that matches the bio-data of people we assist with
the benefits they receive.

Accelerator in 2016

Innovative projects selected
and set in motion

In mid-2016, WFP’s Innovation Accelerator opened
in Munich, aiming to generate and scale
up anti-hunger solutions. It has already given birth to
projects such as hydroponic (or soilless) agriculture
in the deserts of Algeria, Jordan and Peru, or the use
of cutting-edge block chain technology for cash transfers.
By 2017, WFP had linked up with Silicon Valley’s
tech community to crowdsource “moonshot”
(or groundbreaking) pathways to Zero Hunger.

Preparedness
Activities

Emergency operations (EMOPs)
provide immediate assistance. When there is an
emergency WFP quickly establishes how much food
assistance is needed and the best way to deliver it to
the hungry.
Protracted relief and recovery operations (PRROs) rebuild
after an emergency. A protracted crisis disrupts food production
and destroys the foundations of people's livelihoods, eroding the
social fabric of families and communities.
Development operations (DEVs) and Country Programmes (CP) improve
food security for communities. WFP development food aid helps the hungry
escape from the poverty trap.
Special operations (SOs) create the speciﬁc infrastructure needed for Emergency
Operations. WFP draws up Special Operations to speed up the movement of food aid,
regardless of whether the food is provided by the Agency itself.
Preparedness Activities are conducted by WFP with a view to strengthening capacities and
enhancing readiness, appropriateness and eﬀectiveness of a timely response.
