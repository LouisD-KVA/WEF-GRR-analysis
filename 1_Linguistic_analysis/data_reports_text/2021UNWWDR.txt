Foreword
by Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO

What is water worth? There is no easy answer to this deceptively simple question. On the one hand, water is infinitely valuable
– without it, life would not exist. On the other, water is taken for granted – it is wasted every single day.
According to economic theory, the value of a good is determined by scarcity – the gap between limited resources and unlimited
needs. Humans certainly use water as if it was limitless: an estimated 80% of all industrial and municipal wastewater, for
example, is released into the environment without prior treatment.
But fresh water is in fact scarce, and becoming scarcer. Over 2 billion people already live in areas subject to water stress. Some
3.4 billion people, 45% of the global population, lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities. According to independent
assessments, the world will face a global water deficit of 40% by 2030. This situation will be worsened by global challenges
such as COVID-19 and climate change.
More importantly, economic theory is not the only way of determining worth. Cultural values are equally, if not more, significant.
Many indigenous peoples, for example, accord special status to water and waterways. This is the case in New Zealand, where
the Te Awa Tupua Act, passed in 2017, recognizes the Whanganui River as “an indivisible and living whole from the mountains
to the sea”. The Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, in India, are also considered living entities with the same rights as human beings.
For these groups, bodies of water are like loved ones, and therefore priceless.
How, then, should we value water? The 2021 World Water Development Report focuses on this crucial issue. It assesses the
ways water in which is valued across different sectors and identifies how this process can be improved, with a view to better
evaluating what water is worth to our societies.
As the Report underlines, there are few standardized approaches to the valuation of water, whether within or between sectors.
Moreover, these approaches do not always acknowledge the perspectives of different belief systems, cultures, genders and
scientific disciplines. Only by incorporating these viewpoints can we achieve more sustainable, inclusive, gender-responsive
and equitable decision-making processes – and take a step towards attaining Sustainable Development Goal 6, clean water
and sanitation for all.
This report, coordinated by UNESCO, was made possible thanks to the Government of Italy and the Regione Umbria, which have
long supported UNESCO’s World Water Assessment Programme. I wish to thank all those who participated in this common
endeavour, especially the UN-Water family for its close and continued collaboration. This publication recognises that water is
not a question of development, but also a basic human right. By working together, we can identify solutions to help us on our
way to a sustainable and prosperous world, without leaving anyone behind.
Because the fate of humans and water is inextricably linked. In the words of the Whanganui River tribe’s proverb, “Ko au te awa,
ko te awa ko au” – I am the river, the river is me.

Foreword
by Gilbert F. Houngbo, Chair of UN-Water and
President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development

Achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a moral imperative. We owe it to our children and to
future generations.
There is no life on earth without water. Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) calls for the availability and
sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Unless we reach SDG6, we risk failing to attain many of
the other Sustainable Development Goals, including those related to poverty reduction, food and nutrition, human
health, gender equality, energy, economic growth, sustainable cities and the environment. The devasting COVID-19
pandemic reminds us of the importance of access to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities, and that far too many
people are still without them.
The 2021 edition of the United Nations World Water Development Report focuses on valuing water. There is enough
water for all provided we use and manage it efficiently. But we don’t. We invest too little, and ineffectively. We use
too much water, creating scarcities. Quality is suffering and so is the environment.
The value we place on water varies, depending upon who is using it, and why. Value can be a guide to what our goals
should be, what actions are needed, and where we should invest. Many of our problems arise because we don’t value
water highly enough; all too often water is not valued at all.
The time has come for stakeholders to identify, articulate and share perspectives of the values of water.
This report explains various approaches to valuing water for environmental considerations, water-related
infrastructure, drinking water, sanitation and hygiene. It looks at valuation issues in food and agriculture, business,
industry, energy and financing. And it highlights the perspectives of different value systems and cultures, and
associated social and gender-based considerations.
I am grateful to UNESCO and its World Water Assessment Programme for coordinating the production of this report
and would like to thank UN-Water Members, Partners and other contributors for their important work.
I am confident that the report will facilitate a better appreciation of the values of water and accelerate our progress
towards the Sustainable Development Goals.

Preface
by Michela Miletto, UNESCO WWAP Coordinator
and Richard Connor, Editor-in-Chief

It has often been stated that water is undervalued, or that we somehow need to recognize the ‘true’ value of water in order
to make better decisions about how we protect, share and use it. But what does this really mean? Can the value of water be
measured? And if so, how? Who actually gets to determine water’s value? In other words, what is water worth – and to whom?
While these questions may appear clear and simple enough, the answers are anything but. The bottom line is that there
is no one ‘true’ value of water. Rather, water holds a myriad of values that can differ greatly based on where the water is
located, its level of abundance or scarcity, its quality, and its availability. Its values also depend upon the purpose it is used
for and the benefits generated by these uses.
Some values can be quantified and even monetized, such as when water is used as an input in specific industrial processes
or for irrigated agriculture, and expressed as a unit of production (or profit) per volume used. Yet, even across and within
different economic sectors, such metrics can easily fall short of providing a comprehensive ‘value’ for water. For example,
while food security is of vital importance to any household, community or nation, the value of water for food security is
rarely (if ever) factored in when assessing the value of water for agriculture.
The values of water to human well-being extend well beyond its role in supporting direct physical life-sustaining functions or
economies, and include mental health, spiritual well-being, emotional balance and happiness. The often-intangible nature
of these sociocultural values attributed to water regularly defies any attempt at quantification, but they can nevertheless
be regarded amongst the highest values.
Which leads us to the concept of ‘perception’. Even when water from the same source is used for the same purpose under
the same circumstances, its value can be perceived differently from one user to the next. Personal and sociocultural
differences often lay at the root of this, with variables such as gender, age, race, class, status, or even belief, playing a
determining role. The highly subjective nature of the concept of ‘value’ underscores the need to accommodate the different
perspectives of various stakeholders.
As the eighth in a series of annual, thematic reports, the 2021 edition of the United Nations World Water Development
Report (WWDR) examines the value of water across a broad range of water-related perspectives, ranging from water
resources, infrastructure, and supply and sanitation services, through to economic uses and cultural values. It offers
insights in the different methods for valuing water and provides guidance in how to use them.
The report presents a number of methodologies and approaches to valuing water across different use sectors and shows
how these tools have been applied to improve water management. It also describes how valuation can potentially lead to
better decision-making in terms of financing, governance, and knowledge and capacity-building.

viii

We have endeavoured to produce a balanced, fact-based and neutral account of the current state of knowledge, covering
the most recent developments, and highlighting the challenges and opportunities that a greater attention to valuing water
can provide. Although primarily targeted at policy- and decision-makers, water resources managers, academics, and the
broader development community, we hope that this report will also be useful to economists, social scientists, and those
who are engaged in the alleviation of poverty and humanitarian crises, in the pursuit of the human rights to water supply
and sanitation, and in the advancement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
This latest edition of the WWDR is the result of a concerted effort between the Chapter Lead Agencies: FAO, GWP, IHE Delft,
UNDP, UNESCO-IHP, UN-Habitat, UNIDO, WWAP and the World Bank, with regional perspectives provided by UNECE,
UNECLAC, UNESCAP, the UNESCO Office in Nairobi and UNESCWA. The report also greatly benefitted from the inputs and
contributions of several other UN-Water members and partners, as well as from numerous scientists, professionals and
NGOs who provided a wide range of relevant material.
On behalf of the WWAP Secretariat, we would like to extend our deepest appreciation to the afore-mentioned agencies,
members and partners of UN-Water, and to the writers and other contributors for collectively producing this unique and
authoritative report during the COVID-19 pandemic, with all the additional difficulties the situation has imposed on each
and all of us.
We are profoundly grateful to the Italian Government for funding the Programme and to the Regione Umbria for generously
hosting the WWAP Secretariat in Villa La Colombella in Perugia. Their contributions have been instrumental to the
production of the WWDR.
Our special thanks go to Ms Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO, for her ongoing support to WWAP and the
production of the WWDR, and to Mr Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD) and Chair of UN-Water.
We extend our most sincere gratitude to all our colleagues at the WWAP Secretariat, whose names are listed in the Team page.
The report could not have been completed without their professionalism and dedication.
We would like to thank the institutions who have graciously agreed to translate the WWDR into several different languages.
Their support and efforts to broaden the dissemination of the report are very much appreciated.
Last but not least, we dedicate this report to the front-line healthcare providers and essential service workers whose
tireless efforts allowed us to remain as safe as possible during the COVID-19 pandemic.

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

Perspectives, challenges and opportunities
The current status of water resources highlights the need for improved water resources
management. Recognizing, measuring and expressing water’s worth, and incorporating it into
decision-making, are fundamental to achieving sustainable and equitable water resources
management and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations’ 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Those who control how water is valued control how it is used. Values are a central aspect
of power and equity in water resources governance. The failure to fully value water in all its
different uses is considered a root cause, or a symptom, of the political neglect of water and
its mismanagement. All too often, the value of water, or its full suite of multiple values, is not

Executive summary

prominent in decision-making at all.
Whilst the term ‘value’ and the process of ‘valuation’ are well defined, there are several
different views and perspectives of what ‘value’ specifically means to various user groups and
stakeholders. There are also different methods for calculating value and different metrics to
express it.
Differences in the way water is valued occur not only between stakeholder groups but are
widespread within them. These divergent perspectives on water value and the best ways to
calculate and express it, coupled with limited knowledge of the actual resource, present a
challenging landscape for rapid improvements in valuing water. It is, for example, futile to
attempt to quantitatively compare the value of water for domestic use, the human right to water,
customary or religious beliefs, and the value of maintaining flows to preserve biodiversity. None
of these should be sacrificed for the sake of achieving consistent valuation methodologies.
Traditional economic accounting, often a key means of informing policy decisions, tends
to limit water values to the way that most other products are valued – using the recorded
price or costs of water when economic transactions occur. However, in the case of water,
there is no clear relationship between its price and its value. Where water is priced, meaning
consumers are charged for using it, the price often reflects attempts for cost recovery and not
value delivered. Yet, regarding valuation, economics remains a highly relevant, powerful and
influential science, even though its application needs to be made more comprehensive.
Nevertheless, the different values of water need to be reconciled, and the trade-offs between
them resolved and incorporated into systematic and inclusive planning and decision-making
processes. The way forward, therefore, will be to further develop common approaches to
valuation where feasible, but also to prioritize improved approaches to compare, contrast and
merge different values, and to incorporate fair and equitable conclusions into improved policy
and planning.
This report groups current methodologies and approaches to the valuation of water into five
interrelated perspectives: valuing water sources, in situ water resources and ecosystems;
valuing water infrastructure for water storage, use, reuse or supply augmentation; valuing
water services, mainly drinking water, sanitation and related human health aspects; valuing
water as an input to production and socio-economic activity, such as food and agriculture,
energy and industry, business and employment; and other sociocultural values of water,
including recreational, cultural and spiritual attributes. These are complemented with
experiences from different global regions; opportunities to reconcile multiple values of water
through more integrated and holistic approaches to governance; approaches to financing; and
methods to address knowledge, research and capacity needs.

Valuing the environment
The source of all water is the environment and all water abstracted by humans eventually
returns there, together with any impurities added to it. The environment–water interface
can be proactively managed in order to address water-related challenges through what has
become known as ‘nature-based solutions’.
But the status and trends of the environment–water interactions clearly indicate the need for
much better incorporation of the value of the environment in water resources management.
In most studies, water-related ecosystem services are not treated as a distinct or separate
category, and clusters or bundles of services must often be combined from the underlying
results to obtain relevant analyses and conclusions regarding water.
Significant values can also be attributed to ecosystem services that relate to supporting

resilience, or reducing risks. Many disaster risks are exacerbated by the loss of relevant
ecosystem services, as these services played a role in preventing disasters in the first
place. The values of these services can be calculated, but they are often not recognized
or adequately included in economic planning, which tends to favour short-term gains over
longer-term sustainability.
Expressing the values of ecosystem services in monetary terms enables values to be more
easily compared with other economic assessments, which often use monetary-based
units. However, the environment can have important values that cannot, or should not, be
constrained or defined by monetary-based approaches.
The existence of different value systems infers that it would be problematic to develop a
unified system of, and metrics for, valuing water and/or the environment. What is feasible
is to develop a common approach under which different environmental values or value
systems can be compared, contrasted and used.

Valuing hydraulic infrastructure
The value of water to society is underpinned by hydraulic infrastructure, which serves
to store or move water, thus delivering substantial social and economic benefits. Socioeconomic development is curtailed in countries that have insufficient infrastructure to
manage water. While more infrastructure is needed, past experience shows that the
valuation of hydraulic infrastructure has been seriously flawed.
In spite of the large sums of money invested in water infrastructure, the valuation of costs
and benefits are not well developed, standardized or widely applied. Societal benefits
delivered are often unquantified, costs (particularly external costs) are not adequately
accounted for, options are often not appropriately valued and compared, and hydrological
data are often poor and outdated.
The valuation of hydraulic infrastructure is beset with conceptual and methodological
difficulties, particularly regarding non-consumptive use, and indirect and non-use values.
Most methods of valuing water infrastructure centre on a cost–benefit approach, but there is
a tendency to overestimate benefits and underestimate costs, and in particular to not include
all costs.
One of the most critical questions is ‘value to whom’. Valuations tend to excessively focus on
target beneficiaries while other stakeholders may benefit less or even be negatively impacted.

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

A major shortcoming in many approaches is that they focus mainly on financial costs (cash
flows, and capital and operational expenditure) and financial returns. They often omit indirect
costs, and in particular social and environmental costs, which are treated as externalities.
A key question in valuation is whether large capital and operational and maintenance (O&M)
costs are included in subsequent valuations of end uses. Full-cost charging for water services
is the exception rather than the rule. In many countries, only part or all of the operational costs
are recovered, and capital investments are covered by public funds.
Valuation is only of use if the decision-making process in question is based on a fair
assessment of values. Too many projects, particularly for high-profile water infrastructure such
as dams, remain essentially vanity projects, politically motivated and/or potentially subject to
corruption. Under such circumstances, values, if assessed, are opaque, selective, manipulated
or ignored. No amount of guidance on valuation will change that. Fundamentally, valuation of
water infrastructure is about good governance. At least, the attempt to govern well must be in
place for proper valuations to play their part.

Valuing water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services
The role of water within households, schools, workplaces and health care facilities is often

overlooked or not assigned a value comparable with other uses. Water is a basic human need,
required for drinking and to support sanitation and hygiene, sustaining life and health. Access
to both water and sanitation are human rights. A direct extension of access to WASH services
not only improves educational opportunities and workforce productivity, but also contributes to
a life of dignity and equality. WASH services also indirectly add value in the form of a healthier
environment.
It has been estimated that achieving universal access to safe drinking water and sanitation
(SDG Targets 6.1 and 6.2) in 140 low- and middle-income countries would cost approximately
US$1.7 trillion from 2016 to 2030, or US$114 billion per year. The benefit–cost ratio of such
investments has been shown to provide a significant positive return in most regions. Returns
on hygiene are even higher, as they can greatly improve health outcomes in many cases with
little need for additional expensive infrastructure.
The year 2020 saw the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit the world’s most vulnerable
people the hardest – many of them living in informal settlements and urban slums. Hand
hygiene is extremely important to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Globally, over three billion
people and two out of five health care facilities lack adequate access to hand hygiene facilities.
Because access to WASH is so fundamental to life and public health, in many countries WASH
services are considered the realm of governments and therefore often subsidized, even in highincome countries.
However, subsidies do not necessarily ensure that the poor are able to access basic services.
Water subsidies can end up benefiting those with existing connections to sewerage or water
networks, many of whom are non-poor. As a result, the poor do not benefit from the subsidy
and the water service provider loses the tariff revenue it could have collected from wealthier
households. Value is lost in terms of revenue to the provider, while the negative impacts of not
having access to WASH services, such as school and work absenteeism, are not mitigated.
It is important to examine affordability from the perspective of disadvantaged groups, based
on their income, their location and the socio-economic challenges they face.

Valuing water for food and agriculture
Agriculture uses the major share (69%) of global freshwater resources. However, water use
for food production is being questioned as intersectoral competition for water intensifies and
water scarcity increases. Moreover, in many regions of the world, water for food production is
used inefficiently. This is a major driver of environmental degradation, including depletion of
aquifers, reduction of river flows, degradation of wildlife habitats, and pollution.
The value assigned to water in food production is generally low compared to other uses. It
is usually very low (typically less than US$0.05/m3) where water is used for irrigating food
grains and fodder, while it can be relatively high (of the same order of magnitude as values in
domestic and industrial uses) for high-value crops such as vegetables, fruits and flowers.
Estimates of values of water for food production normally only consider the direct
economically beneficial use of water (i.e. value to users of water), while many of the other
direct and indirect benefits associated with water, which may be economic, sociocultural or
environmental, remain unaccounted for or only partially quantified. Some of those benefits
include improving nutrition, accommodating shifts in consumption patterns, generating
employment and providing livelihood resilience especially for smallholder farmers, contributing
to alleviating poverty and revitalizing rural economies, and supporting climate change
mitigation and adaptation. The food security value of water is high but rarely quantified – and it
is often a political imperative irrespective of other values.
Several management strategies that could maximize the multiple values of water for food

production could be implemented, including improving water management in rainfed areas;
transitioning to sustainable intensification; sourcing water for irrigated agriculture, especially
from nature-based and non-conventional sources; improving water use efficiency; reducing
demand for food and its consequent water use; and improving knowledge and understanding
of water use for food production.
Improving water security for food production in both rainfed and irrigated systems can
contribute to reducing poverty and closing the gender gap directly and indirectly. Direct effects
include higher yields; reduced risk of crop failure and increased diversity of cropping; higher
wages from enhanced employment opportunities; and stable local food production and prices.
Indirect effects include income and employment multipliers beyond the farm, and reduction of
migration. Enhanced and more stable incomes could help improve education and the skillsets
of women, and thus foster their active participation in decision-making. Although increasing
water productivity can have substantial positive impacts, care should be taken to account
for possible perverse effects and implications on poverty alleviation (i.e. land grabbing and
increasing inequality).

Energy, industry and business
In the energy, industry and business (EIB) sector, water is seen as both a resource with
withdrawal and consumption costs determined by prices, and a liability involving treatment
costs and regulatory penalties, leading to a perception that water is a cost or risk to sales and
compliance. Business tends to focus on operational savings and short-term revenue impacts,
and tends to pay less attention to water value in administrative costs, natural capital, financial
risk, future growth and operations, and innovation.

There are drivers that push and others that pull businesses towards valuing water. The
former are trends, both global and regulatory, involving natural capital accounting, water
valuation and water pricing. The latter is the growing business case for prospective benefits
including better decision-making, higher revenues, lower costs, improved risk management
and a better reputation.
The higher costs, lower earnings and financial losses related to water risks are significant.
The risks associated with increased water scarcity, flooding and climate change include
higher operating costs, supply chain disruption, water supply disruption, constraints to
growth and brand damage.
Due to its character, the EIB sector is highly focused on monetization. This provides a

predisposition towards certain aspects of value (e.g. price of a cubic metre of water) and
sometimes an indifference to others (e.g. the tangible and intangible value of water to
other stakeholders). The most straightforward monetary valuation is volumetric – price per
cubic metre, multiplied by the volume of water used, plus the cost to treat and dispose of
wastewater. The metrics for the commercial performance of water use in EIB are relatively
simple. They include water productivity, defined as profit or value of production per volume
($/m3); water use intensity, defined as volume to produce a unit of value added (m3/$);
water use efficiency, defined as value added per volume ($/m3); and the change in water use
efficiency over time (SDG Indicator 6.4.1).
The overall economic productivity of water (GDP/m3) in the EIB sector also leads at local,
regional and national levels to various co-benefits, such as job creation and new enterprises.
These are not easy to quantify, as many factors come into play, of which water is only one.
A better understanding of the motivations behind corporate interests in water management
should align with those of water management agencies pursuing Integrated Water Resources
Management (IWRM) planning approaches. The circular economy will value water to the
extent that each litre is reused again and again, making water itself almost become part of
the infrastructure rather than a consumable resource.

Cultural values of water
Culture directly influences how the values of water are perceived, derived and used. Every
society, group or individual exists in their own cultural setting that is moulded by a varying
mix of heritage, tradition, history, education, life experience, exposure to information and
media, social status, and gender, among many other factors.
Some cultures can hold values that are difficult to quantify or indeed, in some cases, to
articulate. Water can appeal to people for spiritual reasons, or through scenic beauty,
because of its importance for wildlife or recreation, among others, or combinations of these.
These values can be problematic to compare with values derived through other formal
means, such as economics, and are therefore often excluded from value assessments that
favour those. Moreover, culture changes and evolves over time, sometimes rapidly.
There is a close relationship between religion, or faith, and ethics. For example, narratives
originating from regions characterized by water scarcity often feature illustrations of lawful
and morally correct living beings, often as characterized by the local religion, rewarded with
rainfall and access to water. By contrast, the modern economic conception of water can be

characterized by its abstraction from social, cultural and religious contexts. Water in the global
economic development context is often considered a resource at the disposal of society and is
therefore distinct from water as it may be recognized by religions or the belief systems of many
indigenous peoples, creating quite diverse, and potentially contradictory, perspectives of values.
The values of water in the context of conflict, peace and security are paradoxical. Whilst much

has been written about the positive value of water in promoting peace, in many cases water
itself was a contributing factor to the conflict in the first place. It has been argued that a spirit
of dialogue helps to transform water-related conflicts into cooperation.
The values of water to human well-being extend well beyond its role in supporting direct
physical life-sustaining functions, and include mental health, spiritual well-being, emotional
balance and happiness.
After understanding, categorizing or codifying cultural values, there is a need to identify ways
and means of incorporating these values into decision-making. These tools, such as cultural
mapping, can help to better understand cultural values of water, reconcile antagonistic values,
and build resilience with regard to current and future challenges, such as climate change. A
fundamental need is the full and effective gender-sensitive participation of all stakeholders in
decision-making, allowing everyone to express their own values in their own way.

Regional perspectives
Sub-Saharan Africa
Africa’s freshwater resources are estimated to be nearly 9% of the world’s total. However,
these resources are unevenly distributed, with the six most water-rich countries in Central and
Western Africa holding 54% of the continent’s total resources and the 27 most water-poor
countries holding only 7%.
The Africa Water Vision 2025 offers a context within which water security and sustainable
management of water resources could be achieved. However, rapid population growth,
inappropriate water governance and institutional arrangements, depletion of water resources
through pollution, environmental degradation, deforestation, and low and unsustainable
financing of investments in water supply and sanitation are some of the main challenges to the
achievement of SDG 6 on the continent.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, valuing water has been a challenging task for many researchers and
development experts, due at least in part to limited baseline historical data. Researchers studying
the value of water have focused mainly on using the actual price paid or the willingness to pay
from the consumer’s point of view by adopting the contingent valuation method. Studies valuing
water in Sub-Saharan Africa have mostly focused on domestic water use.

Pan-European region
Valuing water is a challenging task within any single jurisdiction, hence doing so across
borders presents even greater challenges. While increasing significance is being placed
on valuing water within the Pan-European region, efforts to value water, especially in a
transboundary basin context, remain limited in scope and often use different approaches.
The discernable approaches to valuing water quantitatively in transboundary basins are more
targeted on flood management, disaster risk reduction (DRR), early-warning systems and
ecosystem services. The collective economic benefits of transboundary cooperation on these
aspects outweigh the collective investment costs of unilateral action by several times.

6

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

Quantitatively valuing water is significantly more challenging within transboundary contexts
as the data required to base calculations are often lacking. The countries that share a water
resource often put different emphases on values, needs and priorities attached to water-related
sectors. Many elements that can be valued, are done so on the basis of approximations and
thus often undervalued, especially due to the lack of data and the inability to quantify indirect
benefits. However, several broad-based approaches exist for identifying the intersectoral
benefits of transboundary water cooperation on a case-by-case basis. These benefits, when
strengthened, can consequently help increase the value of transboundary water management by
reducing the economic and other costs of ‘inaction’ or insufficient cooperation in shared basins.

Latin America and the Caribbean
Water stress in the region has fuelled a number of conflicts, as various sectors, including
agriculture, hydroelectricity, mining, and even drinking water and sanitation, are competing over
scarce resources.
Some of the major obstacles in securing effective allocation processes are connected to poor

regulation, missing incentives and/or lack of investment. All these factors ultimately reflect the
low value that is largely attributed to water resources in the region. The costs of water use or
maintenance (once the concession or right of use is granted), are usually nil or insignificant for
hydroelectric plants, mining companies and even farmers; and sometimes these costs are not
even included in their economic balances. The latter represents an implicit subsidy that does
not reflect the strategic value of water in the multiple production processes and under a context
of climate change.
Most countries in the region have not assigned sufficient funds for proper law enforcement in
cases of pollution or overexploitation. While legal precepts are of extreme relevance, regulation
and monitoring as well as well-aligned incentives are essential in the region, not only to ensure
a better appreciation of the role and value of water but also to prevent its overexploitation and
pollution, particularly given the increasing climate instability.

Asia and the Pacific
Due to population growth, urbanization and increased industrialization, water competition among
sectors has become more severe in the region, threatening agricultural production and food
security while also affecting water quality. Water is often a relatively scarce and valuable resource
in the region, and water scarcity is likely to worsen due to the impacts of climate change.
Unsustainable water withdrawals are a major concern in the region, as some countries withdraw
unsustainable proportions of their freshwater supply – exceeding half of the total water
availability – and seven of the world’s 15 biggest abstractors of groundwater are in Asia and the
Pacific.
Wastewater remains an underutilized resource in the region. There is therefore an urgent need
in Asia and the Pacific to tap into wastewater, as well as to tackle water pollution and promote
water efficiency, including from the industrial sector. This is particularly urgent in the region’s
least developed countries, on islands and in countries where water resources are particularly
scarce.
The region has seen the emergence of diverse positive water-valuing initiatives that leverage new
financial, governance and partnership models, notably in Australia, China, Japan and Malaysia.

The Arab region
Few other regions value water as much as the water-scarce Arab region, where over 85% of
the population live under conditions of water scarcity. This scarcity has increased dependency
on transboundary waters, non-renewable groundwater resources and non-conventional water
resources. The quantity of freshwater that can be abstracted in a sustainable way would
probably even be lower if water quality considerations were included.
Water is so highly valued in the region that it is considered a topic of security in bilateral and
multilateral discussions among states. This is amplified by the fact that over two thirds of
freshwater resources available in Arab states cross one or more international boundaries.
However, joint methodologies for the economic valuation of transboundary waters have not
yet been incorporated into cooperation arrangements, and funding to inform joint management
efforts remains limited. Furthermore, national security considerations and a water rights
perspective tend to dominate the discourse among riparian states, although nascent initiatives
exist to value transboundary water cooperation and analysis focused on climate security and
risk mitigation in transboundary water contexts in the Middle East and North Africa.
For the full value of water to be captured and considered by all to be a human right, there is a
need for considerable investment in infrastructure, appropriate technologies and the use of
non-conventional water resources to improve productivity, sustainability and access for all.

the economic and financial considerations in water-related decision-making. Coupled with
a recognition of water’s multiple values, there is also a call for more robust measurement
and valuation methods to help resolve trade-offs. The use of multi-value approaches to
water governance entails acknowledging the role of values in driving key water resources
management decisions as well as a call for active participation of a more diverse set of actors,
thereby also incorporating a more diverse set of values into water governance. Including
the intrinsic or relational values of diverse groups to better inform and legitimize water and
related land resources management decisions would typically involve the direct participation
of groups or interests that are often excluded from water-related decision-making. It may bring
greater emphasis on ecological and environmental processes, and refocus efforts on sharing
water resource benefits, rather than allocating water quantities for highest-value economic
priorities.
Transitioning to a system of water governance that recognizes multiple values and the
active participation of a varied set of actors presents a set of challenges. The first relates to
acknowledging that the governance of water is driven by a set of implicit or explicit values.
The second involves the value or worth of using water in different ways, which is fraught not
only with measurement issues, including what can – and should – be measured, and by whom.
The third relates to the common disconnect between public decision-making processes and
actions on the ground, including the risk of agendas being controlled by vested interests.
Nations can transition into multi-value governance by building on existing governance
frameworks such as IWRM, which integrates interests of diverse stakeholder groups operating
at various political levels and policy sectors. IWRM is most often represented as cutting across
water for people, food, nature, industry and other uses, and aims to encompass all social,
economic and environmental considerations. It is essential to broaden and strengthen multi-

stakeholder processes that recognize and reconcile a comprehensive mix of values, including
benefit-sharing in water governance, as well as integrating ecological and environmental values
into climate-resilient water management.

Financing and funding water services
Maximizing the value of water in investment decisions requires careful valuation of the

analyses

costs and benefits that a project provides. For this, all benefits need to be taken into
account, including those that are economic, social or environmental. Many of the unintended
consequences of these investments, both negative and positive, must also be considered.
Aggregating these types of benefits can be difficult, as they are not all easily converted into
monetary amounts. In cases where benefits cannot be monetized, other valuation tools can
be used, such as cost–effectiveness analyses, which compare costs with non-pecuniary
outcomes such as lives saved, people served or environmental metrics achieved. Another
critical factor for determining benefits of a project is comparing it to what would happen if the
project were not undertaken.
How a project will be funded is another critical component to the valuation analysis, as a
project that does not have a means for funding will eventually see a service disruption when
operations and maintenance are unfunded and capital costs cannot be repaid. Similarly, the
dynamics of the funding type will impact the net benefits of the investment itself, and who
receives them.
For investments in water supply, sanitation or irrigation services, designing an appropriate
water tariff structure is a challenge, as there are multiple, often competing, policy goals that
need to be taken into consideration. When supplying these services, care should also be taken
to ensure affordability for the poor, expansion to the widest number of individuals, and funding
to ensure reliability and network improvements. The water tariff (i.e. price) must be carefully
designed to accomplish as many of these goals as possible – the price of water, its cost of
delivery and its value are not synonymous, and price is merely one tool for aligning water’s use
with its values.
Large subsidies for WASH service provision are justifiable from an economic as well as
a social and moral standpoint; however, they are often poorly targeted, resulting in poor
outcomes. In fact, large, untargeted WASH subsidies can be counterproductive, reducing the
benefits of water services, and thus the valuations of WASH investments. Indeed, in countries
where piped water is deemed to be very low-cost or free, the poor are often unserved or
underserved, and are compelled to pay a much higher price for their water than the rich.

Knowledge, research and capacity development
As a core component of knowledge building and sharing, water-related data and information
are central to understanding and valuing the resource. Water-related data and information
can also be generated by other sources such as earth observations, sensor networks and
citizen data, including on social media. But data and information relating to social, economic
and environmental demands and uses for water are also needed to complete the picture for
potential value generation from water. Further efforts and investments are required to sustain
the supply chain of data and information from its collection, analysis, sharing and application
across sectors and scales.

To promote inclusive and transformative change in valuing water, it is strategically important to
recognize the unique role of local and indigenous knowledge, in addition to the mainstream or
traditional scientific or academic knowledge. Another part of the solution is to expand citizen
science. The involvement of representative local stakeholders in ground-truthing data and
information is also important.
Within the context of valuing water, capacity development concerns the establishment of knowhow to inclusively and properly value water and to effectively manage it on the basis of those
values, applied at different levels and under diverse conditions, leading to variable outcomes.

‘true’ value. As such, the overall importance of this vital resource is not appropriately reflected
in political attention and financial investment in many parts of the world. This not only leads to
inequalities in access to water resources and water-related services, but also to inefficient and
unsustainable use and degradation of water supplies themselves, affecting the fulfilment of
nearly all the SDGs, as well as basic human rights.
Consolidating the different approaches and methods for valuing water across multiple
dimensions and perspectives will likely remain challenging. Even within a specific water use
sector, different approaches can lead to strikingly different valuations. Trying to reconcile
valuations across sectors would normally increase the overall level of difficulty, as would
taking account of some of the more intangible values attributed to water in different
sociocultural contexts. While there may be scope to reduce complexities and standardize
metrics in some circumstances, the reality is the need for better means to recognize, maintain
and accommodate different values.

Coda
Even though it is not always recognized by all, water clearly has value. In some perspectives
the value of water is infinite, since life does not exist without it and there is no replacement
for it. This is perhaps best exemplified by the efforts and investments made in the search for
extra-terrestrial water and the recent elation in finding it on the Moon and Mars. It is a shame
that all too often, it is taken for granted here on Earth. The risks of undervaluing water are far
too great to ignore.

continues to grow at a rate of roughly 1% per year since the 1980s (AQUASTAT, n.d.). While the
rate of increase in freshwater use had tapered off in most Member States of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), where per capita water use rates tend to
be among the world’s highest, it continues to grow in the majority of the emerging economies,
as well as in middle- and lower-income countries (Ritchie and Roser, 2018). Much of this
growth can be attributed to a combination of population growth, economic development and
shifting consumption patterns.

Reservoirs*

Municipalities

Industries

Agriculture

Agriculture currently accounts for 69% of global water withdrawals, which are mainly used
for irrigation but also include water used for livestock and aquaculture. This ratio can reach
up to 95% in some developing countries (FAO, 2011a). Industry (including energy and power
generation) accounts for 19%, while municipalities are responsible for the remaining 12%.
Studies attempting to project trends in future water use have yielded varying results. For
example:
• The 2030 Water Resources Group (2009) concluded that the world would face a 40% global
water deficit by 2030 under a business-as-usual scenario.
• The OECD (2012) projected that global water demand would increase by 55% between 2000
and 2050.
• Burek et al. (2016) estimated that global water use would likely continue to grow at an
annual rate of about 1%, resulting in an increase of 20 to 30% above the current level of water
use by 2050.
While the exact magnitude of the actual increase in global water use remains uncertain, most
authors agree that agricultural water use will face increasing competition and that most of the
growth in water use will be driven by increasing demand by the industry and energy sectors,
as well as by municipal and domestic uses, mainly as a function of industrial development
and improving water and sanitation service coverage in developing countries and emerging
economies (OECD, 2012; Burek et al., 2016; IEA, 2016).

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

Changes in agricultural water demand are among the most difficult to predict. The
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates, based on a
business-as-usual scenario, that the world will need about 60% more food by 2050, and
that irrigated food production will increase by more than 50% over the same period (FAO,
2017a). The necessary amounts of water for these developments are not available. FAO
recognizes that the amounts of water withdrawn by agriculture can only increase by 10%.
Fortunately, there is substantial room for improvements in water use efficiency in irrigated,
and especially rainfed, systems (FAO, 2017a), as well as in eliminating food waste and
shifting consumption towards less water-demanding diets (FAO, 2019a). Together, these
responses would enable projected food demands to be met within sustainable limits and
even present the potential to reduce current withdrawals over the longer term, thereby
reducing competition with other uses.

Water availability

Water stress, essentially measured as water use as a function of available supply, affects
many parts of the world (Figure P2). Over two billion people live in countries experiencing
water stress (United Nations, 2018). However, physical water stress is often a seasonal
rather than an annual phenomenon, as exemplified by the seasonal variability in water
availability (Figure P3). An estimated four billion people live in areas that suffer from
severe physical water scarcity for at least one month per year (Mekonnen and Hoekstra,
2016).
It should also be noted that about 1.6 billion people face ‘economic’ water scarcity, which
means that while water may be physically available, they lack the necessary infrastructure
to access that water (Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture,
2007).
Climate change is likely to increase seasonal variability, creating a more erratic and
uncertain water supply, thus exacerbating problems in already water-stressed areas
and potentially generating water stress in places where it has not yet been a recurring
phenomenon.
Several of the world’s main aquifers are under increasing stress and 30% of the largest
groundwater systems are being depleted (Richey et al., 2015). The areas experiencing the
highest levels of decline are shown in Figure P4. Water withdrawals for irrigation are the
primary driver of groundwater depletion worldwide (Burek et al., 2016).

Water quality

While global water quality data remain sparse due to a lack of monitoring and reporting
capacity, especially in many of the least developed countries, a number of trends have
nonetheless been reported. Water quality has deteriorated as a result of pollution in
nearly all major rivers in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Nutrient loading, which is often
associated with pathogen loading, is among the most prevalent sources of pollution
(UNEP, 2016).
Globally, an estimated 80% of all industrial and municipal wastewater is released into
the environment without any prior treatment, with detrimental effects on human health
and ecosystems. This ratio is much higher in least developed countries, where sanitation
and wastewater treatment facilities are grossly lacking (WWAP, 2017). Managing
excess nutrients in agricultural runoff is also considered as one of the most prevalent
water quality-related challenges globally (OECD, 2017a). Hundreds of chemicals are
also negatively impacting water quality. Risks related to emerging pollutants, including
micropollutants, have been acknowledged since the early 2000s (Bolong et al., 2009).

Extreme events

Floods and droughts represent the two main water-related disasters. Over the period
2009–2019, floods caused nearly 55,000 deaths (including 5,110 in 2019 alone), affected
another 103 million people (including 31,000 in 2019 alone) and caused US$76.8 billion in
economic losses (including US$36.8 billion in 2019 alone) (CRED, 2020). Over the same
period, droughts affected over 100 million people, killing over 2,000 people more, and
directly causing over US$10 billion in economic losses (CRED, 2020).
Globally, floods and extreme rainfall events have increased by more than 50% over the
past decade, occurring at a rate four times greater than in 1980 (EASAC, 2018). Climate
change is expected to further increase the frequency and severity of floods and droughts
(IPCC, 2018).

Water, sanitation
and hygiene
(WASH)

In 2017, 5.3 billion people (71% of the global population of 7.55 billion) used a safely
managed drinking water service – one located on premises, available when needed and
free from contamination (Figure P5). 3.4 billion people (or 45% of the global population)
used safely managed sanitation services – an improved toilet or latrine that is not shared,
from which excreta are safely disposed of in situ or treated off-site (Figure P6).

Of the 18 categories of ‘nature’s contributions to people’ (which include bundles of
ecosystem services), 14 are in decline. These include the three explicitly water-related
categories: regulation of freshwater quantity, coastal and freshwater quality, and
hazards and extreme events (IPBES, 2019a). Declines in these categories also contribute
to declines in most other services categories, threatening the sustainability of those
currently increasing (energy, food, animal feed and materials). Taking into consideration
that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are integrated, indivisible, and nationally
implemented, current negative trends in biodiversity and ecosystems will undermine
progress towards 80% (35 out of 44) of the assessed targets of SDGs related to poverty
(SDG 1), hunger (2), health (3), water (6), cities (11), climate (13), oceans (14) and land (15)
(IPBES, 2019a).

Introduction

Water’s worth is arguably infinite – without water life ceases to exist. Recognizing, measuring
and expressing water’s worth, and incorporating it into decision-making, are fundamental to
achieving sustainable and equitable water resources management. Whilst the term ‘value’ and
the process of ‘valuation’ are well defined (Box 1.1), there are multiple uses, and often reuses,
of water and the very many different stakeholders involved usually have different views of what
‘value’ specifically means to them. There are also different methods for calculating value and
different metrics to express it. Identifying and reconciling these differences is the subject of
this World Water Development Report.

Box 1.1 Value and valuation: definitions
Valuation is the process by which a person or entity assigns value to something.
In the context of natural resources, the term ‘value’ is used in three main ways:
i. Exchange value: the price of a good or service in the market (i.e. market price);
ii. Utility: the use value of a good or service, which can be very different from the market price
(e.g. the market price of water is very low, but its use value very high; the reverse is the case,
for example, for diamonds or other luxury goods);
iii. Importance: the appreciation or emotional value we attach to a given good or service (e.g.
the emotional or spiritual experience some people have when viewing water landscapes, or
the importance given to water through culture or religion).

It is well recognized that water underpins most aspects of economies and sustainable
development. The valuation of water, at least at a fundamental level, is implicit in most
water resources management decisions. Therefore, the valuation of water connects with, for
example, human rights frameworks, with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its
five pillars (people, prosperity, planet, peace and justice, and partnership), and with Integrated
Water Resources Management (IWRM), among others. In order to provide more refined and
quantitative information to support decision-making, some recent initiatives have focused
more explicitly on the valuation of water. Examples include, the High Level Panel on Water
(HLPW, 2017a) and its Bellagio Principles (HLPW, 2017b), the Global High-Level Panel on Water
and Peace (2017), numerous water sector and/or private sector initiatives, and for ecosystems
the recent global assessment of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity
and Ecosystem Services (IPBES, 2019a), among others. The most advanced work on the
valuation of water, in the context of accounting, is the System of Environmental Economic
Accounting that has been developing detailed accounts for water since 2003 – the SEEA-Water
(UNDESA, 2012).
This report groups current methodologies and approaches to the valuation of water into five
inter-related perspectives: valuing water sources, in situ water resources and ecosystems
(Chapter 2); valuing water infrastructure for water storage, use, reuse or supply augmentation
(Chapter 3); valuing water services, mainly drinking water, sanitation and related human health
aspects (Chapter 4); valuing water as an input to production and socio-economic activity,
such as food and agriculture, energy and industry, and business and employment (Chapters 5
and 6); and other sociocultural values of water, including recreational, cultural and spiritual
attributes (Chapter 7). These are complemented with experiences from different global regions
(Chapter 8). Chapter 9 addresses the interdependency of these five perspectives and the obvious
need to reconcile multiple values of water through more integrated and holistic approaches to
governance. Chapter 10 covers financing, while Chapter 11 focuses on knowledge, research and
capacity. Chapter 12 presents overall conclusions and ways forward.

1.2
Why value water?

The real worth of water, combined and contrasted across all stakeholder perspectives, has
often been neglected, leading to its wastage, misuse and misappropriation by certain interests.
Sometimes the contention around the value of water resides in the measurement of its worth.
Other times, contention, or even conflict, resides in comparing differing value domains, for
example, economic versus more intangible cultural values. Those who control how water
is valued control how it is used. Values are a central aspect of power and equity in water
resources governance.
The current status of water resources (see Prologue) highlights the need for improved water
resources management. The cascading negative impacts of increasing water stress, water
scarcity, flooding, pollution, loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and other aspects
of water-related environmental degradation continue to be inadequately accounted for.
This strongly underscores the need to change the way water is valued (Damania et al., 2017).
For example, despite the challenges of increasing water scarcity, farmers, businesses, and
households often have few incentives to consume less water, maintain water quality, or
allocate it to ecosystems or social objectives (HLPW, 2018). Examples abound of countries
where water is scarce and yet is used more intensively and wastefully than in countries where
it is abundant (Figure 1.1). This is often a consequence of inappropriate policies, regulations
and incentives that condone waste and over-use, instead of efficient and prudent use of
scarce water resources. Technical solutions often exist, but the challenge is to translate them
into concrete plans: who does what, at which level, and how. These questions often remain
unanswered (HLPW, 2018).

The failure to fully value water in all in its different uses is considered a root cause, or a
symptom, of the political neglect of water and its mismanagement (WWAP, 2012). It is argued
that a primary reason for limited successes in attaining IWRM and other water-related goals
and targets, and failures in water governance, is the omission of a full representation of
the values of water. Water governance fundamentally concerns values (Groenfeldt, 2019).

Valuing water: Perspectives, challenges and opportunities

Polarization of views on value can either constrain good governance, or be exacerbated by
poor governance, and can lead to: insufficient appreciation of the importance of water; a low
priority being given to water policy in country development programmes, poverty reduction
strategies, and other policies; suboptimal levels of investment in water infrastructure; and even
failure in meeting international socioeconomic goals (WWAP, 2012).
There is some recognition of the overall value of water and its contribution to human wellbeing. For example: “Water is life. It is a fundamental condition of human survival and dignity,
and is the basis for the resilience of societies and of the natural environment” (Global HighLevel Panel on Water and Peace, 2017, p. 11). The right to safe and clean drinking water and
sanitation was recognized by the United Nations General Assembly in 2010 (UNGA, 2010) as
a human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life, forming a basis from which all
human rights essentially stem. There is a plethora of other similar declarations of the overall
value of water. However, the current status of water resources shows that these fundamental
perceptions of value have done little to improve management. All too often, the value of water,
or its full suite of multiple values, is not prominent in decision-making at all. Fragmented
approaches, and in particular dominance of water resources management decisions by
specific sectors or political classes, have been identified as a key challenge in every World
Water Development Report so far.
As the drivers of water insecurity have accelerated apace (Figure 1.2), water has similarly
grown in importance in terms of its essential and diverse values to society. This growth has
placed more attention globally, regionally and at basin and local levels on how societies value
water, why, and to what end purpose. It has underlined a pressing need for a more balanced,
transparent, inclusive and nuanced characterization and reconciliation of water’s diverse
values as seen from many different perspectives (HLPW, 2017a).

This World Water Development Report argues that better measurement, monitoring and
understanding of the values of water, and their incorporation into improved decision-making
frameworks enable the equitable comparison of multiple values of water held by multiple
stakeholder groups, and are essential for achieving sustainable water resources management.

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

1.3
The values of
water to society

1.3.1 Differing perspectives on valuing water
Policy, management and investment decisions are compounded by differences among,
and often within, stakeholder groups on priorities among different values, the specifics
of what value means and how it can be measured, and the metrics for expressing it.
Individuals intuitively recognize that water is “more than a substance: it carries multiple
values and meanings” (HLPW, 2017a, Preamble, p. 1). People’s cultural heritage, world views,
codes of ethics, and established norms frame their relationships with water, influencing
their perspectives and the ways in which they think about and value this natural resource
(Johnston et al., 2012; Bakker, 2012; Krause and Strang, 2016). Different cultures, societies
and communities around the world, including indigenous peoples, understand and define the
values of water in quite different ways, according divergent values to the resource and its
uses, which may be hard or even inappropriate to attempt to reconcile.
There are a number of ways of categorizing value concepts such as assigned (or
instrumental/economic), moral (notions of what is right), held (fairness, courage) and
relational values (Chan et al., 2018). Relational values encompass a wide range of values
that are embedded in desirable relationships, including those between people and those
involving the notion of values held because of specific principles or moral duties and
regardless of whether those relationships imply trade-offs. For this reason, they may depart
from an economic valuation framework (IPBES, 2019a). Relational values can be a bridge
between intrinsic and instrumental values. However, others have considered cultural and
religious values, and other intangible benefits of belief systems, to be cultural ecosystem
services and therefore amenable to economic analysis (e.g. Russi et al., 2013). None
of these concepts, categorizations or approaches are necessarily more important than
others. For example relational, cultural or other intangible values can trump ‘economic’
values in decision-making (examples are provided in chapters 2 and 9). But the weight
given to different value concepts has a major impact on values assessed and decisions
taken. Practitioners need to be acutely aware of the value system that they, and others, are
adopting.

In the case of
water there is no
clear relationship
between its price
and its value.
Where water is
priced, meaning
consumers are
charged for using
it, the price often
reflects attempts
for cost recovery
and not value
delivered

Economics is the most widely applied framework for valuing water. This report takes a
comprehensive view of its scope. There are a number of economic categories of ‘value’
(Box 1.2). In practice, economic approaches can often be more limited in scope and often
furnish an incomplete indication of water’s true economic value. Traditional economic
accounting, often a key means of informing policy decisions, tends to limit water values
to the way that most other products are valued – using the recorded price or costs of
water when economic transactions occur. However, in the case of water there is no clear
relationship between its price and its value. Where water is priced, meaning consumers
are charged for using it, the price often reflects attempts for cost recovery and not value
delivered (see Section 1.5 and Chapter 10). Yet regarding valuation, economics remains the
most relevant, powerful and influential science. Its application, therefore, needs to be made
more comprehensive.
The unique characteristics of water also make it difficult to value using market prices. It is
a heavily regulated commodity, usually without free markets. Due to economies of scale,
water storage and distribution are often under the control of monopolies. Moreover, property
rights, essential for competitive markets, are often absent. Water is also a bulky commodity
with very high weight to value ratio, limiting markets to those in a local area. Finally, large
amounts of water abstracted can be unrecorded (UNDESA, 2012).
Differences in the way water is valued occur not only between stakeholder groups but are
widespread within them. For example, there are multiple ways of expressing and calculating
values of water used by agriculture and variation in what is included in accounting. This
results in a wide range of approaches (Box 1.3).

Box 1.2 Categories of economic values
In this report, economics is a social science concerned with the production, distribution and
consumption of goods and services (Oxford English Dictionary); goods and services are
interpreted comprehensively and include any benefit received from water, material or otherwise.
Importantly, economic assessment and analysis are not limited to monetary valuation.
There are a number of categories for the economic values associated with water such as:
Use values:
Direct use values relate to the direct use of water resources for consumptive uses, such as
input to agriculture, manufacturing and domestic use; and non-consumptive uses, such as
generating hydroelectric power, recreation, navigation and cultural activities.
Indirect use values relate to the indirect environmental services provided by water, such as
waste assimilation, habitat and biodiversity protection, and hydrologic function (UNDESA,
2012, Box VIII.2, p. 123).
Option value is the value of maintaining future choices – today’s value of maintaining the future
option for the use of water, directly or indirectly; for example, pollution of a groundwater store
that is not currently being used incurs no immediate loss of direct value, but reduces the value
of the resource for future use (UNDESA, 2012, Box VIII.2, p. 123).
Non-use values:
Bequest value is the value of water-related ecosystems left or sustained for the benefit of
future generations; the concept of intergenerational equity is a related value system.
Existence value is the intrinsic value of water and water ecosystems, including biodiversity; for
example, the value people place simply on knowing that a wild river exists, even if they never
visit it.

There is a strong
economic case to
invest in water use
efficiency gains
that make more
water available
to, or reduce
competition with,
other uses that
have a higher
value

22

Robust water measurement, modelling and accounting constitute the foundation for water
valuation, and a necessary enabling step towards sustainable development of water resources.
However, there are gaps in our knowledge about the storage and fluxes of water in the
landscape and human-built infrastructure, which are especially surprising when we consider
the important role of water in human welfare (Garrick et al., 2017).
These divergent perspectives on water value and the best ways to calculate and express it,
coupled with limited knowledge of the actual resource, present a challenging landscape for
rapid improvements in valuing water.

1.3.2 Reconciling water value and use
Low values for use based on economic efficiency do not necessarily imply foregoing that
use. Better valuation of water helps identify the case for necessary investments in water use
efficiency, including moderating impacts on water quality. In the example of water use for food,
the very low economic returns ($/m3 of water) do not mean food production to be sacrificed in
order to allocate water to uses with higher returns, since that would jeopardize food security
and livelihoods in developing countries. It means that there is a strong economic case to invest
in water use efficiency gains that make more water available to, or reduce competition with,
other uses that have a higher value. In this example, valuing water helps identify the value of
investment in its management.

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

Box 1.3 Values of water in food and agriculture – Showcasing the diversity of approaches and the
main challenges to estimations
Which parameters should be used to value water use in agriculture, and how? All have their merits,
but few can be easily compared. It is inevitable that different groups will select the value and
method that best support their particular interests.
Agriculture accounts for 69% of global water withdrawals. Yet, globally, agriculture accounts for
only about 4% of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with an average contribution per country of
10.39%, with the highest contribution of 57.39% (Sierra Leone) and the lowest of 0.03% (Singapore),
the trend being a decreasing share of GDP (World Bank, 2020). Such figures suggest that the value
added of water use in agriculture is very low.
Rwanda, for example, has recently prepared detailed water accounts (Government of Rwanda,
2019). Agriculture uses 96% of water withdrawn from the environment (including soil water), mostly
for the low-value crops that are essential to the country’s food needs and the rural economy (see
Figure below).

However, there are important nuances that should be applied when interpreting such data. For
example, the water supply and waste management sector is not using water to produce economic
output directly, but rather treating and distributing water primarily for the use of other sectors. For
this reason, the measure of ‘contribution to GDP’ may be misleadingly narrow in this case. Further,
there are water losses in the process from abstraction to purification to distribution that contribute
to a higher measure of water ‘use’ relative to the economic gains.
A very different picture emerges if value is considered in terms of contribution to overall GDP or
employment. When applying these criteria, it appears that agricultural use of water scores better
through its high contribution to total GDP and high levels of employment; electricity (mainly
hydropower) scores very poorly (although the electricity delivers much value added and most water
is actually returned to the environment); and the service sectors deliver the highest gains in water
use efficiency (see Figure below).

There are a number of options when considering farm produce values, and hence water use
efficiency values: for example, farm gate, wholesale or retail price, or value added (e.g. price of
prepared food in the services sector). These values can differ by orders of magnitude. An added
factor is whether to use gross farm income or residual (net) income when calculating value
delivered. In Namibia, for example, based on gross income, farms returned US$3.88/m3 of water but
after factoring in the costs of inputs, the residual value was only US$0.14–0.51/m3 (Lange, 2006).
Things get even more complicated when considering how to calculate water ‘used’ when
determining value per unit of water. For example, for irrigated agriculture return flow needs to be
factored into consumption (i.e. use net withdrawals), but its degraded state factored in as a cost.
In accounting terms, water infrastructure capital as well as operation and maintenance costs
should be factored in – but rarely are. In rainfed systems, withdrawals (soil moisture/rainfall) are
not usually considered part of water ‘abstraction/withdrawal’ in use calculations. But land use in
rainfed farming can decrease local surface and groundwater storage and flows, and therefore has
a ‘consumption’ element. On the other hand, it can also increase local water storage and flows,
in which case water availability is augmented. As a final example, in both rainfed and irrigated
systems most consider the water evapotranspired by crops as water actually ‘consumed’, but in
both cases this will return again somewhere else as rainfall – so is it ‘consumed’ or ‘recycled’?

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

1.3.3 Recognizing that values of water can be negative
‘Value’ in itself is neutral, but all too often it is assumed to be positive (a benefit). But
where water is in the ‘wrong’ place at the wrong time, or is contaminated, its value
can be significantly negative; that is, involve net costs. Floodwater can, for example,
have a positive benefit (for example by supporting fisheries production or replenishing
nutrients across floodplains to support seasonal livestock grazing), but also a high
negative impact. The value of investment in flood mitigation, therefore, is reflected
in the reduction of this negative value of water. Arguably, the value of certain water
bodies could be considered negative if it interrupts transport – the cost of building a
bridge over it reflects that negative value. Although wastewater should be considered a
resource (WWAP, 2017), the value of untreated wastewater released to the environment
is negative and can be estimated based on how it reduces the value of water in the
environment (pollution impact cost, including how this affects human health). In effect,
the net value of wastewater treatment, above recovering valuable substances from
wastewater, is reflected in the reduction of that negative value of wastewater. Other
examples include where water use results in a negative economic return; for example,
where accounting for all associated inputs and costs (e.g. subsidies) reveals that the
water being used delivers a net economic loss (examples are provided below).

1.4
Methods for
calculating the
values of water

There are a number of methods commonly in use for calculating the value of water
(Box 1.4). However, there can be large differences between values obtained through
different methods. In addition, values derived are not necessarily those that drive
investment. For example, the value of domestic water supply is generally perceived by
households to be higher than that of sanitation and especially wastewater treatment
(UNESCO/UN-Water, 2020), but investments in sanitation deliver about twice the return
of investments in drinking water supply (WHO, 2012).
For some values, or value domains, no ‘methodologies’ are applied – value just exists.
This applies, for example, to some intrinsic values or intangible values held under
customary or religious belief systems. These can be more influential than values derived
through scientific assessment.

1.5
Accounting for
subsidies and
other incentives in
valuations
1.6
Reconciling
different values
and perspectives

Governments often subsidize the costs of critical inputs and fix the price paid for major
commodities, often below their marginal value. In other countries, trade protection
is used to maintain high prices (Box 1.5). For example, Chapter 3 highlights that the
operational costs of water infrastructure, and in particular capital costs, are often not
recouped from users and therefore not reflected in their valuations of water at point of
use. These distortions must be factored into valuations if an accurate picture of values
is to be obtained.

The diversity in perspectives, value systems or world views, and methods for calculating
values and measurement metrics encourage stakeholders to select those approaches
to valuation that best suit their own agendas. Difficulties in valuation and fragmented
approaches to water resources management go hand in hand. Given even an optimistic
view of the levels of impartiality in play, it is unlikely that all stakeholders will easily
agree on a common method of expressing value. But there is a strong argument that
diversity in perspectives on value should be maintained: it is, for example, futile to
attempt to quantitatively compare the value of water for domestic use, the human right
to water, customary or religious beliefs, and the value of maintaining flows to preserve
biodiversity. None of these should be sacrificed for the sake of achieving consistent
valuation methodologies.

Box 1.4 Some examples of methods to calculate values of water
Residual value estimates change in net income; that is, the difference (the residual) between the value of the
output and the costs of all non-water inputs to production. The approach is quite sensitive to small variations in the
parameters used and assumptions about the market and the policy environment. If an input into production is omitted
or underestimated, its value would be wrongly attributed to water. For example, based upon data quoted in UNDESA
(2012) for farming in Namibia, assuming a 5% cost for capital investments, the residual value of water appeared to
be 19 Namibian cents per cubic metre. However, if the real cost of capital rose to 7%, farmers would not earn enough
to cover even the capital costs and the value of the water would be negative – meaning that its use in farming would
result in economic losses.
Mathematical programming models have been developed to inform decisions on water allocation and infrastructure
development. They specify an objective, such as maximizing the value of output, subject to production inputs such as
water supply, and institutional and behavioural constraints. Economy-wide approaches may use linear programming
or simulation to compare marginal values of water among sectors (e.g. Renzetti and Dupont, 2003). More commonly,
a computable general equilibrium model is used, as was done in Morocco in order to determine the impact of trade
reform on the shadow value1 of water in agriculture (Diao and Roe, 2000).
Replacement cost or replacement value refers to the amount that an entity would have to pay to replace an asset at
the present time, according to its current worth. The approach is often used when the market or shadow price of water
cannot be accurately assessed. For example, the absence of drinking water piped to a household could be estimated
by the cost of supplying the same water in bottled form. The method is commonly applied to estimate the value of
ecosystem services (Russi et al., 2013). For example, the value of loss of watershed water purification services can be
estimated, partly, through the capital and operational costs of water treatment facilities.
Contingent valuation does not rely on market data but asks individuals how much they would be willing to pay for the
item in question. The method is especially useful for determining the value of ecosystem goods and services that have
no market prices, for example, biodiversity, good water quality or recreation. It has some utility for valuing consumer
water demand by asking consumers how much they would be willing to pay for water.
Demand functions approaches use a demand curve either from actual sales of water (revealed preference) or from
the use of the contingent valuation approach (stated preference) and involves econometric analysis to measure total
economic value. However, it is often impossible to obtain the circumstances under which a demand curve can be
accurately derived, even in developed countries (Walker et al., 2000).
Tradeable water rights attempt to capture markets in the derivation of the value of water. Examples can be found in
Australia, Chile, Iran, South Africa and Spain’s Canary Islands, as well as in some of the western states of the United
States of America where water trading schemes are in place. Some countries, especially in South Asia, also have
informal water trading schemes (Carey and Bunding, 2001). Australia’s water market in the Murray-Darling Basin
is recognized as the most advanced globally (Seidl et al., 2020a), but the absence of standardized approaches to
valuation leads to considerable divergence in water values (Seidl et al., 2020b). There are varying opinions about how
well markets for water function, as well as about their impact on consumers and the environment, and the morals of
applying them (e.g. Garrick et al., 2020a).
The water footprint is an indicator of freshwater use that looks at both direct and indirect water use of a consumer or
producer, and can be calculated for a particular product, for any well-defined group of consumers or producers. It can
be expressed in terms of water volume and monetary unit, for example, when the water footprint per unit of time is
divided by income (for consumers) or turnover (for businesses). A water footprint sustainability assessment will further
evaluate whether the water footprint is sustainable in terms of an environmental, social and economic perspective
such as biodiversity, human health, welfare and security, thus adding an important additional dimension to value
(Hoekstra et al., 2011).

Box 1.5 The impact of including subsidies and other incentives in accounting for the values of
water
When accounting for the costs of agriculture subsidies in the European Union, it was found that
the value of water used in irrigation in part of the United Kingdom was negative for winter wheat,
barley, oilseed and sugar beet (Bate and Dubourg, 1997). For these crops, net negative value
varied between 2.5 and 15 times the positive value calculated without subsidies. This means that
using water to irrigate crops, in this case, results in a net economic loss. Only potatoes produced
a net positive value when including subsidies but, even then, the subsidies reduced that value by
about half. On the other hand, correcting the effects of trade distortion on the value delivered per
unit of water for crops in Jordan resulted in a reduction of 7% for fruits and 50% for vegetables,
but in both cases net value was still positive (Schiffler, 2014).

Nevertheless, the different values of water need to be reconciled, and the trade-offs
between them resolved and incorporated into systematic and inclusive planning and
decision-making processes. The way forward, therefore, will be to further develop common
approaches to valuation where feasible, but to prioritize improved approaches to compare,
contrast and merge different values, and to incorporate fair and equitable conclusions into
improved policy and planning.
Gender-sensitive stakeholder consultation and the active involvement of all users and
beneficiaries, including disadvantaged and marginalized groups, are critical to ensure
full representation of perspectives and values from the outset, and throughout the
development process (Horne et al., 2017a). All stakeholders and socio-economic sectors,
from water supply and sanitation to agriculture, energy and industry stand to benefit
from an improved integration of the values of water across the full water development or
engineering cycle, from planning and pre-feasibility, through to adaptive management and
monitoring. Water opportunities and risks cannot be managed by a single institution and
require collective action at a meaningful scale.

1.7
Principles for
valuing water
for sustainable
development

Valuing water has been a longstanding general theme and one of great relevance to
development. Efforts to value water have advanced over the past 30 years, ranging from
willingness to pay for drinking water and ecosystem services, to participatory processes
that capture water’s diverse cultural benefits. Yet valuing water remains difficult and
contentious owing to water’s physical, political and economic characteristics (Garrick
et al., 2017). There is still a surprising lack of clarity as to the recognition, measurement
and reconciliation of the full range of values on the ground. Debate reigns over how best to
capture, and give due attention to, the values of water.
The values given to water are at the heart of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development (see Section 7.5). Valuing water is a shared societal
responsibility (HLPW, 2017a). The High Level Panel on Water’s Bellagio Principles on
Valuing Water presents a global opportunity to rethink the values of water through five
fundamental principles (Box 1.6). These broad principles build a more explicit articulation
of best practices and experience in ascertaining and maximizing the benefits to be gained
from water.

Box 1.6 The Bellagio Principles for Valuing Water
1. Recognize water’s multiple values: Consider the multiple values to different stakeholders
in all decisions affecting water. There are deep interconnections between human needs,
economic well-being, spirituality and the viability of freshwater ecosystems that must be
considered by all.
2. Build trust: Conduct all processes to reconcile values in ways that are equitable, transparent
and inclusive of multiple values. Trade-offs will be inevitable, especially when water is
scarce. Inaction may also have costs that involve steeper trade-offs. These processes need
to be adaptive in the face of local and global changes.
3. Protect the sources: Value and protect all sources of water, including watersheds, rivers,
aquifers and associated ecosystems for current and future generations. There is growing
scarcity of water. Protecting sources and controlling pollutants and other pressures are
necessary for sustainable development.
4. Educate to empower: Promote education and public awareness about the essential role of
water and its intrinsic value. This will facilitate better-informed decision-making and more
sustainable water consumption patterns.
5. Invest and innovate: Increase investment in institutions, infrastructure, information and
innovation to realize the full potential and values of water. The complexity of the water
challenges should spur concerted action, innovation, institutional strengthening and realignment. These should harness new ideas, tools and solutions while drawing on existing
and indigenous knowledge and practices in ways that nurture the leaders of tomorrow.

This World Water Development Report assesses the opportunities and challenges to
determining the multiple values of water. Subsequent chapters view valuation through the
lenses of the broad perspectives of key stakeholders or interest groups. Each perspective
addresses how value has been, and is currently being, attributed to water, with which measures
and approaches, and with what degree of success, as well as the opportunities for, benefits
of and methodologies for integrated or nexus approaches. Important gaps in areas such as
data and monitoring, potentially constraining any future action agenda on valuing water, are
identified. Chapter 12 identifies further options for responding to the current challenges to
valuing water.

2.1
Introduction

The environment is central to water resources management. The environment is both the
source of water and a competitor for its use. The value of water as an integral component
of an ecosystem, the role of the environment in driving flows of water, sediments, nutrients,
energy and biota, as well as the interconnections between these flows in the landscape,
are central to water resources challenges. Most water allocation mechanisms nowadays
include the allocation of environmental water as a value domain. These mechanisms include:
water reserves, caps on consumption, sustainable abstraction limits, water markets, licence
conditions on infrastructure operators, and flow release rules and regimes for dams (Horne
et al., 2017a). Legislation on water pollution is among the most widespread and oldest of
water-related rules and regulations (WWAP, 2017).
But the status and trends of the environment–water interactions (see Prologue) clearly indicate
the need for much better incorporation of the value of the environment in water resources
management. The value of the diverse environmental aspects of water, including the value of
biodiversity, are particularly neglected (Arthington et al., 2018; IPBES, 2019a).
This chapter looks at the valuation of the nature–water relationship principally from an
economic perspective. However, Chapter 1 has noted that the scope of ‘economics’ in this
regard should be understood comprehensively and holistically. In particular, ‘economics’
should not be seen as limited to monetary valuation, nor to determining values solely through
market-based approaches. There are important values associated with water and nature, held
by communities or societies, that cannot be properly captured through economic frameworks.
These include, for example, spiritual, religious and cultural values or belief systems (Chapter 7).
These are not limited to indigenous peoples and can also exist, and be powerful, in a broad
range of societies. These values are often held without a valuation process – they just exist.
They are important to consider and can trump economic values.

2.2
The environmental
dimensions of the
resource – A key
consideration

The environment is central to the water cycle and an integral part of all aspects of water
management. The source of all water is the environment and all water abstracted by humans
eventually returns there, together with any impurities added to it. Changes to the environment
can influence the location, amount, timing and quality of water available for human use.
Human influences on the environment are usually negative for water resources. However, the
environment–water interface can be proactively managed in order to address water-related
challenges through what has become popularly known as ‘nature-based solutions’ (WWAP/
UN-Water, 2018). This approach centres on the concept of green, or natural, infrastructure that
can function in the same way as built/physical or grey infrastructure (Figure 2.1).

2.3
Valuing the
environment

The environment’s value can be expressed in terms of the role it plays in delivering water for
direct human uses, such as for drinking, irrigation or industrial use, dealing with extremes such
as flooding, or helping to deal with pollution. But the environment can also be a competing user
of water if, for example, demands are made to allocate water to the environment to support
fisheries or for aesthetic reasons. These are not entirely independent of each other and in both
cases the approach to valuation is similar.

2.3.1 The basis of valuation – nature’s contribution to people, including ecosystem
services
The various values of the environment, or ecosystems, are usually categorized and
measured as benefits delivered to people. ‘Nature’s contributions to people’ is the currently
intergovernmentally accepted terminology and “refers to all the benefits that humanity obtains
from nature: ecosystem goods and services, considered separately or in bundles, are included
in this category” (IPBES, 2019a, p. 51). Water-related ecosystem services, or bundles of them,
are those that play a particular role in the water cycle through the regulation of water flows and
water quality: for example, flood regulation and coastal storm protection, water erosion control
and sediment transport, water supply, water purification (nutrient recycling and pollution
absorption), and regulation of climate and precipitation. These groups of services influence
the amount of water, its location, timing of availability, and quality. In addition, all ecosystem
services are water-dependent, irrespective of their role in hydrology. Without water, ecosystems
cease to function.

Economic valuation of the source

|

31

In most studies, water-related ecosystem services are not usually treated as a distinct
or separate category and clusters or bundles of services must often be combined from
the underlying results to obtain relevant analyses and conclusions regarding water. Interrelationships of different ecosystem processes and functions can be complex. There are also
varying categorizations of the benefits these functions deliver to people. For example, IPBES
(2019a, p. 23) lists “regulation of freshwater quantity, location and timing” and “regulation of
freshwater and coastal water quality” as nature’s contributions to people that are explicitly
water-related, but “regulation of climate”, “regulation of hazards and extreme events” and
“physical and psychological experiences” (as, for example, relating to water landscapes) also
have a strong water-related element. Many of these contributions are inter-related; for example,
in the foregoing, freshwater quantity, timing and location are fundamental parameters of
hazards (e.g. flooding).

Significant values
can be attributed
to ecosystem
services that
relate to
supporting
resilience, or
reducing risks

Other analyses use different categorizations. Barredo et al. (2019), for example, use
‘provisioning services’ (‘water supply’), ‘regulating services’ (‘regulation of water flows, waste
treatment – water purification’) and ‘cultural and amenity services’ (e.g. ‘spiritual experience,
inspiration and aesthetic information’). Sediment regulation, both on land and in water, including
its formation, transport and deposition, is often not easily categorized and its importance as
a water-related service is often overlooked. Depending on the viewpoint, this is an important
function of, or service provided by, ecosystems and its benefits can be categorized as, or
included in, regulation of water quality or erosion, land formation or stabilization, and/or disaster
risk reduction (DDR). It is important that values attributed to water-related ecosystem services
must bear in mind which services are being included or excluded.

2.3.2 Overall values of ecosystem services
The value of nature’s contribution to people outstrips other economic values, including global
Gross Domestic Product (GDP). One estimate of the notional economic value of nature’s
contribution to people was US$125 trillion per year in 2011, around two-thirds higher than
global GDP at that time (Costanza et al., 2014). The costs of inaction, in terms of ecosystem
loss and degradation, are high. As reported by OECD (2019, p. 9), “between 1997 and 2011,
the world lost an estimated US$4–20 trillion per year in ecosystem services owing to land cover
change and US$6–11 trillion per year from land degradation.”
Significant values can be attributed to ecosystem services that relate to supporting resilience,
or reducing risks. In 2019, environment-related risks accounted for three of the top five risks
by likelihood and four of the top five by impact (World Economic Forum, 2019). Most disaster
risks and costs are water-related. For example: between 2000 and 2006, there were 2,163
water-related disasters, costing US$422 billion in damages and affecting 1.5 billion people
(Adikari and Yoshitani, 2009); 45% out of the 820 natural catastrophes registered in 2019 by
Munich Re were related to floods, flash floods and landslides (MunichRe, 2020). Many of these
disaster risks are exacerbated by the loss of relevant ecosystem services (WWAP/UN-Water,
2018), as these services played a role in preventing disasters in the first place. The values of
these services can be calculated (e.g. Batker et al., 2010), but they are often not recognized or
adequately included in economic planning, which tends to favour short-term gains over longerterm sustainability (IPBES, 2019b).
Estimates of value for ecosystem services vary depending on the location of the study, the
methods used, and the clusters and categories of services and biomes considered. In a review
of published valuation studies, De Groot et al. (2012) showed that different biomes have widely
varying total economic values (TEV) per unit area, ranging from less than US$1,000 to over
US$1,000,000 per hectare per year. Wetlands are by far the most valuable biomes per unit area,
by several orders of magnitude. However, this category includes coral reefs, which are an
outlier due to high tourism values.

32

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

The proportion of the total value that can be attributed to water-related ecosystem services
has not been systematically calculated but it is probably the majority of all ecosystem
services: the proportion (including water provisioning, climate regulation, erosion prevention,
disturbance moderation, waste treatment and nutrient cycling) averaged between studies
is 89% in the case of coastal systems and coastal wetlands, 83% for tropical forests, 65.5%
for inland wetlands and 46% for rivers and lakes, but less than 15% for temperate forest,
woodlands and grasslands (De Groot et al., 2012).

2.4
Methods used to
calculate values

The ecosystem services concept has given considerable impetus to continuing efforts
to document the value of ecosystems, including as natural infrastructure within water
management systems (Russi et al., 2013; Gilvear et al., 2017). These values and benefits are
being documented in increasingly transparent, sophisticated economic terms (Vörösmarty
et al., 2018).
Various methods are used to calculate ecosystem service values. These methods are
similar across ecosystem types. Some of those commonly used for water-related services
from forests (Barredo et al., 2019), a wide range of ecosystem types (De Groot et al., 2012)
and wetlands (Russi et al., 2013) include: contingent valuation, choice modelling, averting
behaviour,2 value transfer, related goods approaches, production functions, indirect opportunity
costs, restoration costs, hedonic pricing, replacement costs and preventive/defensive
expenditures.

2.4.1 Monetary valuation
Expressing the values of ecosystem services in monetary terms enables values to be more
easily compared with other economic assessments that often use monetary-based units.
Research on the monetary valuation of ecosystem services dates back to the early 1960s but
received wide attention with the publication of Costanza et al. (1997). Since then, there has
been increasing recognition of the monetary valuation of natural resources and ecosystem
services. Some reject monetary valuation because it undervalues nature, commodifies it or
suggests it can be traded (Conniff, 2012; Bresnihan, 2017), although this is not necessarily
the intention. But monetary valuation has been a major driver of elevating attention to the
environment because of the high values often generated, particularly regarding water.

2.4.2 Non-monetary values

The environment
can have
important values
that cannot,
or should not,
be constrained
or defined by
monetary-based
approaches

The environment can have important values that cannot, or should not, be constrained or
defined by monetary-based approaches. This applies particularly to such things as spiritual
experiences, inspiration for culture, art and design, aesthetic values, information for cognitive
development, and other ecosystem services generally categorized as cultural services
(TEEB, 2010). Such aspects as option, existence or bequest value, or intrinsic or relational
values (see Chapter 1) are particularly difficult to value in monetary terms. Most of these
values are also difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, they are important to include in estimates
of overall value and comparison between different measures of value.
Value can be determined primarily by religious beliefs such as, for example, the revering of
the Ganges River in the Hindu faith. Some societies reject the validity of the application of
economics to nature and the commodification of its benefits, such as, for example, concepts
of the rights of ‘Mother Earth’, whilst others reflect the value of natural resources by giving
them legal rights. Such value systems can be powerful in influencing policy and can override
any assessments based on economic or monetary approaches. Chapter 7 discusses these
aspects of value in further detail.

The existence of different value systems infers that it would be problematic to develop a
unified system of, and metrics for, valuing water and/or the environment. What is feasible is to
develop a common approach under which different environmental values or value systems can
be compared, contrasted and used to identify wise policy choices. A fundamental ingredient of
this is the full and meaningful participation of relevant stakeholder groups in assessments and
gender-sensitive decision-making. This is perhaps the most effective, and equitable, means to
capture the full spectrum of values. Often stakeholders alone know the true values in play to
them.

2.4.3 Natural capital accounting

Regarding nature
as natural capital
enables nature,
and its benefits,
to be compared
and understood
in terms of the
more traditional
economic
thinking that
often dominates
water-related
decision-making

Regarding nature as natural capital enables nature, and its benefits, to be compared and
understood in terms of the more traditional economic thinking that often dominates waterrelated decision-making. Natural capital is the stock of renewable and non-renewable
resources (e.g. plants, animals, air, water, soils, minerals) that combine to yield a flow of
benefits to people (United Nations, 2014). Natural capital accounting systematically measures
and reports on stocks and flows of natural capital. As in traditional economics, capital is
valued in terms of its production or potential production of benefits, including non-use, future
use or option values, which in this context are (potential) ecosystem services. These are
effectively the interest on the capital. Both monetary and non-monetary valuation methods can
be used. The underlying premise is that the environment should be recognized as an asset that
must be maintained and managed, with its contributions (services) better integrated into
commonly used accounting frameworks that support economic analysis (Box 2.1).

Box 2.1 The System of Environmental Economic Accounting for Water – The SEEA-Water
The SEEA-Water can be used to derive water-related indicators such as: access; use per capita
or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and value added; supply rates; availability per capita and
by type; productivity and use efficiency (Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.4); water
emissions (pollution loads) by GDP or per capita; water stress (SDG 6.4); and indicators for
most of the other SDG 6 targets and overlapping SDGs (UNDESA, 2012). SEEA-Water has
been recently applied in different countries for various goals: as a reference guide or tool to
organize relevant statistics to assess water at a national scale (e.g. Statistics Canada, 2016),
for compiling national water accounts (e.g. Government of Rwanda, 2019), for an integrated
assessment of water security in an aquifer-scale case study in Iran (Mahdavi et al., 2019), as
a procedure for the compilation of highly disaggregated water accounts in Finland (Salminen
et al., 2018), and to support decision-making processes of urban water management in
Ecuador (López et al., 2019).

Natural capital accounting approaches are commonly applied to nature-based solutions
(WWAP/UN-Water, 2018) in order to calculate values in play. The impacts of environmental
degradation on water-related costs are often well known; as is often the case, for example,
when estimating the value of watershed services and calculating the potential for, and scale of,
payments for ecosystem services schemes (examples are provided in Chapter 3).
As cases from the United Kingdom (UK) show, natural capital accounts can be generated
for countries, large organizations and businesses, cities, protected areas, and smaller-scale
areas of land and water (e.g. private estates and public parks).3 The World Bank-led Wealth
Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES) partnership encourages the
incorporation of the value of the environment in national economic accounts and development
planning.

Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

2.4.4 Assessing aggregate values
Multiple methods and approaches can be combined to reflect overall values for the
environment. This is usually achieved through the estimation of TEV that reflects the overall
suite of values involved, each of which may be calculated using a different method (Figure 2.2).

2.4.5 Levels of precision required
It can be quite challenging to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the value of waterrelated ecosystems and their full range of services. But different uses require different spatial
scales and methods of precision. Costanza et al. (2014), for example, suggest: low levels of
precision are required for raising awareness and interest at regional to global scales using total
values and macro-aggregates; low to medium levels for urban and regional land use planning
using values for changes by land use scenario; and, medium to high levels for payments for
ecosystem services at multiple scales using data for changes by actions.

2.4.6 Methods for integrating values into decision-making frameworks
At some stage it is necessary to compile information on the values of water and
ecosystems under a coherent decision-making framework. McCartney et al. (2019) provide
a comprehensive example of how to assess the ecosystem services people derive from the
Tana River basin, in Kenya, which enabled the benefits of natural and built infrastructure to be
optimized, thereby increasing overall economic gains.
TEEB (2010) outlines a six-step approach to navigate through the available options for
integrating ecosystem services in local and regional management. Box 2.2 explains the
approach with an example of the Kala Oya River basin in Sri Lanka.

Box 2.2 Application of a stepwise approach to identify options for optimizing ecosystem services in the Kala Oya River
basin in Sri Lanka
The Kala Oya River basin in Sri Lanka has a traditional irrigation system with human-made wetlands for water storage (known as
water tanks). Increasing water demand and unsustainable land use led to reduced water inflow and an increased sediment load.
Step 1: Specify and agree on the problem with stakeholders
Two challenges were identified: (i) competing water demands between traditional users, hydropower and modern agriculture;
and (ii) the need for improved tank management.
Step 2: Identify which ecosystem services are most relevant (to the decision to be made and covering the key stakeholders)
It became clear that, apart from the water tanks’ benefit for rice cultivation, the wetland provided other important ecosystem
services – fish stocks, lotus flowers, fodder and drinking water.
Step 3: Identify the information needs and select appropriate methods, as the study design determines what kind of
information you get
First, assessing the value of the tanks’ provisioning services would offer insights about people’s dependence on them. It was
decided to use participatory appraisal methods, market prices and labour costs. Second, three regulating/habitat services
were selected for a qualitative trend analysis (using literature and expert judgement): water recharge, soil retention and
habitat services.

Step 4: Assess expected changes in availability and distribution of ecosystem services
Rice production had been considered the principal benefit. But results showed that rice accounted on average for about
US$160 per hectare per year, while other provisioning services, including water supply, accounted for an average value of
about US$2,800. This was important for future water allocation negotiations.
Step 5: Identify and appraise policy options based on the analysis of expected changes in ecosystem services
To improve tank management, four scenarios were examined and probable future costs and benefits were jointly considered
(see table below) with qualitative information on the regulating/habitat services (indirect use trends in the table, estimated
based on likely outcomes through expert opinion; -7 equals worst case outcome: continued loss and decline, +7 equals best
case outcome: restoration and recovery).
Scenario 4 (i.e. removing silt and rehabilitating the tanks’ water storage capacity) was the best option with regard to all criteria.

Step 6: Assess social and environmental impacts of policy options, as changes in ecosystem services affect people differently
The scenario of rehabilitating the tanks’ water storage capacity was also the most expensive option, requiring labour for silt
removal (see Table above). As the tanks constituted a fully functioning secure water supply for 93% of households, these
costs were accepted locally.

2.4.7 Valuing the environmental services of water for waste assimilation and water
quality
Ecosystems have a certain assimilation capacity towards contaminants, depending on the
chemical in question, the natural background concentrations and the ambient water quality
standards. This ecosystem service is highly valuable – avoiding costs of treating all releases
– but is hardly ever quantified because it is considered ‘free’. Polluters also appropriate
themselves of freshwater volumes that are required to dilute pollutants to such an extent
that the quality of the water remains above the agreed water quality standards, negatively
impacting water availability. Transgressing beyond this background carrying capacity causes
pollution that creates health hazards, detrimentally affects biodiversity, raises the cost of
treating water and increases water stress (WWAP, 2017).
Biological oxygen demand (BOD) is commonly used as one indicator of water quality. BOD
measures to what extent pollution loads exceed ecosystem carrying capacity, resulting in
an oxygen deficit (demand). Data on BOD can be used in various ways to calculate values
associated with environmental pollution; for example, in a recent study assessing the impact
of BOD on GDP growth (Box 2.3).

Box 2.3 Estimating the impact of upstream biological oxygen demand (BOD) on downstream Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
To estimate the impact of increasing levels of BOD on downstream economic activity, local GDP data were matched to the
nearest upstream water quality monitoring station with data on BOD. Other factors that are known to impact GDP growth were
added as a set of controls, including weather variables, population, geography, intra-annual variations in water quality and
country-specific time trends that capture economic transitions. The results are striking, if not surprising. When the BOD level
exceeds 8 mg/L—a level at which rivers are considered heavily polluted— GDP growth falls by about a third. For middle-income
countries, where BOD is a bigger problem, the impact increases to almost half of growth lost. In high-income countries, where
levels of BOD are lower, GDP only declines marginally.
In effect, this approach estimates the costs of pollution, in this case using GDP, and therefore the value that would be delivered
were the environment less polluted.

Box 2.4 Estimating the value of surface water pollution accidents (SWPAs) in China
Estimation of economic losses due to SWPAs is referenced in China’s Environmental Protection Law. SWPA damages can be
divided into eight types: damage to human health; water supply suspension; damage to fisheries, to recreational functions, to
biological diversity; environmental property loss; accidents; and other, indirect losses. The same procedure for compensation
for traffic accidents was used in the valuation of damage to people’s lives. The functional replacement cost method was used
in economic estimation of the losses due to water supply suspension and loss of water’s recreational functions. Damage to
biological diversity was estimated by recovery cost analysis and damage to environmental property losses was calculated
using pollutant removal costs. The valuation procedure can be used by decision-makers for the economic estimation of
losses in SWPAs. Estimates of the economic losses of pollution accidents also help quantify potential costs associated with
increased risk sources along lakes/rivers and highlight the value of clean water to society as a whole.
Source: Adapted from Yao et al. (2016, p. 1).

The direct valuation of environmental degradation arising from water pollution is usually based
on the cost of damage: either through costs in preventing it (the maintenance cost approach,
e.g. infrastructure costs to reduce damage) or from the benefits of averting the damage (such
as human illness and premature death or any loss of productivity attributable to changes in
water quality) (UNDESA, 2012). A combination of approaches can be used to estimate the costs
of pollution (Box. 2.4). These reflect, at least in part, the value of water in its natural state in the
environment.
The cost-based approach has three variants: abatement cost – the most widely used
approach, which measures the cost of introducing technologies to prevent water pollution;
structural adjustment costs – the costs incurred to restructure the economy (production and/
or consumption patterns) in order to reduce water pollution or other forms of environmental
degradation to a given standard, which often requires complex economy-wide modelling; and
restoration cost – which measures the cost of restoring a damaged body of water, or ecosystem,
to an acceptable state (UNDESA, 2012).

2.5
Approaches that
support valuing
the environment–
water relationship

Improving attention to values of the environment–water relationship involves improved valuation
and mechanisms for incorporating those values into improved decision-making frameworks.

2.5.1 Nature-based solutions
Nature-based solutions use, or mimic, natural processes. They are being deployed at an everincreasing rate and are attracting an improved, if still too peripheral, proportion of water-related
financing (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018). The Green Infrastructure Guide for Water Management
(UNEP/UNEP-DHI/IUCN/TNC, 2014) describes various ecosystem-based management
approaches for water-related infrastructure projects. Innovation in nature-based solutions is
continuing with little sign of a slow-down (Vörösmarty et al., 2018). Specific principles and
standardized implementation guidelines have been developed for application in flood risk
management (Van Wesenbeeck et al., 2017). Nature-based solutions also play a significant role
in climate change adaptation and mitigation (UNESCO/UN-Water, 2020).
Valuation of ecosystem services plays a central role in evaluating nature-based options
and can be calculated from the reduction of water-related operational or capital cost, or
increased productivity gained (examples are provided in Chapter 3). The protection of highvalue catchments and water sources is increasingly recognized for conferring benefits to
downstream rural and urban users (Abell et al., 2017). The value of source protection is usually
calculated through measurably improved supplies for downstream users, as well as cost
savings associated with higher water quality and thus lower treatment costs. Investment in
watershed conservation could generate a positive return on investment for one in every four
cities (McDonald and Shemie, 2014). Water funds are innovative tools for promoting these
benefits (TNC, 2018). These approaches usually adopt payments for ecosystem services as the
mechanism to transfer benefits from beneficiaries to suppliers of services (see Box 3.2).

38

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

Nature-based solutions can deliver significant environmental secondary co-benefits: that is, the
conjunctive delivery of multiple water-related and other ecosystem services (WWAP/UN-Water,
2018). For example, they often deliver improved benefits such as biodiversity conservation,
fisheries, or recreation and tourism, which can tip investment decisions in their favour
(UNEP/UNEP-DHI/IUCN/TNC, 2014; WWAP/UN-Water, 2018). As such, they deliver the social,
economic and environmental co-benefits required under the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), including: access to water supply and sanitation services, food and energy security,
human health and livelihoods, economic growth, job creation, improved human settlements,
reduction in water-related disasters and climate risks, and last but not least, ecosystem
restoration and the protection of biodiversity. They also tend to support overall system
resilience.

2.5.2 Environmental flows
A specific flow regime in a river, capable of sustaining a complex set of aquatic habitats
and ecosystem processes, is referred to as an environmental flow or ‘e-flow’. Similar, but
not necessarily identical, concepts include in-stream flow needs, ecological reserves, the
ecological demand of water, environmental water allocation (or requirement), compensation
flow and minimum flow (WMO, 2019). Interdisciplinary bridges between the eco-hydrological
and social sciences have enabled a better integration of sociocultural and ecological values of
water (Poff et al., 2017; Jackson, 2017; Arthington et al., 2018). The growing ability of markets
to accommodate environmental water needs when supported by capable institutions (Garrick
et al., 2017; Horne et al., 2017b) has created ways to shift water back to the environment
without compromising urban water demands and increasing agricultural productivity.

Valuation of
ecosystem services
plays a central
role in evaluating
nature-based
options and can
be calculated from
the reduction of
water-related
operational or
capital cost,
or increased
productivity
gained

An evaluation methodology that enables the hydrological, ecological and ecosystem services
relationships in given rivers, including estuaries, is central to the effectiveness of an e-flow
(Acuña et al., 2013). Valuation of these services enables the identification of a desired suite of
ecosystem services and subsequently the hydrological regime required to deliver it. There is
a progression from the point where stresses are introduced into the ecosystem, to how these
impact on the ecosystem and, in turn, on the value of benefits to society (Figure 2.3). E-flows
represent the amount of water where this progression is optimal and sustainable.
Estimates of environmental flow requirements are being explicitly integrated into SDG
Indicator 6.4.2, to generate national datasets for monitoring water stress (FAO, 2019b). The
provision of environmental flows supports the achievement of other water-related goals and
targets, such as those addressing food security and nutrition from fisheries and flood recession
agriculture, and human health (Arthington et al., 2018; Vörösmarty et al., 2018).

2.5.3 Private sector initiatives and water stewardship
Business has become increasingly aware, beyond corporate social responsibility, of the risks of
not considering water-related impacts, which has prompted action towards associated alliance
building (Newborne and Dalton, 2016). Water stewardship refers to an approach to support
major water users to understand their water use and its impacts, and to work collaboratively
and transparently for sustainable water management within a catchment context (Box 2.5).
Several initiatives are active in this space: for example, the CEO Water Mandate and the
Business for Water Stewardship. The latter has over 1,200 companies in the United States of
America (USA) engaged in environmental water stewardship efforts that have improved the
quality of 72 billion litres of water, generating a purported economic value of US$1.4 trillion.

2.6
Alternative
sources:
Water reuse,
desalination
and supply
augmentation

Reusing water is the key to water conservation and enhancement opportunities that lead to
fit-for-purpose use of treated municipal wastewater and agricultural drainage water. Additional
opportunities to develop water resources exist in the form of desalinated potable water.
The volumes of some unconventional water resources, such as municipal wastewater and
desalinated water are 380 km3 and 35 km3, respectively. Accessing such sources can help
alleviate water scarcity in dry areas (UN-Water, 2020).

2.6.1 Water reuse
Recovering water, nutrients, precious metals and energy from waste streams are means of
delivering value added (WWAP, 2017). About 380 billion m3 of water can be recovered from
the annual volumes of wastewater produced. This type of water recovery is expected to reach
470 billion m3 by 2030 and 574 billion m3 by 2050 (Qadir et al., 2020). The full recovery of
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium from wastewater can offset 13.4% of the global demand
for these nutrients in agriculture, but current technologies of nutrient recovery from wastewater
have yet to reach 100% efficiency levels (Fernández-Arévalo et al., 2017; Ward et al., 2018).
Beyond nutrient recovery and economic gains, there are critical environmental benefits, such
as a reduction in eutrophication (Mayer et al., 2016).
The energy potential of wastewater is yet to be fully exploited (Frijns et al., 2013). Wastewater
contains more energy than is needed for its treatment and more and more wastewater
treatment plants are reaching internal energy self-sufficiency (Tarallo et al., 2015). There
are good opportunities of intensifying energy recovery from wastewater (Maktabifard et al.,
2018). Wastewater treatment facilities have the potential to produce surplus energy beyond
self-supply. Investments in energy efficiency and recovery activities based on life cycle
cost analysis in wastewater systems have the potential to deliver high rates of return. By
implementing current best management practices and integrating energy considerations
through step-by-step programmes, there is an opportunity to leapfrog sustainable
development, particularly in regions and countries where wastewater collection and treatment
is not always a given (Lackey and Fillmore, 2017). As an essential component of a circular
economy, resource recovery from municipal wastewater can generate new business
opportunities whilst simultaneously improving water supply and sanitation services.

Box 2.5 Water stewardship
The Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) has developed a detailed set of guidelines, the AWS International Water
Stewardship Standard 2.0, that aims to drive economic, social and environmental benefits at catchment scale, by engaging
‘water-using sites’ in understanding and addressing not only site water risks and opportunities, but also shared catchment
water challenges. Water-related costs and revenues are holistically assessed together with shared value creation that
considers economic value, social value and environmental value, including values that benefit stakeholders outside of the site.

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

Saline drainage water produced by irrigated agriculture can be reused for growing salttolerant crops, particularly for energy crops and renewable energy production, thereby
relaxing the growing pressure on already stretched water and energy resources (Qadir et al.,
2010). A range of plant species can be irrigated with saline water for biomass and renewable
energy production. Some promising examples are jatropha, toothbrush tree, Russian olive,
and sweet-stem sorghum (Lamers and Khamzina, 2008). Such use of saline water can
also contribute to carbon sequestration via biomass production and buildup of soil carbon
stocks, thereby reducing the impact of global warming. In addition, the hydraulic pressure
heads located at the regulated gated points in the saline drainage and collector networks
can be used for operating micro-turbines. As a source of decentralized and off-grid energy
production, these hydro-turbines represent an environmentally clean source of energy for
pumping water, lighting and heating, and have the potential to make the associated farming
communities more resilient to climate change impacts (Qadir et al., 2010).

2.6.2 Desalination

Over the past
decade, seawater
desalination
has experienced
an accelerated
growth driven
by advances
in membrane
technology and
material science

Desalinated water is an important water resource, which extends water supplies beyond
what is available from the hydrological cycle, providing a climate-independent and steady
supply of high-quality water (UN-Water, 2020). With around 16,000 operational desalination
plants, daily production of desalinated water stands at 95 million m3 (35 billion m3
annually) of clean water for use in industry, commerce, households, tourism, and high-value
agriculture. Almost half of the desalination capacity (44%) is in the still-growing Middle East
market, but markets in other regions are growing even faster, particularly in China, the USA
and Latin America (Jones et al., 2019).
Over the past decade, seawater desalination has experienced an accelerated growth driven
by advances in membrane technology and material science. A steady downward trend in
desalination costs, coupled with increasing costs of conventional water treatment and water
reuse driven by more stringent regulatory requirements, is expected to accelerate the current
trend of reliance on the ocean as an attractive and competitive water source (see Box 3.5).
These trends are likely to continue and to further establish seawater desalination as a
reliable drought-proof alternative for coastal communities worldwide in the next 15 years
(UN-Water, 2020).
Currently, more than 174 countries use desalination in one form or another to meet sector
water demand, supplying over 300 million people with potable water (IDA, 2020). Despite
declining costs, most desalination facilities are in high-income countries (67%), accounting
for 71% of the global desalination capacity. Conversely, less than 0.1% of the capacity
occurs in low-income countries (Jones et al., 2019).

2.6.3 Augmenting supply
Nature-based solutions, including catchment management, are the key means of
augmenting supply by, for example, recharging groundwater, sustaining surface water
flows, improving soil moisture retention or managing regional precipitation (see Chapter 2
and WWAP/UN-Water 2018). There are also various other infrastructure approaches to
augment water supply. Rainwater harvesting, usually involving the construction of microimpoundments, often in conjunction with green infrastructure such as groundwater or soil
water storage, can be a useful alternative to larger dams.

2.7
Constraints
and challenges

All too often
water-related
policy decisions
are based on a
limited suite of
values. In many
cases, other values
are known but not
included

Despite growing experience and improvements in valuation tools, some limitations still exist.
Barredo et al. (2019) list these as: (i) gaps in knowledge of interdependence of ecosystems and
their services – the value of one service may not easily take into account how other services
are being affected; (ii) preventing double-counting – the full range of complementary and
competitive services must be distinguished before any aggregation of values is completed; (iii)
spatial issues – ecosystem services are best evaluated across their full geographical extent,
which may not fit well with the spatial scale of valuation; (iv) temporal issues – impacts on
ecosystems and their services may extend well beyond a standard time period of a given policy
(project) appraisal; (v) environmental limits – the services that ecosystems provide depend
not only on the scale and function of the ecosystem but also, crucially, on its conditions and
biodiversity levels, and studies typically estimate marginal change at a few points along the
demand curve but applying these values to non-marginal changes is not appropriate; (vi)
dealing with uncertainty – there is often no consensus on certain aspects, but an option for
estimating uncertainty is to conduct a sensitivity analysis; and (vii) data transfer and knowledge
gaps – data transfer is challenging because of differing social and environmental contexts,
characteristics and time periods, as well as the inability to deal with the valuation of novel
impacts – a number of initiatives are attempting to build databases to support knowledge
transfer, such as a database on Forest Ecosystem Service Valuation Studies (Thünen Institute,
n.d.), woodland valuation tools (Scottish Government, n.d.) and The Economics of Ecosystems
and Biodiversity Valuation Database (Van der Ploeg and De Groot, 2010).
Various practical barriers are reported for integrating valuation of ecosystem services in policy
decisions (e.g. Russi et al., 2013; Costanza et al., 2014; Barredo et al., 2019). These include: (i)
cultural barriers – there are often reservations to considering economic approaches for solving
environmental challenges; (ii) methodological barriers – often, there are no generally accepted
procedural rules amidst the methodological complexities of valuation; and (iii) political barriers
– difficulty in implementing and communicating political decisions based on intangible values,
including from the monetization of services with private and public goods characteristics.
The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services has
provided a comprehensive overview of gaps in knowledge (IPBES, 2019b). These include gaps
in data, inventories and monitoring on: nature and the drivers of change; biomes and units of
analysis; taxonomy; links between nature, nature’s contributions to people and drivers with
respect to targets and goals; integrated scenarios and modelling studies; potential policy
approaches; and the incorporation of knowledge of indigenous peoples and local communities.
All too often water-related policy decisions are based on a limited suite of values. In many
cases, other values are known but not included. There is little point improving environmental
valuation if the policy context is not sensitive to incorporating diverse values. Value-based
policy-making is a prerequisite for subsequently enabling environmental values, or any values,
to be properly considered and reflected in decisions.
Environmental values inescapably need to include different perspectives of economic
valuation, including monetary and non-monetary values, as well as other cultural and societal
beliefs or value judgements. The greatest need, therefore, is for tools that compare and
contrast diverse values. This need is common to many other aspects of water values and
considered further in Chapter 7.

Introduction

The value of water to society is underpinned by hydraulic infrastructure that serves to store
or move water. This can be either built (grey) or natural (green). ‘Soft’ infrastructure, such as
organizational infrastructure (e.g. institutions or social networks), is not covered here.
There is little doubt that, overall, hydraulic infrastructure has delivered substantial social and
economic benefits. It is argued (e.g. by Muller et al., 2015) that socio-economic development is
curtailed in countries that have insufficient infrastructure to manage water, as a result of which
many developing countries are held hostage to their hydrology. Therefore, more infrastructure
is needed. However, past experience shows that the valuation of hydraulic infrastructure has
been seriously flawed, particularly for large dams (Box 3.1).

Box 3.1 Experiences with the valuation of large dams
The World Commission on Dams (2000) concluded that: inadequate valuation was a significant factor in the poor or negative
performance of many large dams; in too many cases social and environmental costs have been unacceptable; substantive
evaluations of completed projects are few in number, narrow in scope, poorly integrated across impact categories and scales,
and inadequately linked to decisions on operations; there were a significant number of shortcomings in the valuation of dams
in the proposal, design and implementation stages; and many dams were not built based on a comprehensive assessment
and evaluation of the technical, financial and economic criteria applicable at the time, much less the social and environmental
criteria that apply in today’s context.
It is doubtful that things have substantially improved in practice in the meantime. For example, key findings of an assessment
of dam building under the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), using known standards from the World
Commission on Dams (2000) and the International Hydropower Association’s Sustainability Assessment Protocol (IHA, 2010)
included that: whereas a laudable development rationale has emerged, benefits tend to be overstated and skewed; risks often
outweigh the rewards; costs to communities and the environment have been high; and assessments were not based on a
robust assessment of options (International Rivers, 2012).

By 2030, investment in water and sanitation infrastructure will need to be around US$0.9–1.5 trillion
per year, roughly 20% of the total requirement for all types of infrastructure investment (OECD, 2017b).
About 70% of this total infrastructure investment will be in the global South, with a large share
in rapidly growing urban areas (GCEC, 2016). In developed countries, large investments will be
required for renovation and upgrade. The number of large water infrastructure projects is expected
to increase in world regions where precious natural resources are located, requiring significant
trade-offs (Opperman et al., 2015). Yet, the values of ecosystem services and social impacts remain
insufficiently addressed in major water engineering projects (Hansjürgens et al., 2016), despite social
and environmental safeguards (Skinner and Haas, 2014).
Considering the sums of money invested in water infrastructure, it could be reasonably expected
that the valuation of costs and benefits would be well developed, standardized at least to some
degree, and widely applied. This is not so, and, as will be shown, societal benefits delivered are
often unquantified, costs (particularly external costs) are not adequately accounted for, options
are often not adequately valued and compared, and data are often poor with almost universally
outdated or unrepresentative hydrological data. According to the Water Integrity Outlook (Water
Integrity Network, 2016), no part of the water financing system, public or private, is immune from
corruption or integrity failures and about 10% of investment is lost to corruption, equalling about
US$75 billion each year.
This chapter discusses how improved attention to the valuation of hydraulic infrastructure can
help identify the full range of costs and benefits in play and thereby help maximize its economic,
social and environmental benefits.

3.2
Values of global
benefits of water
infrastructure

Whilst there are various estimates of global investments in hydraulic infrastructure (see above),
less is known about global benefits. There are some estimates of national water infrastructure
value that can be implied from projected benefits delivered. For example, in the United States of
America (USA), current national water infrastructure capital needs are US$123 billion per year,
with an aggregate economic impact of US$220 billion in annual economic activity and 1.3 million
jobs, and an added indirect benefit of US$140 billion (The Value of Water Campaign, 2017). But
these kinds of estimates are not available for the majority of countries.
Some indications of global values can be implied from the costs of infrastructure deficits or
infrastructure failure. In 2015, the economic losses caused by water risks were estimated at
approximately US$500 billion annually (Sadoff et al., 2015). Water-related losses in agriculture,
health, income and property could result in a decline by as much as 6% of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) by 2050 and lead to sustained negative growth in some regions of the world
(World Bank, 2016a). In the USA, service disruptions put US$43.5 billion in daily economic
activity at risk (The Value of Water Campaign, 2017). Water shortages consistently rank
among the global risks of greatest concern to policy-makers and business leaders (World
Economic Forum, 2019). These concerns are real. The global population experiencing severe
water scarcity is increasing from 32 million people in 1900 to a projected 3.1 billion people
by 2050 (Kummu et al., 2010; Gosling and Arnell, 2016). Costanza et al. (2014) valued the
water-related services provided by nature at US$29 trillion per year, and between 1997 and
2011 the estimated loss in annual services from ecosystems was US$2.7 trillion for swamps
and floodplains, and US$7.2 trillion for tidal marshes and mangroves. Asia’s poor river health
alone could threaten US$1.75 trillion in ecosystem services annually (ADB/APWF, 2013). With
financing needs for water infrastructure ranging from US$6.7 trillion to US$22.6 trillion by 2030
(WWC/OECD, 2015), these previous figures on benefits suggest that investments in both grey
and green water infrastructure have the potential to deliver a good economic return, in addition
to often unquantifiable social and human welfare returns.

3.3
Methods and
approaches to
the valuation
of hydraulic
infrastructure

The valuation of hydraulic infrastructure is beset with conceptual and methodological
difficulties, particularly regarding non-consumptive use, and indirect and non-use values. At
an empirical level, the value of this infrastructure can be determined through the cumulative
value it represents to the various end uses of the water. But these values are often not well
established.

3.3.1 General concepts and approaches
Well-established methodologies are available for valuing hydraulic infrastructure. For natural,
or green, infrastructure, and for assessing many environmental impacts of built (grey)
infrastructure, the methodologies centre on the valuation of ecosystem services, which is
covered in more detail in Chapter 2. Onuma and Tsuge (2018) present a methodology to
identify the conditions under which introducing green infrastructure is desirable, and the point
at which it is preferable to grey infrastructure. On the other hand, WWAP/UN-Water (2018)
stresses that separating green from grey infrastructure is a false dichotomy and that the
values of both should be considered together, with their deployment being mutually supportive
(Box 3.2).
The most widely published approaches for the valuation of grey infrastructure relate to large
dams (World Commission on Dams, 2000) and include direct methods, such as marketbased or stated preference approaches, and indirect methods, such as revealed preferences
or choice modelling (see Chapter 1 for further details). Most methods of valuing water
infrastructure centre on a cost–benefit approach, but there is a tendency to overestimate
benefits and underestimate costs, and in particular to not include all costs (e.g. World
Commission on Dams, 2000). The most common shortcomings in valuations relate to social
and environmental costs. One of the most critical questions is ‘value to whom’. Valuations tend
to excessively focus on target beneficiaries while other stakeholders may benefit less or even
be negatively impacted.

Box 3.2 Valuations help identify how green infrastructure supports grey infrastructure – The case of the Itaipu Dam in
Brazil
The Itaipu Dam in Brazil is among the world’s largest in terms of hydropower generation. However, due to the nature of the
soils in its catchment area and land use practices of local farmers, the Itaipu Reservoir (like most others) is vulnerable to
excessive sediment loads that gradually fill it and reduce the storage capacity, and therefore shorten the reservoir’s life
expectancy, while increasing maintenance costs.
Natural capital accounting (described further in
Chapter 2) identified relevant natural capital flows
(ecosystem services). Farmers in the watershed
were able to develop a quantified scoring system
that could account for how much each farm might
contribute to reducing siltation (Laurent et al.,
2011). This enabled farmers to be considered as
‘water producers’ by the National Water Agency,
which assigns values to the ecosystem services
generated by farms participating in the programme
based on their contribution to savings in terms of
dam maintenance, operational costs and capital
depreciation (ANA, 2011). The resulting programme,
Cultivando Água Boa (“cultivating good water”),
Itaipu Dam, Brazil. Photo: © nicolasdecorte/Shutterstock.com
has established a partnership with farmers to
achieve mutual goals of sustainability based largely on the adoption of no-till farming (Mello and Van Raij, 2006). The life
expectancy of the dam complex has now been increased from 60 years to 350 years. Additionally, other environmental
benefits are delivered (such as reduced nutrient runoff and biodiversity conservation) and, importantly, farm productivity
and sustainability have also increased – presenting a win-win scenario for farmers and the hydropower company.

questions is
‘value to whom’.

Because water infrastructure assets are not commonly traded, evidence of their market-based
fair value may be limited. Therefore, most water business accounting methods estimate fair
value based on the Net Present Value of expected incomes, on depreciated replacement cost,
or current replacement cost (Box 3.3). When the business operation is effectively not-for-profit,
it is inappropriate to value water supply infrastructure assets on the basis of future expected
earnings. In such case, a valuation based on depreciated replacement cost gives a better idea
of the future expected benefits arising from holding these assets. It also provides a better idea
of the exposure of the government/community to loss due to extreme events (Comisari et al.,
2011).
Unit Reference Value (URV) approaches have been used to identify the cost of water per unit
volume for water management schemes. For example, in South Africa a URV was developed
in the 1980s. In its most basic form, it is calculated as the discounted present value of the
total (capital and operational) life-cycle cost of a water augmentation or management scheme,
divided by the discounted incremental increase in water supply (Bester et al., 2020).
However, a major shortcoming in many approaches, including most of those listed immediately
above, is that they focus mainly on financial costs (cash flows, and capital and operational
expenditure) and financial returns. They often omit indirect costs, and in particular social and
environmental costs, which are treated as externalities. As noted in Chapter 1, neither the price
of water, nor the costs of its delivery, accurately reflect value. Value needs to be assessed
based on balancing the full suite of all costs and benefits, monetary and non-monetary,
direct and indirect. Using ‘total economic value’ is one approach that can better reflect these
broader considerations as detailed further in Chapters 1 and 2. A full cost–benefit analysis
of a water infrastructure project will therefore involve complex economic assessments. It will
also necessarily involve assumptions regarding such things as risks, discount rates, project

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

longevity, depreciation rates and interest rates. Not only does this allow for a high degree
of latitude, and potential bias, in estimates, it also leads to the significant problem that
the circumstances upon which assumptions are based can change (Box 3.4).
The costs of dam removal are rarely, if ever, factored into valuations at design stage.
Dam removal can be required where structures become unsafe or redundant.

Box 3.3 Why and how to value water infrastructure assets?
Asset value can vary dramatically depending on the valuation basis and the nature of the assets involved. Therefore,
it is necessary to determine for which reasons the asset value is being estimated. Possible reasons for valuing water
infrastructure assets include:
• To measure the net worth; that is, to inform the owners (private or public) of their wealth held;
• To establish a possible sale price for the assets in question;
• To appraise owners of the likely replacement cost of the asset in the event of its destruction or damage;
• To generate estimates of return on the asset; and
• As a basis for generating ongoing measures of productivity.
Key economic and accounting concepts include:
Fair value – The amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties
in an arm’s length transaction. If there is no market-based evidence, fair value can be estimated using an income or a
depreciated replacement cost approach.
For estimating return on water assets, viable valuation bases include:
Current Replacement Cost – The cost to construct or replace the exact same asset today, regardless of the depreciation
incurred.
Depreciated Replacement Cost – the current replacement cost, taking into account accumulated depreciation, generally a
more reliable measure of the remaining economic benefits of the asset compared to current replacement cost.
Net Present Value (or value in use, discounted cash flow, internal rate of return) – the present value of future cash flows
expected to be derived from an asset.
Market valuation is not always used, either because such valuation is not possible, or because it is considered inappropriate
in the circumstances. In commercial accounting, either a Depreciated Replacement Cost or an income approach is generally
used if market values are not available or are considered inappropriate.

Box 3.4 Applying a probabilistic cost–benefit analysis (CBA) to the Three Gorges Dam, China
Morimoto and Hope (2004) applied a comprehensive probabilistic CBA to the Three Gorges Dam in China. This CBA took
project uncertainty into account and tried to deliver more robust and justifiable results than those produced by the more usual
deterministic CBAs or multi-criteria analysis. Thus, the distribution of the net present value could be calculated and the most
significant impacts identified. The results showed that, even though the reasonable and usual assumptions at the time of
construction foresaw positive project impacts, these were highly sensitive to valuation methods, the choice of discount rates
and project uncertainty. For example, costs of alternative renewable energy sources (such as solar) are now substantially less
than at project design, making significant differences to projected hydropower costs and benefits. The authors also note that
most previous studies focused only on each impact of the dam independently, and employed a mainly qualitative approach to
both valuations of each impact and the comparison of values derived.

3.3.2 Assessing economic versus financial viability
It is important to recognize the differences between valuations based on economic or
financial viability. Financial viability is the ability of an entity to continue to achieve its
operating objectives, usually a defined financial rate of return, and fulfil its mission from
a financial perspective over the long term. Economic viability assesses whether a project
provides an overall positive net economic contribution to society after all costs and benefits
have been accounted for, including social, environmental and financial costs and benefits
to society (IHA, 2020). Therefore, a project that is financially viable is not necessarily
economically viable, and vice versa. Despite this, many projects have been founded on
financial valuations only, and even for those, cost recovery assumptions are hardly ever
achieved in reality (World Commission on Dams, 2000).

value of flexible
and adaptive
strategies and
‘no-regrets’based decisionmaking

Current approaches for financing (Chapter 10) and the models employed do not encourage
the required level of attention to the flexible, multi-purpose infrastructure that is needed for
future water security. Moreover, despite the vast sums invested, the values and competing
priorities of different affected stakeholders have not been adequately considered in past
infrastructure financing (WWC/OECD, 2015). Water infrastructure investment needs to
become more efficient to help properly maintain existing assets and also to “avoid building
future liabilities” (WWC/OECD, 2015, p. III). Better valuing of water could contribute solutions
to this challenge, including in the area of good water governance, where integrity and
transparency will be paramount.

3.3.3 Factoring in capital and operational costs
A key question in valuation is whether large capital and operational and maintenance (O&M)
costs are included in subsequent valuations of end uses. Full-cost charging for water services
is the exception rather than the rule. In many countries, only part or all of the operational
costs are recovered, and capital investments are covered by public funds (WWF, 2003). Large
water infrastructure projects, and in particular large dams, often show a poor financial and
economic performance. Usually, they fail to recover operation and maintenance costs, which
suggests that even where it is an explicit objective, recovery of capital costs will be limited
(World Commission on Dams, 2000). Many dams are multi-purpose, providing, for example,
hydropower, irrigation, fisheries and flood control. Allocating costs to the various uses can
be challenging. While valuation needs to somehow balance all benefits and costs of different
water uses, it is artificial if capital and O&M costs are not factored in.

3.3.4 Recognizing that values can change
Values used to calculate the cost–benefit of projects can change. For example, the costs
of renewable energy sources like solar or wind have gone significantly down over the past
decade, a trend that is expected to continue (IEA, 2020). Hence, the original cost–benefit
assumptions of hydropower dams may no longer hold true (an example is provided in
Box 3.4). These reductions in renewable energy costs can also make water infrastructure
more economically viable, such as in the case of desalination (Box 3.5; see Section 2.6.2).

Box 3.5 Valuing desalination
Where freshwater is scarce, its value is high. If coupled with water reuse for irrigation,
desalination reduces freshwater abstraction and augments water supply. The environmental
impacts of this procedure can be moderated if it is powered by renewable energy (Pistocchi et al.,
2020). In Israel, desalination plants currently provide about a quarter of the potable water supply,
and there are plans to expand this capacity. Water shortages have often caused economic losses
affecting the entire Israeli economy. The economic value of desalinated seawater, determined in
terms of the reduction in water shortages, is revealed to be about US$4 per m³: much more than
the direct costs of the desalination process (Palatnik, 2019).

In addition, the potential for future changes in societal values, such as increased values
placed on the environment and recreation, can lead to calls for dam removal. For example,
recovery of salmon stocks has been a major driver of dam removal in the USA (Whitelaw
and McMullen, 2002). That values can change over time highlights the value of flexible and
adaptive strategies and ‘no-regrets’-based decision-making.

3.3.5 Water storage
The storage of water is an important objective of water infrastructure in order to deal with
variations in the supply and availability of water, as well as in water demand. All parts of
the hydrosphere, including oceans, lakes, soils, groundwater and the atmosphere act as
reservoirs, as do human-built reservoirs that principally use dams. Despite the abundance
of dams, by far the largest stores of freshwater are still contained in natural systems.
Trends in water storage
There are widespread declines in total water storage and associated freshwater availability
that are primarily attributed to the intensive overextraction of groundwater and an
increasing temperature-induced surface water loss (Liu et al., 2019). Impacts of climate
change on land water storage trends exceed those of direct human intervention by about a
factor of 2 (Scanlon et al., 2018). Globally, built reservoir capacity per person is decreasing
(Figure 3.1), as reservoir expansion has not been able to keep pace with population
growth, but also because storage capacity of existing reservoirs is decreasing chiefly due
to sedimentation. Average annual storage volume losses equal about 1% of total built
reservoir capacity, and the estimated costs for restoring these losses are approximately
US$13 billion per year (George et al., 2017). An assessment of the value of storage
capacity for enhancing water security in the world’s 400 largest river basins identified water
shortage risks in many parts of Africa, as well as in Australia, northern China, India, Spain
and the western USA (Gaupp et al., 2015).

Losses in artificial reservoir storage due to sedimentation increase depreciation rates on

sediment abatement measures – implemented chiefly through nature-based solutions for
improved catchment management (see WWAP/UN-Water, 2018).

Combined with the increasing need for storage, these trends question whether expansion of
artificial reservoir capacity should be a central component of a sustainable water resources
strategy (Wisser et al., 2013). There are viable alternatives such as: (i) recognizing the
comparative value of storage in, or the conjunctive use of, natural systems, which is not only
where most storage actually occurs but also where the main opportunities for sustainably
increasing storage value can be found; (ii) recognizing the value of reducing demand;
(iii) increasing supply through, for example, improved land management or water reuse; and
(iv) using decentralized solutions.

Evaporative losses
Artificial lakes and reservoirs suffer significant losses from increased evaporation as
compared to the evaporation from the original river, estimated from AQUASTAT data at
346 km3/year globally (FAO, 2015), roughly 10% of total global water withdrawals. Losses can
be expected to be proportionately higher than this average in hotter arid regions, which is
also where water tends to be scarcer. These losses have a significant impact on valuations
that are based on volumes of water used – suggesting that, on average, these volumes
will be twice the amount measured directly. This highlights the value of the environment
in storing water where evaporative losses can be lower. For example, groundwater dams
deliver value by slowing groundwater flows, reducing evaporative losses and creating
additional storage in the underground reservoir (aquifer) behind them (Onder and Yilmaz,
2005). Increasingly, aquifers and built surface storage are being managed together. Most
conjunctive systems usually focus on managing demand by alternating reservoir versus
aquifer use depending on seasons and demand. Aquifer recharge can be proactively
increased through land management (Box 3.6).

Box 3.6 Managed aquifer recharge using green infrastructure: Valuing costs and benefits of
water supply and other social, environmental and resilience services
Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) uses a broad set of green infrastructure solutions that
harness the ecosystem services and natural infrastructure provided by well-functioning land
and its subsurface. Such solutions, which belong to a broader category of Groundwater-Based
Natural Infrastructure (GRIPP, n.d.), are increasingly incorporated as part of integrated water
management solutions to increase water security and resilience and to sustain environmental
services. While increasing water storage and availability are key drivers, MAR generally also
reduces evaporation from, and reduces the land footprint of, alternative surface water storage.
In terms of costs, most of the schemes using natural water for recharge are much cheaper
than highly engineered schemes that use recycled water or apply wells for injecting new water,
as indicated by a recent review of 28 long-standing MAR cases from around the world (Zheng
et al., forthcoming). The same assessment indicates that investments in these solutions are
practically always attractive, with benefit–cost ratios ranging from 1.3 to around 7 for a wide
range of types of solutions. Benefits are calculated from estimated costs of the next-best
alternative water source or the proportion of the value of production attributed to the recharged
water. Ratios would be even higher if other co-benefits (which may be more difficult to assess)
are included, such as water storage, socio-economic benefits, and positive impacts on health,
biodiversity and environmental values. Further analysis of these benefits would provide
additional evidence and incentive to guide policies and investment in MAR.

Box 3.7 Valuing optimization of dam storage and release
Dam operators face pressures regarding the timing of water release. Direct users (e.g. for irrigation or domestic supply)
may argue that water should be stored to minimize risks of shortages. However, this will reduce potential economic and
environmental benefits downstream. Valuations are central to optimizing system performance.
Economic carryover storage value functions (COSVFs) are a means to calculate the value of storage and release to deal
with risks and uncertainty in interannual inflow. For example, when applied to 30 reservoirs, 22 aquifers, and 51 urban and
agricultural demand sites in the California Valley (USA), optimized interannual reservoir operation reduces the average annual
scarcity volume and costs by 80% and 98%, respectively (Khadem et al., 2018). Coordination of multi-reservoir systems
can enhance net benefits from irrigation and hydropower by 3–12%, with coordination benefits increasing with the water
availability and inflow variability (Jeuland, 2020).
Built water infrastructure impacts the balance of services provided by a river and its flow regime. Mandatory minimum
environmental releases do not account for the inherent and often complex trade-offs and synergies that must be considered
in selecting a balance of ecosystem and engineered services. Using multiple performance metrics, covering the suite of
ecosystem and engineered services in play, enables a better understanding of the interactions between natural and built
assets. This helps in the identification of river basin interventions that deliver optimized value by appropriately trading off their
services (Hurford et al., 2020).

Valuation of operational measures for dam storage and discharge
There are significant non-use values associated with the way in which reservoirs store and
release water. Releasing too much water immediately can threaten future direct use supplies
and costs, but not releasing enough creates immediate economic and environmental losses
and hardship downstream. The timing of release of water from reservoirs can have large
impacts on biological productivity and livelihoods downstream and therefore increase non-use
values (Box 3.7).

3.4
Valuing risk
and resilience

Water-related risk and resilience can have very high values. In a survey of 525 investors with
US$96 trillion in assets, 45% reported exposure to substantive risks from water insecurity –
risks that threaten their reputation and license to operate, the security of their supply chains,
their financial stability, and their ability to grow. Among the companies reporting exposure,
the combined business value at risk topped out at US$425 billion with about 40% of the risks
anticipated to hit within the next 1–3 years (CDP, 2020).
Understanding the risk of multiple stressors and the importance of resource resilience in water
infrastructure systems has always been essential, but its importance is especially pronounced
in the face of climate change, which will have an impact on the risk factors. Managing
water under increasing uncertainty and risk was the subject of the fourth World Water
Development Report in 2012 (WWAP, 2012). Values associated with risk and resilience are
often not adequately considered in strategies or assessments. Although engineers have wellestablished methodologies for assessing the risks of failure of individual constructed hydraulic
structures, catastrophic failures of individual structures can occur. However, as opposed to
failure of individual structures, there are bigger and more systemic risks. For example, those
from natural and human-made disasters (e.g. flood, drought, desertification, water pollution
incidents, etc.) or water system failures.
Resilience of water infrastructure refers to its capacity to avoid or recover quickly from
difficulties, stresses or shocks. The ability of water infrastructure to continue to deliver its
benefits in ordinary as well as extraordinary circumstances can be defined as resilience value.
The value of resilience is reflected in the avoided costs of system failures or the speed of
recovery from them.

There is a widespread assumption that built water infrastructure increases resilience and
reduces risks. However, this is not always the case. For example, in India, 40% of thermal
power plants are located in water-scarce areas, and between 2013 and 2016 the largest energy
utilities in the country suffered losses of US$1.4 billion due to climate change when they were
forced to temporarily shut down (Luo et al., 2018). The expansion of constructed reservoirs
to improve resilience to water shortages is hotly debated in many places around the world.
For example, Di Baldassarre et al. (2018) argue that there are two counterintuitive dynamics
that should be considered in this debate: supply–demand cycles that describe instances
where increasing water supply enables higher water demand, which can quickly offset the
initial benefits of reservoirs; or where overreliance on reservoirs increases vulnerability and
therefore the potential damage caused by droughts. It is well established that in some cases
water infrastructure can significantly increase risks and their impacts. Valuation of ecosystem
services in play can illuminate the hidden costs of water management infrastructure. For
example, degradation of wetland values in the Mississippi Delta (USA) caused by sediment
trapping behind dams contributed to increased impacts of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans
in 2005 (Batker et al., 2010). Worryingly, many of the world’s population centres are located in
river deltas with a similar history of infrastructure development upstream.

Water-related risk
and resilience can
have very high
values

Using a spatial framework that quantifies multiple stressors and accounts for downstream
impacts, Vörösmarty et al. (2010) drew attention to the pitfalls of development overly reliant
on built infrastructure. They concluded that despite this infrastructure, nearly 80% of the
world’s population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in
water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their
underlying causes, but leaves them vulnerable to climate-induced hydrological changes. At the
same time, less wealthy nations remain vulnerable, but have options as to how to proceed. The
authors conclude that a cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and
management responses to this crisis, underscoring the necessity of limiting threats at their
source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms.
Risk assessments provide opportunities to incorporate system resilience and multiple
stressors in the management of present and future socio-ecological values. While this is
gradually being embraced by the water sector, the term resilience itself is not yet universally
defined, nor has it become a standard part of water resources management (Makropoulos
et al., 2018). More work is needed to evaluate climate change-related risks and their systematic
uptake in water management (UNESCO/UN-Water, 2020). As with most strategies and plans,
participation of the local population and the incorporation of local knowledge are key means to
identify values in play (Box 3.8).

Box 3.8 Incorporating civil values and local knowledge in risk reduction strategies
Regarding the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, De Oliveira and Paleo (2016) noted that
overreliance on technical information and on the opinion of experts occurred side by side with
negligence of local knowledge and lack of effective public participation in decision-making,
creating a sense of overconfidence regarding scientific knowledge and new infrastructure’s
abilities to withstand future disasters.
Imamura et al. (2016) found that, even in high-risk areas and subsequent to recent significant
disasters, people who frequently visit the sea preferred ecosystem conservation and disliked
seawall construction, whereas people strongly recognizing disaster risks preferred seawall
construction. They also concluded that civil trust in scientific information affects civil
preferences regarding coastal management.

Risk assessment methodologies are continually being improved (Box 3.9). Most centre on
applying knowledge of the interdependencies of relevant social and ecological systems
within the landscape, and assigning magnitudes and probabilities of hazards to evaluate the
probable consequences of multiple stressors and/or future events. The outcomes inform
trade-off considerations regarding the adaptive management of water resources to achieve
sustainable outcomes (O’Brien et al., 2018). In all risk assessments, knowledge of the
uncertainty in the predictions is critical and should always be considered alongside the risk
outcomes.
Infrastructure value chains are proving a useful concept for connecting the concepts of
resilience and value in the context of the infrastructure life cycle. The concept is familiar to
most professionals working on the design, delivery and operation of infrastructure systems
(Avello et al., 2019). Methodologies for assessing resilience value are constantly improving.
For example, Makropoulos et al. (2018) describe a methodology for assessing resilience of
urban water supplies using a stress test methodology that might also assist in the uptake
and evolution of resilience thinking in strategic water infrastructure decision-making.
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development (WBCSD) have jointly developed tools and approaches for assessing waterrelated risks and challenges for companies and investors (Morgan et al., 2020).
Attention to the values of green infrastructure in risk reduction has increased in recent
times. For example, the values and benefits of healthy, resilient ecosystems have been
considered in the context of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR,
2015) and recent guidance for implementation of nature-based flood protection (World Bank,
2017). As is the case with grey infrastructure, inappropriately designed or sited green
infrastructure can also increase risks. For example, wetlands are widely reported to ‘act
like a sponge’, reducing floods and preventing droughts, but some headwater wetlands can
increase downstream flooding (Bullock and Acreman, 2003).

Box 3.9 Ecological risk assessments for dam development in Africa
Ecological risk assessments have been undertaken to evaluate the synergistic effects of
multiple flow-, water quality- and habitat-altering stressors associated with dam development
and operation in Africa. In the Nile, Niger and Orange-Vaal River basins, these tools have been
implemented to establish environmental flows in the context of the synergist effects of nonflow variables, the resilience of ecosystems and the vulnerability of human communities to
stressors associated with water resource developments. In the Orange-Vaal and part of the
Nile basin, the risk that resources have already been over-allocated is high, demonstrating
that use exceeds the resilience of the system to stressors and that continued developments
will probably be unsustainable. In the Orange-Vaal case study, the South African government
now financially compensates Lesotho for the value of ecosystem services if use exceeds
ecosystem resilience. In other parts of the Nile and Niger River basin, however, there is
opportunity for further sustainable development of the existing green infrastructure and for
offsetting the use of threatened resources.

Valuation of hydraulic infrastructure

3.5
Ways forward

Valuation of water infrastructure involves various scales, from site-specific to system-wide,
taking account of the type of project, as well as the hydrological, environmental and social
conditions. Past experience with valuation of water infrastructure highlights the importance
of effective participation of stakeholders, multidisciplinary approaches that reveal invisible
costs and benefits, and the use of a variety of approaches to undertake economic, financial
and social assessments. Impartiality is key. Politics should not affect such an analysis,
nor should financiers. Of course, when deciding whether to proceed with an investment,
they can decide whether the values in question are important to them. Approaches to
considering multiple values, and reaching transparent and equitable decisions, are detailed
further in Chapter 9. Better use needs to be made of the substantial existing guidance,
methodologies and experience available, of which this report provides only a snapshot.
Valuation is only of use if the decision-making process in question is based on a fair
assessment of values. Too many projects, particularly for high-profile water infrastructure
such as dams, remain essentially vanity projects, politically motivated and/or potentially
subject to corruption. Under such circumstances, values, if assessed, are opaque,
selective, manipulated or ignored. No amount of guidance on valuation will change that.
Fundamentally, valuation of water infrastructure is about good governance. At least the
attempt to govern well must be in place for proper valuations to play their part.

4.1
Introduction

The role of water within households, schools, workplaces and health care facilities is so
fundamental that it is, paradoxically, often overlooked or not assigned a value comparable with
other uses. Water is a basic human need, required for drinking and to support sanitation and
hygiene, sustaining life and health. In fact, both water and sanitation are human rights (UNGA,
2016). A direct extension of access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services not
only improves educational opportunities and workforce productivity, but also contributes to a
life of dignity and equality. WASH services also indirectly add value in the form of a healthier
environment, as it allows for the proper management of wastewater, as well as climate change
adaptation when infrastructure is built with these considerations in mind.

4.2
The value of
WASH services

Analysing the interdependencies and values of sanitation and hygiene is key in determining
the full value of WASH. Water is necessary for a variety of sanitation- and hygiene-related uses,
which include use of safely managed sanitation, maintenance and operation of sanitation
facilities, personal hygiene such as handwashing, and menstrual hygiene management
(MHM). This is not only true for households, but also for institutions and public places,
including schools, healthcare facilities and transport hubs. At the same time, safely managed
sanitation and the management of all forms of waste (including toxic waste, MHM and
sanitary waste, and faecal sludge and wastewater) are crucial to assuring water quality. An
integrated approach to WASH can lead to better health gains for those left furthest behind.
Safely managed sanitation interventions can only be fully effective if they ensure a universal
reach, and include meeting the needs of women, girls, and individuals and groups in vulnerable
situations.
Gains from improved sanitation include increased school attendance, greater privacy and
safety – especially for women, children and older persons – and a greater sense of dignity for
all (OECD, 2018).
A recent assessment of the impact of unsafe WASH on childhood diarrhoeal disease suggests
that household connections to water supplies and higher levels of sanitation coverage in
communities lower risks of diarrhoeal morbidity. The assessment found that point-of-use filter
interventions with safe storage reduced diarrhoea risk by 61%, while piped water of higher
quality and continuous availability to premises reduced diarrhoea risk by 75%, compared to
a baseline of unimproved drinking water. Sanitation interventions reduced diarrhoeal risk by
25%, with evidence for greater reductions when high sanitation coverage is reached, while
interventions promoting handwashing with soap reduced these risks by 30%, compared with
no intervention (Wolf et al., 2018).

From an economic perspective, benefits from improved WASH include reduced health care costs
for individuals and society, and greater productivity and involvement in the workplace (Hutton
and Chase, 2017). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that the total economic
losses associated with inadequate WASH services amount to US$260 billion annually in 136 lowand middle-income countries, which is roughly equivalent to an average annual loss of 1.5% of
the aggregate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of those countries (WHO, 2012).
It has been estimated that achieving universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation
and hygiene (Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Targets 6.1 and 6.2) in 140 low- and
middle-income countries would cost approximately US$1.7 trillion from 2016 to 2030, or
US$114 billion per year (Hutton and Varughese, 2016). The benefit–cost ratio (BCR) of such
investments has been shown to provide a significant positive return in most regions (WHO,
2012; Hutton, 2018). Returns on hygiene are even higher, as they can greatly improve health
outcomes in many cases with little need for additional expensive infrastructure (Black et al.,
2016). While it has previously been reported that returns on investment in sanitation, based on
the global averages, deliver over twice the return on investment compared to drinking water
(WHO, 2012), new analysis by Hutton (2018), based on disaggregated data between rural and

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

urban areas (Figure 4.1), suggest that current BCRs favour drinking water supply (with BCRs
of 3.4 and 6.8 for urban and rural areas respectively) over sanitation (with 2.5 and 5.2. for
urban and rural areas respectively). These differences in BCRs between the two services and
the differences in BCRs for each service between urban and rural settings are possibly due to
basic sanitation being generally more expensive to provide than basic water supply (Hutton
and Varughese, 2016), while both are more costly in urban areas. This could partly explain
why investments in drinking water have consistently been higher than those in sanitation
(WHO, 2017).

Similarly to WASH services, improved wastewater collection and treatment also improve
health outcomes, while also reducing other impacts of environmental pollution. There are also
benefits to be derived from wastewater reuse (see Sections 2.6.1 and 5.4.4), such as more
water availability, energy production and use of by-products such as biosolids, which can be
rich in phosphorus and nitrogen (WWAP, 2017). One study puts the value of wastewater at
US$1.1 trillion, with that number expected to rise to US$2 trillion by 2050 according to a model
focusing on water reuse, energy, nutrients and metals (Stacklin, 2012). In addition to the extra

benefits mentioned above, wastewater reuse can reduce operating costs, thereby contributing
to the sustainability of the plant and the operator (Rodriguez et al., 2020). This should incentivize
governments at all levels to improve on wastewater collection and treatment.
Significant data gaps for wastewater remain. For example, reporting on SDG Indicator 6.3.1,
the proportion of wastewater safely treated, shows that 59% of domestic wastewater flow is
collected and safely treated, but this is based on data from only 79 countries, mostly high- and
middle-income, and the data on industrial wastewater are insufficient (United Nations, 2018).
It has been estimated that only 8% of industrial and municipal wastewater in low-income
countries undergoes treatment of any kind (Sato et al., 2013).

4.3
Values and
supplemental
benefits of access
to WASH services

The value of water and sanitation is well understood from a direct health perspective: reliable
access to water supply, sanitation and improved hygiene reduces death, morbidity, malnutrition
as well as illness from waterborne diseases. If a person is sick or malnourished, they are likely to
be weaker and to have difficulty concentrating in school or in the workplace, which can also have
dangerous repercussions. When people must go outside the home to defecate or collect water,
they may be exposed to additional health challenges such as intense weather (monsoon rains,
snow), infectious insects, wild animals, chronic muscle fatigue (from carrying water), and sexual
and gender-based violence. The mental health impacts of these stresses are not insignificant.

4.3.1 Pandemics, including COVID-19
The year 2020 saw the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, which threw the world into disarray.
The health, social and economic impacts are likely to reverberate for many years to come. With
an estimated 90% of all reported COVID-19 cases, urban areas have become the epicentres
of the pandemic (UNSDG, 2020). Population densities and high levels of global and local
interconnectivity make urban areas particularly vulnerable to the spread of the virus (Box 4.1).
“In the near term, for many cities, the COVID-19 health crisis has expanded to a crisis of urban
access, urban equity, urban finance, safety, joblessness, public services, infrastructure and
transport, all of which are disproportionally affecting the most vulnerable in society” (UNSDG,
2020, p. 2).

Inadequate access
to hand hygiene
facilities causes
an increased risk
for the spread of
COVID-19 and
other infectious
diseases

The pandemic hit the world’s most vulnerable people the hardest – many of them living in
informal settlements and urban slums. People living in these densely populated areas face
multiple challenges including inadequate housing, few health facilities, overcrowded public
transport, little or no waste management, and an overall absence of basic municipal services
(UN-Habitat, 2020). Where available, WASH services are frequently intermittent, of poor quality,
and not affordable in the quantities required for good health (UN-Habitat/UNICEF, 2020).
The health impact of COVID-19 also translates to days of work loss, reduced household
income, reduced educational opportunities, potential (yet unknown) long-term health issues
related to the virus, and loss of life.4
Hand hygiene is extremely important to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (WHO, 2020a).
Globally, over three billion people and two out of five health care facilities lack adequate
access to hand hygiene facilities. A lack of data on other aspects of hygiene in health care
facilities prevents a more detailed analysis of the actual situation (WHO/UNICEF, 2019b).
Inadequate access to hand hygiene facilities causes an increased risk for the spread of
COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The health, social and economic impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic, the surge of the purchase of hygiene products to mitigate the spread of
the virus, and the environmental impact of these products, especially plastics, make the value
of safely managed WASH, at all levels, much more visible than has been witnessed in recent
memory.

At the time of production of this report, the human and economic toll of the pandemic was yet to be assessed, but the
scale and severity of its impacts are already widely known.

Box 4.1 Challenges to addressing COVID-19 in informal settlements and other poor or deprived communities
Most of the COVID-19 guidelines are almost impossible to implement in informal settlements and other poor or deprived
communities. Overcrowding, housing design, and lack of access to water, sanitation and waste management facilities, make
any form of physical/social distancing and simple interventions, such as regular handwashing, extremely difficult.
• In informal urban settlements, a large proportion of the population may have existing health conditions (respiratory
infections, waterborne diseases and other chronic illnesses), aggravated by the harsh living conditions and, increasingly,
some lifestyle diseases associated with poor nutrition and substance abuse. These communities also have limited access
to, and ability to pay for, health care.
• Most households rely on day-to-day work to meet their living costs and do not have any savings or financial buffers to
rely on to pay for basic services such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Balancing the need to control the public
health emergency with the economic livelihood impacts on the poor, particularly women and children, will be critical to the
success of any intervention strategy in the response and recovery phases.
• The lack of adequate data and information on informal settlements makes the planning and response to COVID-19
interventions difficult. The current use of city-wide data for access to WASH facilities masks the inequities present.
• The population profile in many informal settlements may not be the same as the rest of the urban agglomeration.
Inequalities in access to basic WASH services also exist within this population. Access to such services can be less than
10% for many of the slum populations.
• Slums and informal settlements may be cut off from service provision in the event of quarantine without proper
consultations. WASH services being essential, under no circumstances should they be discontinued.

COVID-19 has brought to the fore the critical role of local governments and water
and sanitation operators in ensuring continuity of WASH services during pandemics
(UNSDG, 2020). A number of protocols and guidelines have emerged for local governments
and water and sanitation operators to address the pandemic. According to the Global Water
Operators Partnership Alliance (GWOPA), public utilities should work closely with local health
officials and other relevant bodies to maximize access to safe drinking water and sanitation,
especially for vulnerable communities. Furthermore, they should, where possible, ensure
water service continuity, proper treatment, accessibility for all and affordability. For unserved
areas, temporary measures may be taken to facilitate access to safe water or household
water treatment (GWOPA, 2020).
Box 4.2 outlines the protocols and guidelines issued by the Government of Kenya on
COVID-19 response to management of water and sanitation in Kenya.

4.3.2 WASH-related waterborne diseases
Each year, it is estimated that approximately 829,000 people die from diarrhoea as a result
of unsafe drinking water, sanitation and hand hygiene. These causes represent 60% of all
deaths due to diarrhoea globally, including nearly 300,000 children under the age of five, 5.3%
of all deaths in this age group (Prüss-Üstün et al., 2019). This includes cholera, estimated to
cause approximately 95,000 deaths each year (Ali et al., 2015). The cost of disease impact is
measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs5), which means the loss of a ‘healthy’ life year.
Inadequate WASH is responsible for 49.8 million DALYs, with Sub-Saharan Africa accounting
for almost 28 million, and Southeast Asia for 13 million DALYs (Prüss-Üstün et al., 2019).

Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost
due to ill health, disability or early death.

Box 4.2 Protocols and guidelines on the COVID-19 response on management of water supply in Kenya
Kenya’s Protocols and Guidelines were issued to define specific actions and measures to ensure a continuous supply of water
and adequate sanitation during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the objective of ensuring that people have adequate water for
domestic use and handwashing. The Protocols and Guidelines are as follows:
That County Governments has:
1. Directed all the Water Service Providers (WSPs) to provide free water to informal settlements and vulnerable groups for
three months, April–June 2020. Other consumers paid for water and sewerage services.
2. Ensured that all WSPs were fully operational without interruption and that essential personnel observed Health, Safety and
Environment (HSE) regulations at all times.
3. Ensured that WSPs suspended disconnection of water for three months.
4. Ensured that in areas where water tracking was done to communities not connected to water supply, the communities
receiving the service were sensitized on regular handwashing with soap, use of sanitizers and social distancing to avoid a
rapid spread of the disease.
5. Ensured that WSPs enhanced information dissemination strategies on required measures to be observed through various
platforms. Such messages were aligned to directives issued by Ministry of Health.
6. Ensured that handwashing points were accessible in strategic locations to serve needy communities.
7. Collaborated with the National Government to map out and prioritize areas, and to identify additional interventions
necessary to ensure an adequate and safe water availability to the public.

This does not include the millions of non-fatal diarrhoeal episodes and the almost three million
cases of cholera that occur (Ali et al., 2015). Most of these illnesses are preventable, but occur
due to lack of water and sanitation services in homes, schools, health care facilities and the
workplace. The value lost in human life, and in educational and economic potential, is a burden
on society.
“In protracted conflicts, children younger than 15 are, on average, nearly three times more likely
to die from diarrhoeal disease linked to unsafe water and sanitation than violence directly linked
to conflict and war. For younger children, the impact of unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene
is greater: Children under 5 are more than 20 times more likely to die from diarrhoeal disease
linked to unsafe water and sanitation than violence in conflict” (UNICEF, 2019a, p. 3).

4.3.3 Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)
Lack of access to WASH services in health care facilities and at home impacts the prevention
of, and care for, neglected tropical diseases (Boisson et al., 2016), which every year affect more
than one billion people worldwide (WHO, 2015). These include such diseases as trachoma,
schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH: hookworms, whipworms and
roundworms). Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness in the world, responsible
for the blindness or visual impairment of about 1.9 million people worldwide (WHO, 2020b).
Schistosomiasis leads to liver and kidney failure. Depending on the species, STHs mostly
impact school-age children, causing undernutrition and stunting, and maternal (foetal and
female) health. In 2018, an estimated 229 million people required preventive treatment for
schistosomiasis (WHO, 2020c). Approximately 1.5 billion people are infected with STHs,
representing 24% of the world’s population (WHO, 2020d).
STHs contribute to approximately 5.2 million DALYs, schistosomiasis to 3.3 million (GAHI, n.d.)
and trachoma to between 4 and 39 million (Brooker, 2010). A value of access to WASH services
therefore can be expressed in terms of to what extent interventions could help reduce the
number of these diseases and lower the number of DALYs that people experience worldwide.

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

4.3.4 Nutrition
Poor sanitation and hygiene, as well as unsafe drinking water, cause diarrhoeal disease and
environmental enteropathy, which inhibit nutrient absorption, resulting in undernutrition (Teague
et al., 2014). Roughly 50% of all malnutrition is associated with repeated diarrhoea or intestinal
worm infections as a direct result of inadequate WASH (Prüss-Üstün et al., 2008). Futures of
children worldwide, but most notably in developing countries, are impaired by undernutrition.
Infections that arise from poor access to WASH exacerbate undernutrition, which includes
parasitic infections, diarrhoea and possibly environmental enteric dysfunction (EDD) – damage
of gut lining caused by repeated infections. An estimated 45% of all deaths of children under the
age of five is from undernutrition (United Nations, 2018). Stunting, which potentially prevents
children from attaining their full height and cognitive ability, impacts 144 million children under
five worldwide, 91% of them coming from low- and lower middle-income countries. Wasting
also results from these infections, with 47 million affected globally, 92% from low- and lowermiddle income countries (UNICEF/WHO/The World Bank Group, 2020). The economic cost of
undernutrition is estimated to be up to US$2.1 trillion (FAO, 2013a).

4.3.5 Maternal health
Maternal health was codified in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG 5) and now in SDG
Target 3.1. In 2017, approximately 295,000 women died during and following pregnancy and
childbirth from preventable causes (WHO/UNICEF/UNFPA/World Bank/UN Population Division,
2019). Some of these causes are linked to a lack of access to WASH services. The connection
between handwashing of birth attendants and reduced infection rates was established as early
as 1795 (Gould, 2010). The impacts of poor sanitation and unsafe water supplies are not yet as
clear, but there are a number of direct and indirect mechanisms through which poor sanitation
and unsafe water have been shown to negatively impact the maternal health of women
(Esteves-Mills and Cumming, 2016).

The connection
between
handwashing of
birth attendants
and reduced
infection rates
was established
as early as 1795

At the global level, 11% of maternal deaths, mostly in low- and middle-income countries, are
caused by infections linked to unhygienic conditions during labour and birth, at home or in
facilities, and to poor hygiene practices in the six weeks after birth (WHO/UNICEF, 2019b).
Infections associated with unclean births may account for more than one million deaths
each year (WHO/UNICEF, 2019b). Basic hygiene practices during antenatal care, labour and
birth, can reduce the risk of infections, sepsis and death of infants and mothers by up to 25%
(PMNCH, 2014).
Poor sanitation can impact maternal health through hookworm, large roundworm, listeria and
schistosomiasis. Unsafe water management affects maternal health through increased risks
of malaria and dengue, arsenic or fluoride contamination, and exposure to metals in the water
(Chitty and Esteves-Mills, 2015).

4.3.6 Menstrual hygiene management
Efforts to address MHM has in recent years gained momentum worldwide. Globally, more than
500 million women and girls do not have adequate access to MHM facilities, particularly in
public places such as schools, health care facilities and in the workplace (World Bank, 2018).
Women and girls are not able to manage menstrual hygiene with ease and dignity due to a
combination of discriminatory social environments, inaccurate information, poor facilities
and a limited choice of absorbent materials (UNICEF, 2019b). Health impacts of lacking MHM
can be physical, potentially causing reproductive tract infections, or psychosocial, leading to
embarrassment, fear of stigma, anxiety (Esteves-Mills and Cumming, 2016), shame and loss of
dignity (UNICEF, 2019b). Ultimately, women and girls’ contributions to society can be limited by
the lack of MHM facilities.

4.3.7 Time
One of the most direct values of access to WASH services is the time gained for people,
especially women and girls, who shoulder the burden of bringing drinking water closer to
home. Around 230 million people, mostly women and girls, spent more than 30 minutes per
trip collecting water from sources away from their home (WHO/UNICEF, 2017a). Across 61
countries, women and girls were responsible for carrying water in eight out of ten households.
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has calculated how much time women and girls
spend carrying water every day, which equals 200 million hours, or 8.3 million days, or 22,800
years (UNICEF, 2016).
The World Bank (2015) showed that in Southeast Asia, walking times for sanitation practices
also are significant (Table 4.1). Times differ based on setting, but as people usually make
multiples trips per day, the assumption of 30 minutes per day globally (as was concluded by
WHO, 2012 and Hutton, 2013) is not unreasonable.

4.3.8 Education
Water and sanitation also impact school attendance as well as livelihoods. If a person is sick,
they cannot attend school or work and earn income. If the ill person is a young child or an older
person, there is a high likelihood that someone else also misses school or forgoes income in
order to provide the necessary care. The lack of MHM facilities in schools results in girls’ lack
of ability to manage their menstrual hygiene and thus increases absenteeism, which results in
economic costs and reduced opportunities in their futures (World Bank, 2018).
The universal dimension of SDG Targets 6.1 and 6.2 implies all settings, which also translate
to schools (WHO/UNICEF, 2017b). These targets codify the recent priority given to improving
access to WASH services in schools. WHO/UNICEF (2018) showed that 69% of schoolchildren
had access to drinking water (based on data from 92 countries), 66% to sanitation (in 101
countries) and 53% to hygiene (in 81 countries). This equates to 570 million children lacking
drinking water in schools, 620 million lacking sanitation and 900 million lacking hygiene. UNDP
(2006) reported that over 443 million school days are lost due to water-related illnesses.
The value to society of WASH in schools is clear. Access to WASH in schools and at home
increases the access to quality education, resulting in better educational outcomes (United
Nations, 2018). It enhances both students’ and teachers’ health, given their long hours in
schools, and provides education on sanitation and hygiene, which can help develop healthy
behaviours for life (UNICEF, 2012). For girls and young women, improving access to WASH

in schools, especially MHM, can improve school attendance. Ensuring equitable access
to WASH in schools for children with disabilities encourages equitable education and
ensures that no child is left behind. Better education, in turn, leads to improved economic
performance and growth, from the personal/household up to national levels.

4.3.9 Labour
An unhealthy workforce means a loss in staff productivity and a negative impact on
livelihoods, which both translate into value lost for society. It has been shown that access
to WASH services in the workplace is an important factor for a company’s ability to
function and prosper (WBCSD, 2018).
It is estimated that at least US$6.5 billion is lost per year in working days due to a lack of
access to sanitation (WHO, 2012). In addition, almost 400,000 work-related deaths occur
each year from communicable diseases, which have the main contributing factors being
poor-quality drinking water, and poor sanitation and hygiene (WWAP, 2016).

It has been shown

Access to WASH in the workplace is also an issue that impacts gender equality and
women’s workplace productivity. Not having a safe, private location, especially during a
women’s menstrual period, may lead to anxiety, stress and absenteeism, which results in
lower productivity often translating to lower income. It was shown that in the Philippines
and Viet Nam, in workplaces where WASH facilities were inadequate and assuming
women would be absent for at least one day during their menstrual period for lack of such
facilities, this would equate to 13.8 million and 1.5 million workday absences, respectively,
and US$13 million and 1.28 million in economic losses (Sommer et al., 2016).

4.3.10 Gender-based violence
Lacking access to safe WASH facilities can expose people to increased levels of violence
based on sexual orientation and gender identity (House et al., 2014). With women and
girls shouldering the majority of the burden of carrying water from long distances to
households, this puts them at additional risk of attack or rape. Open defecation, still
practiced by almost 900 million people worldwide (United Nations, 2018), causes a feeling
of shame among women and girls, and is therefore often practiced at night, when they
face increased risk of harassment or attack. The use of sanitation facilities outside the
home at night also carries a risk. Other scenarios where gender-based violence can be
related to access to WASH services can occur in schools, during conflict situations, in
situations where men hold power in WASH-related programmes, and in the home, among
others. All of the occurrences mentioned can not only cause physical harm, but can have
psychological repercussions as well, impacting health and well-being (House et al., 2014).

4.3.11 Human rights, quality of life and dignity
When the human right to water and sanitation was adopted in 2010, the United Nations
Member States recognized it as “essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights”
(UNGA, 2010). The Human Rights Council shortly thereafter added that it is “inextricably
related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as
well as the right to life and human dignity” (HRC, 2010). In 2015, water and sanitation
were recognized as separate rights given their specific challenges to implementation
(UNGA, 2016). Without access to water and sanitation services, neither quality of life nor
dignity can be attained. Human rights reflect the values of countries worldwide, and the
implementation of the human rights to water and sanitation expresses how they also
support all three pillars (economic, environmental, social) of sustainable development.

4.4
Accessing WASH:
Subsidies and
affordability

Because access to WASH is so fundamental to life and public health, in many countries WASH
services are considered the realm of governments and therefore often subsidized, even in
high-income countries. When governments in lower-income countries are unable to provide
these services on their own, and cost recovery from the user cannot be achieved, they will
often rely on donor assistance and charity to help fill in funding gaps. The reliance on public
funding does not incentivize service improvement and obstructs conversations about the tariff
structure, making it difficult even to keep pace with cost inflation.

4.4.1 Subsidies
Subsidies do not necessarily ensure that the poor are able to access basic services. Water
subsidies can end up benefiting those with existing connections to sewerage or water
networks, many of whom are non-poor (Nauges and Whittington, 2017). As a result, the poor
do not benefit from the subsidy and the water service provider loses the tariff revenue it could
have collected from wealthier households (WWAP, 2019). Value is lost in terms of revenue
to the provider, while the negative impacts of not having access to WASH services, such as
school and work absenteeism, are not mitigated.
Even so, part of the reason that WASH services are heavily subsidized is claimed to be that
people living in poverty are unwilling or unable to pay for them. Often ignoring the potential
negative influences of vested interests and corruption, this claim also fails to consider the
amounts that such people already pay, which are generally higher than the non-poor, who
benefit from the existing subsidized rates. According to research done across ten low- and
middle-income countries, on average, 56% of subsidies end up in the pockets of the richest
20%, while only 6% of subsidies find their way to the poorest 20% (Andres et al., 2019). The
2019 World Water Development Report observed that people living in informal settlements
often pay 10–20 times more for their water, which comes from suppliers such as water tankers
(WWAP, 2019).

4.4.2 Affordability

Subsidies do not
necessarily ensure
that the poor are
able to access
basic services

The cost of access, including connection costs (fees, materials, labour, etc.), whether it is a
monthly bill or an investment in household infrastructure, is sometimes the largest barrier to
improved access. Even if household budgets allow for access to WASH services that meet the
national minimum standard, they may still be far from the home, at risk of contamination, or
not available in sufficient quantity.
However, little has been done to track WASH affordability at the global scale to date and the
guiding texts in the human rights literature fail to define how economic accessibility can be
measured or monitored. No indicators have yet been adopted that enable an understanding
of the relationship between national policies, tariff policies and the actual costs faced by
households. Until now, the main method to measure affordability has been to estimate the annual
expenditure on water and wastewater as a proportion of annual income, and comparing this ratio
with an ‘affordability threshold’ (Hutton, 2012). The weakness of measuring actual WASH costs,
especially in low- and middle-income countries, is that for many households the expenditure
surveys omit some major cost items, while the service level is below the national minimum
standard. As a result, affordability assessments do not sufficiently show the service gap.
To understand affordability of WASH to a household, three key dimensions should be present:
(i) what WASH costs to a household – whether actual or potential; (ii) the spending power of a
household – which is a combination of wealth, assets and income; and (iii) spending needed
to meet other ‘essential’ needs – which indicates the other needs for spending that WASH
is competing with (UNICEF/WHO, 2021). Clearly, the most vulnerable households are those
that are low-income, have high WASH costs and little support from the welfare state or other
sources for their other essential needs. UNICEF/WHO (2021) concludes that affordability can
be measured using different indicators, but that affordability assessments should compare
actual costs faced by households to access their WASH service with the required cost to reach
a given basic minimum, whether a national standard or the SDG definition.

Figure 4.2 shows the impact of WASH expenditure on the proportion of households having
different expenditure ratios when required costs are calculated instead of actual costs.
The implications of this estimation are different in the six countries included, with bunching6
of required costs in Mexico and Cambodia, increasing costs for required costs in others
(Zambia, Pakistan and Ghana) and diminishing costs in Uganda. The caveat of these results
is that the required costs are based on a single rural and a single urban national unit cost
for basic WASH services, which will not reflect the reality of many different contexts within a
country.
Besides the operation and maintenance costs included in Figure 4.2, capital or investment
costs should also be included, as well as the value of time spent by household members
for WASH services off-plot. Figure 4.3 shows the impact on different deciles in Ghana
of adopting different costs in the numerator of the calculation, demonstrating that only
including actual O&M costs gives an incomplete picture of the costs faced by households,
especially poor households. Future global and national monitoring of affordability should
take these factors into account.
It is important to examine affordability from the perspective of disadvantaged groups,
based on their income (poor, seasonality), their location (e.g. remoteness, slums) and the
challenges they face (e.g. climate, water access). For example, the access to basic and
safe drinking water and sanitation continues to be a challenge for indigenous communities
(WHO/UNICEF, 2016).

Introduction

5.2
The multiple
benefits of
water for food
production

Food security has long been a challenge for human societies and will become an increasingly
pressing global issue over the coming decades (Fischer, 2018). Although global food
production has kept pace with population growth, close to 750 million people (or 10% of
the global population) were exposed to severe levels of food insecurity in 2019 (FAO/IFAD/
UNICEF/WFP/WHO, 2020). Unfortunately, this number has increased even further over the
course of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impacts worldwide. In the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 aims to
“end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture”
(UNGA, 2015). The food system is almost entirely supported by water, and agriculture uses
the major share of global freshwater resources. However, water use for food production is
being questioned continually as intersectoral competition for water intensifies and water
scarcity increases. Additionally, in many regions of the world, water for food production is
used inefficiently (D’Odorico et al., 2020). This is a major driver of environmental degradation,
including depletion of aquifers, reduction of river flows, degradation of wildlife habitats, and
pollution (Willett et al., 2019). A fundamental transformation of how water is being managed
in the food system is therefore necessary if most of the SDG 2 targets are to be achieved by
2030, without further degradation of water resources to concurrently achieve SDG 6 to “ensure
availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” (IFPRI, 2019).

Water is used for food production in various ways, including for agriculture, livestock and
inland fishery production. Water use in agriculture ranges from essentially rainfed, relying
on soil moisture from rainfall, to entirely irrigated. The global water footprint related to crop
production in the period 1996–2005 was 7,404 km3 per year, representing 92% of humanity’s
water footprint (Hoekstra and Mekonnen, 2012). Rainfed agriculture covers 80% of the
world’s cropland and accounts for the major part (60%) of food production (Rockström et al.,
2007). Rainfed agriculture has a global water footprint of 5,173 km3 per year (Mekonnen and
Hoekstra, 2011a). Irrigated agriculture covers about 20% of cultivated lands, yet it accounts
for 40% of food production (Molden et al., 2010) (Table 5.1), and has a global water footprint
of 2,230 km3 per year (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2011a). Water withdrawals from surface and
groundwater resources for irrigation currently amount to 2,797 km3 per year, which represents
70% of all water withdrawals in the world (Table 5.1). In many drier countries, it is not unusual
for irrigation water use to account for more than 90% of total water withdrawals (FAO, 2012a).
Water for livestock production is used for growing and producing livestock feed (which is
included in rainfed and irrigation water demand), direct consumption by livestock, and livestock
processing. While direct water consumption by livestock is very small in most countries,
representing less than 1–2% of total water use, water availability and its quality are of utmost
importance for livestock production (FAO, 2019c). Finally, inland fishery production relies fully
on natural and modified water bodies (FAO, 2014a).
Efforts to value water for food production have advanced over the past 30 years (Young and
Loomis, 2014). Existing water valuation studies often indicate that the value assigned to water
in food production is low compared to its value in alternative water uses, such as domestic
and industrial uses. They also indicate that the value of water could be very low (typically less
than US$0.05/m3) where water is used for irrigating food grains and fodder, while it could
be high (of the same order of magnitude as values in domestic and industrial uses) where
reliable supplies are needed for high-value crops such as vegetables, fruits and flowers (FAO,
2004). D’Odorico et al. (2020) indicate that the global mean values assigned to water in the
production of the four major staple crops (wheat, maize, rice and soybean), representing about
60% of global food production, range between US$0.05 and 0.16 per m3. Those values vary
considerably within and among regions.
As exemplified in Box 1.3, there are multiple ways of expressing and calculating values
of water used for food production. Variation also exists in terms of what is included in
accounting, providing a wide range of results. However, estimates of values of water for food

production normally only consider the direct economically beneficial use of water (i.e. value
to users of water), while many of the other direct and indirect benefits associated with
water, which may be economic, sociocultural or environmental, remain unaccounted for or
only partially quantified (Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture,
2007). Some of those benefits include achieving food security and improving nutrition,
accommodating shifts in consumption patterns, generating employment and providing
livelihood resilience especially for smallholder farmers, contributing to alleviating poverty
and revitalizing rural economies, supporting climate change mitigation and adaptation, and
providing multiple-use water services.

5.2.1 Food security
Water is central to food security and nutrition. Making water available to agriculture helps
boost crop yields, enables the expansion of the area under cultivation – as it allows for
planting during the dry season and using areas where production was formerly unfeasible –
and supports the production of more nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables (Hanjra and Qureshi,
2010; Domènech, 2015). The food security value of water is high but rarely quantified – and it
is often a political imperative irrespective of other values. In two case studies in India, Rogers
et al. (1998) estimated the food security value of water based on the avoided impact on
consumers of increasing foodgrain prices – which could have resulted from water shortages
and the subsequent reduction of food supply – and found that it is at least two times higher
than the net value of crop output. Moreover, it has been shown that people who have better
access to water tend to have lower levels of undernourishment, while lack of it can be a major
cause of famine and undernourishment, especially in areas where people depend on local
agriculture for food and income (FAO/WWC, 2015). Recently, disruptions of food supply and
trading systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on food security and
nutrition in many countries that depend largely on food trade. This clearly adds to the often
hidden value of water for local agriculture (FAO, 2020a).
In the coming decades, water for food production will be even more critical for food security.
Global demand for food and other agricultural products is projected to increase by 50%
between 2012 and 2050, driven by population growth (FAO, 2017b). Furthermore, rapidly rising
incomes and urbanization in much of the developing world will encourage dietary changes
towards increased consumption of livestock-based products, sugar and horticultural products,
which all rely on crops with higher water requirements than traditional staple food diets
(Ringler and Zhu, 2015). Food production is thus required to sustainably intensify and expand
to keep up with food demand.

5.2.2 Poverty alleviation
Despite striking economic growth in the past, there are still 2.1 billion poor people, of whom
767 million people live in extreme poverty. Of all people living in poverty, 80% live in rural areas,
where agriculture continues to be the mainstay of their livelihoods (World Bank, 2016b). In
many of those areas, such as in Sub-Saharan Africa, insufficient and erratic water supplies
constrain agricultural productivity and compromise income stability, with dramatic effects for
the poorest households, who have limited assets and safety nets to cope with risks (WWAP,
2016). This limits rural inhabitants’ capacities to accumulate the human capital and assets
needed to sustainably lift themselves out of poverty (FAO, 2014b). In India, for example, a
30-year analysis shows that wages are highly sensitive to rainfall shocks (World Bank, 2007).
Prolonged drought causes persistent unemployment, which often leads to migration from
rural to urban areas, notably when off-farm employment is limited (WWAP, 2016). The impacts
could be extremely large for women, who comprise about 43% of the agricultural labour
force globally and half or more of the agricultural labour force in many African and Asian
countries (FAO, n.d.a). Therefore, improving water security for food production in both rainfed
and irrigated systems can contribute to reducing poverty and closing the gender gap directly
and indirectly. Direct effects include higher yields, reduced risk of crop failure and increased
diversity of cropping; higher wages from enhanced employment opportunities; and stabilized
local food production and prices. Indirect effects include income and employment multipliers
beyond the farm, and reduction of migration (Faurès and Santini, 2008). Enhanced and more
stable incomes could help improve education and the skillsets of women, and thus foster
their active participation in decision-making. Although increasing water productivity can have
substantial positive impacts, care should be taken to account for possible perverse effects and
implications for poverty alleviation (i.e. land grabbing and increasing inequality).

5.2.3 Multiple uses of water

Water for food
production can
serve as a conduit
of broader rural
access to water
resources

Water for food production can serve as a conduit of broader rural access to water resources.
Multiple uses of water involve the practice of using water from the same source or infrastructure
for multiples uses and functions (FAO, 2013b). It may be used for different domestic purposes
such as drinking, washing, bathing or hygiene, and for other productive purposes such as
livestock rearing, aquaculture or supporting small businesses (Domènech, 2015). Water for food
production could also indirectly support natural vegetation and simultaneously provide various
cultural (e.g. recreation, tourism) and environmental services (e.g. groundwater recharge, water
purification) (FAO, 2013b). Exploiting these opportunities is of paramount importance in order to
make water use consistent with productivity, livelihoods, efficiency and environmental objectives,
thus enabling direct contribution to various SDG targets.
The additional services that can be provided by water for food production result in improved
environmental and human health, hygiene, and livelihood opportunities for the rural poor. The
potential of multiple water uses is particularly high in irrigation, where the scheme irrigation
efficiency (the proportion of water pumped or diverted through the scheme inlet that is used
effectively by the crops) has been estimated at roughly 40–50% globally. This figure varies
widely among regions and drops to 28% in Sub-Saharan Africa and 26% in Central America
and the Caribbean (AQUASTAT, 2014). By allowing water to be used for different purposes, the
value of water can be significantly amplified (FAO, n.d.b).
For example, in areas of northwest India where groundwater is saline, irrigation canals not only
provide water for domestic and livestock uses, but seepage from these canals also recharges
the groundwater table, thus enabling the pumping of high-quality water from handpumps and
shallow tubewells. In the absence of this freshwater, use of saline groundwater by animals
is reported to result in about 50% reduction of milk production. In this region, income from
livestock accounts for a significant proportion of the income of poor households, particularly
in the dry season. In addition to livestock, irrigation canals provide water for the environment.
In some canals in southern India, canal drops are used for installation of small and mini
hydropower plants (Rogers et al., 1998).

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

Promotion of multiple water use is particularly timely in the light of the spreading COVID-19.
In response to the crisis, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
highlights that inherent effects of the pandemic have grown beyond the well-defined spear
of health risks and have shocked livelihoods and food security in several countries. Irrigation
plays an important role in improving crop productivity and ensuring food security. However,
expanding irrigation could impact the availability of water for sanitation and hygiene, which has
a central role in slowing down the spread of the disease. Developing multiple water uses would
certainly allow to fight the pandemic while ensuring the basic needs of food security in rural
communities. A new initiative of the FAO’s Land and Water Division, called SMART Irrigation –
SMART WASH, offers corporate solutions to enhance irrigation and provide water, sanitation
and hygiene (WASH) facilities to vulnerable communities, thus responding to their critical
needs during the pandemic (FAO, 2020b).

5.3
Impacts
and costs of
inefficient use
of water for food
production

Despite the multiple benefits that water used for food production provides, its inefficient use
has resulted in serious economic, social and environmental impacts (or negative values), such
as the depletion of freshwater resources, deterioration of water quality, land degradation,
increased vulnerability to climate shocks, and declines of biodiversity and ecosystem services
(Willett et al., 2019).

5.3.1 Water scarcity
Water scarcity occurs when water supply is insufficient to meet water demand (FAO, 2012b).
Continued increase in water use for food production over the last decades has exacerbated
water scarcity conditions in many regions around the world (e.g. northeastern China, India,
Pakistan, the Middle East and North Africa), where available surface water is limited due
to lower precipitation and higher evaporation rates (Wada, 2016). In these regions, when
the available surface water resources are insufficient for productive farming, groundwater
resources serve as a main source for irrigation. Estimates based on comprehensive national
and subnational data indicate that 40% of actually irrigated area in the world is serviced
by groundwater sources (Siebert et al., 2010). In India, privately developed groundwater
infrastructure now supports a larger area of irrigation than the area serviced by all surface
irrigation investment (FAO, 2020c). However, excessive groundwater pumping often leads to
overexploitation, causing groundwater depletion, which constrains sustainable food production
(Giordano et al., 2017) and has devastating effects on groundwater-dependent ecosystems
sustaining the livelihood of millions of people (Wada, 2016).
In the coming decades, many regions around the world are expected to face either absolute
or seasonal water scarcity conditions, driven by increasing competition for water between
agriculture and other sectors and a more variable water availability because of climate change
(Greve et al., 2018). The World Bank (2016a) estimated that regions affected by water scarcity
could see their growth rates decline by as much as 6% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by
2050 as a result of losses in agriculture, health, income and property – sending them into
sustained negative growth.

5.3.2 Water quality degradation
Water scarcity is caused not only by the physical scarcity of the resource and lack of access
to it, but also by the progressive deterioration of water quality in many countries, reducing
the quantity of water that is safe to use (Van Vliet et al., 2017). Water use for food production
is both the source and the receptor of water quality problems. During recent decades, food
production became highly intensive in many developed and rapidly growing economies striving
for food security. This intensification included high levels of agrochemicals use to maximize
crop yields, as well as a significant increase in livestock production (Lu and Tian, 2017). This
has resulted in high nutrient loads (mainly phosphorus and nitrogen), which are the main
causes of the degradation of downstream water quality and the eutrophication of water
bodies (Vilmin et al., 2018). There are numerous socio-economic costs associated with the

deterioration of water quality, including costs related to water treatment and health; impacts
on economic activities such as agriculture, fisheries, industrial manufacturing and tourism;
degradation of ecosystem services; reduced property values; and opportunity costs of
further development (WWAP, 2012). For example, the estimated total of annual cost of water
pollution from diffuse sources (mainly agriculture) exceeds billions of American dollars in just
the Member States of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Algal blooms associated with excessive nutrients in freshwater systems cost Australia
US$116–155 million annually, including through major disruptions of water supplies for
livestock and urban areas, as well as fish kills (OECD, 2017a).

5.3.3 Increased vulnerability and ecosystem degradation
Over the past decades, intense irrigation has substantially affected local and downstream
water flow in various regions of the world, including in Asia, southern Europe, and the western
and central parts of the USA, which subsequently increased the magnitude and frequency
of hydrological droughts in those regions (Wada et al., 2013). Additionally, irrigation was
found to accentuate vulnerability to droughts. If farmers grow water-intensive crops, crop
productivity suffers disproportionately during droughts as a result of their higher water needs
(Damania et al., 2017). Irrigation has also caused environmental degradation of aquatic
ecosystems that exceeds by far that of terrestrial and marine ecosystems (Arthington,
2012). Aquatic ecosystems, such as wetlands, provide a wide range of goods and services
of significant value to society, including habitat for valuable species, flood control, carbon
sequestration, pollution attenuation and recreational opportunities. The global economic
value of the ecosystem services provided by wetlands only was estimated at US$26 trillion
per year in 2011 (Costanza et al., 2014). However, much of the irrigation development
worldwide that occurred in the last decades was considered a priority over environmental
flows. If environmental flow requirements are being satisfied without improving irrigation
efficiency, half of the globally irrigated cropland would face production losses of more than
10%, with losses reaching 20–30% of total production in some regions such as Central and
South Asia (Jägermeyr et al., 2017).

Lack of valuation of water for food production has resulted in its inefficient use, which has
hindered the progress towards global food security and poverty alleviation, and resulted in
various negative socio-economic and environmental externalities. Therefore, valuing water
in food production can play a key role in making the trade-offs explicit that are intrinsic to
decision-making and priority-setting, especially when it concerns social needs such as food
security, which is not revealed in the marketplace (Hellegers and Van Halsema, 2019). It also
enables a better understanding of the causes of inefficient use of water in the food system
and provides incentives to increase investments in the modernization of water infrastructure.
This can in turn increase the efficiency and productivity of water use for food production,
while avoiding the cascading negative impacts of inefficient water use (such as water scarcity
and pollution) and ensuring that sufficient water remains for aquatic ecosystems to sustain
their health, productivity and resilience to climate change.
Several management strategies that could maximize the multiple values of water for food
production could be implemented, including improving water management in rainfed areas;
transitioning to sustainable intensification; sourcing water for irrigated agriculture, especially
from nature-based and non-conventional sources; improving water use efficiency; reducing
demand for food and its consequent water use; and improving knowledge and understanding of
water use for food production (FAO, 2011a; 2017b; 2018a; FAO/IFAD/UNICEF/WFP/WHO, 2020).

5.4.1 Improving water management in rainfed lands

Increasing
water supply
to irrigation
must be coupled
with options to
improve water use
efficiency (better
management
practices,
technologies
and regulatory
measures)

Increasing water scarcity in many regions around the world leaves little room for further
expansion of large-scale irrigation. Moreover, the large gaps between actual and attainable
yields in rainfed agriculture in many regions suggest a large untapped potential for yield
increases without irrigation (Rockström et al., 2010). For example, several African countries
have yields that are at around 20% of their potential (FAO, 2011a). Closing this yield gap could
substantially increase food production and reduce the need for irrigation. Some experts
therefore indicate that rainfed agriculture will remain the major source of food production in
the coming decades and argue that more investment should be directed toward improving
water management in rainfed lands (Rockström et al., 2007). There are two broad water
management strategies to improve yields and water productivities in rainfed agriculture:
(i) capturing more water and allowing it to infiltrate into the root zone with water harvesting
techniques such as surface microdams, subsurface tanks or some tree species, and with
soil and water conservation practices such as runoff strips and terracing; and (ii) using
the available water more efficiently by increasing the plants’ water-uptake capacity and
reducing non-productive soil evaporation with integrated soil, crop and water management
strategies, such as conservation agriculture and improved crop varieties (Rockström et al.,
2010). These management options are key to reducing yield losses in rainfed lands during
dry spells, and play an important role in climate change adaptation. They allow farmers
additional guarantees that may encourage them to invest in other inputs, such as fertilizers
and high-yielding varieties, providing them with the opportunity to grow higher-value market
crops, such as vegetables or fruits (Oweis, 2014). However, it is important to mention that
water harvesting and other management practices to improve the infiltration and storage of
rainwater in soils may result in water trade-offs with downstream users and ecosystems (Zhu
et al., 2019).

5.4.2 Sustainable agricultural intensification
The transition of agricultural development towards sustainable intensification is a strategic
avenue to use resources, including water, more efficiently (FAO, 2018a). Sustainable
intensification refers to producing more from the same area of land while conserving
resources, reducing negative impacts on the environment, and enhancing natural capital
and the flow of ecosystem services (FAO, 2011b). Sustainable intensification includes
production systems and practices such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, integrated
crop–livestock and aquaculture–crop systems, nutrition-sensitive agriculture, sustainable
forest and fisheries management, and water-smart agriculture. Water-smart agricultural
practices, for instance, aim at improving agricultural productivity while reducing vulnerability
to increasing water scarcity (Lipper et al., 2014) (Box 5.1). Water-smart agricultural practices
range from planting crops suited to higher temperatures and longer droughts, to adopting
practices (such as alternate wetting and drying) that minimize energy and water use while
improving crop yields. However, the adoption of these solutions tends to be slow in the
absence of adequate incentives. For instance, a large share of the gains of approaches
such as water-smart agriculture accrue to beneficiaries other than farmers, while the costs
of technology adoption fall mainly on farmers. A wider uptake of such practices requires
introducing incentives, including changes in subsidy regimes, public investments in
infrastructure or extension services, selective forms of crop insurance, and increased access
to credit (World Bank, 2016a). Moreover, “achieving sustainable agricultural intensification
requires a substantial paradigm shift to reconcile growing human needs with the need to
strengthen the resilience and sustainability of landscapes and the biosphere. This calls for
bold changes in the technological aspects of production systems to improve their ecological
efficiency.” (FAO, 2018a, p. 148).

5.4.3 Increasing water use efficiency in irrigation
Increasing water supply to irrigation must be coupled with options to improve water use
efficiency (better management practices, technologies and regulatory measures) (Scheierling
and Tréguer, 2018). Jägermeyr et al. (2015) showed that with proper water accounting and

Box 5.1 Systems of Rice Intensification (more productivity with less water)
Rice is a staple for nearly half the world’s population. Irrigated, lowland rice cultivation, which covers about 56% of the
total rice-cropped area, produces about 76% of the total amount of rice produced globally (Uphoff and Dazzo, 2016). The
System of Rice Intensification (SRI) provides an example of a successful water-smart agricultural practice. SRI is a practice
developed to increase the productivity of land, water and other resources in rice production systems, and is promoted in
many rice-producing countries. It is based on the principle of developing healthy, large and deep root systems that can better
resist drought, waterlogging and rainfall variability – all of which are potential impacts of climate change. SRI has proved
particularly beneficial as it requires only intermittent water application, rather than continuous flood irrigation. The average
increase in income from SRI compared to conventional practices in eight countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India,
Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam) amounted to around 68%. Crop yields increased between 17 and 105%, while water
requirements decreased between 24 and 50%. Additionally, SRI can possibly reduce methane emissions, as it reduces the
amount of flooding required for irrigated rice cultivation (FAO, 2013c).

the enforcement of strict withdrawal regulations, the adoption of highly efficient irrigation
systems could reduce non-beneficial water consumption at the river basin level with more
than 70% while maintaining the current level of crop yields, enabling the reallocation of water
to other uses, including environmental restoration. While irrigation losses may appear high,
as globally on average only 40–50% of the water supplied to agriculture reaches the crops, it
is now widely accepted that a large part of these losses return to the river basin in the form
of return flow or aquifer recharge, and can be tapped by other users further downstream or
serve important environmental functions (FAO, 2012b).
Efficiency measures to reduce irrigation losses upstream, such as the adoption of efficient
on-farm-irrigation techniques (sprinkler and drip systems) or canal lining, while maintaining
existing levels of withdrawal, often lead to intensification of water usage and even a net
increase in water consumption (Box 5.2): the so-called rebound effect or irrigation efficiency
paradox (Grafton et al., 2018). To avoid this rebound effect, some attempts have been
made to introduce water consumption quotas or water extractions caps (Xie, 2009). Thus,
measures to reduce irrigation water losses must be assessed at the basin level, and not only
at individual farm level (Hsiao et al., 2007).

5.4.4 Sourcing water for irrigated agriculture
In order to have secure access to water for irrigation, people have always tried to control and
store seasonal and irregular water flows (FAO, 2012b). Augmenting the supply of freshwater
resources can be done by investing in built water supply infrastructure, such as water storage
facilities, water transfer canals and groundwater wells, or through aquifer recharging and
rainwater harvesting. Alternatively, nature-based solutions and improved land management
offer promising possibilities to enhance the availability and quality of water for agriculture,
while simultaneously preserving the integrity and intrinsic value of ecosystems and
minimizing negative impacts for society (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018).
Water resources of lesser quality (e.g. domestic wastewater, drainage water, saline water)
are now being valued, both for the resources they contain and for their associated benefits.
Significant synergies for the wide adoption of non-conventional water supplies could be
created through a transition to a circular economy, fostering sustainable agricultural water
management with enhanced resource recovery (Voulvoulis, 2018). Drainage water can be
reused either through loops in systems or by farmers pumping directly from drains. Use of
these relatively saline waters poses agricultural and environmental risks, as it can cause
soil salinization and affect water quality downstream. Therefore, salinity risk assessments
and monitoring are required, as are actions to prevent the further salinization of land and
water and to remediate saline or sodic soils. A successful example can be found in Egypt,
which reuses over 10% of its annual freshwater withdrawals without deterioration of the salt
balance (FAO, 2011a).

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

Box 5.2 Improved irrigation water use efficiency does not always lead to increased availability downstream
With the advent of pressurized irrigation, particularly from groundwater sources, governments worldwide have created
subsidies for farmers who wish to transfer from flood irrigation to sprinkler and drip technologies, in the hope that
improvements in irrigation efficiency at scheme level would reduce water withdrawals – whether from surface or groundwater
sources. Documented examples have included China (Kendy et al., 2003), the United States of America (Ward and
Pulido-Velazquez, 2008), Spain (Lopez-Gunn, 2012), Mexico (Carrillo-Guerrero et al., 2013), Chile (Scott et al., 2014), India
(Birkenholtz, 2017), Morocco (Molle and Tanouti, 2017) and Australia (Grafton and Wheeler, 2018). Evidence from these
countries indicates that any efficiency gains made through agricultural water use programmes, including the adoption of
irrigation technology (subsidized or not), are internalized by farming units who tend to intensify crop production, expand areas
under irrigation and thereby increase their evaporative consumption of water.
In the case of Australia, farmers were subsidized for adopting irrigation technology as an inducement to give up long-held
water use rights in the Murray-Darling River basin and return the right to the Commonwealth in order to increase in-stream
flows. After more than a decade of implementation, this recovery or ‘buy-back’ of water rights and the accompanying subsidy
of irrigation technology has not resulted in any measurable impact on in-stream flows (Wheeler et al., 2020). This example
highlights the relevance of implementing accompanying socio-economic and environmental policies, and of carefully
selecting compliance instruments, including the operation of water markets (Seidl et al., 2020b). At the very least, technical
‘fixes’ to water scarcity problems need accurate measurement of the resulting surface and groundwater flows and a stronger
approach to regulatory compliance and water accounting. What might be apparent on paper (the return of water entitlements)
does not necessarily translate to reductions in agricultural water withdrawals.
The conclusion reached is that water productivity can be increased through efficiency programmes in agriculture, but that
there is little or no evidence for water being ‘freed up’ for other uses, including environmental flows. Compliance at the point
of withdrawal is essential, but has to go hand-in-hand with the capacity to measure and account for return flows and the
environmental outcomes downstream of irrigated areas.

The use of treated
wastewater
is becoming
particularly
appealing for
agriculture in
peri-urban and
urban settings

The use of treated wastewater (see Section 2.6.1) is becoming particularly appealing
for agriculture in peri-urban and urban settings (Box 5.3). It is estimated that 380 km3 of
wastewater is produced annually across the world, which equals about 15% of agricultural
water withdrawals. The irrigation potential of this volume of wastewater stands at 42 million
ha (Qadir et al., 2020). With urbanization, more and more wastewater will be available in the
coming years, revealing an opportunity to address water scarcity in dry areas through the
collection, treatment and fit-for-purpose use of wastewater in agriculture and other sectors.
Wastewater is also a source of nutrients for agricultural production systems. The full nutrient
recovery from wastewater would offset more than 13% of the global demand for these
nutrients in agriculture. The recovery of these nutrients could result in a revenue generation
of US$13.6 billion globally (Qadir et al., 2020). Beyond the economic gains of reusing
wastewater to maintain or improve agricultural productivity, there are critical human health and
environmental benefits (FAO, 2010a).
Desalination (see Section 2.6.2 and Box 3.5) is one of the technological options that can
provide an additional source of freshwater for irrigation, especially in water-stressed
coastal areas. One challenge with its large-scale implementation is that most desalination
technologies entail considerable upfront investment costs and energy requirements. However,
investment costs for the main commercial desalination technologies, along with energy
requirements, have been decreasing since the first projects were implemented (Mayor, 2020).
The supply of desalinated water for agriculture is most likely to be cost-effective in a tightly
controlled environment, using agricultural practices with the most efficient water use, crops
with high productivity, and renewable energies (Barron et al., 2015). Such conditions are often
associated with greenhouses, vertical farming and the production of high-value crops in
urban and peri-urban areas, where the cost of water is small compared to the infrastructure
investment. In recent years, the use of desalination powered by renewable energies for
irrigating high-value crops in remote areas became a more viable option (Burn et al., 2015).

Box 5.3 The use of treated wastewater to address agricultural water scarcity
Treated municipal wastewater is increasingly recognized as an important source of water for agriculture. Despite such
recognition, the potential of wastewater irrigation remains underexploited. The Real Acequia de Moncada is a centuries-old
irrigation system in Valencia (Spain) that successfully uses treated wastewater for irrigation. The Real Acequia de Moncada
uses treated wastewater obtained from the closest wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and shows clear benefits for both
farmers and WWTP managers. Benefits for agriculture include additional regularity in the water supply for farmers, especially
during the dry summers when the crop water requirements are higher and water is scarce. At the same time, using treated
wastewater in agriculture avoids its pumping into the sea, providing wastewater treatment with an additional value proposition
while protecting aquatic environments. Several factors fostered the use of treated wastewater in the traditional irrigation
systems of Valencia. First, the high level of water scarcity and recurring droughts reduced freshwater availability for irrigation.
Second, traditional irrigation systems in Valencia have always used wastewater (even untreated) for irrigation. Lastly, the
treated wastewater was supplied to farmers at no additional cost, as all the costs involved in treating the wastewater were
financed by the sanitation fees.

5.4.5 Water pricing and incentives for efficiency gains

Although water
pricing to reduce
the demand from
the domestic and
industrial water
sectors has been
met with varying
levels of success,
for agriculture,
zero or very low
water prices are
common, and
in some areas
even the energy
for pumping is
subsidized

Water pricing can be used to improve water use efficiency in agriculture and to make users
aware of the value of water. Different pricing instruments (e.g. volumetric pricing, nonvolumetric pricing, tradeable permits) can be implemented to achieve different objectives (e.g.
cost recovery, efficient use, reallocating water use) (Davidson et al., 2019). Although water
pricing to reduce the demand from the domestic and industrial water sectors has been met
with varying levels of success, for agriculture, zero or very low water prices are common, and
in some areas even the energy for pumping is subsidized. This situation may persist because
of vested interests, political problems associated with price reform, practical difficulties in
measuring and monitoring water use, and social norms (e.g. the perception of water as a
free good and access to water as a basic right) (FAO, 2004). These low prices can have an
adverse bearing on the effectiveness of irrigation systems and water use. They result in poor
maintenance and consequent inefficient operation of existing irrigation systems, limited
capacity for improvements or investment in new infrastructure, and waste of water at the farm
level. It is, however, well documented that irrigation demand is highly inelastic when prices
are in a low range. The price levels that can induce substantial conservation or recover the
costs of providing sustainable irrigation services would have to be very high to be feasible
(Zhu et al., 2019). Such high prices would impose disproportionate costs for farmers, leading
to land fallowing while hindering food security and poverty alleviation (Cornish et al., 2004).
Two-tiered water pricing, setting a low price for subsistence needs while charging a price equal
to marginal cost, including environmental cost, for discretionary uses, has been alternatively
suggested (Ward and Pulido-Velazquez, 2009). This pricing arrangement can promote efficient
and sustainable water use patterns, while meeting subsistence needs of poor households
and supporting the provision of ecosystem services. An alternative instrument to implement
water pricing would be to pay farmers to save water and improve its quality (e.g. subsidies for
investing in efficient irrigation systems) (Ringler and Zhu, 2015). However, it is claimed that
those payments tend to favour the wealthy and thereby exacerbate inequalities in resource
access and wealth distribution in rural areas (FAO, 2004).

5.4.6 Reducing food loss and waste and adopting sustainable diets
Lifestyle changes, such as reducing food loss and waste (FLW) and adopting sustainable diets,
when aggregated at a larger scale, could have a considerable impact on water use for food
production (Jalava et al., 2016). Reduction of FLW could increase food availability without the
need for extra food production and the associated resource needs. Updated estimates of food
losses, prepared by FAO, indicate that globally around 14%, in terms of economic value, of the
food produced is lost from post-harvest up to, but not including, the retail level (FAO, 2019c).

76

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

Kummu et al. (2012) found that the global production of lost and wasted food crops
accounts for 24% of total freshwater resources used in food crop production. However,
efforts to reduce FLW must overcome the challenge posed by the fact that losses occur
mostly in small percentages at different stages of the food chain. Reducing these
losses requires shared commitments, strong quantitative goals, careful measurement
and persistent action. Additionally, public interventions (i.e. policies and infrastructure
investments) should create an enabling environment that allows private actors to invest
in the reduction of FLW (FAO, 2019a).

Shifts towards
sustainable
diets could also
reduce the use
of water for
food production
by about 20%
compared to
current diets

Shifts towards sustainable diets could also reduce the use of water for food production
by about 20% compared to current diets (Springmann et al., 2018). Sustainable diets
are defined as those that are healthy, have a low environmental impact, are affordable
and culturally acceptable (FAO, 2010b). Such diets involve a limited consumption of
meat, added sugars and highly processed foods, and eating a diversity of plant-based
foods (Tilman and Clark, 2014). Several measures could be implemented to encourage
shifts towards sustainable diets. One of the biggest challenges for these shifts is the
current cost and affordability of sustainable diets. To address this challenge, agricultural
priorities must be reoriented towards sustainable food and agricultural production.
This requires an increase in public expenditure to raise productivity, encourage
diversification in food production and ensure that sustainable healthy foods are made
abundantly available. Policies that penalize food and agricultural production (through
direct and indirect taxation) should be avoided, as they tend to have adverse effects on
the production of sustainable healthy foods (FAO/IFAD/UNICEF/WFP/WHO, 2020). At
the consumption level, it is necessary to raise the awareness of the general public on
the importance of sustainable consumption through education, public information and
promotional campaigns (e.g. meat-free days), and food labelling (Capacci et al., 2012).

5.4.7 Improving knowledge on water use for food production
Lastly, robust water monitoring, modelling and accounting collectively constitute the
foundation for water valuation, and a necessary step towards sustainable management
of water resources (Garrick et al., 2017). However, only limited knowledge and data are
available about freshwater resources and how they are being used for food production
at the global scale. The FAOSTAT and AQUASTAT databases are unique sources on
agriculture and water, containing data for over 200 countries and grouped by region,
from 1961 to the most recent year available.7 New digital technologies are creating
unprecedented opportunities to leverage data and analytics in order to improve the
assessment and management of water use (IWA, 2019). As an example, the FAO
Water Productivity Open Access Portal (WAPOR) (Box 5.4) can be used to interactively
map, monitor and report on agricultural water productivity in near-real time, using data
generated with remote sensing technologies.

Box 5.4 Water Productivity Open Access Portal (WaPOR)
Water productivity, which is expressed as the quantity of biomass produced in relation to the total volume of water
consumed in that year (actual evapotranspiration) can be retrieved from the FAO Water Productivity Open Access Portal
(WaPOR). These data can be assessed at the continental, national, river basin and sub-basin/irrigation scheme scales
(FAO, n.d.c). Water productivity gaps can be identified this way, facilitating proposed solutions to reduce them, and
contributing to a sustainable increase of agricultural production, while taking valued ecosystems and equitable use of
water resources into account (FAO, 2020d). Eventually these steps should lead to reduced overall water stress. Many
of the new digital technology interventions are already in use on large-scale commercial farms (e.g. in Europe), but
knowledge transfer to small-scale farms using simple agricultural methods (e.g. in Africa or Asia) is limited and needs to
be further enhanced.

6.2
Water use

There is a contradictory relationship between the energy, industry and business (EIB) sector8
and water. On the one hand, water is essential for the EIB9 sector’s operations, which would
be impossible without such a resource, as there is no substitute. On the other hand, the reality
in most business-as-usual cases is that water is expected to be cheap (even free), clean and
plentiful. The needs from the EIB sector may come in competition with, or at the expense of,
other users, many of whom regard water from completely different perspectives. The EIB
sector’s demand for water may also impact the environment and ecosystems in a variety of
ways. Clearly, for the sustainable and equitable use of water resources, this sectoral view and
situation need to change, while at the same time the EIB sector needs to continue providing
the goods and services demanded from it. The value of water in its many uses and facets is a
common denominator. The good news is that for the EIB sector, the process of appreciating
the varied values of water is under way, yet the multidimensional challenges are many.

The importance of water to successful operations in the EIB sector is reflected in the quantity it
requires. Industry and energy combined withdraw 19% of the world’s freshwater, ranging from
2% in South-East Asia to 74% in western Europe in 2010 (AQUASTAT, 2016). These amounts
relate only to self-supplied water, as opposed to municipally supplied water, and do not include
hydropower. As a result, the actual percentage used by EIB is even higher, though no figure is
available. Another perspective suggests that companies in seven sectors (food, textile, energy,
industry, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and mining) “account for and wield influence over 70% of
the world’s freshwater use and pollution” (CDP, 2018, p. 11).
The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that energy (primary energy and power
production) in 2014 was responsible for approximately 10% of total water withdrawals, of
which about 3% was consumed (IEA, 2016). The IEA also estimates that a similar amount
(about 10% of global water withdrawals) was used by the other industries. These numbers
combined are in general agreement with AQUASTAT’s 19%.
Projected global water demand between 2000 and 2050 shows a 400% increase for
manufacturing and a 140% increase for thermal power generation (OECD, 2012). Another
study (2030 WRG, 2009) foresees almost a doubling of industrial water withdrawals to
2030, reaching a percentage of 22% globally. At the same time, the IEA foresees that by
2040, withdrawals of water for energy are expected to increase by less than 2%, while water
consumption10 is estimated to increase by close to 60% (IEA, 2016). Moreover, in the last four
years, even though the number of companies reporting water reduction targets to the CDP
(formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) has close to doubled, there is a nearly 50% increase in
companies reporting higher water withdrawals with expanding production, particularly in Asia
and Latin America (CDP, 2018).
Clearly, EIB is a major user of water and will continue to be so. With increasing water scarcity,
the significance of value11 will increase and, by extension, influence the interaction with other
users and stakeholders.

The Paradox of Value or the Diamond–Water Paradox, where price is determined by scarcity and not by utility, states
that scarce diamonds fetch a higher price than abundant water, even though water is more useful. Increasing water
scarcity may well change this, as water’s marginal utility becomes more valuable.

6.3
The case for
water valuation
in the EIB sector

The call for EIB to adequately incorporate the value of water into their business models has
been increasing in recent years, particularly as water has been generally undervalued, leading
to severe consequences – “Inadequate valuation and ineffective pricing of water for energy
generation, industrial and agricultural activities and domestic uses has led to inefficient water
use, high discharges of pollutants, and degraded marine and freshwater systems; all leading to
high levels of water stress due too little, too much, or too dirty water” (SIWI, 2018, p. 3).
The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) makes the case that there
are drivers that push and drivers that pull businesses into valuing water (WBCSD, 2013). The
former are trends, both global and regulatory, involving natural capital accounting, water
valuation and better water pricing. The latter is the growing business case and prospective
benefits (summarized in Figure 6.1), with important points being better decision-making, higher
revenues, lower costs, improved risk management and a better reputation (Box 6.1). A review
of business water valuation studies (WBCSD, 2012) found many benefits, which are also often
interrelated. Risk management, for instance, can reduce costs. The report provides more
rationale and detail on mounting the case for valuing water, and calls for businesses to
consider their externalities and manage their use of natural resources in relation to societies
and economies.

The higher costs, lower earnings and financial losses related to water risks are significant.
According to the CDP, the top five water risk drivers are increased water scarcity, flooding,
drought, increased water stress and climate change (CDP, 2017). The ensuing top five risks
were higher operating costs, supply chain disruption, water supply disruption, constraint to
growth and brand damage. From another perspective, 76% of the water-related risks were
physical, while regulatory risks constituted 16%, and reputation and markets 6% of these risks
(CDP, 2018). When risk to EIB is considered financially through valuation, there is a stronger
case for good stewardship (WWF/IFC, 2015). Water-related financial company losses of
US$38.5 billion were noted in 2018, with the largest impacts relating to two companies in
mineral extraction and power generation (Table 6.1). These numbers may be larger, as at least
50 companies could not provide figures (CDP, 2018). In 2019, the combined risk to business
value was US$425 billion (CDP, 2020). Figure 6.2 illustrates how water risk relates to financial
consequences.

Box 6.1 Water efficiency, mitigating risks and water value
Sustainable access to water is essential to all of Unilever’s operations, 40% of which take place
in water-stressed areas. In such locations, the cost of buying water is often low and does not
reflect its availability, or its true value, to the company’s business or to local communities.
Consequently, where the business case for many water efficiency measures is made solely on
the basis of the purchase price of water, they may not meet the standard investment criteria.
The company’s Clean Technology Fund for sustainable capital expenditure has different
allocation criteria for water saving projects at water-stressed sites. First, the payback period
is increased from three to five years, increasing also the number of projects that can receive
funding and changing the investment mindset. Second, a water stress factor is applied as
water saved in water-stressed sites could be five times more valuable than where water is
in abundance. In 2019, the amount of water abstracted by Unilever’s factories was cut by
46.8% per tonne of production, as compared to 2008. The cumulative costs avoided through
direct water savings driven by water efficiency improvements are over €122 million since 2008.
In addition, sites are encouraged to explore the energy, chemical and labour cost savings/costs
avoided through the water efficiency measures (the true costs of water), which have shown very
attractive payback periods of 1.3 years.

As with other sectors and stakeholders noted in this report, the EIB sector has its own
perspective on the value of water. Water is seen as both a resource with withdrawal and
consumption costs determined by prices, and as a liability involving treatment costs
and regulatory penalties, leading to a perception that water is a cost or risk to sales and
compliance (WWF/IFC, 2015). A series of case studies brought together by the World Wide
Fund for Nature (WWF) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) led to the conclusion
that business tends to focus on operational savings and short-term revenue impacts, and
tends to pay less attention to water value in administrative costs, natural capital, financial risk,
future growth and operations, and innovation.
The WBCSD has argued that “it is not always possible or desirable to express all values in
monetary terms”. In fact, qualitative valuation (descriptive, high, medium, low) should be the
starting point (WBCSD, 2013, p. 3). Then follows quantitative valuation using ‘indicators’ or
metrics of value (cubic metres, people affected). Finally, the monetary value is calculated. This
hierarchy is shown in Figure 6.3.

It is also important to determine what to quantify. The WBCSD points out that water
valuation strictly means “the worth of water to different stakeholders under a set of specific
circumstances” (WBCSD, 2013, p. 2). However, for the WBCSD it also encompasses “waterrelated valuation”, which “means assessing the worth of all benefits and costs associated
with water.”12 (p. 8). Their report looks at six possible categories of water-related value for
water valuation studies noting that the “coverage depends on the objective and context of the
assessment” (p. 3):

12

The WBCSD adds that “a technical definition of what is covered by water valuation is assessing values (as well as prices
and costs), whether qualitatively, quantitatively or monetarily, associated with: water use; changes in the quantity and/or
quality of water in situ; hydrological services; non-water impacts, and extreme water-related events.” (WBCSD, 2013, p. 8).

1. Off-stream – abstraction for surface or groundwater and the costs of using such water,
such as the costs associated with decontamination.
2. In-stream – the value of services provided by water remaining in a waterbody, such as
hydrological services, fishing, biodiversity, and recreation and environmental flows.
3. Groundwater – the value from services such as storage and filtration.
4. Hydrological services – the value of benefits from non-aquatic habitats such as forests and
grasslands.
5. Non-water impacts – common environmental costs such as greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions related to the energy used for pumping or for desalination. Carbon sequestration
is a positive impact.
6. Extreme events – costs usually related to the effects of drought or flooding now made
worse by climate change.
The WBCSD prefers a welfare economics approach based on human well-being, and therefore
recognizes that social and environmental aspects also should be considered. To address this,
it uses total economic value (TEV),13 an approach it argues is more attractive to international
policy-makers and business. By contrast, WWF and IFC advocate for the importance of water
risk (uncertainty) in valuation and for risk mitigation by stewardship (WWF/IFC, 2015). They
also point to how time and space play into this view (Figure 6.4). However, any approach would
benefit from including what is not currently being valued, looking at any changes in values over
time, and scalable solutions for valuing water.

“Using the TEV approach, monetary values can be estimated for human-related environmental and social benefits that are
additive. In effect, this converts environmental and social values into economic (i.e., societal or public) values to enable a
total or net human welfare value to be derived through the use of BCA [Benefit Cost Analyses].” (WBCSD, 2013, p. 16).

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

The WBCSD, WWF and IFC provide valuation tools, but before an evaluation can done, the EIB
sector needs to determine its water risks. A number of risk tools are available (the WWF Water
Risk Filter, for instance), essentially mapping tools using average weighted scores of unrelated
indicators (WWF/IFC, 2015). They indicate areas in which companies are likely to face water
risks, but they do not address value.

6.5
The monetization
of water

Due to its character, the EIB sector is highly focused on monetization (monetary value). This
provides a predisposition to certain aspects of value (e.g. price of a cubic metre of water) and
sometimes an indifference to others (e.g. the tangible and intangible value of water to other
stakeholders).

6.5.1 Measurement
The most straightforward monetary valuation is volumetric – price per cubic metre, multiplied
by the volume of water used, plus the cost to treat and dispose of wastewater. These items
may be nuanced by considerations of consumed or recycled water. In Canada, a detailed
industrial water survey is conducted every two years and for 2015 the total water costs14 of
manufacturing were almost CA$1.4 billion (Statistics Canada, 2020a). However, inefficient use
of water is promoted by subsidies that artificially lower prices (McKinsey & Company, 2011).
Prices of between US$0.03 and US$1.50 per cubic metre for industrial water have been noted
in Member States of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),
with subsidies ranging from 5 to 90% (McKinsey & Company, 2011). It is also noted that prices
have been increasing as abstraction and treatment and their associated energy and transport
costs have also risen. For a realistic picture of evaluation, the EIB sector needs to factor in the
real costs of undervaluing the water it uses.

valuation is

The metrics for the commercial performance of water use in EIB are relatively simple. They
include water productivity, defined as profit or value of production per volume ($/m3); water
use intensity, defined as volume to produce a unit of value added (m3/$); water use efficiency,
defined as value added per volume ($/m3); and the change in water use efficiency over time, for
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 6.4.1. It is telling with respect to valuing water
that current data for these indices are not readily available, patchy, or not clearly disaggregated
into energy and industry, as opposed to data on the overall economy. However, a yardstick is
provided by the Canadian physical flow account for water use in 2015, which reports “industrial
water use intensity was 18.3 cubic metres per $1,000 of real GDP” (Statistics Canada, 2018).

6.5.2 Economic growth
The overall economic productivity of water (GDP/m3) in the EIB sector also leads at local,
regional and national levels to various co-benefits, such as job creation and new enterprises.
These are not easy to quantify, as many factors come into play, of which water is only one. The
influence of water on value added and industrial jobs was noted in a Swedish study on waterintensive industries (EEA, 2012). In areas where water use was decoupled from economic
output, water abstraction remained the same or went down in tandem with a large increase
in value added. Where water withdrawal increased, there was only a small increase in value
added. As the number of jobs remained constant in each situation, the value of water to jobs
would change. A corollary to this could be the rebound effect (Ercin and Hoekstra, 2012),
where reducing a water footprint by efficiency is negated by increased production. In this case,
the same amount of water would produce more value as opposed to less water producing the
same value.

A market value of gross value added15 per cubic metre of water (AU$/m3) used in production
in Australia shows much higher economic values for mining and manufacturing (>100AU$/m3)
than agriculture (<10AU$/m3) (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2010). However, this measure
should be viewed with caution, as water often represents a small cost that may not limit
production (Prosser, 2011). It also does not include capital costs or price changes related to
production. The report suggests that the increase in marginal profit for each extra unit of water
used may be a better economic value measure of changes in water use, and more efficient
users may therefore buy more water.
Access to water and water infrastructure are not included in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing
Business Index, because it is “often taken for granted” (Damania et al., 2017). Based on a large
survey of firms, Damania et al. (2017) showed that water shortages affect smaller firms and
low- or middle-income countries the most. Formal firms see an 8.7% average loss in sales for
one extra water outage per month. However, for informal firms – more often associated with
developing countries – this number rises to 34.8%. Moreover, repeated power outages show a
positive correlation with repeated water outages and in countries with frequent water outages,
bribery is sometimes used by firms to have access to it, which also plays into the value of
water (Damania et al., 2017).

6.5.3 Water footprints and virtual water

Water-scarce
countries can
virtually import
water through
water-intensive
products from
countries with
adequate water
resources

A water footprint is a gauge of the value of water in an EIB product. It measures how much
water is used to produce a product over its entire supply chain (Water Footprint Network, n.d.).
It includes direct and indirect use as well as consumption and pollution. It can also be scaled
to a national level. The metrics are usually cubic metres of water per a variety of units such
as tonne of production, currency etc. For industrial products, a global average water footprint
of 43 m3 per US$1,000 value added has been calculated between 1996 and 2005, with a
wide range of values, such as 1,350 m3 in Viet Nam and 5.56 m3 in Germany, to illustrate two
countries with different economic structures (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2011b).
A closely related measure is virtual water, which is “the volume of water required to produce a
commodity or service” (Hoekstra and Chapagain, 2007, p. 36). It has an international economic
connotation as it is a measure of water exported from one country to another, expressed as
an embedded volume in that export. Thus, water-scarce countries can virtually import water
through water-intensive products from countries with adequate water resources. This clearly
has a bearing on the value of water between the trading partners. Globally, for industrial
products the average virtual water content16 is 80L/US$ (Hoekstra and Chapagain, 2007), with
a wide range between countries. For example, in the USA it is 100L/US$, whereas in China and
India it is between 20 and 25L/US$.

6.5.4 Water quality, wastewater and pollution impacts
In the EIB sector, meeting water quality standards is customarily seen as a cost, either to
treat wastewater or to pay fines: indeed, in some countries it is cheaper to do the latter than
the former (WWAP, 2015). Data regarding the amount of industrial wastewater generated
are sparse, as is information regarding treatment costs. This is emphasized in the European
Union’s data, where of the 34,000 facilities reporting to the European Pollutant Release and
Transfer Register (E-PRTR) only 2,500 industrial facilities reported emissions into water (EEA,
2018). Facilities emitting below thresholds do not have to report and the data suggest that
smaller point sources of industrial pollution may have bigger effects than the regulated larger
installations. Significantly, as pollutant releases generally declined between 2007 and 2017,
industry’s gross value added increased by 11% (EEA, 2019).

Box 6.2 Costs and ramifications of pollution
In March 2018, two pipeline leakages occurred at Anglo American’s mine in the State of Minas Gerais,
Brazil. 1,686 tonnes of iron ore slurry were discharged, 492 of which flowed directly into the Santo Antônio
stream. The water supply to the Santo Antônio do Grama community was interrupted and operations
were suspended until December 2018. The incident resulted in a substantive impact of US$0.6 billion on
the group’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization (EBITDA). This included the
cost of 280 days of lost production; immediate risk mitigation, including river clean-up and community
compensation (approximately US$7.5 million); the inspection and repair of the pipeline (US$20 million);
and eight non-compliance notices (US$50 million). Remedial action included provision of potable water
to the community; immediate clearing of iron ore sediment on affected land and in the river; and recovery
and restoration of areas directly affected and over eight miles beyond.
Source: Excerpt from CDP (2020, p. 14).

In its report on 2019, the CDP focused on water pollution (CDP, 2020). The results show that
less than half of their respondents “regularly meter and monitor the quality of their discharges”
(CDP, 2020, p. 2) and a very low percentage have targets for reduction in water pollution.
Pollution can have large financial consequences for companies and investors (Box 6.2).
The relationship balance between water pollution and economic cost has been further
explored in a World Bank study (Damania et al., 2019a) (see Box 2.3). Assuming that upstream
pollution lowers downstream economic growth, using a large database and biological oxygen
demand (BOD) as a proxy for other contaminants, it found that growth of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) is lowered by a third in heavily polluted surface water (BOD > 8 mg/L).17 This
indicates a relationship between productivity upstream and reduced growth downstream. The
report also challenges the environmental Kuznets curve that suggests that pollution declines
with increasing prosperity.18 Indeed, it argues that economic growth brings a greater number
of pollutants, pointing out that in the USA there are notifications for the release of over 1,000
new chemicals per year. In those cases where the curve does hold true, it is not for economic
reasons but attributable to environmental groups and major investments in infrastructure.
Wastewater treatment is a direct cost to the EIB sector. Worldwide, there is a lack of data on
this topic, but detailed data are available in Canada where, in 2015, the cost for manufacturing
treatment and discharge was CA$506 million, representing 36% of all water costs in the
manufacturing sector (Statistics Canada, 2020a). By contrast, the thermal power sector spent
only CA$12 million or 5% of their total costs on water (Statistics Canada, 2020b).
If wastewater is considered as a resource (WWAP, 2017), such costs can be mitigated by
wastewater use and recycling (see Sections 2.6.1 and 5.4.4). Cooling, heating and process
water, either treated or untreated, can be reused for a variety of purposes, maybe many times.
This has a double payback, as it reduces the costs of both freshwater demand and wastewater
discharges. Obstacles can include the availability of wastewater, the cost–benefit ratio and an
increased energy use. Impediments may be overcome by industrial symbiosis, where facilities
exchange wastewater for their mutual benefit. The next step is the formation of eco-industrial
parks where a number of industries work together to share wastewater and the cost of its

“In the early 1990s, it was famously claimed by economists Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger that pollution would
follow an inverted-U pattern with development. As countries grow and industrialize, pollution will increase. At some
point, outrage from citizens or sufficient affluence would result in policies and cleaner technologies that cause the trend
to reverse, with growth leading to a cleaner environment. This hypothesis, known as the environmental Kuznets curve,
implies that growth is the best means to environmental improvement” (Damania et al., 2019a, p. 2).

Box 6.3 Fostering eco-industrial parks in Viet Nam
This five-year project of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), completed in
2019, aimed to increase the transfer, deployment and diffusion of clean and low-carbon technologies,
to minimize emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and water
pollutants, and to improve water efficiency and the sound management of chemicals. The project
promoted and supported the gradual transformation of industrial zones into eco-industrial parks. If all
18 opportunities that were identified are implemented, 885,333 m3 of freshwater is expected to be saved
every year, along with Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production (RECP) options saving 488,653 m3 of
water per year. The water reductions contribute to overall financial savings that often have short payback
periods: in the order of months.

treatment, as well as energy supply. This then becomes a part of Resource Efficient and
Cleaner Production (RECP) and Green Industry (Box 6.3), moving toward a circular economy
(UNESCO/UN-Water, 2020).
In addition to the direct costs of poor water quality, such as the costs of treatment, there
are external socio-economic costs, such as impacts on drinking water, ecosystems, public
health, tourism and fisheries. These impacts are difficult to disaggregate and quantify in
relation to EIB, as other factors are involved, such as diffuse agricultural pollution. Mining
tailings dam failures that directly affect river systems with heavily polluted water do provide a
specific cause. The cost of the human and environmental impacts, plus the fines and loss in
production can be huge, not to mention the immeasurable cost of the fatalities.
Another World Bank study assessed the effects of water quality on land prices and property
values (amenity value) as indicators of economic prosperity. Using data from Brazil, Argentina
and Mexico, it showed that a 100% decrease in BOD increased house prices between 6.9 and
13.7%, while property values would increase 5.3 to 6.0% if a uniform standard for BOD was
adopted (Damania et al., 2019b).

6.5.5 Bookkeeping for energy
The energy industry differs from other industries in that it either needs enormous amounts of
water for thermal cooling or hydropower, or virtually none at all for other renewables like solar
or wind power. Biofuels are an in-between resource, which, if rainfed, do not put extraordinary
demands on local water resources, but, if irrigated, can make a large demand on supply.
However, out of the approximately 10% of global water withdrawals attributable to energy,
58% is used for fossil fuel-based power generation (Figure 6.5), whereas primary energy,
including biofuels, represent only 12% (IEA, 2016).19
The large amounts of water necessary for electricity generation in thermal power, nuclear
power and hydropower is often withdrawn from lakes and rivers for free, though much is
returned after use (e.g. cooling) through dam gates and spillways. In New Zealand, the asset
value of the water for hydroelectricity in 2015 was estimated at NZ$9.8 billion, with a return
from use of NZ$586 million (Stats NZ, 2017). The value of this ‘free’ water can only be seen
when it becomes unavailable. For example, in the drought that struck California (USA)

19

In terms of water intensity (L/MWh), electricity generation ranges from about 10 (solar photovoltaic) to 100,000
(nuclear) L/MWh. For primary energy, fossil fuels range from approximately 1 to 10,000 L/toe (tonnes of oil equivalent)
and biofuels (irrigated water) about 1,000 to 5 million L/toe (IEA 2016, figures 3 and 4).

between 2007 and 2009, hydropower generation dropped and was offset by using
US$1.7 billion worth of natural gas, which besides the financial cost, also significantly
increased CO2 emissions (Christian-Smith et al., 2011).
It has been argued that for thermal plants in the USA, cooling water use is not reduced as a
function of the price of water (Stillwell, 2019). Currently, water is so cheap that water prices
would have to be significantly greater than average USA prices to make investing in improved
thermodynamic efficiency to reduce the use of cooling water worthwhile in the long run. The
situation is exacerbated as most plants self-supply their water and thus only have small costs
for pumping and possibly treatment. In the short run, if cooling water becomes scarce, once
water costs become too high in relation to electricity generation, a plant will shut down at
minimum power output. Kablouti (2015) has put forward that water availability and regulations
mainly drive investment, not the price of water use. He argues that investment should be
based on the total value of water, rather than technological options. In a similar vein, the true
economic value of water in electricity generation can be viewed through life cycle analysis.
Meldrum et al. (2013) revealed that, though water in thermal plants is mainly used for cooling,
renewable technologies needed substantial amounts of water for their manufacture and
construction. The lowest total life cycle water use was in photovoltaics and wind energy, and
the highest for coal and nuclear energy.
Hydropower, in multipurpose situations, leads to a hybrid value of water, as electricity is being
produced while there are, or can be, environmental and economic costs and benefits to other
water users (see Chapter 3). Opperman et al. (2015) have proposed that, particularly given
the worldwide growth of hydropower, there is an opportunity for a balanced approach for
sustainable energy and healthy rivers using “Hydropower by Design”. This avoids bad siting of
hydroelectric power plants, minimizes impacts and offsets others by investment in mitigation.

Box 6.4 Energy water valuation
The Serre-Ponçon multipurpose dam and reservoir in southeast France produces 6.5 billion kWh of renewable electricity,
supplies drinking and industrial water, irrigates over 150,000 hectares of farmland and regulates flood control. It also provides
many water-related recreation and tourism activities with an average turnover of about €150–200 million a year.
At times, climate change is affecting the availability of water for different uses. The water must be managed in accordance
with the European Union’s Water Framework Directive to balance water needs between environmental objectives and
economic development, taking into consideration different economic uses and values of the water.
The Electricité de France (EDF) Group signed a Water Saving Convention with two main irrigators, who were remunerated by
EDF for using less water, which means using water more efficiently. This left more water in the reservoir to cope with drought
and provided more flexibility for power generation. EDF used its own in-house software water valuation tool (PARSIFAL) to
manage and optimize the allocation of water resources, to enhance environmental and social aspects, and to assess the
amount of compensation for the irrigators.
Two scenarios were evaluated: one based on saving 32 Mm3/year of water from being withdrawn by the irrigators, and the
other saving 100Mm3/year. A sensitivity analysis was also performed using three different sets of weather conditions: a dry
year, a normal year and a wet year. The valuation focused on the value of each m3 of water saved.
The EDF software can be used for short- and long-term planning and management of hydropower reservoirs by the hour,
taking into account a range of alternative simulated operating conditions. Multipurpose uses of the water are taken into
account, including the economic valuation for the supply of a discharge or volume of water.
Using water values allocated to the volumes of water stored as a function of date, the software compares the revenue or
savings between present and future releases of a given volume of water. The valuation reflects a ‘change in productivity’, as
the value of water is based on the value of energy that can be derived from each m3 of water at a particular time. The overall
calculations are based on €/m3 of water saved under the two scenarios. This value is effectively the financial cost of energy
(€/KWh) (based on current and future energy prices in France) linked to the energy productivity (m3/KWh) and volume of water
used (m3) by the hydropower plant.
The valuation revealed how much additional value in terms of energy prices could be generated through the water saving
initiatives, and that within the range of 32–100 Mm3/year of water saved, the economic gain is linear and proportional to the
volume of water saved. This determined the level of remuneration for the irrigators for their reduced water consumption.
Agricultural consumption of water was reduced from 310 million to 201 million m3 in six years. In addition, the environment
benefited, as around 84% of the water savings were used for ecological purposes. The timing of the water savings was key as
more electricity could be generated during peak demand periods when prices were higher. The results were used as a starting
point for negotiations with the irrigators to determine how much money they will receive from EDF for saving water. The next
step is to extend this idea to other stakeholders in the basin for long-term water savings.

Desalinization is receiving increased attention, particularly in areas of water stress (see
Sections 2.6.2 and 5.4.4). However, its energy use is significantly higher, as much as 23 times,
than conventional water sources, which results in a cost of four to five times that of treated
surface water (World Bank, 2016a). This makes it too expensive for many uses. Although
the cost is falling,20 the impacts of the brine, the impacts of water intake, as well as the GHG
emissions need resolution. However, the use of saline water for energy crops and energy
generation provides a value for marginal-quality water.

According to a recent study, decarbonizing desalination using renewable energy “will result in global average levelised
cost of water decreasing from about 2.4 €/m3 in 2015, considering unsubsidised fossil fuel costs, to approximately
1.05 €/m3 by 2050” (Caldera and Breyer, 2020, p. 1).

6.6
Accounting for
the environment

Incorporation of the value of the environment in water resources management has
been discussed in Chapter 2. The EIB sector has an increasingly recognized and
important role through its activities and coordination with other stakeholders in sharing
and contributing to this value equitably. Decisions by EIB regarding how to allocate,
price and invest in water are usually made by a comparison between the economic
returns of different water demands, and the economic costs of supplying water – as
described in the sections above. Yet on both demand and supply sides, ecosystems
form an important – but often ignored – component of these calculations and business
management decisions. It is now recognized that ecosystems, through their demand
for water, provide a wide range of goods and services for human production and
consumption, and therefore for EIB (Emerton and Bos, 2004; Green et al., 2015;
Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016).

6.6.1 Natural capital accounting

Decisions by EIB
of how to allocate,
price and invest
in water are
usually made by
a comparison
between the
economic returns
of different water
demands, and the
economic costs of
supplying water

Natural capital accounting is a useful tool to inform the private sector about the
services nature provides as well as the relationship between these services and
businesses. The EIB sector interacts with natural capital whether directly or indirectly,
in the form of production inputs (raw materials, water, energy) or in the form of
dependency to the services nature provides (regulatory services such as pollination,
supportive services such as the nutrient cycle, cultural services such as recreation
and, importantly, waste assimilation and water quality – see Chapter 2). Natural capital
accounting can help determine the extent to which businesses may be impacted,
positively or negatively, by these natural services in their daily operations in terms of
monetary value (see Section 2.4.3). Tangible information on ecosystem services value
could enable the EIB sector to understand these impacts and values and to take more
conscious decisions. Businesses that recognize the importance of natural capital for
their operations can make more reliable and informed investments and can better
assess risks and opportunities. A useful document in this respect is the Natural Capital
Protocol, intended to provide businesses with a standardized framework for including
natural capital in decision-making (Natural Capital Coalition, 2016).

6.6.2 Nature-based solutions
Nature-based solutions (see Section 2.5.1) can be used in combination with others
types of interventions, which makes them more accessible to the EIB sector, where
mixed built and natural assets can deliver optimal results for food supply chains as well
as energy production (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016). For example, investing in natural
infrastructure within a river basin to support existing built water infrastructure systems
can result in lower costs and more resilient services, as dams benefit from forests that
stabilize soils and hold back erosion upstream.

6.6.3 Environmental flows
Where EIB activities rely heavily on existing water regimes, changes in flow patterns
can affect production and costs. Equally, environmental flows (see Section 2.5.2) can
be critically impacted by water or fragmented by dams that store water and regulate
water flows21 (Grill et al., 2019) to maximize hydropower generation. Water accounting
is a useful tool as it can provide evidence-based information for decision-making
and policy development around water supply (quantity and quality), the demand of
different water users and uses, as well as the current level of consumptive water use
and whether or not it is sustainable. However, the limited or lacking considerations
regarding environmental flows, in particular the seasonal timing of flows, limits the
water accounting approach in being able to encompass the full value of ecosystem

21

Only 37% of rivers longer than 1,000 km still flows freely over their entire length, and only 23% flows
uninterrupted to the ocean (Grill et al., 2019).

services in water provision over an extended period. The focus on primarily water
volumes, similar to other methods such as the Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting
(VWBA) approach (Reig et al., 2019), means that social and environmental water
benefits are not included in the water balance. For EIB, this difference between valuing
water volumes and water benefits needs to be clarified, since the measurement of
water saved may or may not generate appropriate information by which to assess
companies’ performance (Newborne and Dalton, 2019). Complementary indicators to
measure non-volumetric outputs, as well as elements of effective water stewardship
activities that increase the likelihood of generating social, economic and environmental
benefits to solve shared water challenges in river basins, are critical for decisionmaking (Reig et al., 2019; Newborne and Dalton, 2019).

6.7
Stakeholders,
corporate social
responsibility
(CSR) and
stewardship

In response to water security concerns and increasing awareness of both pollution of
watercourses and the impacts of climate change on precipitation, companies have
become more aware of their risks from changes in hydrology. Moreover, as companies
increasingly recognize the value of water to their operations, they expand from CSR to
stewardship (see Section 2.5.3).
A better understanding of the motivations behind corporate interests in water
management should align with those of water management agencies pursuing
Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) planning approaches.
A significant challenge to overcome the transition from being a corporate water user
to becoming a good steward, is the realization that individuality does not resonate in
water management. Stewardship and the ‘collective action’ needed across a range
of actors requires a greater recognition of public goods generated from good water
management, and a reorientation in thinking from ‘my water supply’ to ‘our water basin’
(Box 6.5). This also includes taking into account gender equality, in order to meet
human rights-related responsibilities and sustainable development in general.

Box 6.5 Valuing ‘Every Drop’
As water, more specifically high-quality water, comprises 95% of beer, it is as valuable
as it is essential to brewing. In the last decade, beer producer Heineken has reduced
its water use by almost a third. Recognizing that water is precious and undervalued, it
has committed itself to water protection for communities in the water-stressed areas
where it operates. Its Every Drop 2030 Water Ambition in support of the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goal 6 is dedicated to this end. In water-stressed areas,
Heineken commits to fully balance within the local watershed every litre of water used
in its products, to maximize water circularity, and to reduce water usage from 3.2 of
water per hectolitre of beer to an average of 2.8 hl/hl. In addition, it has invested in
reforestation, landscape restoration, desalination and water capture, working closely
together with other water users. For example, in Indonesia, as a consequence of working
alongside the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Heineken is
part of a water alliance (‘Aliansi Air’), in which government, businesses, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and local community groups work together on water conservation
and pollution reduction in the Brantas river basin.

6.8
Future value for
EIB – Succeeding
and surviving

In concert with all sectors and stakeholders, EIB enterprises, in order to succeed and survive
commercially and to play their necessary part in overall water management and stewardship in
the face of climate change, will need to improve their understanding of value and valuation of
water: some potential avenues are outlined below.

6.8.1 Internal pricing
In a similar way as companies have developed internal prices for carbon, there is increasing
momentum to do this for water. Such an internal price is one “used in economic analysis,
when market price is felt to be a poor estimate of ‘real’ economic value” (Emerton and Bos,
2004, p. 86), and attempts to account for future uncertainty around price (WWF/IFC, 2015).
In 2017, of the companies reporting to CDP, 53 (7%) were accommodating environmental and
social costs by performing internal pricing of water (CDP, 2017). For example, using a tool
that quantifies hidden costs like pre-treatment and wastewater treatment, Colgate Palmolive
discovered that their true cost of water was 2.5 times what they paid for it. Limitations to
shadow pricing include the assumptions required and changes to the value of money over
time: it works for procurement, but most impacts are caused by other factors, such as
operational interruption (WWF, 2019a).

6.8.2 Industry 4.0

Blockchain
technology could
offer a transparent
way to manage
water and trade
water rights in
real time between
parties, including
industry and
energy

The fourth industrial revolution22 is anticipated to lead to increased productivity and growth,
with up to 30% faster production and 25% increases in efficiency (Rüßmann et al., 2015). It
blends digital and physical technology into cyberphysical systems using nine technology
pillars.23 Such systems will be connected along the value chain (Box 6.6), collecting data and
optimizing production. Clearly, as water’s true value is increasingly recognized in EIB, water
efficiency will be an integral part of such developments. In Industry 4.0, water efficiency will
also be connected with increasing energy efficiency and with the uptake of renewable clean
energy sources (UNIDO, 2017).

Box 6.6 ‘Supply chain’ versus ‘value chain’
A ‘supply chain’ refers to the system and resources required to move a product or service from
supplier to customer. The supply chain (or indirect) water footprint of a business is the volume
of freshwater consumed or polluted to produce all the goods and services that form the input
of production of a business.
The ‘value chain’ concept builds on this, but also considers the manner in which value is added
along the chain, both to the product/service and the actors involved. From a sustainability
perspective, ‘value chain’ has more appeal, since it explicitly references internal and external
stakeholders in the value creation process. It also encourages a full-lifecycle perspective
and not just a focus on the (upstream) procurement of inputs. Value is generally used in a
narrow economic sense, but it can be interpreted to encompass ‘values’, i.e. ethical and moral
concerns as well as other non-monetary utility values such as the closing of material loops, the
provision of ecosystem services and added customer value.

The fourth industrial revolution was preceded by three others, two of which had strong connections with water. The
first focused on water power and the steam engine. The second centred on electricity, which has a strong nexus with
water. The third was driven by computers and automation.

Outside the factory fence, Industry 4.0 has a great potential to combat water
insecurity – not only in the EIB sector but also in agriculture, municipal water supply
and wastewater treatment. A report by the World Economic Forum (2018) suggests
new ways for Industry 4.0 to address five urgent water issues (Figure 6.6). The use of
satellite imagery could lead to significant improvements in information on supply and
demand, and can also be extended to groundwater. As such, the water intensity of
supply chains could be optimized. Blockchain technology could offer a transparent way
to manage water and trade water rights in real time between parties, including industry
and energy. Moreover, water quality could be monitored through a network of sensors
to find contamination and its sources. Using blockchain linked to smart contracts, fines
could automatically be levied for infringements of standards (Damania et al., 2019a).
The possibilities are numerous but investment financing will be necessary, as well as
an enabling environment for an innovation ecosystem to actively promote new ideas
and technology. Furthermore, multi-stakeholder governance should include both the
public and private sectors (World Economic Forum, 2018).

6.8.3 Beyond stewardship

The circular
economy will
value water to the
extent that each
litre is reused
again and again,
making water
itself almost
become part of
the infrastructure
rather than a
consumable
resource

The value of water is so broadly based in so many aspects of EIB that numerous
methods and approaches will be required under an overall strategy to realize its true
economic worth. In many respects, the attention EIB will have to pay to the true value
of water is similar to the major and dramatic shift in corporate operations and thinking
that will be required to meet the water-related challenges of climate change as outlined
in the 2020 World Water Development Report (UNESCO/UN-Water, 2020). At present,
only a small proportion of large corporations are responding to the challenge. CDP
reports that “[i]n 2019, companies representing a quarter of global market capitalization
disclosed water security information” (CDP, 2020, p. 2). This report covered 2,433
companies, noting that more than 2,500 did not meet “investor or customer requests
for data” (CDP, 2020; p. 6). To put this in perspective, according to an OECD publication
there are approximately 41,000 listed companies worldwide (De La Cruz et al., 2019).
These numbers do not include the countless Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
(SMEs) worldwide,24 many of which may have water and wastewater low on their list
of priorities, either because of poor regulation and enforcement or because they barely
survive, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic.
As has often been stated, business-as-usual is not going to provide a solution for the
water-related challenges that the EIB sector will face in the future. A recalibration of
corporate thinking about water, combined with better all-round management, will be
required in the context of a different and new global economy (CDP, 2018). Production
and consumption must be further decoupled from the use of water resources to allow
water value to establish a realistic level based on other drivers. The circular economy
will value water to the extent that each litre is reused again and again, making water
itself almost become part of the infrastructure rather than a consumable resource.
The investment and financing necessary will need to transcend the ‘quarterly
capitalism’ (Barton, 2011) view of shareholder value, which expects short-term returns
on investment. Instead, it should move to much longer time-frames. A current trend is
inclusive capitalism, which, by engaging all sectors, seeks to open “the opportunities

24

It is estimated that there are approximately 400 million SMEs, accounting for 95% of firms and 60 to 70% of
employment worldwide (National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights, n.d.)

and benefits of our economic system to everyone” (Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism,
n.d.). Sustainable capitalism complements this. An aspect that became significant
recently is impact investing by asset managers, such as BlackRock, allocating capital
to companies with good environmental, social and governance (ESG) records. This is
still mainly aimed at climate change, but water and its value, including under conditions
of scarcity and desertification, will be a factor when adaptation is considered. Certainly,
there is the start of a movement in the USA to redefine the purpose and responsibilities
of companies to focus on their broader sphere of influence and to include all
stakeholders, with commitments to customers, employees (fostering “diversity and
inclusion, dignity and respect”), suppliers and communities, not just shareholder value
(Business Roundtable, 2019). In so doing, as water tightly links all these parties and is
central to them, its value will be a paramount consideration moving forward.

7.1
Introduction

Culture directly influences how the values of water are perceived, derived and used. The United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines culture as “the set
of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features of society or a social group …
it encompasses, in addition to art and literature, lifestyles, ways of living together, value systems,
traditions and beliefs” (UNESCO, 2002, p. 62). Every society, group or individual exists in their
own cultural setting that is moulded by a varying mix of heritage, tradition, history, education,
life experience, exposure to information and media, social status, and gender, among many
other factors.
Culture is multifaceted, and each culture usually comprises a set of subcultures. Besides,
scientists working in many different parts of the world also share some kind of ‘scientific
culture’, which is often a dominant factor in the way in which values are generated and used,
and is pivotal in the development of global science (Wang, 2018). But different disciplines
within science, such as hydrology, economics, engineering or sociology, have their own
subcultures that influence what elements each of them portrays as important. Some scientific
cultures may disregard, or even be hostile to, alternative approaches, such as the value of
indigenous and local knowledge. The societies within which these cultures operate choose
the weight they place on science and the outcomes are far from uniform. Take, for example,
the diversity in societal acceptance of anthropogenic climate change or scientific knowledge
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (Lewis, 2020). Science tends to favour valuations
based on data and information, whereas most other people value water without using data
and information at all. Thorough assessment and discussion of these cultural influences on
the values of water is beyond the scope of this report. The key point is that, for any values, it
is important to understand the cultural background under which they arise and how culture
influences how they are used.

Culture directly
influences
how the values
of water are
perceived, derived
and used

Some cultures can hold values that are difficult to quantify or indeed, in some cases, articulate.
Water can appeal to people for spiritual reasons, or through scenic beauty, because of its
importance for wildlife or recreation, among others, or combinations of these. “Cultural
practices reflect and constitute cultural values and are a discernible way that culture can be said
to manifest itself, both at particular moments in time (e.g. recreational activity) and as part of a
broad cultural realm of lived experience (e.g. a whole ‘way of life’)” (Fish et al., 2016a, p. 213).
Water-related values may harbour profound emotional dimensions, and are often anchored in
the collective social imaginary, expressed in narratives and artistic works (see, for example,
COMEST, 2018; Fish et al., 2016b). These values can be problematic to compare with values
derived through other formal means, such as economics, and are therefore often excluded
from value assessments that favour those.
Culture changes and evolves over time, sometimes rapidly. For example, Chapter 3
provides examples of how increasing values attributed to the environment can drive dam
decommissioning and how climate change has elevated values associated with water-related
risks. Chapter 4 cites the case of how COVID-19 has reminded societies of the value of safe
water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services. Global history and geopolitics have often
imposed one culture’s values on another, for instance through colonization (Box 7.1). However,
cultural values of water are also frequently shared and appreciated by several different
societies, outside the group where the values and their expressions emerged.
Contradictions between water-related values exist, and research is increasingly interested in
understanding how and why diverse groups within and among societies regard a seemingly
identical substance very differently. A juxtaposition of the social and cultural background
of values of water can help to understand the origin, complexity and drivers of value
systems. This process can inform ethics and foster learning in harmony with the living world,
increasingly considered indispensable (COMEST, 2018; HLPW, 2018).

Box 7.1 The legacy of colonial value systems on water resources law in Africa
Statutory water permit systems prevail in most African countries and are designed to override customary water law. This is a
colonial legacy where colonial authorities vested water resources in their overseas monarchs and granted permits to settlers
only. This state ownership concept transferred to post-independence and extended permit requirements to the millions
of small-scale water users. However, implementation appears logistically impossible. As such, a large number of microusers, often the most vulnerable, are unable to obtain a permit, leaving them in a state of legal limbo. Meanwhile, national
or international high-impact users, often more proficient with administrative and legal matters, continue to benefit from the
strongest, sometimes even tradable, entitlements (Burchi, 2012). New hybrid forms of water law should target and enforce
permits to regulate these relatively few high-impact users and finally recognize customary water rights at equal legal standing
(Schreiner and Van Koppen, 2018).

7.2
Methods of
categorization,
assessment
and analysis of
cultural values

Recent research seeks to create an analytical framework for cultural values. For example,
many of the cultural values related to water can be assessed and expressed by considering
them as cultural ecosystem services. Fish et al. (2016b) have suggested that, to aid analysis
and assessments, these cultural services can be categorized according to:
• Environmental spaces – the places, localities, landscapes and seascapes in which people
interact with each other and with the natural environment;
• Cultural practices – expressive, symbolic and interpretive interactions between people and
the natural environment;
• Cultural benefits – dimensions of human well-being that can be associated with these
interactions between people and the natural environment; and
• Cultural goods – the interactions between values, services and benefits, potentially
amenable to market transactions, creating cultural goods that can be exchanged, sometimes
but not always, in monetary terms.
These distinctions can be placed in a framework of dynamic feedback loops for cultural
ecosystem services, in order to obtain a general theoretical viewpoint that can be applied to
water (Figure 7.1). This can help us understand cultural ecosystem services and how these
contribute to a wider set of cultural values. Economic valuation methodologies, including for
estimating monetary and non-monetary values, can be applied to many of these individual
cultural services, enabling a comparison between them and other ecosystem service
categories (see Chapter 2 for further details).
However, using ecosystem services frameworks is no panacea for holistic valuation. Even
where applied, the approach can still lead to bias towards direct and indirect use values, that
are easier to quantify and therefore under-represent more intangible values such as bequest
or existence value. There can be dramatic inconsistencies when economic, social and cultural
values are not reconciled (Box 7.2).

7.3
Faith-based
values

Across faith-based traditions worldwide, water can symbolize elements as diverse as life,
purity, renewal and reconciliation, but also chaos and destruction (Oestigaard, 2005). In some,
water is seen as a gift for humans to care for, whilst others embrace a view that accentuates
water’s importance for the environment and wildlife.
There is a close relationship between religion, or faith, and ethics. The World Commission on
the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology proposed ethical principles that seek to
integrate human concerns with those of the various ecosystems affected by the global water
cycle (COMEST, 2018). Contexts of values can influence their representations. For example,
narratives originating from regions characterized by water scarcity often feature illustrations of
lawful and morally correct living beings, often as characterized by the local religion, rewarded

with rainfall and access to water. By contrast, the modern economic conception of water can
be characterized by its abstraction from social, cultural and religious contexts (Anderson et al.,
2019). Water in the global economic development context is often considered a resource at
the disposal of society and is therefore distinct from water as it may be recognized by religions
or the belief systems of many indigenous peoples, creating quite diverse, and potentially
contradictory, perspectives of values (Jiménez et al., 2014).

As pointed out earlier, culture is integral to all societies. The values and value systems of
indigenous peoples are frequently used as examples of ‘cultural values’, embodying societies
that see themselves as part of the living world. Certainly, indigenous worldviews are not
homogeneous. At the same time, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity
and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has demonstrated that indigenous peoples bring technical,
governance and complementary capacity to the management of natural resources (IPBES,
n.d.). The High-Level Panel on Water recognizes the role of indigenous knowledge as part of
concerted action and institutional coherence through generating ideas and realizing the various
values of water (HLPW, 2018). The legally binding Convention on Biological Diversity (1992)

Box 7.2 Trying to understand cultural values through investigating mass fish kills in the Menindee region, Australia
A mass fish kill in the Menindee region of New South Wales over the summer of 2018–2019 was investigated by the
Australian Academy of Sciences. Two conceptual frameworks for ecosystem services (that of the Millennium Ecosystem
Assessment and the concept of Total Economic Value, see Chapter 2) were concluded to be potentially controversial and
problematic. Using standard techniques, there is more certainty in determining direct and indirect uses of water resources
than there is in determining option, bequest and existence values, as well as other cultural values.
In Australian indigenous societies, cultural affiliations with landscapes and water features are expressed through social
etiquette, place-based knowledge, narratives, beliefs and daily practices. Some challenges to applying economic methods to
indigenous values include:
• income disparities: price-based valuation techniques give greater voice to richer people than to the preferences of the poor;
• (in)separability: direct and indirect benefits are frequently interdependent and overlap, hence it is difficult to value them
collectively;
• value and culture: monetary valuation methods are often inappropriate and offensive in the indigenous context; and
• community-held values: individual values are easier to assess than community-held values.
Testimonials of representatives of the Aboriginal communities emphasized that the river is a living being to many, and
fundamental for ongoing survival. The investigation concluded that alternative approaches, such as the life satisfaction
approach, subjective scaling, cognitive mapping, storytelling and benchmarking can be more suitable in valuation contexts.

was one of the first global instruments to require State Parties to work with indigenous and local
peoples to promote, preserve and maintain their local knowledge and traditional systems25 (broadly
applicable to water due to the intimate relationship between biodiversity and water on the one, and
water as an ecosystem service on the other hand). The United Nations Declaration on the Rights
of Indigenous Peoples (UNGA, 2007, Article 25) elaborated these principles in a broader context:
“indigenous peoples have the right to maintain and strengthen their distinctive spiritual relationship
with their traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used lands, territories, waters and coastal
seas and other resources and to uphold their responsibilities to future generations in this regard.”
Despite these global commitments and aspirations, the recognition of indigenous rights in practice,
the incorporation of their values and knowledge, and their full and effective participation in decisionmaking is far from universal.
The connection between water and place, often categorized as ‘relational values’ (see Chapter 1),
can be strong in many indigenous cultures. Water is a central element in the cultures of certain
indigenous peoples in the Arctic, for example, where knowledge and values around water, ice
and snow are carefully entwined into the cultural life of the group and water plays the lead role
in knowledge mapping, functions as a teaching tool and provides directional sense, amongst
many other roles (Hayman, 2018). Originating in such settings, values-led management as a
participatory, scalable approach that can be learned collectively has the objective of sustaining
the collective community-desired state of their relationship with a given place (Artelle et al., 2018).
Water, as a whole, may be seen as a sentient being by certain cultural groups. For example,
recognition of the importance of relational values led to the granting of legal personhood
and protection of the Whanganui River, under the custodianship of the local Maori People,
in New Zealand (Box 7.3).

Article 8j: “[Each Contracting Party shall] Subject to its national legislation, respect, preserve and maintain knowledge,
innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation
and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the
holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the
utilization of such knowledge, innovations and practices.”

Culture and the values of water

|

101

Traditional value systems can be expressed through customary water law. Most Africans, for
example, rely on customary rights for their access to water (Ramazzotti, 1996), with significant
legal and social impacts. Individuals and groups in rural communities have invested in water
infrastructure to develop surface and groundwater sources for basic livelihoods such as for
domestic, livestock, irrigation and other uses. In some cases, self-supply is an indispensable
complement to government water schemes. Water tends to be seen as a shared resource, or,
in cosmological terms, as provided by higher powers – and thus simultaneously of spiritual
and physical, life-sustaining value (Box 7.4).

7.5
Collective
normative values

There are several examples of how the global community has come together to reach
consensus on values and principles regarding water that reflect a world ethic or ‘culture’.
For example, the rights to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation have been recognized
to be fundamental to the realization of all human rights and to human dignity (UNGA, 2010).
The Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation of the
United Nations has documented at the intergovernmental level how human rights are directly
impacted by ill-considered water management projects, water uses or activities deteriorating
water around the world (UNGA, 2019). The Special Rapporteur also stressed the need to
respect local cultural values and the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous groups.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, defining the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), is perhaps the broadest and most integrated international framework. It recognizes
the importance of water in its SDG 6 (“Ensure availability and sustainable management of
water and sanitation for all”), with the various dimensions of the values of water reflected
through its six targets covering drinking water, sanitation, water quality, water use efficiency,
Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), and ecosystems, as well as cooperation and
capacity-building, and the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation
management. Water also has transversal value across all the SDGs (Figure 7.2).
Agreements on shared values are also manifest in many other forms at the global, national
and subnational level – for example, in transboundary water agreements that incorporate
provisions for sharing water and its benefits (see Chapter 8 for examples).

Box 7.3 Place-based value systems, stewardship and legal personhood of the Whanganui
River, New Zealand
The Maori Peoples generally recognize an indivisible whole, rather than breaking environmental
complexities into its constituent components, such as riverbeds. This holistic approach avoids
dividing water into sociocultural, economic and ecological values. From this perspective, a
river, for example, is a living basin that carries its own meaning, life and character, built up
over time and embodying both tangible and intangible components, many of which defy
measurement and therefore assessment in terms of identifying trade-offs. In 2017, the
Parliament of New Zealand conferred the Whanganui River legal personhood, settling an
ancient dispute over the ownership of the river, the water and the land (Waitangi Tribunal, 1999;
Parliament of New Zealand, 2017). Representatives of the local Maori community administer a
fund for environmental enhancement and are responsible for keeping the intrinsic values that
represent the essence of the river intact (Te Aho, 2018). The success of the Maori approach to
stewardship is still subject to debate (e.g. Eckstein, 2018), but the legal personhood of the river
reflects the community value system and its recognition by the national government.

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

Box 7.4 Value aspects of customary water law: Views from Africa
The Borana people of Ethiopia value water as either a source that you ‘share in’ as a member of a descent-based collective, or
something to be ‘shared out’ to signify respect (Dahl and Megerssa, 1990). Customary principles of basic human needs are in
line with human rights values, not only safeguarding the right to drinking water, but also often the right to water for irrigation,
which supports family food security (Hellum et al., 2015). Customary socioterritorial principles see water as belonging to
land and customary land tenure. Those who constructed and maintain water infrastructure exert claims to water stored
or conveyed (‘hydraulic property rights creation’), providing additional value components (economic and otherwise) to the
previous ones. These principles are further shaped by first-come-first-served claims, by transfers that are based on kinship
(marriage, inheritance), or by sharing with or without monetary compensation, and/or by force and violence.

The values of
water for peace,
security and
transboundary
cooperation

The values of water in the context of conflict, peace and security are paradoxical. Whilst much
has been written about the positive value of water in promoting peace, in many cases it was
water itself that was a contributing factor to the conflict in the first place. Water, therefore, can
at times act as a conflict indicator, as the source of contention, and/or as connector to support
conflict resolution and peacebuilding. Growing threats to peace and security due to increasing
environmental challenges and water insecurity are well documented today (Mach et al., 2019).
The need for transboundary water agreements often stems from water having high inter-state
value and, therefore, being a potential source of conflict. International water cooperation
initiatives have existed for millennia, the first document occurrence being the two Sumerian

city-states of Lagash and Umma crafting an agreement to end a water dispute along the Tigris
River in 2500 BCE – an agreement that is thought to be the first recorded treaty of any kind
(Priscoli and Wolf, 2009). More than 3,600 treaties related to international water resources
have been concluded between CE 805 and 1984 alone (FAO, 1984). “Despite the complexity of
the problems, records show that water disputes can be handled diplomatically. The last 50 years
have seen only 37 acute disputes involving violence, compared to 150 treaties that have been
signed. Nations value these agreements because they make international relations over water
more stable and predictable” (UNDESA, n.d.a).
It has been argued that a spirit of dialogue helps to transform water-related conflicts into
cooperation (Wolf, 2017). One example of such dialogue-based cooperation is the Lake Chad
region, where Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Libya, Niger and Nigeria cooperate
in the Lake Chad Basin Commission, with the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, the
Republic of Congo and Sudan having observer status, to jointly improve the state of this shared
water body and co-develop its resources to the benefit of the riparian population.26 Although
initially established to address water- and environment-related issues, the Commission has a
broad mandate and has ventured into military cooperation to support peace (Assanvo et al.,
2016).

Whilst much has
been written
about the positive
value of water
in promoting
peace, in many
cases it was water
itself that was
a contributing
factor to the
conflict in the first
place

The value of water for peace can be further augmented by encouraging inclusive multi-track
water diplomacy processes and evidence-informed political decision-making (Klimes and
Yaari, 2019). Many initiatives support cooperative water management through value-based
approaches. The Shared Waters Partnership of the Stockholm International Water Institute
(SIWI) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), for example, advances peace,
security and environmental protection, while opening new opportunities for riparian states
to sustainably develop their water resources.27 Various tools help with conflict resolution,
including the global and regional tools developed in the framework of the Water, Peace and
Security (WPS) partnership that help predict conflicts in advance and seek to take action
to improve cooperation among parties.28 Fostering a better mutual understanding among
countries to reconcile differences over shared waters is an underpinning of the UNESCOled initiatives From Potential Conflict to Cooperation Potential (PCCP)29 and Internationally
Shared Aquifer Resource Management (ISARM).30 For the SDG Indicator 6.5.2 (“Proportion
of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation”), as at
December 2020, 130 countries responded positively in the second reporting exercise, out of
153 countries sharing water resources, testifying to the important value of transboundary
water cooperation in the global development context. However, in the first reporting exercise
in 2017–2018, only 17 countries reported that all their transboundary basins were covered by
such arrangements (UNESCO/UNECE/UN-Water, 2018).
Further details on valuing water in the transboundary context, and on the role of transboundary
watercourse agreements and the United Nations global water conventions, can be found in
Section 8.2.2.
Water has also had a high value as a weapon since ancient times (Del Giacco et al., 2017).
It was used as a strategic weapon during the Second World War (Lary, 2001), can be used
selectively to favour or disfavour ethnic or social groups (Cleaver, 1995), and has seen a
resurgence as a weapon in recent times (Von Lossow, 2016).

7.7
The values of
water for mental
health and life
satisfaction

The values of water to human well-being extend well beyond its role in supporting direct
physical life-sustaining functions, and include mental health, spiritual well-being, emotional
balance and happiness. According to the Constitution of the World Health Organization
(International Health Conference, 1946), “health is a state of complete physical, mental and
social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”31
The broader values of access to safe WASH, such as improving access to education and
employment and enhancing security and dignity, and the disproportionate importance of
these to women and girls, are covered in Chapter 4. In some cultures, water can have a more
systemic role, so that access to it defines the wealth of the family/individual and hence
social status. This increases the burdens of shame for those with limited access to water,
who by consequence can only live up to lower hygienic standards and may be unable to fulfil
normative expectations of hospitality, such as offering drinking water to guests. This can
become a factor of discrimination (Stevenson et al., 2012). Distress and conflict can also be
generated when water allocation, distribution and/or regulation are applied unequally and/or
in contradiction to commonly held values in a given context (WWAP, 2019).
Water in landscapes has aesthetic values that contribute to mental health (Völker and
Kistemann, 2011). Unsurprisingly, life satisfaction and happiness depend to a great
extent on water (Guardiola et al., 2013). For example, access to water infrastructures was
directly related to household life satisfaction in Bolivia (Guardiola et al., 2014), Pakistan
(Nadeem et al., 2018) and the United Kingdom (Chenoweth et al., 2016). The expansion of
piped water lines has been found to increase people’s happiness regarding both monetary
(Mahasuweerachai and Pangjai, 2018) and non-monetary outcomes (Devoto et al., 2012).
These, and other, values of water in the context of mental health, life satisfaction and
happiness are much more than anecdotal. There is increasing attention to measuring wellbeing beyond traditional economic indicators. It is well known that Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) is not a measure of well-being, sustainability or inequality (Hoekstra, 2019). Literally
hundreds of ‘beyond-GDP’ alternatives are being explored based on the goal of creating a
society that enhances broader aspects of well-being and is able to sustain a ‘good life’. For
example, in 2019 the New Zealand government presented the first budget with priorities
explicitly based on well-being (Government of New Zealand, 2019). The first World Happiness
Report was prepared to support a United Nations High-Level Meeting on ‘Well-Being and
Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm’ held at the UN in 2012. The latest report for
2020 (Helliwell et al., 2020) notes how blue spaces and local water quality are used as metrics
for measuring subjective well-being, and that SDG 6 positively correlates with subjective wellbeing in all regions.

7.8
Integrating
cultural values into
decision-making

After understanding, categorizing or codifying cultural values, there is a need to identify
ways and means of incorporating these values into decision-making. Examples of integrative
methods to understand and integrate cultural values would include: adapted Environmental
Flow Assessments that include cultural values (Tipa and Nelson, 2012); Social and Cultural
Impact Assessments (Croal et al., 2012), and Cultural Heritage Management Plans, which are
increasingly promoted worldwide (ICOMOS, 2019). These tools can help to better understand
cultural values of water, reconcile antagonistic values, and build resilience with regard to
current and future challenges, such as climate change. A fundamental need is the full and
effective gender-sensitive participation of all stakeholders in decision-making, allowing
everyone to express their own values in their own way.

31

The definition has not been amended since 1948.

Culture and the values of water

105

Certain tools, such as cultural mapping, have been recognized by UNESCO as crucial to
preserving the world’s intangible and tangible cultural assets (UNESCO Bangkok Office, 2017).
Cultural mapping can help articulate the holistic values of local and indigenous peoples to
decision- and policy-makers, who may favour economic values over the health and well-being
of waterscapes. Cultural mapping can be integrated in and used to inform environmental flow
assessments, for instance to record the cultural significance and social function of certain
water bodies, and to rank their associated values for water management schemes (Tipa and
Nelson, 2012).
Further ways and means to accommodate multiple values and value systems for water are
covered in Chapter 9.

7.9
Heritage and
water values

Water is often a prominent component of heritage values through both tangible and intangible
benefits that can be categorized by: the acquisition, management and control of water; the
various types of water use; the management of constraints and the control of natural water;
water and health; water quality and the associated representations; water-related knowledge,
knowhow, myths and symbols; and cultural landscapes of water (ICOMOS, 2015).
Given the role of water in all societies, sites whose heritage value is associated with water
abound on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The 39 sites on the List that represent both
natural and cultural values are water-related (Willems and Van Schaik, 2015; UNESCO, 2011).
The same holds true for water-related heritage that is not listed as a World Heritage property
(Hein, 2020). The importance of protecting water heritage in order to achieve SDG 6, especially
in relation to SDG Target 6.6 on the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems,
has been noted.32

7.10
Creating wider
space for cultural
values

A truly holistic understanding/approach to IWRM can help integrate different stakeholder
values, if applied cognizant of the diversity of meanings and values of water, and the
relationships they create within and between societies (Krause and Strang, 2016). However,
while IWRM can assume the paradigm of control over nature and be a resource-centric,
utilitarian approach, it also remains a theoretically open and adaptive approach that can very
well include nature conservation as a positive outcome, and that the river basin or lake is
supported to be able to reach their fullest purpose. Better recognition of this dimension holds
potential for more holistic approaches to water management and sustainable development
in which local, indigenous and traditional values and knowledge can contribute to addressing
contemporary water resources challenges.
Social learning, individual and collective psychology and emotions play a crucial role in
interiorizing values. Values influence human behaviour and are learned and expressed in
interaction with others. UNESCO’s Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)33 aims to
empower learners to take informed decisions and responsible actions for environmental
integrity, economic viability and a just society, for present and future generations, while
respecting cultural diversity, including as related to water. Community initiatives, water
museums, local interpretation centres and their networks34 can be complementary tools to
formal education in this endeavour, as is harnessing the power of engaging youth (UNPFA,
2014) in valuing water holistically.

32

For example, participants’ understanding of the importance of protecting water heritage in order to achieve the SDG
Target 6.6 has been pursued during the session on water and heritage of the UNESCO International Water Conference
held in May 2019. For further information, see en.unesco.org/waterconference/programme.

8.1.1 Water resources and challenges
Africa’s freshwater resources are estimated to be nearly 9% of the world’s total (Gonzalez
Sanchez et al., 2020). However, these resources are unevenly distributed, with the six most
water-rich countries in Central and Western Africa holding 54% of the continent’s total
resources and the 27 most water-poor countries holding only 7% (UNESCO Regional Office for
Eastern Africa, 2020). Large rivers include the Congo, Nile, Zambezi and Niger. Lake Victoria
(spreading across Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda) is the second-largest freshwater lake in
the world by surface area, while Lake Tanganyika (shared among Burundi, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Tanzania and Zambia) is the second-largest by volume, as well as
the second-deepest freshwater lake in the world. This notwithstanding, Africa is the seconddriest continent in the world, after Australia. Arid and semi-arid areas cover about two thirds
of the continent. About 73% of the total population of Sub-Saharan Africa did not use safely
managed drinking water services in 2017 (WHO/UNICEF, 2019a). An estimated 14% of Africa’s
population (about 160 million people) currently live under conditions of water scarcity (Hasan
et al., 2019), due in part to the uneven distribution of water resources as well as inequalities in
the access to clean and potable water services (UNEP, 2002).
The Africa Water Vision 2025 (UNECA/AU/AfDB, 2003, p. 2), which calls for “An Africa where
there is an equitable and sustainable use and management of water resources for poverty
alleviation, socio-economic development, regional cooperation, and the environment”, offers a
context within which water security and sustainable management of water resources could be
achieved. However, rapid population growth, inappropriate water governance and institutional
arrangements, depletion of water resources through pollution, environmental degradation,
deforestation, and low and unsustainable financing of investments in water supply and
sanitation are some of the main challenges to the achievement of Agenda 206335 and the
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 on the continent (NASAC, 2014).

8.1.2 Adopted methodologies for valuing water
In Sub-Saharan Africa, valuing water has been a challenging task for many researchers and
development experts, due at least in part to limited baseline historical data. Researchers
studying the value of water have focused mainly on using the actual price paid or the
willingness to pay (WTP) from the consumer’s point of view by adopting the contingent
valuation (CV) method (Markantonis et al., 2018). For example, Kaliba et al. (2003) used the
CV method to estimate the WTP to improve domestic water supply in rural areas of central
Tanzania, while Bogale and Urgessa (2012) used the CV method to study the willingness of
rural households in the Haramaya District in eastern Ethiopia to pay for improved water service
provision, and the determinants of water value. Similar studies, such as Markantonis et al.
(2018) and Arouna and Dabbert (2012), have used the CV method to estimate WTP in the West
African countries of Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger. In South Africa, Yokwe (2009) used a mixed
approach by applying the residual valuation method (RVM), WTP and cost-based approaches
(CBA) (i.e. accounting costs of operation and maintenance) to evaluate water productivity and
values per crop, per farm and by scheme.

8.1.3 Valuing water in Sub-Saharan Africa: Important cases and results
Studies valuing water in Sub-Saharan Africa have mostly focused on domestic water use.
Below are the results of selected cases of water valuation on the continent.
West Africa
In West Africa, Markantonis et al. (2018) used the CV method to investigate a household’s
WTP for domestic water in the transboundary Mékrou River basin in Burkina Faso, Benin and
Niger, and also explored the payment for domestic water provision in relation to poverty. The

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

study revealed that depending on the state of wealth, households in the Mékrou River basin
were, on average, willing to pay €2.81 per month for a domestic water provision network.
The survey estimated that the average maximum WTP per household and per month is
CFA2089 (€3.18), whereas the average minimum WTP is CFA1532 (€2.34). The maximum and
minimum WTP amounts were found to be almost 10% higher in Burkina Faso and around 5%
lower in Niger. Meanwhile, the results on daily household domestic water consumption and
expenses revealed that the residents of Niger had the highest expenses for domestic water
(mean value = CFA109.55), which was more than 30% higher than the basin-wide average. In
contrast, Benin was the country with the lowest mean annual expenses (CFA72) (Markantonis
et al., 2018).
East Africa
Kaliba et al. (2003) estimated the WTP to improve community-based rural water utilities in
the Dodoma and Singida Regions of Tanzania. With surveys covering 30 villages in the two
regions, the study revealed “respondents who wanted to increase water supply in Dodoma
Region were willing to pay 32 Tsh above the existing tariff of 20 Tsh/bucket. In the Singida
Region, the analogous amount was 91 Tsh per household per year above the existing user fee
of 508 Tsh per household per year. If the tariff or user fees have to be increased, the estimated
average potential revenue for the surveyed villages was 252 million Tsh/year (US$265 263) in
the Dodoma Region, and 5.2 million Tsh/year (US$5474) in the Singida Region.” (p. 119)
Similarly, Bogale and Urgessa (2017) studied the willingness of rural households in the
Haramaya district in eastern Ethiopia to pay for improved water service provision, and the
determinants of water value. On the basis of primary data obtained from a survey conducted
on randomly selected rural households, the study revealed that the mean WTP of households
equalled US$0.273 per 20-litre jerrycan. Using a bivariate probit model, the study concluded
that WTP for improved water service provision was also determined by factors such as
household income, education, sex, time spent to fetch water, water treatment practice, quality
of water and expenditure on water.
Southern Africa
Yokwe (2009) applied the residual valuation method (RVM), WTP and CBA (i.e. accounting
costs of operation and maintenance) to evaluate water productivity and values under two
irrigation schemes (Zanyokwe and Thabina) in South Africa. The study revealed that in the
Zanyokwe scheme, the WTP per m3 among active farmers was, with ZAR0.03, lower than
the gross margin of output (ZAR0.69), while the accounting cost per m3 of water (ZAR0.084)
was less than the gross margin. In the Thabina scheme, active farmers were willing to
pay ZAR0.19 per m3 of water, which is three times the proposed costs of operations and
maintenance (O&M – ZAR0.062) per m3 of water used. The study showed that both the
accounting cost and WTP were less than the gross margin per m3 of water in the Zanyokwe
scheme.
Farolfi et al. (2007) assessed which factors determined the household-level WTP for an
improvement in water quantity and quality in Eswatini, using the CV method. A Tobit model
was applied to a survey among 374 households. As could have been expected, WTP
was shown to be significantly influenced by household income, but the distance of water
sources (in both rural and urban environments), and the household’s head’s age, level of
education and gender were also important factors. Furthermore, it was found that current
water consumption negatively impacted WTP, in other words: the more water a household
consumed, the less it was willing to pay to increase its quantity – but that same household
turned out to be willing to pay more to improve the water’s quality. WTP for improved water
provision services was found to be especially high among rural households.

8.2
The Pan-European
region

8.2.1 Valuing water in the Pan-European region
Valuing water is a challenging task within any single jurisdiction, hence doing so across
borders presents even greater challenges. Within the Pan-European region as defined
by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the development of
overarching frameworks such as the 2000 European Union Water Framework Directive
(European Parliament/Council of the European Union, 2000) demonstrates the increasing
significance that is being placed on valuing water. Nonetheless, efforts to value water,
especially in a transboundary context, remain limited in scope and often use different
approaches. Shared water management between states is very advanced within the
UNECE Pan-European region (United Nations/UNESCO, 2018), supported by the Convention
on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water
Convention) (UNECE, 1992). Hence, this section focuses on efforts and approaches at
valuing water in transboundary contexts rather than any national examples.

8.2.2 Valuing water within transboundary basins: Case studies and benefits of
cooperation
The Pan-European region contains few basin agreements and river basin organizations
(RBOs) that include an explicit methodology on the quantitative valuation of water in
their legal and institutional frameworks. Rather, the discernable approaches to valuing
water quantitatively in the transboundary context are more targeted on specific aspects
of managing transboundary water resources, such as flood management, disaster risk
reduction (DRR), early-warning systems (EWS) and ecosystem services.
The Kura River basin shared by Azerbaijan and Georgia has been the focus of several
iterations of frameworks for valuing water (OECD, 2015a). The initial phase aimed at
conducting an inventory of the benefits and related values of cooperative management
of the Kura River for both basin states. This was based on a framework developed in
2013–2015 under the Water Convention (see Table 8.1 below), whose aim it is to support
transboundary cooperation.
As a second step, “a methodology for assessing the net benefits of trans-boundary
cooperation under different scenarios was developed, which included both the assessment
of the gross benefits and costs of coordinated action” (OECD, 2015a, p. 48). This
methodology was tested using two Kura River basin case studies: water quantity in the
transboundary Jandari Lake and flooding issues along the Kura River. Lastly, mechanisms
were suggested on how to realize these benefits.
In summary, while “a thorough assessment of the costs and benefits of trans-boundary
cooperation in the two case studies was not possible, due to a lack of basic, quantitative
data on water use and of economic information and data” (OECD, 2015a, p. 48), it was
determined that the collective economic benefits for both basin states outweighed
the collective investment costs by more than 15 times, in comparison to a scenario
of not acting on flood management within the basin. As a result, the installation of a
joint EWS was recommended. Several general conclusions relevant to valuing water in
a transboundary context also emerged. Firstly, “economics should inform the decisionmaking process from the very beginning, hand-in-hand with environmental data” (OECD,
2015a, pp. 48–49). Hence, investment in data collection systems is recognized as being of
vital importance and while it comes at an additional cost, that cost can be compensated
by the benefits of effective cooperation. Moreover, the inclusion of economic thinking
in transboundary water management in this context is constrained by the lack of an
appropriate legal framework on regional use of water resources. Thus, the two basin
countries could, for example, establish a bilateral commission, based on a bilateral
agreement (OECD, 2015a).

heavy rainfall caused disastrous floods, which led to significant economic damage, costed
within Germany at around €9 billion (Teichmann and Berghöfer, 2010). After this event, an
extended CBA was conducted on the value of developing a more integrated approach to
flood risk management. Three possible options were assessed: “a. to relocate selected dykes,
thereby permanently enlarging the river bed; b. to establish flood polders, specially designated
flood retention areas which can be opened for flooding upon demand; c. a combination of
a) and b)” (Teichmann and Berghöfer, 2010, p.1). The CBA framework that was developed
allowed for the comparison of policy options as regards to: “(i) their maintenance costs,
(ii) the annually avoided flood damage (based on previous flood incidences), (iii) their
biodiversity value and (iv) their nutrient retention value” (Teichmann and Berghöfer, 2010, p.1).
Importantly, this CBA framework to assess the value of integrated flood risk management
not only accounted for monetary costs and benefits, but also included two other wider
ecosystem service benefits in the calculation and assessment, namely: the water purification
function performed by biological decomposition in natural floodplains, and the restoration of
riparian biodiversity and habitats. Ultimately, the CBA of several ecosystem services revealed
“polder flood retention areas to provide cost-effective protection against flood damage, with
additional ecological benefits” (Teichmann and Berghöfer, 2010, p.1).
At a broader regional scale, the 2017 joint Adelphi and Regional Environmental Centre for
Central Asia (CAREC) study on Central Asia sought to assess the general value of water
cooperation via a calculation of the costs of inaction compared to the interrelated benefits of
transboundary management. The aim of the study was to develop “a comprehensive analysis
and a monetary value of both the direct and indirect impacts of inadequate transboundary
cooperation on water management in the region” (Adelphi/CAREC, 2017, p. I). ‘Inaction’ in
this regard was defined not as a complete lack of action, but rather as measuring the gap
between existing limited cooperation activities and the benefits that would result for the
future development of the region from full cooperation over transboundary water resources.
Using existing frameworks and regional stakeholder engagement, this study identified 11
types of costs that stemmed from suboptimal water management (Figure 8.1).
The study recognized that a full quantification across all 11 types of costs of inaction would
be difficult, particularly if attempting to integrate significant indirect costs that cannot be
directly attributed to transboundary water governance (Adelphi/CAREC, 2017). Despite this
inherent difficulty, the study noted that “it is important not to neglect these indirect costs
of suboptimal water management because they demonstrate that the true value of water
cooperation is far greater than the direct economic benefits that can be derived from better
water management” (Adelphi/CAREC, 2017, p. VII).
In order to reach an approximate valuation, the project subsequently drew on three previous
studies (UNDP, 2005; World Bank, 2016c; Shokhrukh-Mirzo et al. 2015) that calculated
monetary values of proxies for three cost categories: agricultural losses, inefficient
electricity trade and lack of access to finance due to non-cooperation. In sum, total costs
for insufficient cooperation were calculated at more than US$4.5 billion per year, yet this
calculation was subsequently qualified as not reflecting the true costs, given that certain
elements were deemed to be systematically undervalued. Overall, it was posited that “the
quality of water governance will have an enormous impact on future economic development
[emphasis added]” (Adelphi/CAREC, 2017, p. VIII) in the region. The study then mapped
out how cooperation at different levels can transform a ‘business-as-usual’ approach to
transboundary cooperation. In addition, several entry points for mutually beneficial solutions
were proposed to address existing inaction on the premise that “the scale of these costs
contains significant opportunities as better water management and closer cooperation can
lower these costs substantially” (Adelphi/CAREC, 2017, p. III).

Many, but not
all, benefits
can undergo
a quantitative
assessment.
Only in some
cases can the
monetary value
of the benefits be
assessed

In terms of available tools, the Water Convention has developed two specific approaches with
the objective of identifying a range of benefits of transboundary water cooperation, to increase
the value of shared water management in transboundary contexts. The first approach focuses
on the identification, assessment and communication of the benefits of transboundary water
cooperation, in order to assist countries in reaping the numerous benefits of joint action
(Table 8.1). It provides step-by-step guidance on how to carry out a benefit assessment
exercise as well as how the assessment of benefits can be integrated into policy processes
to foster and strengthen transboundary water cooperation (UNECE, 2015). Many, but not all,
benefits can undergo a quantitative assessment. Only in some cases can the monetary value
of the benefits be assessed.
The second, related approach is the Water–Food–Energy–Ecosystem Nexus approach.
The Transboundary Basin Nexus Assessment (TBNA) methodology aims to jointly identify
intersectoral issues in the respective transboundary basins and to address them through
concrete policy and technical solutions to be applied at regional, basin, national and local
levels. One such dialogue, underpinned by an analysis, that combined both approaches to
valuing transboundary water cooperation was conducted in 2016–2017 in the Drina River
basin mainly shared by Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia (UNECE, 2017). The
assessment concluded that coordinating the operation of the existing dams in the basin would
not only allow for better flood management, but would also improve national energy security,
increase electricity export opportunities and reduce annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
in the long term.
What is clear from this brief examination of the few available selected case studies within
UNECE’s Pan-European region is that: a) no single unified approach exists to quantitatively
valuing water; b) within transboundary contexts, quantitatively valuing water is significantly

more challenging as the data that are required to base calculations upon are often
lacking, while the countries that share a water resource often put different emphases
on values, needs and priorities attached to water-related sectors; c) almost all elements
that can be valued at all, are valued on the basis of approximations and thus inherently
undervalued, especially due to the lack of data and the inability to quantify indirect
benefits; and d) considering that transboundary water cooperation in the UNECE PanEuropean region is among the most advanced worldwide, it can be assumed that
countries significantly value transboundary cooperation and are therefore eagerly
engaging in it (United Nations/UNESCO, 2018). Notwithstanding these general
conclusions, several broad-based approaches exist for identifying the intersectoral
benefits of transboundary water cooperation on a case-by-case basis. These benefits,
when strengthened, can consequently help increase the value of transboundary water
management by reducing the economic and other costs of ‘inaction’ or insufficient
cooperation in shared basins.

8.3
Latin America
and the
Caribbean

Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are a water-abundant region. According to the
latest regional estimations, it possesses an average water endowment per inhabitant of
close to 28,000 cubic metres per year, which is more than four times the world average of
6,000 m3/inhabitant/year (FAO, 2016). Similarly, it holds the largest wetland in the world, the
Pantanal, with an area of 200 thousand square kilometres, which regulates the hydrology of
large areas of the continent (UNEP-WCMC, 2016), while the Amazon River has the largest
discharge in the world: it contains much more water than the Nile, the Yangtze and the
Mississippi combined. These facts often feed a misperception that water in the LAC region
is easily and equally available to all citizens. This is far from the truth.

Despite comprising a third of the renewable resources of freshwater in the world, this
endowment is very unequally distributed. Water is found mainly in rural and natural Amazonian
areas, while expanding urban areas in arid or semi-desert zones (such as Lima, Santiago or
Buenos Aires) or those located at high altitudes with smaller water catchment areas (such as
Bogotá, Mexico City and Quito) face greater challenges in securing a stable access to water.
The same is true for the small island states of the Caribbean (UNECLAC, forthcoming).
If the levels of stress due to water scarcity (FAO, 2018b) are analysed not at the national level,
but disaggregated at the level of river basins or specific territories, localized scenarios of high
water pressure in LAC are again identified in the most populated areas, which at the same
time are centres of economic activity. The most relevant cases are those of the Central Valley
in Chile, the Cuyo region in Argentina, the coastline of Peru and southern Ecuador, the Cauca
and Magdalena Valleys in Colombia, the Bolivian altiplano, the Brazilian Northeast, the Pacific
coast of Central America, and much of northern Mexico (FAO, 2016). All these areas report
water stress levels above 80% (which is considered extremely high) for periods ranging from
3 to 12 months per year (Mekonnen et al., 2015). According to Manson et al. (2013), in Mexico
per capita water available is currently 64% lower than it was in the middle of the last century,
due to population growth. In the Andes mountain range of South America, there has also been
substantial loss of glaciers, estimated at 22.9 Gt per year between March 2000 and April 2018
(Dussaillant et al., 2019), the equivalent of nine million Olympic swimming pools per year.

Water stress in the
LAC region has
fuelled a number
of conflicts, as
various sectors,
including
agriculture,
hydroelectricity,
mining and even
drinking water
and sanitation,
are competing
over scarce
resources

Water stress in the region has fuelled a number of conflicts, as various sectors, including
agriculture, hydroelectricity, mining and even drinking water and sanitation, are competing over
scarce resources. While the agricultural sector is the largest water user with up to 71% of all
water withdrawals, followed by 17% used as drinking water and for sanitation, and only 12%
for industrial purposes (FAO, 2016), the use of water in mining is frequently associated with
a high potential for conflict with the local population. This is because mining is concentrated
in high-altitude areas with little water and with the capacity to contaminate springs of water
sources (head basins or ‘headwater’) or in arid or semi-arid areas where reservoirs are located
(UNECLAC, forthcoming). In the case of hydroelectric dams, whose use is not accounted for in
withdrawals (although evaporation is currently recognized as a relevant source of water loss),
conflicts often emerge in the contexts of pass-through plants with little or no previous storage,
thus leaving long sections of channels without water, which could generate downstream
conflicts (Embid and Martín, 2017).
Water usage allocation, whether in the form of concessions (the most widespread mechanism
used in the region) or water rights (as in the case in Chile), has not been very effective in
reducing conflicts nor in controlling overexploitation and pollution of water bodies throughout
the region. In fact, about a quarter of the river stretches in the region are affected by severe
pathogenic contamination, with monthly concentrations of faecal coliform bacteria in excess
of 10,000cfu/L (which increased by almost two thirds from 1990 to 2010). The main source of
this kind of pollution is domestic sewage (UNEP, 2016).
Some of the major obstacles in securing effective allocation processes are connected to poor
regulation, missing incentives and/or lack of investment. All these factors ultimately reflect
the low value that is largely attributed to water resources in the region. For instance, in LAC,
the average proportion of wastewater that is safely treated is just below 40%. The proportions
of wastewater properly treated in 2018 were 22% in Argentina, 23% in Colombia, 34% in Brazil,
39% in Peru, 43% in Ecuador, 51% in Mexico and 72% in Chile (UNDESA, n.d.b). The costs of
water use or maintenance (once the concession or right of use is granted), are usually nill or
insignificant for hydroelectric plants, mining companies and even farmers; and sometimes
these costs are not even included in their economic balances (Embid and Martín, 2017).
The latter represents an implicit subsidy that does not reflect the strategic value of water
in the multiple production processes and under a context of climate change. This becomes
particularly problematic when water becomes scarce as conflicts for multiple uses increase

114

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

and there are frequently no pricing mechanism in place to establish adequate signalling that
may lead to economizing or restricting usage. Lastly, most countries in the region have not
assigned sufficient funds for proper law enforcement in cases of pollution or overexploitation.
Despite the many examples of water evidently not being adequately valued for the varied and
irreplaceable economic, social and environmental benefits it provides, there have been some
promising attitudes and innovative initiatives in LAC.
Regarding access to drinking water, a World Bank study using CV to reveal preferences
indicated that the poorest urban households in Central America were willing to pay much
more per cubic metre for a piped service (Walker et al., 2000). A more recent study for
Guatemala registered an increase of over 200% in the WTP for reliable supplies of safe
drinking water (Vásquez and Espaillat, 2016). Also, in rural areas of El Salvador a very high
WTP for drinking water and sanitation was evident (Perez-Pineda and Quintanilla-Armijo,
2013). These findings suggest that there is great need among this vulnerable segment to
access water and sanitation services.

Some of the
major obstacles in
securing effective
allocation
processes are
connected to
poor regulation,
missing incentives
and/or lack of
investment

The payment for ecosystem services (PES) approach, related specifically to water, has been
a positive experience in recognizing the role and value of ecosystems in flow regulation,
protection against storms, and the provision of water from basins in terms of both quality
and quantity. Since these services are often dependent on sufficient forest cover, payments
are aligned to forest conservation and regeneration. Payments for hydrological services and
forests have been implemented in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Mexico (Sánchez, 2015).
Beltrán (2013) documents the case of PROBOSQUE, a decentralized body of the Ministry of the
Environment of the government of Mexico. Between 2003 and 2011, PROBOSQUE has invested
US$16.3 million in 142,087 hectares, belonging to 219,218 beneficiaries, to ensure that forests
were able to provide hydrological services. Another positive experience of PES related to
water is found in Costa Rica´s FONAFIFO. FONAFIFO, or Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento
Forestal, is a decentralized body of the Ministry of Environment and Energy of Costa Rica. The
programme is funded by a fixed tax on hydrocarbons and between 2003 and 2011, about 9% of
the national surface, equivalent to 51,000 square kilometres or 17.4% of all forested areas, was
under this scheme of PES (Manson et al., 2013). Most of these hectares were previously used
for cattle grazing, so that the scheme has also contributed to reducing GHG emissions in the
country over the last decades (Saravia-Matus et al., 2019).
Lastly, an innovative approach that aims at better valuing and protecting the environmental
benefits of water is found in Colombia. In 2017, the Constitutional Court recognized the Atrato
River in the province of Chocó as a subject of law. The rights of the river include its protection,
conservation, maintenance and, in this specific case, restoration. The court ordered the
State to set up a commission of guardians and to implement a protection plan against overproliferation of mining activity in the area (Benöhr and González, 2017).
Departing from the value of water bodies per se, the Constitution of Ecuador (Constitución de
la República de Ecuador, 2008) also brings another interesting example of the valuing of the
environment. In its 7th Chapter, Article 71, it expresses that nature or Pacha Mama has rights
to ensure its reproduction. Ecuador became the first country in the world to formally recognize
the rights of nature and establish a biocentric Constitution. Yet, others have followed, such as
Bolivia, which in 2010 proclaimed the Law of the Rights of Mother Earth (Ley de Derechos de la
Madre Tierra) (Benöhr and González, 2017).
While these legal precepts are of extreme relevance, it is necessary, as with any other law
or grant of rights, to secure proper enforcement and policing. In this respect, regulation and
monitoring as well as well-aligned incentives are essential in the region to not only ensure a
better appreciation of the role and value of water but also to prevent its overexploitation and
pollution, particularly in a context of increasing climate instability.

8.4
Asia and
the Pacific

8.4.1 Context
The Asia and the Pacific region is home to 60% of the world’s population but has only 36%
of the world’s water resources, causing its per capita water availability to be the lowest in
the world (APWF, 2009).
Due to population growth, urbanization and increased industrialization, water competition
among sectors has become more severe in the region, threatening agricultural production
and food security while also affecting water quality. Unsustainable water withdrawals are a
major concern in the region, as some countries withdraw unsustainable proportions of their
freshwater supply – exceeding half of the total water availability – and seven of the world’s
15 biggest abstractors of groundwater are in Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP/UNESCO/ILO/
UN Environment, 2018). Research suggests that groundwater use will increase 30% by 2050
(UNESCAP/UNESCO/ILO/UN Environment, 2018; ADB, 2016). Severe water stress due to
the demands from irrigation is observed in the North China Plain and northwest India, which
are known to be the major food baskets of the region (Shah, 2005). Water is therefore a
relatively scarce and valuable resource in the region, and water scarcity is likely to worsen
due to the negative impacts of climate change. In addition to the low levels of per capita
water availability, high levels of water pollution are observed in the region, with more than
80% of the wastewater generated in the region’s developing countries not being treated
(Corcoran et al., 2010).
Wastewater remains an underutilized resource in the region. There is therefore an urgent
need in Asia and the Pacific to tap into wastewater, as well as to tackle water pollution
and promote water efficiency, including from the industrial sector (UNESCAP, 2019). This
is particularly urgent in the region’s least developed countries, on islands and in countries
where water resources are particularly scarce.
The region has seen diverse positive water-valuing initiatives that leverage new financial,
governance and partnership models. In China, water stewardships schemes are being
developed, including with the support of the Alliance for Water Stewardship’s projects
in Kunshan (Alliance for Water Stewardship, 2018). These schemes are defined as “the
use of water that is socially and culturally equitable, environmentally sustainable and
economically beneficial, achieved through a stakeholder-inclusive process that involves
site and catchment-based actions” (Alliance for Water Stewardship, n.d.). In Malaysia, an
evaluation of the aquatic ecosystem services of the Putrajaya lake and wetland was carried
out as part of the Malaysia UNESCO Cooperation Programme (MUCP), aiming to inform
decision-making in terms of management and to ensure public understanding and support
for decisions made (Ghani, 2016). In the Murray–Darling Basin in Australia, a cap-andtrade agricultural water market has been implemented based on secure tradable water
rights, recognizing the value of water to current and future generations by restricting total
consumptive water use to an administratively determined environmentally sustainable level
(Australian Water Partnership, 2016).

8.4.2 Case study: Valuing groundwater in the city of Kumamoto, Japan
Kumamoto is located in a volcanic region, with groundwater aquifers on which over one
million people depend for drinking water and industrial use (Kumamoto City, 2020a).
Scientific research has established that paddy fields and rice farming in the middle Shira
River watershed area contribute up to one third of the groundwater recharge. Consequently,
the reduction of paddy fields due to the building of residential areas and crop conversion
has resulted in a decrease of the groundwater resources in Kumamoto (Japanese Ministry
of Environment, 2015).36

36

Without taking any action, groundwater was projected to decrease to 563 million m3 by 2024, down from roughly
600 million m3 in 2007. The Kumamoto region aims to conserve the amount of groundwater recharge by 6.36
million m3 in 2024 (Kumamoto City, 2020b).

116

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

To reverse this trend, in 2004, the city government has provided subsidies to farmers in the
form of a PES scheme (Japanese Ministry of Environment, 2010). The aim was to incentivize
them to flood their crop-rotated paddy fields with water from the nearby Shira River during the
fallow period (between May and October) as a part of their farming practice (United Nations,
2013). The payments cover management and preparation costs based on a per hectare basis
and period, as presented in Table 8.2. Both public and private sector parties joined the initiative,
incentivized by the public ordinance to annually report on quantities of groundwater extraction
and recharged, as well as financial support and provision of workers.
As a result, quantities of groundwater recharge have increased since 2004, with, in 2018,
12.2 million m3 of groundwater recharged (Kumamoto City, 2020c).37 Groundwater extraction
has also been reduced, to a total of 104.7 million m3. Converted into the rates at which
consumers are charged for water in this region, the amount of water recharged would have a
value equivalent to US$27,145,300.38 A total financial contribution of US$6.46 million was
provided from 2004 to 201839 to ensure more water security for people, the economy and the
environment of the Kumamoto region.

Valuing groundwater also institutionalized the multi-stakeholder partnership between the
water and the agro-forestry sectors in 11 municipalities. For instance, the establishment of
the Kumamoto Groundwater Foundation in 2012 supplemented the existing programmes
implemented by the City of Kumamoto: another groundwater recharge project in the fallow
fields during the winter season and a water offset programme (Japanese Ministry of
Environment, 2015).
The adoption of the PES approach for groundwater conservation in Kumamoto has also had
an additional positive effect on the private sectors’ water management practices, including the
enhancement of companies’ corporate social responsibility policies for water sustainability
through water stewardship certificates in their factories.

8.5
The Arab region

8.5.1 Regional setting
Few other regions value water as much as the water-scarce Arab region. For thousands of
years, the identity, lives and livelihoods of peoples in the region have been closely tied to the
ability to access and benefit from water. Civilizations flourished along the Nile and between
the Tigris and Euphrates river systems, based on irrigated agriculture while navigation allowed
their economies to prosper. Communities extended along coastlines thanks to coastal
aquifers. Nomads survived because of wadis, oases and intermittent streams that speckled
the desert landscape and provided an anchor for modern cities. Ingenious indigenous methods
were developed, such as the aflaj canalization system in Oman, which ensured water was
valued and shared at the community level and which in 2006 was included as a unique system
of water management in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
In the Arab region, nearly 86% of the population, or nearly 362 million people, live under
conditions of water scarcity or absolute water scarcity (UNESCWA, 2019a). Fourteen countries
in the region use more than 100% of their available freshwater resources, which strains efforts
to achieve SDG Target 6.4 that aims to reduce the number of people facing water stress, as
shown in Figure 8.2. This scarcity has increased dependency on transboundary waters, nonrenewable groundwater resources and non-conventional water resources. The quantity of
freshwater that can be abstracted in a sustainable way would probably even be lower if water
quality considerations were included.

8.5.2 Regional challenges and opportunities
Freshwater scarcity is aggravated by several challenges, including high population growth, water
pollution, high dependency on transboundary water resources, water infrastructure damage due
to conflict and occupation, and inefficient use of water especially in the agricultural sector. This is
further worsened by climate change impacts due to a projected rise in temperature and generally
decreasing precipitation trends (UNESCWA et al., 2017).
Water is so highly valued in the region that it is considered a topic of security in bilateral and
multilateral discussions among states. This is amplified by the fact that over two thirds of
freshwater resources available in Arab states cross one or more international boundaries.
The Arab Ministerial Water Council has prioritized cooperation on shared water resources
management since it adopted the Arab Strategy for Water Security in the Arab Region to Meet

118

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

the Challenges and Future Needs for Sustainable Development 2010–2030 (AMWC, 2012).
However, joint methodologies for the economic valuation of transboundary waters have not yet
been incorporated into cooperation arrangements, and funding to inform joint management
efforts remains limited (UNESCWA, 2019b). Furthermore, national security considerations and
a water rights perspective tend to dominate the discourse among riparian states, although
nascent initiatives exist to value transboundary water cooperation, such as efforts to scope the
benefits of transboundary water cooperation on the North Western Sahara Aquifer System which
is shared between Algeria, Libya and Tunisia (UNECE, 2019), and analysis focused on climate
security and risk mitigation in transboundary water contexts in the Middle East and North Africa
(Schaar, 2019).
In terms of conventional water resources, countries have increasingly drawn upon renewable and
non-renewable groundwater to support cities, industry and agriculture in areas where surface
water is limited or not available. However, this has come at the cost of depleting groundwater
reserves and lowering the groundwater levels in several countries, threatening the future
socio-economic development benefits from the use of this groundwater. It has also introduced
trade-offs where the value of water and energy are contrasted when brackish water is pumped
into the ground to help extract oil and gas. Over-abstraction of groundwater and especially of
non-renewable groundwater is a major concern, especially in the Member States of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC – Figure 8.3). Recognizing the value of groundwater for water security
and for reversing the trend of declining groundwater levels, several GCC States, including Qatar
and Saudi Arabia, have recently invested in managed aquifer recharge projects with the majority
depending on treated wastewater as the recharge source.

The Arab region has also expanded its dependency on non-conventional sources of water to
meet its growing water needs. Desalination and the use of treated wastewater have significantly
expanded as the cost of production has decreased. Over half of the world’s desalination capacity
is in the Arab region, and mostly in GCC States (UN Environment, 2019). The use of desalinated
water is needed to meet the rising water demand, particularly in urban areas, albeit more and
more desalination plants are being used to supply water for agriculture as well. An example is
the recently commissioned desalination plant in Agadir, Morocco (see Box 8.1). Although the
cost of desalination has dropped greatly in recent years, several countries are investing in new
technologies and renewable energy to further lower the cost of desalination and avail more
sustainable options. Saudi Arabia has constructed a photovoltaic desalination plant in Khafji using
nanotechnology, with an expected full capacity of 60,000 cubic metres per day (Harrington, 2015).

Box 8.1 Agadir
Desalination Plant,
Morocco
The construction
of Africa’s largest
desalination plant is
underway in Agadir,
Morocco. The plant
will initially produce an
average of 275,000 cubic
metres of desalinated
water per day, with a
maximum capacity of
450,000 cubic metres per
day. As such, the plant
would supply drinking
water to 2.3 million
people living in the region
of Souss-Massa, with a
second phase supplying
desalinated water to
irrigate an area of some
15,000 hectares. The
project’s cost is over
€370 million. As farmers
in the region realize
the value of water for
their livelihoods, they
contribute in exchange
for a discounted price on
future desalinated water
(Novo, 2019). Energy
from a wind farm and
a pressure exchanger
will help lower the cost
of desalination in future
phases (Mandela, 2020).

The use of treated wastewater in the region has been spreading considerably. More than two
thirds of collected wastewater in the Arab region is safely treated at the secondary or tertiary
level. Nevertheless, only a quarter of this volume is used for agriculture and groundwater
recharge. In most countries of the Arabian Penninsula, treated wastewater is used for
greenbelts and nature reserves, and to combat land degradation. Jordan leads the Arab region
in the use of treated wastewater, with 100% of treated wastewater reportedly used in 2013
(UNESCWA, 2017). Nevertheless, there is a significant potential for the expansion of the use
and value of safely treated wastewater in other parts of the Arab region and specifically for the
agricultural sector.
While agriculture represents only 7% of the regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the sector
consumes 84% of all freshwater withdrawals in the region (UNESCWA, 2019a). Although the
value of this water is not well reflected in the pricing and export of agricultural commodities,
the sector employs approximately 38% of the region’s population and produces 23% of GDP
in Arab Least Developed Countries (UNESCWA, 2020a). This renders water for crops and
livestock essential for sustaining rural livelihoods, income and food security in some of the
most vulnerable parts of the region. The value of water in this water-scarce region, however,
is well understood given the range of efforts underway to enhance water use efficiency and
productivity in the agricultural sector at the intergovernmental, national and farm levels, as
regularly addressed by the High-Level Joint Committee of Arab Ministers of Agriculture and
Water. Improvements in water use efficiency and productivity in the Arab region have been
valued at about 0.5% of regional GDP (Rosegrant et al., 2008), where the average irrigation
efficiency is below 46% (AFED, 2015).
The region is relatively urbanized, with more than 58% of its population now living in cities
(UNESCWA, 2020a). The disparity in coverage between urban and rural areas, the intermittent
supply, the high amounts of non-revenue water, and the low cost recovery render it difficult to
value water effectively in cities as well. Water service providers are under increasing pressure
to meet the needs of growing cities and informal settlements, including around 26 million
of those that are forcibly displaced (refugees and internally displaced people) in the Arab
region (UNESCWA, 2020b). While the influx of displaced communities adds to the growing
pressure on water and sanitation services, displaced people often do not have the means
to pay for such services to meet their basic water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) needs.
Nearly 87 million people lack access to an improved source on premises, 70 million do not
have a continuous water supply and over 74 million people lack access to basic handwashing
facilities (WHO/UNICEF, 2019a). This leads to additional costs and has many health
implications, particularly given the need to stem the transmission of COVID-19.
Affordability and access to water resources are fundamental when considering the value of
water. Findings from SDG 6 monitoring under the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme
(JMP) have highlighted that Northern Africa and Western Asia, which largely overlaps with the
Arab region, have the second-highest rate of water expenditures. Nearly 20% of the population
spent more than 2 to 3% of their household expenditures on WASH services (United Nations,
2018). Vulnerable communities, which are most often not connected to water supply and
sanitation networks, end up paying much more for water-related services than their connected
counterparts. The health cost is no less, as in 2016 there were nearly 30,000 deaths in the
region attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (SDG Indicator 3.9.2 –
WHO, n.d.).
For the full value of water to be captured and considered by all to be a human right, there is a
need for considerable investment in infrastructure, appropriate technologies and the use of
non-conventional water resources to improve productivity, sustainability and access for all.

9.1
The increasing
emphasis on
bringing multiple
perspectives into
water governance

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development emphasizes the integrated nature of
development and the need to balance economic, social, and environmental considerations.
This would require institutional reforms and innovative governance approaches that mitigate
the trade-offs and maximize the synergies between the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
and their policy domains (Breuer et al., 2019; OECD, 2017c). There is an evolving understanding
that a diverse set of values drives the economic and financial considerations in water-related
decision-making (Schulz et al., 2018; Pahl-Wostl et al., 2020). Taking a much broader stance on
values than what was advocated under the Dublin principles (ICWE, 1992); the High-Level Panel
on Water (HLPW, 2018) encourages countries to “Recognize and Embrace Water’s Multiple
Values” (the related Bellagio Principles are outlined in Box 1.6). Coupled with a recognition
of water’s multiple values, there is also a call for more robust measurement and valuation
methods to help resolve trade-offs (Garrick et al., 2017). This is broadly what this Chapter
refers to as a transition to multi-value approaches to water governance.
The use of multi-value approaches to water governance entails acknowledging the role of
values in driving key water resources management decisions as well as a call for active
participation of a more diverse set of actors, thereby also incorporating a varied set of values
into water governance. Incorporating the intrinsic or relational values of diverse groups to
better inform and legitimize water and related land resources management decisions entails
the direct participation of groups or interests that are often excluded from water-related
decision-making. It may bring greater emphasis on ecological and environmental processes
and refocus efforts on sharing water resource benefits – for present and future generations –
rather than allocating water quantities for highest-value economic priorities.

9.2
Challenges
in bringing
multiple values
to bear on water
governance

This section points to a set of challenges in transitioning to a system of water governance
that recognizes multiple values and the active participation of a varied set of actors. The first
challenge relates to acknowledging that the governance of water is driven by a set of implicit or
explicit values (Schulz et al., 2018). This entails recognizing that different interests and diverging
perspectives inherent to the social, cultural, environmental, ecological and economic values
integral to water drive diverse resource-related decisions. This does not only relate to ‘who is
at the governance table,’ but also explicitly recognizes the worth of water to different groups in
society. The second challenge relates to water valuation: the assessment or description of the
value or worth of using water in different ways. However, water valuation is fraught not only with
measurement issues, but also with a whole array of issues relating to what can – and should –
be measured at all, and by whom. This then leads to the third challenge, which relates to the
common disconnect between public decision-making processes and actions on the ground,
including the risk of agendas being controlled by vested interests.

9.2.1 Bringing diverse voices and values into the discussion – The challenges of
meaningful participation
The effective participation of a more diverse set of actors can greatly influence the outcome
of water governance, including the generation and sharing of a greater set of benefits from
the use of water. Despite the fact that participatory approaches are not new to the water
sector (e.g. the Dublin Principles suggest “full public consultation and involvement of users
in the planning and implementation of water projects” (ICWE, 1992, Principle 2)), the Agenda
2030 calls for renewed efforts to inform decision-making, and to recognize and manage
trade-offs and potential conflicts between policy priorities in participatory and inclusive ways
(OECD, 2016). In reality, individuals or groups from indigenous communities, women, and
youth groups are often not included; not considered ‘relevant’, or for other reasons impeded
from participating in relevant decision-making processes (Pahl-Wostl, 2020). Resolving the
challenges of exclusion has been underscored in the HLPW Outcome Document, which calls for
a transition with respect to the identification of, and roles for, ‘relevant’ stakeholders, including
to “identify and take into account the multiple and diverse values of water to different groups and
interests in all decisions affecting water” (HLPW, 2018, p. 17).

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

Despite the best intentions to involve a diverse set of actors, it should be stressed that
participation takes time. This time investment, which is a must for governance processes, might
be incompatible with specific projects, policies, or national and local political timelines. Dialogue
mechanisms need to already be established for any strategic ‘co-governance’ of a multiple
values-based approach to water use and protection, if it is to go beyond donor-driven project
lifecycles and actually enable longer-term ‘governance’ of projects and water uses, in specific
locations and with specific stakeholders. On the other hand, projects are a means to finance
development, and ‘governance processes’ may not provide the type of return that would motivate
investment. Hence, participation – or governance for that matter – cannot be treated as a ‘magic
bullet’ or quick solution. It does require both time and funding in order to take place.

Despite the best
intentions to

set of actors, it

Another obstacle for participation is that it must be continuously reinvented. Even though a
successful consultation in one location can lend its ‘approach’ as a lesson learned to other
locations, the potential training of stakeholders or facilitators, or the time needed for officials or
managers to visit different sites and participate in processes, cannot be reduced, even if a certain
approach has already been carried out successfully in other locations. Hence, there are few
opportunities for economies of scale. In addition, participation – understood as ‘co-ownership’ or
real influence – can challenge the status quo, in which vested interests can be important. There
may be reasons to rush projects in ways to forgo discussion and full vetting of all parties, as
participation might lead to projects not going ahead, even if the required financing is available.
Finally, it is important to mention that ‘more’ or ‘better’ participation with ‘more actors’ may
still not resolve the complex array of challenges and competing interests inherent to water
governance processes. Stakeholders with the best of intentions at moments can be deeply
dissatisfied with the outcomes of multi-stakeholder processes to activate the necessary
reforms, or when ideas proposed by vested interests may prevent lasting change. This implies
that ‘more participation’ alone may not resolve the challenges described in this Chapter but
must be embedded within a country’s water policy, along with a wider basket of interventions
that seek to strengthen multi-value governance processes in water resources management.

9.2.2 Balancing trade-offs when you cannot measure what you really treasure
Water valuation exercises have come to predominantly focus on quantifying a monetary value
of water-related goods and services. Hellegers and Van Halsema (2019, p. 522) argue that “as
wider scopes and concerns on how water affects the well-being of society entered the fray of
valorisation, it has become increasingly clear that decision-making should be more concerned
with weighing [and reconciling] the trade-offs among the diverse values of water, rather than
establishing one commensurate value. Valuation then should no longer be solely targeted at
‘economic’ value determination …, but more towards offering a structured and transparent
mechanism that supports a multi-stakeholder process” to recognize, balance and address the
trade-offs among diverse types of values. Water decision-making appears at the nexus of
ethics, public policy, nature, values, beliefs and rationality (Priscoli, 2012).
Garrick et al. (2017) emphasize the importance of valuing water by going beyond what can
be easily measured. Valuing water is difficult and contentious not only due to measurement
issues but also because of what it represents: “Disputes may arise regardless of the validity and
precision of valuation methods, reflecting the inevitable trade-offs underlying water governance”
(p. 1004). The contribution of valuation or measurement for such inherent political deliberations
can be seen to lie principally in how it can expose the diverse values attached to water, and the
different ways such values may – or may not – be captured. This can also enable decisionmakers to explicitly acknowledge which values are driving water governance decisions. This
makes clear the need for multi-stakeholder participatory processes as an institutional strategy
to support the recognition and inclusion of values and to activate governance mechanisms that
manage water according to a broader set of values (e.g. representing social, cultural, economic
and ecological values), which can facilitate inclusive and value-based water decision-making. As
Hellegers and Van Halsema (2019, p. 521) point out, multi-stakeholder processes (as outlined in

Enabling multi-value approaches in water governance

|

123

Section 9.3.1) can seek to include multiple values “to jointly reach a certain level of agreement on
the management of water resources within the set priorities of [a country’s] development strategy”.
However, beyond the relevance of multi-stakeholder processes, a key challenge is how to consider
or measure diverse sets of values, often without a common denominator or metric (see Boxes 1.1
and 1.2, and Figure 1.3, where different types of ‘values’ are defined).
Different communities (professional and non-professional, indigenous and non-indigenous
groups, etc.) have diverse knowledge and value systems. Moreover, different stakeholders relate
differently to water bodies, nature, the environment, as well as to other groups in society.
Some sets of values are less tangible and notably difficult to quantify or translate into monetary
terms – which is a common methodology for comparing different sets of values. For example,
indigenous peoples’ worldviews and values related to the environment can go beyond instrumental
or intrinsic values.40 Figure 9.1 below captures this as ‘relational’ [or place-based] values in relation
to nature. Such moral and emotional links to water challenge the worldviews embedded in most
standard approaches to measurement and valuation of water resources management.

Instrumental values refer to a matter that is important/has value because of the service or utility it provides, e.g. a
washbasin for convenient handwashing. For instance, art or music can be instrumentally valuable because their value
is dependent on and derives from the responses they evoke. Intrinsic values, on the other hand, refer to a matter that
is important/has value or is valued by others for its own sake, regardless of whether it provides services or utility.
Handwashing may be intrinsically valuable if it makes a person feel good, regardless of being healthy or clean. It may
even have an intrinsic value for moral reasons – being the right thing to do. Further, intrinsic and instrumental values are
fundamental in moral theory as well as conservation biology (see e.g. Justus et al., 2009)

124

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

Other examples of these deeper attachments and long-standing relationships expressed as
values can be found through ethics of care or stewardship that contribute to human wellbeing (Bennett et al., 2018; Jax et al., 2018). There are several definitions of relational values,
but most capture “the importance attributed to meaningful relations and responsibilities
between humans and between humans and nature” (Arias-Arévalo et al., 2017). As observed
in Chan et al. (2016), relational values are not present in things but derivative of relationships
and responsibilities to them. The recognition and use of ‘relational values’ are important for
fostering pluralistic approaches that help bridge differing worldviews in relation to water
bodies (Parsons and Fisher, 2019).

Balancing the
representation
of instrumental
economic growth
priorities with
relational
and/or intrinsic
values may
reinvigorate the
national and
subnational
political dynamics

Balancing the representation of instrumental economic growth priorities with relational
and/or intrinsic values may reinvigorate the national and subnational political dynamics.
In practice, this is very complex, as there is no ‘optimal’ water allocation strategy that
encompasses all the multiple values associated with water, as different value systems
intersect and overlap (Hellegers and Leflaive, 2015). Indeed, the essence of water
governance is about resolving trade-offs and conflicts in ways that create the most possible
benefits and synergies, as such methodologies for grappling with multiple values and
uncertainty are maturing (LeRoy Poff et al., 2015; see also Section 9.3 on pathways below).
Beyond challenges related to measurement methodologies, as described above; the next
challenge resides in the implementation of an open, inclusive and balanced process for
decision-making, which is discussed in the next section.

9.2.3 From theory to practice: Navigating hidden agendas and vested interests
The third set of challenges involves some of the many obstacles in enabling and sustaining
multi-value governance processes. If decision-makers fail to take people’s views into
account – meaning to not only listen, but to actually reframe questions and answers – they
have only wasted people’s time, and therefore the consultation loses credibility. In the worst
case, consultation can turn into an unjust exercise that depoliticizes local development, or
is ‘captured’ by economic or political elites (Cooke and Kothari, 2001; Gaynor, 2014; OECD,
2015b). An experience of India’s Swachh Bharat Mission highlights the need for robust
consultation measures to include diverse groups and the potential hierarchies between them
(Mukherjee, 2020).
The implementation process also risks running into problems of bureaucratic inertia.
Disinterest, excessive regulation or rigid conformity to rules may compound with corruption.
The Water Integrity Network (2016, p. 23) suggests that “corruption and a lack of integrity
threaten every area of life where power, money and prestige are at stake.” Apart from derailing
policy implementation, corruption also reinforces existing inequalities (Søreide, 2016)
between broader groups in society, and the resources available to women and men (UNDP/
Huairou Commission, 2012). As suggested in the section below, transparency and the equal
involvement of people of different gender identities and backgrounds may help break up
networks of vested interests and hidden agendas.
As a result of these and other challenges, a multi-values driven governance approach does
not only relate to water, but aims to engage with the whole social, cultural, economic and
wider political system. Water governance needs to navigate explicit priority-setting at the
political level along with the implicit prioritizations (values) carried out in practical policy
implementation. This does not only involve public servants, but the whole society, including
the private sector, civil society and other groups.

9.3
Pathways
towards multivalue water
governance
processes

This section highlights some potential pathways for how nations can transition into multivalue governance. These pathways build on existing approaches such as Integrated Water
Resources Management (IWRM). IWRM represents a plan-led, multi-scale catchment-based
approach that integrates interests of diverse stakeholder groups operating at various political
levels and policy sectors (Lubell and Edelenbos, 2013), which would be open or inclusive
of any nexus or set of issues. IWRM is most often represented as cutting across water for
people, food, nature, industry and other uses, and aims to encompass all social, economic and
environmental considerations.41
The different pathways or approaches presented below aim to respond to many of the
challenges highlighted in the previous section.

9.3.1 Strengthen multi-stakeholder processes that recognize and reconcile a
comprehensive mix of values in water governance
The process of enabling a multi-value approach to water governance means recognizing that
values ultimately drive water governance decisions, and actively incorporating a balance of
cultural, spiritual, economic, environmental or social values into water resources management
decisions within a specific policy context (Hellegers and Van Halsema, 2019). This may be
achieved by activating decision-making processes that enable a wide array of stakeholders
to express their values, with a view to reaching a certain level of agreement. Such processes
can be considered to ‘co-create’ water management (see Hermans et al., 2006). Above all,
strengthening [multi-stakeholder] water governance includes “giving ‘voice’ to communities that
are historically underrepresented or ignored in decision-making processes” (Garrick et al. 2017,
p. 1005). This section provides examples of where underrepresented groups or additional
values are brought into water governance processes at different levels.
Since the early 2000s, there is a growing will and effort to make up for the historic exclusion
of indigenous peoples’ interests in water and environmental management. This has led to
the integration of perspectives and knowledge of indigenous peoples in water governance,
most notably at the global level (IWGIA, 2019; Makey and Awatere, 2018). Incorporating the
knowledge and beliefs of indigenous peoples into water governance implies foundational
changes in the valuation of water, involving different cultural and social identities and
institutions, separate from the mainstream or dominant society or culture (Awume et al., 2020).
For instance, in New Zealand, the Integrated Kaipara Harbour Management Group connects
Maori values alongside principles of ecosystem-based management. This involves values
related to sustainable resource management (kaitiakitanga), respect (manaakitanga) and
relationships (whanaungatanga) (Harmsworth et al., 2016). Box 9.1 illustrates another example
of how governments are actively seeking to embed values of water from the perspective of
indigenous communities into water governance processes.
In addition to indigenous communities, there are many groups whose voices are often not
effectively incorporated into water management decisions. For instance, women usually
provide most of the labour for securing household water needs but remain underrepresented in
structures of formal water management (Thakar, 2019; World Bank, 2019). Efficiency gains can
be realized by bringing women into water governance bodies at various levels (Mommen et al.,
2017; Trivedi, 2018).42 A diversification of genders in governing bodies may also have knock-on
effects like the opening-up of close-knit management communities and shine light on hidden
agendas. Such additional transparency brought on by broader participation and mix among
decision-makers can reduce corruption and mismanagement.

41

IWRM has been defined as “a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land
and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising
the sustainability of vital ecosystems” (GWP, 2000, p. 22).

42

This ‘efficiency argument’ speaks for the instrumental value of involving women more equally in water management.
Yet, there is also an intrinsic value relating to the moral imperative of equal involvement or influence of women and
men in decision-making.

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

Box 9.1 The National Water Initiative in Australia
In Australia, Commonwealth and State government agencies have aimed to move beyond a resource exploitation focus and
towards acknowledging different values and interests in water governance. This is of importance to indigenous Australians
whose interests in water were only formally recognized in 2004 with The National Water Initiative (National Water Commission,
2004; Bark et al., 2012).
The National Water Initiative directs all signatories to provide for indigenous access to water resources by: (i) ensuring inclusion
of indigenous representation in water planning where possible; (ii) taking account of existing Native Title rights to water in the
catchment area; (iii) allocating water to Native Title holders.1 As long as the indigenous interests are ‘non-consumptive’ and
‘non-commercial’, they do not require a water allocation (see Maclean et al., 2014).
Indigenous Australians have developed governance activities to blend their knowledge with their contemporary conservation
and land management knowledge and training, enabling them to engage in water planning and management on their traditional
lands (Maclean et al., 2014). Further, partnerships between Aboriginal groups and social researchers to document their water
values, knowledge and interests has been shown to have multiple benefits. First, these partnerships record valuable traditional
ecological knowledge and related values. Second, they can also articulate indigenous interests in ways that make them
accessible to scientists and planners, while most importantly, remaining true to the relevant worldview. Indigenous groups can
use social research tools to directly communicate their water knowledge, values and interests to government agencies and to
build the necessary relationships to maintain a meaningful dialogue.
Source: Based on Maclean et al. (2015, pp. 142–144).

Native Title is “a right to access and take water for the purposes of satisfying personal, domestic, social, cultural, religious, spiritual or non commercial communal
needs, including the observance of traditional laws and customs, including a right to teach the physical and spiritual attributes of places and areas of importance on
or in the land and waters” (O’Donnell, 2011, p. 11; see also Jackson and Langton, 2012).

Next, mobilizing youth networks into water governance can be construed as a way of
integrating future generations’ rights into water governance. The vibrant youth movement
‘Fridays for Future’ has had a major influence on environmental policy through massive and
consistent mobilizations, constituting a critical force for global change (Braw, 2019). Youth
movements have also been engaged in the management of water scarcity in the Mediterranean
(Pedrero et al., 2018). Such voices and perspectives greatly influence the values – and the time
perspective – that are considered in water decision-making.
At the international level, the challenge is to bring states, international agencies, bodies of
the United Nations (UN), civil society and academia together. The Global High-Level Panel on
Water and Peace (2017) urges states to adhere to and implement International Water Law, and
thus calls for wide accession by states to the 1997 Watercourses Convention and the 1992
Water Convention hosted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).
The panel also recommends intensified work on supplemental instruments to these two
United Nations global water conventions, including ‘soft law instruments’ such as guidelines
and procedures that facilitate water cooperation. The Working Group on Integrated Water
Resources Management promotes technical and political dialogues on water governance, e.g.
with respect to water allocation, hydropower development and irrigation. Such work draws on
the values and benefits outlined in Table 9.1.
Finally, the integration of human rights principles represents an attempt to broaden
stakeholder processes, through yet another angle, towards more equitable water governance
processes and outcomes. The human rights-based approach (HRBA) focuses on those who
are the most marginalized, excluded or discriminated against, but not with an eye to the ‘basic
needs’ of ‘beneficiaries,’ but rather to ‘fulfil the rights’ of people (UNFPA, n.d.). The human rights
to water and sanitation do not only refer to the contents of universal and adequate access to
water and sanitation, but also to the procedural right of influencing the ways in which these
services are being provided.

9.3.2 Include benefit-sharing into water governance decisions
In water resources management, explicit benefit-sharing to enhance the productivity
of shared water resources has been advocated as an alternative to water allocation by
water volume (Sadoff and Grey, 2003; 2005). Sadoff and Grey (2003) argued that by
refocusing from the sharing of water (quantities) to the sharing of benefits that may be
derived from the use of water, a zero-sum game of water-sharing is being replaced by
a positive-sum game. “[F]ocusing on the benefits derived from the use of water in a river
basin, rather than the physical water itself, is another way to broaden the perspective of
basin planners” (p. 396). Benefit-sharing yields far greater scope for mutually beneficial
and sustainable arrangements among different stakeholders (Yu, 2008). The goods and
services (benefits to which values may be attached) include hydropower, flood regulation,
irrigated agriculture or improved navigation. Benefits may be non-economic, like improved
environmental stewardship, regional integration or even political gains, and go well beyond
monetary compensations. As highlighted in the previous section, Table 9.1, benefits also
extend to regional integration, trade and reduced conflict. The case of the Senegal River
basin (Box 9.2) offers insights into how benefit-sharing approaches have been tried on a
transboundary scale in Africa.
Benefit-sharing can also enable enhanced poverty reduction. Yet, as discussed in the box
above, in order to realize such gains, the mix of actors that benefit and those involved in
determining the benefit-sharing is critical. As benefits can be measured through values,
benefit-sharing is an example how to integrate a diverse set of values into water governance
within and between nations.
Although most discussions on benefit-sharing relate to the transboundary scale (see
Section 8.2.2), the original concept offers a framework to resolve the rising competition for
water between urban and rural, domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses (Garrick et al., 2019).
Benefit-sharing may even be seen as an application of the systems perspective – going well
beyond the water liquid itself – and the need to grapple with different interests, represented by
the various benefits (and their values) accruing to different actors or stakeholders.

9.3.3 Focus on systems to go beyond narrow sectoral interventions
A systems-based approach to water involves multi-scale policy and planning to integrate water
allocation incentives into wider sectoral processes of institutional reform and infrastructure
development. This requires an understanding of behavioural responses, which can amplify or
undermine such actions (Garrick et al., 2020b). Therefore, priorities for water governance and
the appropriate level of management depend greatly on the scale at which the problem appears
(Kjellén, 2018). Water governance processes may gain from ‘breaking siloes’ to address global,
regional and/or local issues.
A systems approach that integrates multiple values across multiple scales into water
governance calls for: (i) understanding the interconnections between hydrological,
administrative, economic, political, social, and ecological/environmental systems and the
underlying values embedded within these systems; (ii) identifying the risks, shocks or stressors
faced by people and/or the ecosystem or production systems; (iii) developing scenarios or
models to understand trends, responses, issues and impacts (involving actors from various
sectors as described in Section 9.3.1); (iv) co-designing the type and mix of actions to be taken
based on agreement among representatives of a diverse set of values; and (v) testing, learning

Box 9.2 Benefit-sharing and cost allocation in the Senegal River basin
The Senegal River, the second longest river in western Africa, flows through Guinea, Mali, Senegal and Mauritania to the Atlantic
Ocean. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, the basin area suffered severe aridity, leading to famine and severe degradation of
the natural resources base, enormous losses in agriculture and ecology, and problems of groundwater recession and saltwater
intrusion. It was in this context, in 1972, that the Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve Sénégal (OMVS), the Senegal
River Basin Organization, was established comprising Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal. The OMVS hoped to a) promote food selfsufficiency in the basin, b) reduce economic vulnerability to climatic fluctuations and external factors, c) accelerate economic
development, and d) secure and improve the incomes of basin populations through benefits-sharing and cooperation among the
three riparian countries.
In order to govern and manage the Senegal River, a framework was needed to allocate benefits and costs in a way that would
be satisfactory to all member states, so a methodology was developed to allocate joint costs across services (hydropower,
navigation, and irrigation) and member states. In a traditional single-country multi-purpose investment, cost allocation is typically
accomplished by comparing the benefits to the costs of the various project services. Multi-country approaches are far more
complex as the benefits to be gained from the river differ from country to country. For Mali, gaining navigable access to the
Atlantic Ocean and power production were of primary interest. For Mauritania and Senegal, developing irrigation and to a lesser
degree power production (except for the cities) was of primary interest.
Thus, to estimate the hydropower, irrigation and navigation benefits derived from two reservoirs that were to be built on the
Senegal river, a cost allocation was made based on the benefits that member states could gain from irrigation, power generation
and shipping, allocating cost percentages for Mali, Mauritania and Senegal as 35.3%, 22.6% and 42.1%, respectively.
In the early 1970s, this was a unique and innovative approach for river basin projects. At that time, preparing a comprehensive
environmental and social assessment for a major project was not common practice.
The experience of the OMVS stands out compared to other river basins around the world where the dialogue among riparian
members is often entrenched in discussions over water allocations, instead of focusing on the benefits derived from diverse
uses of the river among various members. This vision of benefit-sharing was integral to the discussions among the nations of
Mali, Mauritania and Senegal, and helped to reaffirm that “regional cooperation was an absolute necessity since all would benefit
in ways that none could accomplish alone”. The commitment among the three countries to these principles of benefits sharing
was codified through the establishment of legal conventions and a remarkable degree of supra-national executive authority
vested in the OMVS. Moreover, the greatest demonstration of solidarity on benefit-sharing is espoused in the early OMVS goals,
which state that “the benefits and aims for development would supersede political boundaries and be intended for all of society
living in the Senegal River Basin”.

Box 9.3 Nexus approaches
The conceptual framework articulated as Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) arguably pursues the integrated
and coordinated management of water and land as a means of balancing different water uses, while meeting social and
ecological needs and promoting economic development. However, by explicitly focusing on water, there is a risk of overfocus
on water-related development goals, thereby reinforcing traditional sectoral approaches.
A common nexus approach to water considers the different dimensions of water, energy, food and the environment and
recognizes the interdependencies of different resource uses to develop sustainably in order to strike a balance between the
different goals, interests and needs of people and the environment. It explicitly addresses complex interactions and feedback
between human and natural systems. Nexus interactions are about how resource systems are used and managed, describing
interdependencies (depending on each other), constraints (imposing conditions or trade-offs) and synergies (mutually
reinforcing or having shared benefits).
Going beyond many IWRM approaches, a nexus approach considers interactions taking place within the context of globally
relevant drivers, such as demographic changes, urbanization, industrial development, agricultural modernization, international
and regional trade, markets and prices, technological advancements, diversification and changes of diets, and climate change,
as well as more context-specific drivers, like governance structures and processes, and cultural and societal beliefs and
behaviours. These drivers often have a strong impact on the resource base, causing environmental degradation and resource
scarcity, but they also affect and are affected by different social, economic and environmental goals and interests.
A recurring criticism of the nexus approach is that it adds relatively little to already existing integrated approaches to
resources management such as IWRM, if IWRM is implemented properly and holistically.

and adapting.43 As pointed out by Garrick et al. (2019), periodic reviews should be built
into the process to avoid crisis-driven responses. The importance of such analyses to take
cognizance of systemic linkages of water decisions across sectors have been emphasized in
the Dutch-supported Valuing Water Initiative (VWI), which builds coalitions to foster dialogue
with diverse groups around trade-offs and competing interests in Colombia, Ethiopia, the
Netherlands, Peru, and Zambia (VWI, 2020).44
Although IWRM is seen as a ‘systems approach’ to water management designed to enable
a sequenced, inclusive and institutional approach that responds to contextual realities in
order to achieve water security (GWP 2009; Schenk et al., 2009; Villarroel Walker et al., 2012),
in practice it has been criticized as ‘too water-centric’ in its approach to managing water
resources (Giordano and Shah, 2014). IWRM has often not fully considered important social,
economic and environmental linkages across other sectors of an economy (Hoff, 2011;
Roidt and Avellán, 2019). For this reason, different ‘nexus’ approaches have emerged as
complementary frameworks, aiming to more explicitly account for certain interdependencies
and linkages beyond the water sector (see Box 9.3).
Among these complementary ‘nexus’ approaches one may include nexuses of ‘water and
health,’ ‘source-to-sea’/‘ridge-to-reef’, or for example, ‘ecosystem-based approaches’ (EBA).
EBA and the greater consideration of ecological interdependencies have been brought
forward along with the increasing recognition of the global crises of climate change and the
crossing of ‘planetary boundaries’ (UNDP, 2020).

43

Put differently, a systems approach that integrates multiple values into water governance may consider the following
elements: a) define the boundaries of the system; b) stress the system; c) model the scenarios, d) co-design the
approach, and; e) learn, test and adapt the approach.

9.3.4 Integrating ecological and environmental values into climate-resilient water
management

In recent calls for
enhancing climate
resilience in water
governance and
management, it
is suggested to
systematically
consider
uncertainty and
risk and build
resilience into
water-related
decision-making

In recent calls for enhancing climate resilience in water governance and management, it is
suggested to systematically consider uncertainty and risk, and to build resilience into waterrelated decision-making (Timboe et al., 2019). One of the major issues is to identify what
values (and for whom) are associated with climate change (the risks and costs of diverse
climatological shocks to societies, economies, as well as ecological health) and whether
underrepresented ecological and environmental values can be better integrated into water
governance to enable climate resilient water management.
The European Union (EU) has pioneered ways to embed ecological and environmental values
into water management, as an EBA has been integrated into the EU’s biodiversity strategy,
the EU’s 7th Environment Action Programme and the EU’s Water Framework Directive (WFD).
The WFD focuses on the ecological perspective, having as its main objective to attain a good
ecological status of water resources (European Parliament/Council of the European Union,
2000). To achieve this objective, the EU supports the following: a) implementation mechanisms
that focus on the assessment of water resources and of pressures, b) participatory processes,
and cost–benefit considerations in support of watershed decision-making, c) the development
of River Basin Management Plans (European Commission, 2019a; Grizzetti et al., 2016), and d),
mapping, assessment and accounting of ecosystems and their services, both in biophysical and
monetary terms (Maes et al., 2018).
Next, ecosystem frameworks may be a viable approach to identify and integrate ecosystem and
environmental values into water governance (see Chapter 2). These policies are contributing to
preserving and restoring Europe’s natural capital by integrating ecosystems and their services
into decision-making (European Commission, 2019b). Outside Europe, the use of ecosystem
services-based approaches highlighting the multiple values of water-dependent ecosystems
have gained momentum also in Costa Rica, Ecuador and Mexico (Engels et al., 2008).
More broadly, a climate-resilient water management approach would go beyond IWRM,
as it would not only aim to manage natural resources by adapting to global climate-driven
changes, but also ensure to go beyond ‘business-as-usual’; include redundancy,45 flexibility, and
adaptability; and specifically aim to reduce the vulnerability of poor communities (James et al.,
2018).

9.4
Conclusions

This chapter has highlighted both challenges and pathways for transitioning towards multi-value
and multi-stakeholder water governance processes. Such governance approaches emphasize
the multiple perspectives that need to be incorporated into decision-making processes, and
not only for the sake of improving decisions and outcomes. The inclusion of multiple values
and perspectives is also a moral imperative that provides legitimacy to decision-making and
subsequent policy implementation.
Water management processes tend to include only a limited number of stakeholders, and
to focus narrowly on exploitation of water resources to prioritize economic objectives. Such
technocratic or narrow water management approaches have been critiqued on both social and
environmental grounds. Water managers and decision-makers need to reach out beyond ‘the
water sector’ not only to reach those sectors and industries that implicitly decide over land and

“Redundancy refers to spare capacity purposely created within systems so that they can accommodate disruption,
extreme pressures or surges in demand” (The Rockefeller Foundation/Arup, 2014, p. 5). It is achieved when multiple
functions, elements or components provide the “same, similar, or backup functions” (Ahern, 2011, p. 342), providing
resilience by way of “saving from failure.”

water use in the course of running their businesses, but also to include communities that have
historically been excluded from natural resource governance and water management. This
broadening of interests to incorporate multiple values into a decision-making process adds
complexity to the formal process. It may also run into resistance from vested interests as
conflicting demands or worldviews relating to how water and land should be used or protected
are brought to the table.

The most
important way
to achieve the
multi-value
approach remains
participation to
allow new and
underrepresented
groups into the
process

Opportunities for overcoming these differences and attempts to find mutually supportive
solutions to highly complex water management decisions include the active incorporation of
a values lens into governance processes. The most important way to achieve the multi-value
approach remains participation, as highlighted above, to allow new and underrepresented
groups into the process. The HRBAs to development affirm the imperative of involving all
concerned in an effective way. But beyond this, the way in which the issues are framed can
make a great difference: foremost, by broadening the perspective from the water as such, and
seeing resources as a means to achieve many other things. Such ‘benefit-sharing’ approaches
can lead to a more rational and mutually beneficial sharing and use of water, as a means to
higher-level goals.
Also, it is imperative that all stakeholders see and understand the interlinkages. The
approaches and pathways discussed in this chapter all build on a systems perspective –
including ecosystems-based, nexus and climate-resilient approaches to water management.
Again, this may help stakeholders find new and mutually beneficial ways to cooperate
on preserving or developing values even with a broader time horizon, i.e. longer-term
sustainability.
While the chapter has provided a glimpse into the benefits associated with multi-value water
governance approaches, there are also great challenges. Active transitions towards inclusive,
multi-values approaches to water management that balance ecological, social, economic/
financial and other key concerns (many of which are often underrepresented in major waterrelated decisions) also break with vested interests and the status quo. Even if decision-making
can achieve an equitable and inclusive process, it is imperative that financing and policy
implementation follow suit. Governments, the private sector and civil society can gain by
engaging from a values perspective in future development projects and governance processes.
By balancing environmental, social, cultural, economic and other priorities, and systematically
integrating the interdependencies and trade-offs between goals and decisions, inclusive multivalue and multi-stakeholder approaches stand to improve water governance.

Introduction

Any costs not
recovered through
tariffs must be
covered through
a combination
of taxes and
transfers

A fundamental challenge with managing and valuing water is that water encompasses the
qualities and benefits of many different types of goods.46 At its source, it is usually treated as
a public good, an open access resource, or a common-pool resource, available for the public
to use without exclusion (Anisfeld, 2011). With open access, common-pool resources, users
get all the benefits from their own use, but costs are distributed – often unequally – amongst
users (e.g. resource depletion or quality degradation), potentially subjecting it to overuse,
exploitation and degradation. In order to provide benefits to cities, farms and households,
costly investments in infrastructure like dams, pipes and treatment systems are needed. In
the case of water supply and sanitation infrastructure, these services are generally private
goods (i.e. the services are both excludable and rivalrous), which means that the poor can be
excluded if the price is too high. Other services, like flood protection provided by dams and
levees, are public goods, where no one can be excluded, nor can user fees be easily collected.
Water can also simultaneously be an economic good – a critical input for nearly all forms
of economic production – as well as a merit good – a commodity which should be made
available based on need rather than willingness to pay, as it is vital for life and human health.
In order to maximize the benefits of water, several different valuation criteria must be
simultaneously considered. First, given water’s status as a merit good and a declared human
right in Resolution 64/292 of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA, 2010), access to
safely managed drinking water at an affordable price needs to be extended to all. At the same
time, in order to prevent tragedy-of-the-commons situations, where water is used without care
for the sustainability of the resource, a price or ‘tariff’ is often needed to constrain profligacy.
However, the price of water, its cost of delivery and its value are not synonymous, and price
is merely one tool for aligning water’s use with its values (see Chapter 1). Finally, the vital
infrastructure needed for service delivery has operational, maintenance and construction costs
that must be recouped to ensure access and network expansion. Where these funds come
from can play an important role in determining who gets access, how service is expanded, and
ultimately to whom service providers are responsive.
There are three major means for funding water investments: tariffs, taxes and transfers.
Tariffs are user-paid fees and typically increase with the use amount of service used.47
Cost-recovery tariffs may be estimated in order to cover the total costs of service provision
(i.e. including the depreciation and the profitability of the total capital employed) or some
selected portions of these. Any costs not recovered through tariffs must be covered through
a combination of taxes and transfers (Andres et al., 2019). A recent survey of 16 countries
shows just how countries can vary in their sources of funding of hygiene projects (Figure 10.1).

46

The taxonomy of goods presented in this chapter is the one extensively debated in the economic literature since the
1950s. Goods are classified in four types on the basis of two attributes: rivalry in and excludability from consumption.
Rivalry refers to the attribute for which the consumption of a good (or a service) by a person reduces the ability or
prevents another person in consuming simultaneously the same good (or service), while excludability refers to the
feasibility of excluding other people from accessing and consuming a good (or a service). The goods can be classified
in: private goods (excludable and rivalrous); public goods (non-excludable and non-rivalrous); and mixed goods as
common goods or common-pool resources (non-excludible and rivalrous); and club goods (excludible and nonrivalrous). The nature of goods – if private or public – does not depend on and is not related to who provides them,
whether they be private companies or public entities. The use of ‘public’ and ‘private’ throughout the entire chapter
relates to the meanings as provided in this footnote, and does not refer to categories of funding sources or ownership
(private vs. public funding/ownership).

47

Domestic or industrial tariffs typically have a fixed portion, as well as a variable portion that increases based on usage
(see Section 10.4). Irrigation water tariffs may also include volumetric charges, but are often based on the size of the
area under irrigation (number of hectares) and/or the crops that are being produced (see, for instance, Berbel et al.
2019 for a discussion on irrigation tariffs in Europe).

When decisions on whether to finance a water infrastructure project are made, several criteria
must be considered. Whereas an investment bank seeking to invest in a business might only
take into consideration its financial prospects, investments in water sector infrastructure must
consider that and more. This is because many of the benefits of water infrastructure are nonpecuniary – i.e. they do not result in a financial return – but still benefit society in meaningful
ways. And yet, decisions on whether to finance an investment and how that investment will be
funded are often interrelated, as the source of funding can determine the overall benefits of
the project. It is in this context that this chapter discusses methods to value investments in the
water sector, the challenges and importance of financing and funding infrastructure, and ways
to maximize the benefits that they provide.

10.2
Valuation of
infrastructure
investments and
financing decisions

Different types of water infrastructure will have different economic and financial return
profiles. Generalization is difficult given the diversity of infrastructure types. Some water
infrastructure will generate largely private economic benefits (e.g. drinking and irrigation
services) while some will generate largely public economic benefits (e.g. flood protection,
storm water drainage). Some infrastructure, like multi-purpose dams, may provide both.
There may also be infrastructure that provides, under certain conditions, common-pool and
club economic goods as well. Some water infrastructure will also have greater opportunities
to generate cash flow through user fees (i.e. higher financial returns), while other water
infrastructure will be justified largely on economic grounds (funded through taxes and other
sources). Understanding these different economic benefits and financial returns is important
to identify the funding mechanism over the full life cycle (planning, appraisal, implementation,
operation, maintenance and replacement). Nevertheless, all water infrastructure needs to
undergo a financial and economic cost–benefit analysis (CBA) to determine whether scarce
funding resources are best allocated to this infrastructure in comparison to other potential
investments in other sectors. Water services-related infrastructure (e.g. water supply,
wastewater, irrigation, hydropower) can potentially draw upon a wider range of financing
modalities, from both governments and commercial sources.

A cost–benefit analysis compares the costs of the project with the benefits, to determine
if the project is economically viable and worthwhile. Given scarce government and donor
budgets, it is critical that those funds finance only the projects that return the greatest
net benefits. An ideal analysis will include in the cost side of the analysis both capital
expenditures (CAPEX; i.e. the upfront costs of building the infrastructure) and operational
expenditures (OPEX; the ongoing operational and maintenance costs of the project). For
instance, the CAPEX of a water treatment plant would be the costs of designing and building
the plant itself. The OPEX would be the costs of paying salaries and materials to operate and
maintain the plant over its lifetime. Other costs that are ideally accounted for include social
costs, such as impacts on human health, and environmental costs like land conversation/
degradation or non-renewable groundwater depletion. Techniques for estimating these costs
are similar to those for estimating social and environmental benefits, and are discussed in
the ensuing paragraphs.
As with a project’s costs, many water investments will have economic, social and
environmental benefits. For instance, the expansion of water and sanitation infrastructure
will reduce the costs of obtaining water for households (economic); reduce illnesses such as
diarrhoeal disease or lead to general health benefits (social); reduce time needed to fetch
water (social); and improve water quality due to reduced nutrient effluence and bacterial
contamination (environmental). Aggregating these types of benefits can be difficult, as they
are not all easily converted into monetary amounts. Nevertheless, economists have tools for
monetizing some of these benefits (see Box 10.1). In cases where benefits cannot be
monetized, other valuation tools can be used, such as cost–effectiveness analyses, which
compare costs with non-pecuniary outcomes such as lives saved, people served or
environmental metrics achieved.

Box 10.1

Tools for monetizing non-monetary costs and benefits of water projects

The field of environmental economics provides several different ways to value non-monetary benefits. The most common
methods include:
• Contingent valuation: This approach asks people directly about their willingness to pay (WTP) for a certain good or
service, or what they would be willing to accept (WTA) to give up a good or service. For instance, the construction of a
wastewater treatment plant could improve water quality in a nearby river. This may not financially benefit nearby residents,
but it may give them more recreational opportunities, and improve nearby environmental quality and therefore ambiance.
By aggregating the residents’ WTP for this water quality improvement, the evaluator can get a sense of how much
residents value a cleaner river, and factor that in when assessing the benefits provided by the wastewater treatment plant
(Alberini and Cooper, 2000).
• Hedonic pricing: This approach typically relies on measuring how benefits are capitalized within housing or property prices.
A hedonic pricing model attempts to estimate how different factors affect the price of a home. Using the example from
above, the model will estimate how housing prices will change when the construction of a wastewater treatment plant
improves nearby river water quality. To do so, it compares the prices of houses in areas with poor water quality with similar
houses in areas with better water quality, while controlling for other confounding factors. The difference in housing prices
or rents is the value that the public places on the water quality improvement.
• Travel costs method: The underlying assumption of the travel cost method is that if an individual is willing to pay the
cost of visiting a recreational site, then they should value that site at least as much as what they paid to visit it. The
underpinning of this approach is that the effect of increasing travel cost is considered the same as increasing the price of
admission. Since many natural areas have either low or no admission prices, this approach uses travel cost as a proxy for
estimating consumer surplus (Bolt et al., 2005). If individuals are willing to pay more to travel to a lake or river with cleaner
water, that difference in the travel cost can be used as a lower bound for the value that individuals attach to the water
quality improvement.
For further details see Chapters 1 and 2.

A critical factor for determining economic benefits of a project is comparing it to what
would happen if the project were not undertaken. For instance, an expanded water supply
system that connects households to water utilities greatly reduces the cost of fetching
water. Nevertheless, water is a basic human need, and in the absence of this water
connection, households will find alternative means for water collection. In addition, there
may be alternative, lower-cost options for providing improved water to households, such
as a community tap. The costs and benefits of the proposed investment should therefore
be compared to the baseline (i.e. the status quo) as well as to these alternative projects, in
order to determine the true net benefits of the investment. By going through this process, one
can determine if the proposed investment is truly the best use of scarce funds, or if viable
alternatives exist.

10.3
Accounting for
the scarcity
value of water

In order to properly value water when planning and designing infrastructure projects, it is
vital that economic analyses factor in all externalities generated by the project. An externality
is a positive or negative side effect of an activity that is imposed on other parties. A project
that aims to expand a water supply piped network to new residents, for instance, will generate
significant externalities. Some will be positive, such as health benefits to the community due
to reduced spread of communicable diseases; and some can be negative, for instance if the
water comes from a non-renewable groundwater supply. The proper way to include the value
of water into the economic analysis, and thus account for water depletion, is through the use
of a shadow price of water.48 By accounting for the shadow price of scarce water resources, an
economic analysis can internalize the wider economic and ecological impacts of the project
and lead to better decision-making. Put simply, when water is very scarce and has many
competing uses, it will have a higher shadow price, and will impact the estimated net benefits
of a water investment.
Determining the true shadow price of water is non-trivial and requires a lot of information or
assumptions. The standard way to calculate the shadow price of water is through an optimal
control technique that aims to maximize a series of benefits over time. As this needs to occur
in a way that is economically credible and adequately rigorous, it requires a lot of information
about the future use of water. To calculate water’s shadow price, one must know information
(or make assumptions) about a whole host of future economic conditions, such as population
size, industry composition, domestic and international markets, as well as future hydrological
conditions. Adding to the complexity is the fact that the shadow price of water will vary by
location, as water availability and quality can fluctuate significantly from one basin to the next,
and thus must be estimated separately for each potential investment project.
Because of the difficulty in deriving a shadow price for water, it is often excluded from
economic analyses of water investments; however, less rigorous solutions do exist. One such
technique is the replacement cost method (see Box 1.4). Here, one estimates the costs to
the economy of needing to replace the water that is being used through either a reduction in
use by other sectors, or a switch from the current water source to another source such as an
inter-basin transfer or desalination. Both methods give an estimate of the value of a particular
water source to the broader economy (Box 10.2). Nevertheless, it must be noted that the
replacement cost method is an imperfect substitute for the optimal control problem, as it will
not factor in all significant externalities. Thus, the result may be above or below the net present
value of the true shadow price.

The city of Dhaka relies heavily on groundwater sources for its industrial and municipal water use. However, due to overextraction, the groundwater table is declining dramatically, in some areas by up to 2 metres per year. A major reason for this is
rapid industrialization and urbanization, poor planning, and the lack of a tariff that signals the growing scarcity of water. In an
ideal world, the value of groundwater could be estimated using optimal control methods, and that shadow price can be used
to inform a redesign of the tariff structure or new investments/policies. However, for many of the reasons described above
this is not feasible.
In an analysis commissioned by the 2030 Water Resources Group, Gulland et al. (2020) employed the replacement cost
method to assess the cost of declining groundwater. To do so, they examined the textile industry, an industry that is both
economically critical for the country and also very water-intensive. They estimated the increased costs to the industry of
switching to two alternative water sources – surface water and rainwater harvesting – as well as the cost of reducing water
demand by improving water efficiency. The results show that, depending on the availability of surface water as a viable
substitute for groundwater, the total value of groundwater availability is between 5 and 46% of the textile industry’s net profit,
annually. This equates to BDT108–964 million (US$1.2–11.3 million) per year, for the use of 17 million m3 of water per year.
This information can then be used to inform the shadow price of water, and help the city of Dhaka make better decisions on
its water use strategy.

10.4
Financial
viability of water
infrastructure
investments

The above discussion surrounds the economic viability of a water sector investment;
however, water sector services such as water supply, sanitation, irrigation, flood protection
and water treatment have financial costs that must be paid for. When evaluating whether to
make a water sector investment, one must take into consideration whether and how it will be
funded. This is a critical component to the valuation analysis, as a project which does not have
a means for funding will eventually see a service disruption when operations and maintenance
are unfunded and capital costs cannot be repaid (UNICEF/WHO, 2021). Similarly, the dynamics
of the funding type will impact the net benefits of the investment itself, and who receives them,
as will be discussed in this section. This is particularly a challenge when it comes to water
supply, sanitation and irrigation services, as these services offer private goods (as opposed
to flood protection or wastewater treatment, which are largely public goods). This section
therefore focuses on the water supply and sanitation subsectors.
For investments in water supply, sanitation or irrigation services, designing an appropriate
water tariff structure is a challenge as there are multiple, often competing, policy goals
that need to be taken into consideration. Water is simultaneously a basic human right, a
vital economic input and a renewable (but depletable) resource, and it requires significant
investments to get it from source to tap. Valuing water resources and services as a whole, and
maximizing the benefits of these services requires prudent management of often competing
goals of environmental sustainability, fairness and equity, cost recovery, and economic
efficiency. These services must be supplied while taking care to ensure affordability for the
poor, expansion to the widest number of individuals, and funding to ensure reliability and
network improvements. The water tariff (i.e. price) must be carefully designed to accomplish
as many of these goals as possible. In addition, there are other issues to be considered in the
design of tariffs, including climate change, public acceptability, simplicity and transparency
(Box 10.3).
A tariff structure that appropriately considers all of these different goals is unlikely to be
found. For instance, increasing access to water services may involve lowering water tariffs.
However, this would encourage profligacy, unsustainable withdrawals and inefficient use of
water. It will also leave water services underfunded, reducing their quality and limiting their
expansion. On the other hand, while higher prices may reduce waste and increase efficiency,
they restrict access to the wealthy. In some cases, even a single objective may require
multiple policy interventions. Experience suggests that motivating farmers to change irrigation
practices requires more than just price incentives. Higher prices may need to be combined
with other interventions such as extension services, water rights allocations, education and
improved access to markets (Frija et al., 2012; Levidow et al., 2014).

Box 10.3 Innovative mechanisms to ensure affordability of water tariffs in France
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2020) found in a study that water expenditures in
the lowest household income decile in France was on average 1.17% between 2011 and 2015. Since helping those who
are unable to pay is preferable over lowering tariffs for all (WWAP, 2015), local private water operators have innovated
the following mechanisms to ensure access and affordability, and better deliver against the Human Rights to Water and
Sanitation:
• In 1995, public and private bodies have together co-created the ‘Multi-Services Points of Information’ (PIMMS), involving
the State of France and several cities (Assemblée nationale, 2016). By 2020, 67 PIMMS were in operation throughout the
territory, with an estimated one million people assisted, including on water and sanitation aspects.1
• In 2000, the Federation of Private Water Operators (FP2E) spearheaded an idea to erase unpaid bills for households in
difficult financial situations, within the framework of the Housing Solidarity Fund (FSL) (République française, 2015, Article
L115-3). This measure currently covers 75% of the French territory (Da Costa et al., 2015).
• In 2010, ‘water vouchers’ were created by French private operators to alleviate the pressure on the least favoured
households, benefiting 20,000 households per year (BIPE-BDO/FP2E, 2019).
• Finally, social tariffs were tested in several cities, involving FP2E members. Based on the positive returns (Comité national
de l’eau, 2019), France adopted in 2019 a law allowing their introduction throughout the country (République française,
2019).

Although pricing can be an effective tool to reduce profligacy, the prevailing price of water
in most locations is far too low to discourage overuse. Several recent studies from the USA
have used statistical approaches to demonstrate how water markets and pricing can increase
water use efficiency and lead to significant economic gains (Debaere and Li, 2020; Hagerty,
2019). Broader literature exists on the responsiveness of demand for municipal water to its
price (see for reviews Arbués et al., 2003; Dalhuisen et al., 2003; Espey et al., 1997; Nauges
and Whittington, 2010; Worthington and Hoffman, 2008). The overall finding is that demand
for piped water is price-inelastic (i.e. it does not respond significantly to changes in price),
and that usage increases slightly with income. This has important implications for demand
management and suggests that a significant increase in effective prices will be needed if users
are to be induced to consume less water. As noted above, if water is overused and becomes
scarce, its shadow price will be high, reducing the net benefits of network expansions.
The increasing block tariff (IBT) is widely believed to be the solution to balance access/
affordability with the need for funding and sustainability, particularly in the case of domestic
and industrial systems. With an IBT, the tariff rate starts low and increases with use, so that
the 1st cubic metre of water is cheaper than the 100th. The popularity of IBTs is based on the
assumption that the poor consume less water than the rich. Accordingly, by reducing prices for
the lower brackets of consumption, the service is rendered more affordable for the poor. Thus,
those consuming larger amounts of water implicitly subsidize water use for those consuming
lesser amounts of water. In addition, profligacy can be disincentivized if the higher volumetric
blocks are costly enough to limit overuse of water.
IBTs have become by far the most popular form of water tariff in the world. While there is
no complete database available to determine the kinds of tariff structures in use globally,
several comprehensive sources can be used as sources of information: the International

Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNet) Tariff database49 and a survey
of utilities conducted by Global Water Intelligence (GWI).50 Together, these sources indicate
that about half of global utilities covered in these databases use IBTs (Figure 10.2). They are
especially popular in Latin America (70% of the utilities), the Middle East and North Africa
(74%), and East Asia and the Pacific (78%). The uniform volumetric tariff is the next most
common water tariff, and used in many developed countries (44%). It is the dominant practice
in Europe and Central Asia (85%) (IBNet Tariffs database, 2018). A contrasting variant of the
IBT is a decreasing block tariff (DBT), where higher volumes consumed are charged at lower
rates. This system is used by about 7% of utilities in parts of North America, Western Europe
and Africa. Such a tariff structure neither generates incentives to save water, nor does it appear
to meet any presumed equity goals.

Despite their popularity and perceived benefits, IBTs are no panacea for managing and
valuing water. Previous studies have found that IBTs are not effective tariff designs if the
stated goal is to subsidize low-income households or limit overuse (Foster et al., 2000; Walker
et al., 2000; Banerjee et al., 2010; Angel-Urdinola and Wodon, 2012; Barde and Lehmann, 2014;
Whittington et al., 2015). Indeed, the outcomes of the use of IBTs have been found to be rather
disappointing. To explain this, at least five factors have been identified in the literature:
1. Errors of exclusion: IBTs determine the water bills for those connected to the piped
network. But especially in low-income countries, the poorest households do not have water
connections. Thus, they are not eligible to receive the ‘lifeline’ (i.e. cheapest) rate of water,
and they miss out on the subsidies implicit in IBTs.

50

The annual tariff survey conducted by Global Water Intelligence does not contain a representative sample of utilities
across the globe, in particular regions or in particular countries. The IBNet database is not representative either, but it
is larger and more focused on developing countries.

140

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

2. Shared connections: Poorer households tend to share connections, as they may have
multiple families living in one residence, or may have a communal tap. Thus, the IBT has a
perverse effect – the more households share the primary customer’s connection, the more
water is billed through the primary connection, and the more water is sold at the prices in
the higher blocks of the IBT. As a result, the poorer may end up paying higher tariff rates.
3. Low income elasticity of demand for water: The IBT is based on the assumption that the
correlation between household water use and income is high, so that poor households who
use little water fall into the lower blocks, and rich households that use more water fall into
the upper blocks. However, it turns out that the correlation between water use and income
is low. As a consequence, any subsidies delivered through the lower blocks are poorly
targeted.
4. Low average costs: Around the world, and especially in developing countries, the volumetric
prices of all the blocks in the IBT are quite low, and below total average cost of delivery.
Using an IBT that prices all water below total average cost means that customers do not
receive an economic signal about the scarcity value51 of the raw water resource, or about
the marginal costs imposed on the utility by increased water use (see Box 10.4).
5. Customers respond to average, not marginal prices: In order for an IBT to achieve the
objective of reducing water use, customers must respond to marginal, not average, prices.
This is because the marginal price (i.e. the price of the next unit of water consumed) is what
is targeted by the IBT. There is little empirical evidence to suggest that households respond
to marginal prices. It seems more plausible that households respond to average prices (i.e.
the total bill) because many IBT tariff structures are complex and hard to understand, and
because tariffs in most low- and middle-income countries are so low.

10.5
Subsidizing water,
sanitation and
hygiene (WASH)
services

Subsidies in the WASH sector are pervasive across the world, in nearly all regions, income
groups and settings. A recent World Bank study found that only 35% of utilities can cover
operation and maintenance costs through revenues generated by tariffs, and only 14% can
cover all economic costs related to service provision (Andres et al., 2019). Even fewer of these
utilities can cover the original capital costs, which is often on par or higher than operation and
maintenance costs (for instance, capital costs amount to an average of 49% of total costs
for water utilities in the United Kingdom (Kingdom et al., 2018)). The remainder of expenses
are either covered by subsidies, which can be explicit (such as direct cash transfers to water
utilities), implicit (through discounted inputs such as energy needed for pumping and water
purification), or ‘resolved’ by deferring maintenance, and allowing services to crumble.
Large subsidies for WASH service provision are justifiable from an economic as well as a social
and moral standpoint; however, they are often poorly targeted, resulting in poor outcomes. As
discussed above, water is a merit good and a declared human right. Thus, it is vital that access
is ensured for all, and subsidies are an important means for achieving this goal. Nevertheless,
as found by Andres et al. (2019), upwards of 56% of subsidies in the WASH sector benefit
the wealthiest quintile of the population, while a paltry 6% go to the poorest quintile. This is
largely driven by two factors. First, subsidies tend to focus on networked services, whereas
poorer neighbourhoods are typically not serviced by piped networks. Second, there are many
households that have the potential to connect to networks, but that do not because they cannot
afford the connection costs or the volumetric charges. Thus, the subsidy recipient pool is
dominated by wealthier households, which capture the bulk of the subsidies.

Scarcity value is an economic factor describing the increase in an item’s relative price by an artificially low supply.

Box 10.4 Day Zero events and scarcity signalling in South Africa
The struggle of Cape Town with the approach of ‘Day Zero’ during 2017 and 2018, the day
when the city’s water supplies were estimated to run out, illustrates the importance of
consumption efficiency. As Day Zero approached, Cape Town’s water utility was saddled with
a complex Increasing Block Tariff (IBT), which failed to send customers a clear price signal
that Day Zero was approaching and that everyone needed to conserve water. Even when the
forecasts indicated that Day Zero was just a few months away, most customers in Cape Town
were still receiving price signals that water was cheap and plentiful, and the average tariff was
far below the cost of incremental water supplies (Booysen et al., 2019).
The lessons learned are not only applicable to Cape Town. Anywhere in the world, as the
demand for water rises with urbanization and affluence, the cost of water provision rises
with the exhaustion of cheaper options. Price signals that fail to convey the scarcity value
of water artificially inflate the demand for water and create path dependence that increases
vulnerability to drought.

Large, untargeted
WASH subsidies
can be
counterproductive,
reducing the
benefits of water
services, and thus
the valuations of
WASH investments

Large, untargeted WASH subsidies can be counterproductive, reducing the benefits of water
services, and thus the valuations of WASH investments. Indeed, in countries where piped
water is deemed to be very low-cost or free, the poor are often unserved or underserved, and
are compelled to pay a much higher price for their water than the rich (World Bank, 2016a).
This is because large subsidies leave the utilities beholden to the provider of those subsidies
– often local or national governments – rather than the customers themselves. Water
connections tend to go hand-in-hand with political connections, leaving the poor dependent on
informal means like water tankers, which can be significantly more expensive than water from
the formal, piped system. In addition, when funding relies on subsidies, then future funding
may be uncertain if government budgets tighten or priorities shift, thus adding uncertainty to
economic valuations.
Resolving these unintended outcomes would require a change in how investments are
funded. Subsidies, rather than reductions of per unit costs, should fund investments in
lower-income communities, and make it more affordable for poorer households to connect
to networks. In addition, rather than an IBT that provides subsidies based on water use,
households in need of subsidies can be targeted through administrative selection, such as
means-testing, or observable factors like household location. This will better ensure that the
subsidy reaches the poor, and that the utility is beholden to its customers.

10.6
Conclusions

142

In sum, the needs for investments in the water sector are numerous, whereas public funds
are scarce. Maximizing the value of water in investment decisions requires careful valuation
of the costs and benefits that a project provides. For this, all benefits need to be taken into
account, including those that are economic, social or environmental. Many of the unintended
consequences of these investments, both negative and positive, must also be considered.
Only then can we prioritize projects that will bring the most benefits to the most people.

11.1
Introduction

‘Water data’ are the physical, environmental, ecological, social, economic, cultural and political
parameters of water use, availability and accessibility (Laituri and Sternlieb, 2014). ‘Data’
are “facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis”, whereas ‘information’
is a broader concept and includes “facts provided or learned about something or someone
and/or what is conveyed or represented by a particular arrangement or sequence of things”
(Oxford English Dictionary). Data are always discrete and computable, whereas information
can be much broader and include quantified, qualitative or unmeasured knowledge. Data are
not usually useful as information until assessed or presented in a context. Often, the same
data can be used to present different knowledge, like there are variations in how statistics
can be interpreted. This is apparent in a number of places in this World Water Development
Report where different stakeholders use the same data to portray different information or
interpretations of value, place the same data in different contexts, and/or apply different
assumptions and methods to interpret them. In addition, a key factor in valuations is that
some stakeholders can deliberately exclude data in order to strengthen their case. This implies
that whilst data as such are important, the way in which they are used to create messages is
equally influential.
There are some belief systems that value water without data, or indeed knowledge, such as
those based on faith, religion or cultural beliefs. Homeopathy, for example, is based on the
scientifically unfounded belief that ‘water has memory’ (Baran et al., 2014). Yet, as interpreted
by millions of ‘believers’, these beliefs can ultimately influence value judgements, regardless of
the full spectrum of scientifically accepted data and knowledge. For example, Chapter 2 points
out that some cultural or faith-based concepts of value can override any valuations based on
science and data.
The World Water Development Report Series has consistently highlighted the shortcomings
in data and information availability to underpin the sustainable management of water. This
Chapter explores this issue with regards to data and information as enabling conditions for
supporting and promoting valuing water broadly, consistent with the Bellagio principles (see
Chapter 1). The focus is on requirements for improving data and knowledge regarding the
valuation of the multiple benefits of water. However, as pointed out in all previous chapters,
current methodologies for valuation, where they exist, as well as different value and belief
systems, result in a wide variety of values and opinions on their relative importance.

11.2
Knowledge
building and
sharing

11.2.1 Valuing data, access and use
As a core component of knowledge building and sharing, water-related data and information
are central to understanding and valuing the resource, including with regards to human and
environmental needs, to inform decision-making. Many aspects of water resources cannot be
valued or managed unless some data and information are available concerning its location,
quantity and quality, and how these vary over time (Stewart, 2015). But data and information
on these hydrological aspects of water do not, by themselves, inform values that relate to the
benefits that water delivers. Therefore, data and information relating to social, economic and
environmental demands and uses for water are needed to complete the picture for potential
value generation from water. Hydrology is driven by climate and weather, which can be difficult
to accurately predict. While data from hydrological networks collected over many decades
offer insights into the dynamics of the water cycle (Tetzlaff et al., 2017), serving as the basis
for hydrological modelling and several other purposes (Box 11.1), lack of data and information
remains a challenge for water resources management (Alida et al., 2018). In addition, the rise
of climate change means that previous hydrological records no longer accurately predict future
conditions.
The need for, and the value of, hydrological data are likely to further expand in the future due to
the global changes related to a growing population, processes of urbanization and economic
developments. While those changes will increase the demand for and competition over water,

Box 11.1 Use and value of hydrological data
Hydrological data have been widely used to support water management to meet societal needs. Examples of applications
include: i) multipurpose water management systems planning, design, operation and maintenance; ii) the preparation and
distribution of flood forecasts and warnings aimed at protecting lives and property; iii) the design of spillways, highways,
bridges and culverts; iv) floodplain mapping; v) determining and monitoring environmental or ecological flows; vi) managing
water rights and transboundary water issues; vii) education and research; and viii) protecting water quality and regulating
pollutant discharges (Stewart, 2015; Hester et al., 2006). A literature review of economic studies assessing the returns
on investment from hydrological monitoring programmes found that a dollar of investment in public water data systems
generates at the median four dollars in social benefits (Gardner et al., 2017), which highlights the socio-economic and
management value of hydrological data.

climate change will make the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources more variable
and increasingly difficult to predict, threatening the reliability of water supply (IPCC, 2018).
To address these challenges, improved, adaptive water management is needed. This in turn
requires hydrological data with a higher density (more parameters measured at higher spatial
and temporal resolution), better continuity over longer periods, and improved availability
(i.e. discoverability, access machine readability), to account for the changing hydrological
conditions and their impacts on biophysical, social, economic and environmental conditions
(Cho et al., 2017).
Despite their great societal value, hydrological data, including for groundwater, are still
deficient across the globe. Although the increasing competition for water and the projected
impacts of climate change further broaden the need for and value of hydrological data, the
levels of publicly reported data are well below established benchmarks for station coverage.
The reported data in three of the most widely available and globally comprehensive public
water datasets show a growing gap, with particularly the developing countries of Africa, Asia
and South America lagging behind (Cho et al., 2017) (Table 11.1). There has also been an
overall decline in in-situ monitoring systems across the world, including a diminishing number
of precipitation gauges (Stokstad, 1999; Sun et al., 2018), water quality monitoring systems

(Zhulidov et al., 2000) and river discharge sensors (Fekete et al., 2012). Finally, despite
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 6.5, promoting transboundary cooperation for
integrated water resources management, there is no single global hydrological monitoring
system, but rather a proliferation of networks designed and operated by their respective
owners for specific uses and at different spatial scales, covering different parameters and data
types (Cho et al., 2017).

The situation is even worse when it comes to water-related socio-economic and environmental
data. These are critical to revealing the different values of water and to driving or influencing
decision-making regarding planning, policy and management. Data related to societal use of
and demands for water, including in relation to environmental water needs and constraints
and their relative values, remain scattered, fragmented or simply unavailable. For example,
gender-disaggregated data on topics such as access to water supply, sanitation and hygiene
(WASH) or water resources management tend to be lacking and where they do exist they
are very limited or not reported due to the methodologies and high aggregation levels used
(Chapter 4). Gender- and age-disaggregated data on participation in water management and
decision-making are also deficient. The result is that gender-sensitive analysis is hardly ever
done in real time despite its critical importance to policy formulation. The Toolkit on SexDisaggregated Water Data developed by the UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme
(WWAP) taskforce on gender,52 and the inventory of available policies and tools developed in
the frame of the International Waters Learning Exchange and Resource Network (IW:LEARN)53
can provide valuable assistance here. Women tend to have different preferences to men when
it comes to solutions, and are more prone to take issues like environmental considerations into
account (OECD, 2014).
There is also a need to standardize the compiling, storing and disseminating of data and
information relating to the economic values of water under its diversity of uses. Especially
social, cultural and other intrinsic values are hardly standardized. Further efforts and
investments are needed to sustain the supply chain of data from its collection, analysis,
sharing and application in support of the management needs across sectors and scales.

11.2.2 Knowledge and data sharing tools
With the modern advancements in earth observation as well as information and
communication technology (ICT), both the sources and tools for collecting and sharing
water data have been expanding. Water-related data and information are derived from seven
main sources (Table 11.2). These include measurements through monitoring networks
specially operated by governments directly, model estimation, and administrative collection
(e.g. regulation data such as permits or census data) (Bureau of Meteorology, 2017).
Water-related data and information can also be generated by other sources such as earth
observations, sensor networks and citizen data, including on social media. The development
of earth observation has progressed to include a plethora of sensing opportunities afforded
by CubeSats, uncrewed aerial vehicles and smartphone technologies, enabling new means
of measurement, such as real-time high-definition videos of storm cell development, flood
propagation and precipitation monitoring, among others (McCabe et al., 2017). These
expanded data sources complement each other, increase the knowledge base for management
decision-making (e.g. Hadj-Hammou et al., 2017), and improve data and information for
understanding the values of water (Table 11.2).

These rich sets of data streams need to be converted into value-related information
products and tools that inform policy and management. Important aspects herein include:
i) coordination and communication between data providers and users to help ensure that
the data and tools created are useful and to avoid mismatches between data needs and
availability; ii) strategies or methods to unlock private data and to stimulate data sharing
among stakeholders; and iii) common standards to allow data aggregation and integration
(Grossman et al., 2015). Functioning water observation networks producing fit-for-purpose
data and information, and their sharing with all stakeholders, are essential for minimizing
uncertainties and informing water resources management (WMO, 2009).
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has compiled a database listing tools, processes and
methods that have emerged over the past 15 years related to water and environmental risks,
impacts and values (WWF, 2019b). The database allows for comparisons between the various
approaches to valuing water in a broad sense that have been adopted in practice by different
stakeholders, or that target different audiences and management needs with varying outputs
and levels of accessibility.
Some standards and protocols, such as the International Water Stewardship Standard (Alliance
for Water Stewardship, 2019) and the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol (HSAC,
2018), are increasingly incorporating criteria and assessments of stakeholder involvement and
social inclusion, including indigenous peoples’ rights and women’s participation, as well as
ecosystem protection.

11.3
Local and
indigenous
knowledge

To promote inclusive and transformative change in valuing water, it is strategically important
to recognize the unique role of local and indigenous knowledge (LIK), in addition to the
mainstream or traditional scientific or academic knowledge. LIK refers to the understandings,
skills and philosophies developed by societies over long histories of interaction with their
natural surroundings that inform decision-making about fundamental aspects of day-to-day
life (UNESCO, n.d.). It provides sociocultural information necessary for community survival and
for flourishing within local environmental, geographical and cultural contexts, while facilitating
communication and decision-making within a community (Tharakan, 2015). Until recently,
water resources management and policy have not appropriately included LIK that reflects
and carries the local values of water, despite its relevance to sustainability (e.g. Escott et al.,
2015). Connecting LIK and mainstream science can allow for the creation of new spaces for
collaborative approaches to value and manage water resources (Box 11.2). Scientific studies

Box 11.2 The Great Canoe Journey
Indigenous knowledge can raise awareness of the perspectives on values that people
prescribe to water. The Great Canoe Journey, a learning tool developed by the Canadian
organization Waterlution, is an example of such a project. The programme combines cultural
and water education and is targeted at Canadian students aged 7–18. Educational activities
include local indigenous canoe builders who teach students about the traditional boats and
the local waters, alongside indigenous and non-indigenous youth advisors who specialize in
other areas related to the local environment, drawing from scientific research. The programme
utilizes local knowledge to sensitize students to their local cultures, waterways and other
natural resources. It also challenges students to reflect on their own relation to water, based
on the different indigenous and non-indigenous perspectives and value systems presented
to them. Between 2018 and 2020, the Great Canoe Journey events reached more than 4,200
youth in Canada.

have identified, shown or justified the unique value of LIK in various water-related
contexts and applications including, for example, climate change adaptation (Makondo
and Thomas, 2018; Son et al., 2019), coastal resilience enhancement (Chowdhooree,
2019), water and river management (Parsons et al., 2019; Borthakur and Singh, 2020),
environmental management (Boiral et al., 2020), and disaster risk reduction (Cuaton
and Su, 2020). Examples or practices of LIK regarding water management prevail
across cultures and regions in the world (UNESCO, n.d.), and provide inspirational
and locally adapted solutions, illustrating how water is valued and can be effectively
managed at the local level (Box 11.3).

Box 11.3 Local and Indigenous Knowledge (LIK) in managing water scarcity with value
generation
The small streams, called oueds, in the vicinity of Tiznit, Morocco, flow rarely and erratically.
Local communities created long underground tunnels called foggara or khettara to exploit
groundwater in a sustainable way, recognizing its important future and scarcity values.
After the infrequent rains, the oueds can also be exploited by barriers that are maintained by
users, which allows for water storage for irrigation when required. The ‘water master’ (abbar)
distributes water according to pre-established value-based rules so that each user knows
exactly when and for how long they are entitled to water their crops. Hence, LIK is included and
applied in value-based thinking to smartly manage water.

11.4
Transdisciplinary
and participatory
research

Estimates of water-related values are often incomplete, approximate and conflicting
(Garrick et al., 2017). Some can be addressed through transdisciplinary and participatory
research, which can help identify, understand and incorporate the diverse values of
water by engaging multiple disciplines and stakeholders to identify effective, acceptable
solutions to common problems.
Part of the solution is to expand citizen science. Citizen science often pre-dates formal
science – citizens have been involved with collecting meteorological data for centuries
(Buytaert, et al., 2014). Local communities, including women, youth and indigenous people
organizations, are usually well informed about local conditions and practices and have a
vested interest in contributing to improved management (Box 11.4). One of the constraints
to expanding citizen science can be resistance from formally trained academics. In order
to improve uptake of citizen science, ten principles for its use have been developed by
the European Citizen Science Association (ECSA, 2015) (Box 11.5). Although access
to internet has been a constraint to using mobile apps, particularly in least developed
countries, the digital divide continues to narrow (UNESCO, 2017). In areas where ICT
approaches to disseminating knowledge are lacking, radio, printed information and
storytelling can be important means to transfer knowledge.
The involvement of representative local stakeholders in ground-truthing data and
information is important. However, for example, women are often not invited or able to go
to meetings where information is collected or disseminated.

Knowledge, research and capacity development as enabling conditions

149

Citizen science not only facilitates data and knowledge generation but also inclusive,
participatory decision-making, local leadership, awareness-raising and capacity
development (Liebenberg et al., 2017; McKinley et al., 2017). It can, therefore, create
better-informed policy through a bottom-up inclusive approach to understanding and
valuing water, while building a foundation for a more sustainable community in the long
term (Hugh, 2019).

11.5
Capacity
development

Capacity development is the process through which individuals, organizations and
societies obtain, strengthen and maintain the capabilities to set and achieve their
own development objectives over time. Within the context of valuing water, capacity
development concerns the establishment of know-how to inclusively and properly value
water and to effectively manage it on the basis of those values, applied at different levels
and under diverse conditions leading to variable outcomes. As a key enabling condition,
capacity development seeks to establish a strong knowledge base, awareness of its
necessity, understanding of valuing water, and the ability to utilize, apply and improve
this knowledge (Wehn de Montalvo and Alaerts, 2013). Particular attention is required to:
• increase the collection and coverage of water data, particularly socio-economic data,
from all traditional and non-traditional sources, in multiple metrics reflecting diverse
values;
• develop and strengthen effective mechanisms to integrate water data and to use them
to inform policy and management;
• enhance knowledge and data sharing mechanisms, within and beyond the water
sector, to broaden participation in the knowledge production process, facilitating
closer stakeholder collaboration and creating mutual trust in contested situations, and
to stimulate and support innovation; and
• recognize and include local and indigenous knowledge in scientific research, including
in setting the research agenda and in policy and management decision-making, so as
to integrate a deeper understanding of local values, human–water interactions and
locally adapted/proven solutions, as well as to increase equity.

the increasing
complexity and

in the water sector

150

With the achievement of the Bellagio principles on valuing water as the overall goal,
specific goals can be established for capacity development in the short, intermediate
and long terms (Table 11.3). Immediate goals centre on the metrics and methodologies
for measuring and analysing water values, including coverage and quality of water
data. The intermediate- to long-term goals centre more on institutions and the enabling
environment at the societal level, including water literacy regarding social norms and the
cultural aspects of valuing water.
Innovation in education is much needed to keep pace with the increasing complexity
and new developments in the water sector. There are gaps in professional education
programmes related to water. Yet, there is limited, if any, educational and training
support to meet the societal needs, which are very significant considering that climate
change elevates water resilience, risk and security as goals. There is a need for more
investment to support these, and other, needs and to develop more integrated education
programmes between the various water-related disciplines.

Conclusions

12.1
What is the
value of water…
to whom?

Water is a unique and non-substitutable resource. As the foundation of life, societies and
economies, it carries multiple values and benefits. But unlike most other natural resources,
it has proven extremely difficult to determine its ‘true’ value. As such, the overall importance
of this vital resource has not been appropriately reflected in political attention and financial
investment in many parts of the world. This not only leads to inequalities in access to
water resources and water-related services, but also to inefficient and unsustainable use
and degradation of water supplies themselves, affecting the fulfilment of nearly all the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as basic human rights.
Approaches to valuing water vary widely across – and even within – different user dimensions
and perspectives. Whereas criteria for valuing water resources and the environment
(Chapter 2) focus mainly on quantifying the economic impacts and benefits of water provision,
purification and other ecosystem services, valuing water infrastructure (Chapters 3 and 10)
lends itself more to a cost–benefit type of analysis. Valuing water supply and sanitation
(Chapter 4) is closely related to the benefits these services bring to people and communities,
including improved health and living conditions. The value of water for agriculture (Chapter 5),
industry and energy (Chapter 6) is easiest assessed though an input–output economic
perspective, which can include quantifying economic returns and other benefits, such as
employment, as value delivered per unit of water. Finally, the often intangible nature of
some sociocultural values attributed to water (Chapter 7) regularly defies any attempt at
quantification but, nevertheless, can be regarded amongst the highest values.
These are, of course, oversimplifications. The reality, as described throughout this report,
is much more complicated. For example, attempts to value water are likely to suffer from
some level of bias, even where unintentional, on the part of those directly involved in
valuation processes, as the perception of the values attributed to water and its related
benefits can be highly subjective. The fundamental question about value is, then, value to
whom? Valuations often tend to target specific beneficiaries, while other stakeholders may
benefit less or even be negatively impacted.

12.2
Recognizing
and overcoming
complexities

Consolidating the different approaches and methods for valuing water across multiple
dimensions and perspectives will likely remain challenging. As exemplified in Box 1.3,
even within a specific water use sector (in this case agriculture), different approaches can
lead to strikingly different valuations. Trying to reconcile valuations across sectors would
normally increase the overall level of difficulty, as would taking account of some of the more
intangible values attributed to water in different sociocultural contexts. While there may be
scope to reduce complexities and standardize metrics in some circumstances, the reality is
the need for better means to recognize, maintain and accommodate different values.
Currently, although tools and methodologies exist for valuing water, even if imperfect, they
are often poorly utilized. Economics is perhaps the discipline that logically has the greatest
utility in valuations and its application has improved in some approaches, notably for the
environment (Chapter 2). To be more effective, economics must have the broadest of scopes,
not be limited to monetary-based valuations or market-based approaches, and include
analyses of all costs and benefits in play, including those that are hidden or invisible. Even so,
it must be recognized that there are values that can override those based on economics.
Yet as complex as valuing water may be, it remains an absolutely necessary step in
addressing water-related challenges worldwide. Otherwise, water will remain poorly
accounted for and, thus, routes to its better management harder to identify. Making all the
different values of water more explicit gives recognition and a voice to dimensions that are
otherwise easily overlooked, poorly understood or ill-defined, which can lead to inequitable
sharing of benefits, inadequate reconciliation of negative impacts and costs, unsustainable
solutions, unintended consequences, risks, and weakly performing policies and institutions.

154

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021 VALUING WATER

One critical step lies in a better understanding of the concept of ‘value’ itself. As described
throughout this report, ‘price’, ‘cost’ and ‘value’ are by no means synonymous. Whereas the
first two are easily quantifiable from a primarily economic monetary-based perspective, the
notion of ‘value’ encompasses a much broader set of often intangible benefits. While monetary
valuation is arguably easier than most other approaches, and has the important advantage of
using a common metric whereby values of different uses can be quantitatively compared, it
can lead to the undervaluation or exclusion of benefits that are more difficult to monetize.
Another issue involves recognizing the shortcomings of current approaches to valuation in
order to improve their application and performance. For example, as alluded to in Chapters 3, 4
and 10, capital costs are often not considered when valuing water infrastructure, which in turn
leads to a skewed analysis. Consideration of the impacts of subsidies, whether directly related
to water infrastructure or major water use sectors like agriculture and industry, is generally
lacking in most water valuation schemes. Including the costs of capital or subsidies can
change the benefit–cost analysis from positive to negative. Although subsidies, including for
capital, may be justified in some circumstances, if not transparent they lead to illusory values.

Approaches to
valuing water
vary widely
across – and even
within – different
user dimensions
and perspectives

The importance of knowledge (Chapter 11) is also critical. There is a need across the board
to improve data and information, and to incorporate them better into decision-making.
However, better data will not necessarily lead to better management outcomes. Many policy,
management and investment decisions regarding water deliberately ignore relevant data and
information. No improvement in the data will be able to correct such decisions. Examples
include decisions driven by vested interests or corruption (see Chapters 3 and 9). Therefore,
issues go well beyond the extent, relevance and reliability of the data and information. Equally
important are the ways in which data and information are used.
The idea that ‘valuing water’ would necessarily translate into local water savings needs to
be reconsidered. Chapters 5 and 6 clearly point to the fact that, in some cases, improving
water productivity and use efficiency can not only fail to reduce demand, it can also lead to
conflicting trade-offs, notably with respect to poverty alleviation. This is not to say that efforts
to reduce water use should not be pursued vigorously across all sectors, but rather that the
full range of potential socio-economic impacts need to be taken into consideration. Valuing
water also has an important role in identifying the value of investments in its management;
for example, the incremental value of improved water use efficiency in agriculture is delivered,
not necessarily through higher-value crops, but by making more water available for other
higher- value uses. This begs the important question of how incentives are transferred from
higher- to lower-value uses. For example, most would consider food security to be a priority,
but food itself is a low value use of water. So how can the promotion of higher-value uses for
industrial, domestic or environmental purposes provide the incentives for improved crop water
productivity?
Intangible values are not limited to ‘water for peace’ or to the various sociocultural perceptions
and realities described in Chapter 7. For example, the value of water for food security is
arguably incalculable, yet water is often undervalued (or even shown to have a negative value)
in agriculture (Chapter 1). This illustrates a certain disconnect between water and other
sectoral policies where the value of water remains hidden or ignored. Similarly, while water
is essential for electricity production, its value usually remains hidden until generation is
undermined by water scarcity.
A significant gap is where valuations fail to factor in the potential costs associated with
risks and uncertainties, or the benefits of reducing them. Extreme water-related events, the
catastrophic failure of water supply systems or sudden changes in price assumptions made,
among other sources of risk and uncertainty, can drastically affect valuations. In a world of
increasing risks and uncertainties due to climate change, this is a surprising omission.

12.3
Addressing
conflicting views

The risks of
undervaluing
water are far too
great to ignore

Addressing conflicting views and managing potential trade-offs remains one of the
greatest challenges to water management. Various water use sectors, from water
supply, sanitation and hygiene, to agriculture, energy, industry and the environment,
stand to benefit over the longer term from an improved integration of the values
of water across the full development cycle, from planning through to improved
efficiencies, adaptive management and monitoring. But in the near term, there will
be trade-offs and a need for adjustments, through a set of controls and incentives
for certain sectors to use water more efficiently in particular instances. The initial
phases of water resources planning and infrastructure design present considerable,
but underused opportunities for introducing various aspects of water’s value.
Once identified through stakeholder processes of engagement and empowerment,
acknowledging the various aspects of water’s value can help ensure their equitable
treatment in subsequent stages of water management. Similar opportunities to further
address trade-offs exist in later stages of decision-making. In the short term, not
all sectors will benefit every time, and some sectors, if not all, will need to adapt in
response to the different values of water.
As described in Chapter 9, stakeholder engagement and empowerment by means of
multi-stakeholder platforms, dialogues, and vision and objective-setting processes
tailored to water development all provide entry points for ensuring full consideration of
the multiple values of water. Institutionalizing ethics into all water decisions and water
behaviours could contribute a complementary set of behavioural guidance to that of
the laws, policies and regulations concerning water. Political will to consider all value
sets for water, and to then act on that basis, is critical, necessitating the transformation
of political processes and a redistribution of power and voice, through the building of
public awareness and pressure for change.
Finally, the demand for valuing water needs to be created. Water is universally
underpriced and undervalued. Very few governments, businesses or citizens are
demanding that water is valued. Moreover, where citizens perceive water as a human
right, and therefore a free or public good, valuations can be resisted.

12.4

156

Even though it is not always recognized by all, water clearly has value. In some
perspectives the value of water is infinite, since life does not exist without it and there is
no replacement for it. This is perhaps best exemplified by the efforts and investments
made in the search for extra-terrestrial water and the recent elation in finding it on the
Moon and Mars. It is a shame that all too often, it is taken for granted here on Earth.
The risks of undervaluing water are far too great to ignore.

UN-Water coordinates the efforts of United Nations entities and international organizations working on water and
sanitation issues. By doing so, UN-Water seeks to increase the effectiveness of the support provided to Member States
in their efforts towards achieving international agreements on water and sanitation. UN-Water publications draw on the
experience and expertise of UN-Water’s Members and Partners.
SDG 6 Progress Update 2021 – brief
This brief will which will provide an executive update on progress towards all of the SDG 6 (based on new data on the SDG 6
global indicators) and identify priority areas for acceleration.
SDG 6 Progress Update 2021 – 8 reports, by SDG 6 global indicator
This series of reports will provide an in-depth update and analysis of progress towards the different SDG 6 targets (based
on new data on the SDG 6 global indicators) and identify priority areas for acceleration: Progress on Drinking Water,
Sanitation and Hygiene; Progress on Wastewater Treatment; Progress on Ambient Water Quality; Progress on Wateruse Efficiency; Progress on Level of Water Stress; Progress on Integrated Water Resources Management; Progress on
Transboundary Water Cooperation; Progress on Water-related Ecosystems.
United Nations World Water Development Report
The United Nations World Water Development Report (WWDR) is UN-Water’s flagship report on water and sanitation issues,
focusing on a different theme each year. The report is published by UNESCO, on behalf of UN-Water and its production is
coordinated by the UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme. The report gives insight on main trends concerning the
state, use and management of freshwater and sanitation, based on work done by the Members and Partners of UN-Water.
Launched in conjunction with World Water Day, the report provides decision-makers with knowledge and tools to formulate
and implement sustainable water policies. It also offers best practices and in-depth analyses to stimulate ideas and actions
for better stewardship in the water sector and beyond.
UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS)
GLAAS is produced by the World Health Organization (WHO) on behalf of UN-Water. It provides a global update on the policy
frameworks, institutional arrangements, human resource base, and international and national finance streams in support of
sanitation and drinking water. It is a substantive input into the activities of Sanitation and Water for All (SWA).
The progress report of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP)
This report is affiliated with UN-Water and presents the results of the global monitoring of progress towards access to safe
and affordable drinking water, and adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene. Monitoring draws on the findings of
household surveys and censuses usually supported by national statistics bureaus in accordance with international criteria
and increasingly draws on national administrative and regulatory datasets.
Policy and Analytical Briefs
UN-Water’s Policy Briefs provide short and informative policy guidance on the most pressing freshwater-related issues that
draw upon the combined expertise of the United Nations system. Analytical Briefs provide an analysis of emerging issues
and may serve as basis for further research, discussion and future policy guidance.

WORLD WATER DAY AND THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT

The United Nations designates specific days,
weeks, years and decades as occasions to
mark particular events or topics in order to
promote, through awareness and action, the
objectives of the Organization.
International observances are occasions
to educate the general public on issues
of concern, to mobilize political will and
resources to address global problems, and to
celebrate and reinforce achievements of humanity.
The majority of observances have been established by resolutions of the United
Nations General Assembly. World Water Day (22 March) dates back to the 1992
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development where an international
observance for water was recommended. The United Nations General Assembly
responded by designating 22 March 1993 as the first World Water Day. It has
been held annually since then and is one of the most popular international days
together with International Women’s Day (8 March), the International Day of Peace
(21 September) and Human Rights Day (10 December).
Every year, UN-Water — the UN’s coordination mechanism on water and sanitation
— sets a theme for World Water Day corresponding to a current or future waterrelated challenge. This theme also defines the theme of the United Nations World
Water Development Report that is presented on World Water Day. The publication is
UN-Water’s flagship report and provides decision-makers with tools to formulate and
implement sustainable water policies. The report also gives insight on main trends
including the state, use and management of freshwater and sanitation, based on
work by the Members and Partners in UN-Water.
The report is published by UNESCO, on behalf of UN-Water, and its production is
coordinated by the UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme.

Water is a finite and non-substitutable resource. As the foundation of life, societies and economies, it
carries multiple values and benefits. But unlike most other natural resources, it has proven extremely
difficult to determine its true ‘value’.
The 2021 edition of the United Nations World Water Development Report, titled “Valuing Water”
assesses the current status of and challenges to the valuation of water across different sectors and
perspectives, and identifies ways in which valuation can be promoted as a tool to help improve its
management and achieve global sustainable development.
Methodologies and approaches to the valuation of water are described through five interrelated
perspectives: valuing water sources and the ecosystems upon which they depend; valuing water
infrastructure for water storage, use, reuse or supply augmentation; valuing water services, mainly
drinking water, sanitation and related human health aspects; valuing water as an input to production and
socio-economic activity, such as food and agriculture, energy and industry, business, and employment;
and other sociocultural values of water, including recreational, cultural and spiritual attributes. These
are complemented with experiences from different global regions, opportunities to reconcile multiple
values of water through integrated and holistic approaches to governance and financing mechanisms,
and prospects to address knowledge, research and capacity needs.
The United Nations World Water Development Report (WWDR) is UN-Water’s flagship report on water
and sanitation issues, focusing on a different theme each year. The report is published by UNESCO,
on behalf of UN-Water and its production is coordinated by the UNESCO World Water Assessment
Programme. The report gives insight on main trends concerning the state, use and management of
freshwater and sanitation, based on work done by the Members and Partners of UN-Water. Launched
in conjunction with World Water Day, the report provides decision-makers with knowledge and tools to
formulate and implement sustainable water policies. It also offers best practices and in-depth analyses
to stimulate ideas and actions for better stewardship in the water sector and beyond.
