his report reflects the enormous
achievements of the World Food
Programme in 2006, its final year under
my predecessor, James Morris. This is also
a tribute to his dedication to the service
of the hungry poor.

I am honoured and very excited by the
opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.
I am determined to continue building what
I regard as not simply the largest, but the
finest humanitarian organisation in the world
– one that knows its mission and delivers
on its promises. Nothing can stand
between WFP and the hungry.
Josette Sheeran
WFP Executive Director

Pr e f a ce by t h e F o r m e r E x ec ut i v e D i r ec t o r

For

WFP, 2006 was a year of
consolidation, with considerable
investment in addressing lessons from past crises,
including strengthening operational procedures
and mainstreaming initiatives in capacity
building. At the same time, the organisation
maintained full engagement in emerging and
ongoing crises and provided four million metric
tons of food to 88 million of the world’s hungriest
people, a slight decrease from 2005.

WFP’s ability to respond rapidly and effectively was
significantly enhanced in 2006 by establishing
additional humanitarian response depots, dedicated
structures to support emergency response, and an
increased number and diversity of partners. This
investment paid off last July when the Lebanon
conflict erupted and the entire country came under
heavy shelling and an economic blockade. A WFP
emergency team was in Lebanon within days to
open a base for a regional emergency operation
(EMOP). During the 33-day conflict, more than
1,000 people died, 4,500 were wounded and one
million displaced. WFP reached 824,000 displaced
people with food assistance and supported the
entire humanitarian community with truck
convoys, aircraft and ships, as well as security and
telecommunications services.

Headquarters in Rome. There were no appreciable
improvements in security in Darfur and obtaining
access to people displaced by conflict was a
continuous struggle – one that cost a WFP staff
member his life in early 2007.
WFP continued to face challenges in meeting
development commitments. When resources were
constrained, WFP was often unable to prevent
the deterioration of prevailing chronic food
shortages and under-nutrition. This happened in
the Sahelian countries in 2006 when child
malnutrition rates reached appalling levels and a
rapid humanitarian intervention was required.
Concurrently, WFP sustained its leadership on
hunger by strengthening analysis and
programming capacities to address broader hunger
and nutrition issues in support of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). WFP launched the
World Hunger Series, aimed at policymakers in
developing and developed countries; the series
aims to serve as a global reference on hungerrelated issues. The 2006 edition focused on
hunger and learning.

Sudan continued to be WFP’s most significant and
challenging humanitarian operation – and one of
the largest single country operations in WFP’s
history. WFP consolidated its efforts into a single
country-wide EMOP for 6.4 million people. Six
special operations (SOs) provided humanitarian
air services, road repairs, mine clearance,
telecommunications, stronger logistical support for
Darfur and an inter-agency joint logistics centre to
fix bottlenecks in the food distribution chain. The
operation accounted for more than one-fifth of
2006 direct operational expenditures, with more
WFP staff working in Sudan alone than at

fundraising, WFP continued efforts to reduce
costs; the outsourcing of some IT functions to
India is one such cost saving example.

The Ending Child Hunger and Undernutrition
Initiative (ECHUI) gathered buy-in from a range
of stakeholders. A recent analysis by FAO shows
that child mortality has fallen more quickly in
those countries that have made the greatest
progress in reducing hunger. But still there are
some 400 million malnourished children
throughout the world – one of the greatest
humanitarian challenges facing us today.

In 2006, the issue of United Nations reform
moved from discussion and debate to
implementation. In Lebanon and in the Horn of
Africa, WFP learned valuable lessons from the
new humanitarian cluster approach, with the
agency taking the lead in logistics and IT. The
Rome-based agencies ensured that food security,
hunger reduction, rural and social development
and safety nets were all focus areas and this was
endorsed by the United Nations Development
Group (UNDG).

In 2006, WFP strived to “do more, do it better,
and do it together”. WFP made significant
progress on behalf of hungry people in a number
of areas, including strengthening relationships
with non-governmental organisations (NGOs)
and regional organisations. In the past two years
alone, the number of NGO partners grew by
68 percent. WFP signed a breakthrough
agreement last year with Islamic Relief
Worldwide in order to better serve beneficiaries
who live in Muslim communities – about half of
WFP’s total beneficiaries in 2006. As a cosponsor
of UNAIDS, WFP worked with other UN
organisations, national governments and NGOs
to strengthen community, national and global
response to AIDS. Given the role of nutrition in
maintaining the health and livelihood of people
living with HIV and AIDS, WFP provided food
and nutrition support in 51 countries – through
care, treatment and mitigation interventions –
reaching over 2.3 million people.

If 2006 was a year of consolidation, it was also a
year of transition, for the United Nations system
generally, and for WFP in particular. I reluctantly
decided not to seek a further term as Executive
Director of WFP, beyond my current term ending
in April 2007. WFP staff give so much of
themselves to the many people in this world most
in need. My thoughts and best wishes go to them
and those they serve in the coming years. My
successor, Josette Sheeran, is an exceptional
person, with extensive experience, a caring heart
and a strong commitment to take WFP to the
next level and to make a huge difference in the
lives of many. I am confident that under her
stewardship WFP will continue to be the most
admired and respected humanitarian agency in
the world, having earned and deserved this
reputation.

WFP’s donor base and partnerships with the
private sector continued to increase, reaching a
record number in 2006. WFP received
contributions – cash and food – from nearly
100 donors. Contributions included over
US$214 million in funding from the UN and
World Bank through the recently created Central
Emergency Response Fund (CERF), country
common humanitarian funds, and multi-donor
trust funds (MDTF). Complementing progress in

hile there were no catastrophic events
like the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami or
the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, there were
several large natural disasters in 2006, for
example the May earthquake in Indonesia that
killed thousands of people. There were also a
significant number of smaller disasters. Fourteen
different sudden natural disasters required funds
from the Immediate Response Account (IRA).
In Latin America and the Caribbean, WFP
responded to four disasters of short duration: in
Bolivia, Ecuador, El Salvador and Nicaragua. In
Asia, WFP responded to two different natural
disasters in Nepal: in the first half of the year
assistance was provided to families affected by
drought; in the second half these same areas
required assistance as a result of flooding.

Large protracted conflicts were also a feature of
WFP’s operating landscape in 2006. Sudan,
WFP’s largest operation, accounted for
64 percent of direct emergency expenditures
and required 18 percent of WFP’s employees.
Kenya was the second largest EMOP securing 15
percent of total emergency direct expenditure.
These two EMOPs combined accounted for 78
percent of direct emergency expenditures.
Ethiopia captured over 14 percent of direct
protracted relief and recovery operation (PRRO)
expenditures.

Current evidence on climate change suggests
that such paradoxical climatic developments
may become more frequent and that global
warming will cause an increase in the number of
natural disasters over the next 50 years.
According to the Centre for Research on the
Epidemiology of Disasters, the number of
natural disasters increased from over
232 per year in 1994 to 493 in 2006.

and rapidly growing funding mechanism. WFP
benefited significantly from new pooled funding
opportunities for humanitarian programmes,
which include the CERF, country level common
humanitarian funds, and the World Bank
managed MDTF. In 2006, WFP received
contributions of approximately US$214 million
in UN and World Bank managed funds. Pooled
funds for humanitarian response and transition
programmes will likely continue to be a
significant component of the organisation’s
income in the years ahead and it will be
important that reporting and financial
management requirements for these funds are
harmonized with existing procedures.

These three countries accounted for over
34 percent of direct expenditures in 2006 and,
despite a mid-year shortfall in Sudan, were
relatively well funded overall, with 84 percent
and 97 percent of EMOP needs met in Sudan and
Kenya, respectively. Ethiopia was fully funded.
Between 1990 and 2005, global food aid
deliveries fell by nearly 40 percent. In 2006, the
overall amount of food aid delivered globally
declined compared with 2005, from 8.2 million
tons to 6.7 million tons and the gap between
emergency and development food aid continued
to widen. WFP’s share of emergency food aid
increased to almost 70 percent of the total.
Despite the challenging funding environment,
new sources of funding emerged. Multilateral
pooled funds, for example, are a relatively new

shortfalls, reaching planned beneficiaries with less
tonnage during periods with pipeline breaks. A
number of mechanisms assisted COs in coping
with pipeline irregularities. For example,
advanced funding mechanisms and common
humanitarian funds helped minimize pipeline
disruptions. Local government contributions of
food commodities played an important role in
overcoming pipeline disruptions in Kenya and
Sudan. Partnerships were strengthened and
diversified, however unpredictable resources
sometimes hindered partnerships at field level.
This was particularly problematic for HIV
activities, when drugs arrived on time but food
was either delayed or insufficient.

publicised relief operations were adequately
funded, many smaller operations suffered from
significant funding shortfalls or pipeline breaks.
If all programme categories are considered, 52 out
of 146 operations were fully funded. One-fifth of
all WFP operations experienced shortfalls of over
50 percent of planned needs. For example, the
southern Africa PRRO suffered both from
shortfalls and timing problems.
Shortfalls and pipeline disruptions were mostly
due to the timing of donations and the high
proportion of contributions directed by donors to
specific operations – 91 percent of contributions
were directed in 2006. Such a high level of
directed contributions resulted in a number of less
visible operations being under resourced. Just an
additional US$20 million in multilateral
donations would have enabled WFP to avoid
pipeline breaks in 13 smaller refugee operations.
Several factors affected the physical availability of
contributions on the ground: donations confirmed
in the last quarter of a calendar year which usually
translated into food distributions in the first
quarter of the subsequent year; and the life cycle
of operations, including the need to pre-position
commodities especially ahead of the rainy season.
Development programmes faced a particular
challenge regarding timing. At the beginning of
the year, WFP forecast the level of resources that
each programme would receive during that year.
In practical terms, this meant that when
contributions were confirmed late in the year,
pipelines and operational activities were
potentially disrupted early in the year.
Resource shortfalls and contribution timing
affected countries differently. Most country offices
(COs) strived to maintain beneficiary numbers by
cutting rations to accommodate commodity

In southern Lebanon, which bore the brunt of the
bombing and shelling, those who chose to stay or
were unable to leave – the oldest, weakest and
the poorest – also had to contend with the
disappearance of goods and services, with shops
and markets no longer functioning and electricity
and water cut off. A humanitarian crisis loomed.

On

13 July 2006, in response to a series of
Katyusha rocket attacks by Hizbollah
on northern Israel and the kidnapping of two
Israeli soldiers the previous day, Israel launched a
series of dawn air strikes on Hizbollah positions in
southern Lebanon and bombed bridges and key
intersections on roads all over the country, as well
as Beirut international airport.

FAST
Over the following days, the bombardment
continued and hundreds of thousands of civilians,
fearing for their lives, took all they could carry in
private cars, taxis, buses and trucks, and headed
north. A week after the conflict began, more than
half a million people had been forced to flee their
homes. Among them were some 95,000 displaced
people packed into schools, public buildings and
parks in Beirut, joined at night by tens of
thousands more from the city’s heavily bombed
southern suburbs. A further 140,000 people fled
across the border to Syria.

RESPONSE

The Lebanese Government and civil society
moved swiftly and generously with the resources
they had on hand to help the war-affected
displaced population. Lebanese NGOs were also
very active from the outset. However, such was
the magnitude and suddenness of the destruction,
that the Government requested external
humanitarian assistance. (The UN offered
humanitarian aid to all sides in the crisis.)
WFP geared up fast to respond to the crisis. While
the agency had no office in Lebanon, having
closed down its operation in the country in
December 1996, within a week it had an
assessment team on the ground to work out the
requirements for food, logistics and security

In northern Israel, some 30 civilians were killed
and more than 300,000 were displaced by
Hizbollah rocket attacks.

13,000 tons of food to some 824,000 Lebanese
displaced in the south, in Beirut and its southern
suburbs, the Beka’a valley and across the border
in Syria. All WFP activities in Lebanon were

Government, in particular with the High Relief
Committee and the Ministry of Social Affairs.

support and was finalising an emergency plan to
provide food aid to those hardest hit by the crisis,
as part of a US$130 million UN Flash Appeal.
Initially, WFP planned to supply some
300,000 people with food aid, valued at
US$8.9 million, with priority given to those in
greatest need, including 95,000 displaced seeking
shelter in Beirut and 165,000 people remaining
in the south.

LOGISTICAL
As many beneficiaries did not have access to
cooking facilities, high energy biscuits and
canned products were provided as ready-to-eat
food. WFP also gave flour to support bread
production through NGOs and commercial
bakeries.

AND SECURITY CHALLENGES

Under normal circumstances, moving thousands
of tons of food and other supplies around a small
country like Lebanon, with excellent roads and a
highly developed infrastructure, would present
few challenges. However, the bombing of key
installations and major roads, including the
destruction of more than 140 bridges in the first
week of the conflict, left Lebanon paralysed.
Before the bombardment, the 80-km road

In the event, by the end of the three-month
operation, WFP had delivered nearly

Frustrated by the failure of the international
community to bring a swift end to the conflict,
the demonstrators focused their anger on the
United Nations. Hundreds of protestors forced
their way into UN House, where most of the aid
agencies had offices, and smashed windows,
furniture and equipment. A fire was started on
the second floor of the building, but this was
quickly brought under control.

journey from Beirut south to Lebanon’s second
city, Tyre, would take about an hour along the
main highway. For WFP convoys, the same
journey along circuitous mountain routes, on
narrow dirt roads and across temporary river
bridges jammed with cars, buses and trucks
overflowing with fleeing civilians, could take up
to seven hours. Fresh bombings meant that new
routes needed constant exploration – a bridge
open one day could be destroyed the next. And
as the conflict wore on, it became harder to find
haulage companies and drivers willing to join
the aid convoys.

Fortunately, no UN staff were injured in the
attack. The 20 WFP staff then in Beirut took
shelter in the basement of the building and
prepared to evacuate through an underground car
park. This proved unnecessary, as security staff
succeeded in regaining control of the building.
WFP subsequently relocated its Beirut office to
the Movenpick hotel in the west of the city.

To provide the greatest possible security for its aid
deliveries, WFP developed a system of
“concurrence on safety”, whereby all sides in the
conflict would be provided with details of each
convoy the day before its planned departure. This
would include the number of trucks and escort
vehicles, the exact route and planned times of
departure and arrival. Until the declared
cessation of hostilities on 14 August, no WFP
convoy would proceed without receiving
“concurrence” from all sides.

LOGISTICS

As the lead UN logistics agency, WFP assumed
responsibility for transporting all UN aid supplies
within Lebanon and on behalf of several NGOs.
In total, WFP transported 25,200 tons of food and
non-food relief items for 38 organisations, by land,
sea and air.

The system worked, in that no WFP convoy came
under attack at any time, although on two
occasions vehicles travelling close to the convoys
were destroyed and a building in Tyre was bombed
less than 100 metres from where WFP trucks were
being unloaded. But the system caused serious
delays to the delivery of aid, with convoys to the
south held up for one week in early August.

to witness the impact of the bombing and to
review the needs of the people as they began to
rebuild their lives after nearly five weeks of
conflict.

Among the main non-food items that WFP
transported into and within Lebanon were fuel,
shelter materials, water, and hygiene and medical
equipment. The agency also helped the
Government of Lebanon import 12,300 tons of
wheat during the period of the Israeli blockade.

Located about 50 km down the coast from Beirut,
Ghazieh is a farming community with scattered
light industry. During the conflict, 31 of its
residents were killed in bombing raids and some
20 houses and dozens of shops were destroyed.
Most of those who fled the fighting returned soon
after the ceasefire, to begin repairing and
rebuilding their properties, many were still in
need of humanitarian assistance, including clean
water and food supplies.

Movement of goods inside Lebanon was hampered
by a shortage of suitable trucks. Locally contracted
vehicles were often old and prone to breakdowns,
especially on the rough roads used for detours. The
supply by the Swedish Rescue Services Agency of
a fleet of nine heavy trucks plus support vehicles,
with drivers and mechanics, made a crucial
difference to WFP’s ability to deliver aid on behalf
of the entire humanitarian community.

“Over the next few weeks, many people still need
food aid so their resources and energies can be
devoted to the numerous other issues they face
while recovering from the crisis,” said Morris.
“Once commercial activities return to normal,
we will be able to wind up our operations. We do
not want to stay a day longer than necessary.”

While for the duration of the hostilities WFP’s
efforts had been concentrated on providing relief
to the displaced, now relief efforts needed to be
directed at all those affected by the war, including
those who had stayed in their homes and the
hundreds of thousands returning, many of them
to find that their houses had been destroyed.

“Having followed the conflict day by day, I was
determined to come to Lebanon and see for
myself what people have gone through,” Morris
said. “I am saddened by their losses but also
encouraged by people’s strength and resilience.
After what I’ve seen today, I am confident
that the Lebanese people will overcome this
latest ordeal.”

Over the coming days and weeks, regular
commerce was taking time to re-establish itself
and for many Lebanese, WFP food aid was vital
to fill the gap.

The cessation of hostilities brought a new
phase to the WFP operation. The lifting of the
Israeli blockade gave far greater access, with
Beirut international airport reopened and the
sea ports of Beirut, Tripoli and Tyre open to
international shipping.

until the end of October. Over the previous
three months, WFP had built up an operation
run by 150 international and national staff at its
peak, to provide food to some 824,000 people

SOMALIA

Ethiopian forces drove the UIC forces back to
Mogadishu, then down to the port city of
Kismayo and through southern Somalia until
they were cornered in the Ras Kamboni region
at the extreme southern tip of Somalia on the
border with Kenya.

E

thiopia launched its first air strikes into
Somalia on 24 December in support of the
Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG),
just a few hours before a WFP-chartered Antonov
An-12 made the first airdrop of WFP food into
Somalia in seven years.

It was a striking reversal in less than two weeks
with UIC forces initially taking heavy
casualties near Baidoa and then quickly
abandoning town after town to the advancing
TFG in the face of superior firepower from
supporting Ethiopian tanks, helicopter gunships
and MiG warplanes.

It was a coincidence that only brought home the
risks of working in one of the world’s most
dangerous and difficult countries and why WFP
does so year in, year out: people need our help –
particularly in countries such as Somalia, which
doesn’t even appear in UNDP’s annual Human
Development Index of 177 countries because
of a lack of comparable data since 2001.
The air strikes came at the end of one of Somalia’s
most politically and militarily tumultuous years
since the fall of the Siad Barre Government in
1991. Sadly, for the people of south and central
Somalia, the latest conflict erupted following the
worst drought in a decade and worst floods in
years (see natural disasters, page 28).
Confronting new challenges every day in
Somalia, WFP in 2006 delivered 78,000 tons of
food to 1.4 million vulnerable people, almost
three times the amount of food received in 2005.
The vast majority of beneficiaries – 1.2 million –
were in south and central Somalia.
From June 2006, forces of the Union of Islamic
Courts (UIC) seized Mogadishu and a string of
other centres in south and central Somalia up
to the border with the northeastern region of
Puntland. By December, the UIC appeared on
the brink of ousting the TFG from its last base
in the town of Baidoa.
Amid widespread fears of regional war and
contingency plans being made, TFG and

19

C o n f li c t
WFP also had to suspend airdrops into the south
from the Kenyan port of Mombasa – but not
before the helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft had
delivered 150 tons of much-needed food and nonfood items to people in flooded areas.

With 15 sub- and field offices and more than
100 national staff in Somalia, WFP is the largest
humanitarian agency in the country and has
worked there since the 1960s. The 2006 conflict
was only the latest in a cycle of violence on top
of back-to-back emergencies because of war,
drought and floods.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
It was a momentous year for the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) because it held its
first free democratic elections in 45 years, secured
by the largest UN peacekeeping mission in the
world. Incumbent President Joseph Kabila won
with 58 percent of the votes.

While a number of staff were relocated out of
combat areas, most WFP offices were staffed and
operating throughout the conflict, including
Mogadishu. With TFG and Ethiopian forces
nearing the capital, a WFP-chartered ship arrived
in Mogadishu port on 26 December and started
discharging 4,500 tons of WFP food the same day.
Dock labourers continued working and unloaded
the entire cargo even while control of the port
changed three times – from the UIC to a
sub-clan militia to the TFG.

Political advances and better security in places
prompted people to start moving home in 2006
before voting ended. The challenge now for the
humanitarian community is to match political
progress with humanitarian progress so people can
rebuild their lives in peace.

With only a few short breaks because of
insecurity, WFP staff and partners kept
distributing food in the south through the last
two weeks of 2006. Some 2,000 tons of food
reached 93,000 people hit by floods in the Lower
Shabelle and Middle and Lower Juba regions.

A country the size of western Europe with almost no
transport infrastructure and plagued by continuing
violence, especially in the east, the DRC has long
been considered by many donors as a chronic
problem almost beyond solution. The election
changed that and produced some hope that DRC
could find peace and development at last.

The TFG declaration that it was closing its
borders and airspace and the Ethiopian air strikes
from 24 December forced WFP to move two
WFP-chartered Mi-8 helicopters from the
southern port of Kismayo to neighbouring Kenya.

In 2006, WFP delivered 42,000 tons of food to
1.6 million people in DRC – only about half the
planned tonnage because of insufficient resources,
insecurity and poor infrastructure. Of the
US$73 million needed to provide 82,000 tons of
food from January to December 2006, less than
half was resourced by the end of July.
This shortfall came at the worst time because
violence displaced 500,000 people in the first
months of the year. This forced WFP to act as a
fireman, putting fires out where it could. In total,

20

Many depended on aid for their survival. Yet,
WFP was forced to drastically reduce rations from
July to December because of a lack of resources.
The biggest problem, however, was access
because transport routes were destroyed by years
of civil war. The rainy season in February made
already bad roads worse and transporters hiked
their prices.

83 percent of WFP resources went to emergencies
caused by violence by armed groups.
Overall, the total number of IDPs decreased by
33 percent, to 1.1 million compared to 2005. But
while substantial numbers were able to go home,
renewed militia violence caused new
displacements – both in new areas and areas
where some IDPs had returned, underlining the
fragility of the peace process.

WFP responded in March by airdropping – for the
first time in the DRC – more than 330 tons of
food to 38,000 displaced people. They were the
first WFP airdrops outside Sudan since 1998. Later
in 2006, a contribution from the UN CERF
allowed WFP to buy 25 trucks to increase the
delivery capacity in Katanga, which has a shortage
of commercial trucks and high transport costs.

Some were repeatedly displaced, especially in
North Kivu, Ituri and Katanga in the East. They
made temporary shelters out of leaves and
creepers, ate wild fruit and drank dirty water.
They could not tend their fields and women were
targets of sexual abuse.

21

C o n f li c t
With the elections, most of the 200,000 displaced
people in Katanga started returning home – some
for the first time in years. WFP and its partners
helped more than 97,000 people in Katanga with
food and seeds to start rebuilding their lives in
peace at last.

WFP concluded partnerships in 2006 with
240 local and 40 international NGOs.
Contributions from the European Commission,
Belgium, Spain, Greece and France allowed WFP
to make local purchases of critically needed food.

An agreement with the Congolese national
railways allowed WFP to organise several
‘humanitarian trains’ running from the southern
city of Lubumbashi. Some went as far as Kindu,
1,500 km north. From October to December, the
trains carried the largest amount of food aid
moved by rail in the last decade. In total, more
than 3,000 tons were delivered in three months
to over 400,000 people.

CHAD
Landlocked, shorn of infrastructure and torn by
violence, Chad is one of WFP’s most testing
operational environments. In 2006, WFP fed over
270,000 refugees in the country, as well as providing
emergency rations to at least 66,000 Chadians
forced from their homes by fighting in the East.
2006 was a year in which increasing violence in
eastern Chad threatened to compromise the
entire humanitarian effort. Sporadic
confrontations between local rebel groups and the
Chadian army forced WFP to suspend temporarily
all non-emergency activities in December, in
order to focus efforts on over 220,000 refugees
from Sudan’s Darfur region as well as Chadians
displaced by the conflict. Matters were
complicated further by the destabilising effect
of the war in neighbouring Darfur and an
intensification of clashes based on ethnic lines.

Funding from the European Commission
Humanitarian Office (ECHO) and CERF ensured
that the UN Humanitarian Air Service
(UNHAS) managed by WFP flew cargo and more
than 9,500 humanitarian passengers to isolated
parts of DRC in 2006. UNHAS operations in
DRC closed in December 2006 because of a lack
of resources.
In April, two crew members and a civilian were
killed when a WFP-chartered Caravan crashed
high in the Rwenzori mountains on the Ugandan
side of the border with eastern DRC. The
humanitarian community was shocked by their
deaths and pays homage to their dedication.

Looting of warehouses in Abeche following a
rebel attack on the vital humanitarian hub in
November, cost WFP about 500 tons of food,
valued at close to US$500,000. Soon afterwards,
all non-essential staff were forced to relocate,
some for the second time in less than a year, as
security deteriorated further. In order to
coordinate operations as efficiently as possible in
the volatile environment, all heads of sub-offices
in the East were regrouped in Abeche until
conditions improved. By the end of the year, a
special escort provided by the Government was
necessary for WFP staff to access six of the
12 refugee camps.

In the West of the DRC, WFP-contracted barges
carried WFP food from the capital Kinshasa to
the Northwest.
In late 2006, WFP, as leader of the logistics
cluster, focused on operational activities and
coordination with and through partners to
rehabilitate lake, river, rail and road
infrastructure.

22

to key operational centres. The service remains
critical in that it allows humanitarian personnel to
access remote parts of a vast country where people
are most in need.

Despite all the obstacles and with significantly
reduced staffing levels in the field, WFP and its
NGO partners ensured an unbroken supply of food
to the eastern camps and to the Chadians worst
affected by the violence. Earlier in the year, WFP
had again successfully pre-positioned all necessary
stocks ahead of the rainy season, when large-scale
land transport becomes impossible for at least four
months. This is an annual challenge, for which the
early confirmation of contributions by donors
remains crucial to meeting it.

D ARFUR
In 2006, Sudan was WFP’s biggest emergency
operation in the world, reaching more than five
million people. Despite a booming oil economy,
much of Africa’s largest country is poorly developed
and ridden with conflict. The ongoing conflict in
Darfur, the lingering effect of the civil war in the
south and chronic poverty in the east have left
many of Sudan’s 35 million people food insecure
and dependent on international aid in the absence
of social services.

In a similarly challenging operation in southern
Chad, WFP fed approximately 50,000 refugees from
the Central African Republic (CAR), forced north
by fighting and random acts of violence around
their villages since early 2003. About 17,000 arrived
in Chad in late 2005 and early 2006. With violence
persisting in northern CAR, the refugees had no
intention of returning.

Expectations that the humanitarian situation would
improve in 2006, a key planning assumption for
WFP last year, were not realized. Despite the
signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement in May, the
security situation actually deteriorated in the last
six months of the year and an additional

December, the situation had reached crisis point as

April 2004.

often too dangerous to get aid convoys through. In
July, the worst month for access in 2006, WFP
wasn’t able to reach close to half a million
beneficiaries. Nevertheless, some 400,000 tons of
food were distributed last year in Darfur.

Today, nearly two million displaced Darfurians
remain in camps and are completely dependant on
food aid, while one million other residents require
food aid to supplement their livelihoods. Despite
insecurity, a joint FAO/UNICEF/WFP study found
that malnutrition levels stabilized in 2006,
hovering just below the emergency threshold of
15 percent for children under five. The study also
found that while 70 percent of war-affected
Darfurians were food insecure, the number was
slightly down from the previous year.

Attacks on aid workers marked an alarming new
turn of events in Darfur in 2006. Twelve relief
workers, all Sudanese, died on the job in Darfur in
the latter half of 2005 – more than in the previous
two years combined. More than 400 UN and
NGO staff were evacuated during 31 separate
incidents in the last six months of 2006. In
December in Gereida IDP camp, the world’s
largest, armed men burst into aid compounds and
beat staff with rifle butts. As a result, WFP’s
cooperating partner, Action Contre La Faim, was
forced to withdraw, leaving 130,000 people
without food until the International Committee
for the Red Cross stepped in.

But 60 percent of highly food-insecure
householders in Darfur said insecurity was the
main barrier to cultivating their land, raising
livestock and taking part in other incomegenerating activities. The fighting also hampered
WFP’s access to the camps because roads were

Besides insecurity in Darfur, resourcing for the
enormous Sudan operation was a constant
challenge. In April, WFP took the painful decision

24

to cut rations to Darfur by 50 percent after only
32 percent of the US$746 million required to fund
the operation was secured. (Including the air
operation and road building in southern Sudan,
WFP appealed for close to US$1 billion dollars for
Sudan – or nearly a third of its annual budget last
year.) However, a healthy response from donors,
especially the United States and the European
Commission later in the year, helped restore rations
and the operation rounded out 2006 with 84
percent of the required funding.

environment, however, the flexible and pragmatic
approach of the country team succeeded. The
limitations on access to the Gaza Strip necessitated
an innovative approach from the WFP logistics
team and partners to adapt to the extraordinary
circumstances. Several parallel corridors were
established to move food into Gaza, enabling the
operation to continue despite frequent closures of
Gaza’s main border crossings. This meant that
despite closure of the main cargo crossing to Gaza
for 41 percent of the year, food continued to reach
the most needy on time. WFP succeeded in
delivering 95 percent of planned food commodities,
reaching its targets of 30,000 tons to the Gaza Strip
and 37,000 tons for the West Bank.

WEST B ANK

2006 started as a year of hope. However, by
February, the outlook was bleak, with a myriad of
new emerging threats to household food security.
WFP’s PRRO (running from September 2005 to
August 2007), planned to feed 480,000 of the most
food-insecure non-refugee population. However, by
June 2006, an Emergency Food Needs Assessment
indicated that the population required more
support to prevent a serious degradation in their
livelihoods amidst the growing humanitarian crisis.
Gaza was seen to be particularly affected as a result
of the combined effects of the stagnated economy,
movement restrictions and avian influenza, while
the West Bank showed worrying trends of market
fragmentation.

WFP also responded to emergency needs of people
most affected by the conflict by distributing readyto-eat rations (bread and canned meat) in Beit
Hanoun, northern Gaza Strip.

To mitigate the impact of the crisis on the poorest
and most vulnerable non-refugee families, WFP
activated its contingency plan in July expanding
the caseload by 25 percent to 597,000 individuals
and adding canned meat/fish to beneficiary rations
in Gaza to mitigate the nutritional threats caused
by a shortage of protein in the diet in the wake of
the avian influenza outbreak.

The WFP/FAO food security assessment in
November showed that thanks to generous donor
support, WFP’s flexible response had helped to
mitigate the food security crisis maintaining food
security levels at 2004 levels; nevertheless,
vulnerability is spreading to urban areas and new
target groups. Continued assistance to food-insecure
non-refugees is vital to maintain basic nutrition and
livelihoods until a political solution is found.

WFP faced many challenges to the programme
amidst the turbulent political and security

SOUTHERN SUDAN

Last year, close to 700,000 Sudanese returnees
received three-month resettlement rations while
almost 50,000 were given special transit rations.
WFP plans to increase distributions of
resettlement rations in 2007 and double the
number of transit rations. Some four million
southerners were displaced inside Sudan during
the civil war and 600,000 were scattered in
refugee camps in neighbouring countries. Their
long and often dangerous journey home marks the
biggest migration of human beings on Earth today.

In

June, WFP Executive Director James
Morris warmed hearts when he travelled
to southern Sudan and finally met a little boy
affectionately known as One O’Clock. The boy
got his name because one o’clock was the time of
day he was found alone, tearfully wandering in
Sudan’s unforgiving landscape. He was among a
group of “returnees” making their way back to
southern Sudan following the end of the country’s
brutal 21-year civil war, between the north and
the south, which ended in 2005.

B ACK

But along the way, the group was attacked by
armed horsemen and the infant boy was
separated from his mother. He would have
perished had he not been discovered by a kindly
woman named Noura Sawa Abu. Noura, a
mother of nine, had also been among the group
of returnees but was unable to locate the mother.
So she took the boy in and named him “One
O’Clock” or Sahwat, as the name is translated
in her native Dinka language.

TIMOR LESTE

For the first few days of the unrest, WFP, which
was in the final few months of a two-year PRRO to
assist 175,000 people across the country, had to
suspend operations. Non-essential international
staff were evacuated.

Five years after gaining independence and full
self-determination, following 24 years of
Indonesian control and three years of UN
administration, unrest broke out in Timor Leste
in May 2006 in and around the capital, Dili.
The fighting, which began with riots after the
dismissal of some 600 troops and quickly
descended into gunfights and looting, forced
tens of thousands of people to flee their homes
and seek shelter in makeshift camps.

However, within a week – and despite transport
networks being down and supply lines cut by
ongoing fighting – WFP set out to provide
emergency food assistance for six months for up to
100,000 people affected by the crisis. The
operation, valued at US$5.2 million, would
support and complement the Government’s efforts
to provide food to displaced people in camps.

reaping the peace dividends.

The agency began distributing rice and fortified
biscuits to up to 70,000 people in and around Dili
who were displaced or otherwise affected by the
fighting, and up to 30,000 people in the
countryside. Beyond providing rations to displaced
people, WFP worked with the Government in
emergency planning and in setting up a network of
food stocks in small warehouses across the country.
Timor Leste is one of the poorest countries in Asia.
Food insecurity is widespread due to low crop
yields, lack of income, drought and undeveloped
markets. Almost one-third of the population
regularly experiences food shortages.

T

here is no escape from calamity piled upon
calamity: a succession of droughts in Kenya
followed in 2006 by the worst regional drought in
years and then the worst floods in a decade.

At the height of the drought, the United Nations
identified more than eight million people in 2006
as in need of immediate humanitarian assistance
in East Africa and the Horn. WFP provided a
very effective response in the entire region.

Mass movements of people and livestock were the
first signs that 2006 would be hard as nomadic
herders discovered they had no more grazing lands.
Traditional ‘fall-back’ areas even in neighbouring
countries were dry. Women and children appeared
at the sides of dirt roads begging for water and food.

The failed short or Deyr rains from October to
December 2005 were followed by poor long or Gu
rains in many pastoralist areas from April to June
and heavy short rains from November to
December. Loss of life was very limited because of
emergency assistance, but hundreds of thousands
of people fell into destitution and still are unable
to climb out.

Within weeks of the short or Deyr rains failing,
animals were dying of disease caused by long waits
at boreholes and water pans, exhaustion and
starvation. Children suffering from dehydration
began appearing at clinics in the region. Many
never made it to centres to receive treatment.

Droughts of course often make a harsh life even
more precarious for many people in arid and semiarid areas of Kenya and Somalia. But land

are now multiplying the blows to eight million
pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in both
countries.

DROUGHT TO FLOODS

With a mild El Niño, the 2006 OctoberDecember short rains, which failed the previous
year, were the heaviest in years and led to
widespread flooding in northeastern, eastern and
coastal parts of Kenya, in southeastern Ethiopia
and along the Juba and Shabelle Rivers in
Somalia.

With donor support, WFP proved yet again in
2006 that it could provide emergency food aid in
time to prevent the loss of millions of lives in
the region and to buy some time for long-term
development – dependent on the will of
national governments and the international
community.

The floods were not as bad as those in 1997 in
Kenya and Somalia, but in some places the
impact on people was greater because damaged
roads were never repaired. An estimated quarter
of a million people were displaced by the floods
along the Juba and Shabelle Rivers.

In Kenya, WFP gave 258,000 tons of food to
3.86 million Kenyans in 26 arid and semi-arid
districts hit by drought and/or floods. WFP
rapidly scaled up its EMOP from 1.2 million
people assisted in January to 3.6 million at the
height of the drought between February and
August.

Overnight, hundreds of thousands of people went
from being targeted by WFP because of drought
to targeted by WFP because of floods. Hundreds
of contracted trucks became stuck for weeks on
dirt roads that were washed-out or transformed
into quagmires in both countries.

In addition, drought, floods and conflict in
Somalia led to 34,000 Somalis in 2006 crossing
the border as refugees to camps at Dadaab in
eastern Kenya. A total of 270,000 refugees in
camps at Dadaab and Kakuma in drought-stricken
areas relied entirely on WFP food for their
survival.

WFP launched a three-month SO for Kenya and
Somalia in November, providing fixed-wing
aircraft to airlift and airdrop humanitarian
supplies and transport aid workers, and Mi-8
helicopters to deliver humanitarian staff and
assistance to flood-affected areas.

In Somalia, WFP assisted some 1.5 million people
in 2006 with 78,000 tons of food – almost three
times the amount received in 2005.
The drought coincided with a bumper maize crop
in western Kenya, but it was unprofitable for
traders to move the maize to northeastern Kenya
because of transport costs and a lack of
purchasing power among the poor. Instead, the
Government of Kenya donated in-kind food,
mainly maize, worth US$19.6 million. The food
was then twinned with cash donations to WFP, so
it could be transported to drought- and floodstricken areas to reach those in need.

for almost two months, so distributions could start
on time in January 2007.

WFP also chartered boats to deliver food aid and
other assistance to isolated communities in both
countries.

After a slow start, donors were very generous to
WFP in both Kenya and Somalia because of the
drought and floods. Somalia received 88 percent
of required resources and total cash donations of
US$49.5 million. In 2006, Kenya’s EMOP
received US$211 million, or 94 percent out of
the US$225 million needed from March 2006 to
February 2007.

Flood waters displaced 100,000 refugees in the
Dadaab camps in November. Airlifts and airdrops
were used to deliver food and other assistance to
the camps, which could not be reached by road

M ohamed A bey, a 47-year-old pastoralist leader
in the roadside community of Skanska in
northeastern Kenya, says he o w ned 400 livestock
before the drought. No w he has just 20.

The air operations received swift, vital support
from donations through the CERF, which helped
get the aircraft in the air. In all, the SO in 2006
received a total of US$12.8 million, or 77 percent
of the US$16.5 million needed until the end of
February 2007.

ETHIOPIA

Some 1.7 million people were struggling to
survive with limited access to water and food.
Their assets were depleted, their ability to
respond to this latest shock greatly diminished,
and their survival strategies stretched to the limit.

DROUGHT

The bony, emaciated animal carcasses strewn
alongside the red, dirt tracks, the dried-up
boreholes and the weary, fatigued-looking
women carrying half-empty water containers –
the evidence was unmistakable. Drought – no
stranger to Ethiopia – had returned once again,
this time predominantly in the southeastern
corner of the country: the Somali region.

The Humanitarian Appeal issued in January 2006
by the Ethiopian Government, the United
Nations and other humanitarian partners
requested US$166 million in food and non-food
assistance. Sixty-nine percent of the 2.6 million
people in the country requiring urgent food
support in 2006 were those in the critically
affected pastoralist and agro-pastoralist areas of
Somali and Oromiya regions. Some 221,000 tons
of food was needed in these areas alone.

In this corner of Ethiopia, 1.5 million people,
mainly pastoralists and agro-pastoralists, were in
need of urgent humanitarian assistance
following the failure of consecutive rains. This
in addition to another 220,000 people who
assessment missions concluded were also at
particular risk in the neighbouring Borena zone
of Oromiya region.

WFP moved quickly. Working closely with the
Government of Ethiopia, the first food
allocations of 16,653 tons were made to the
Somali region in December 2005 and food
distributions began in January 2006. Cereals,
pulses, vegetable oil and blended food were
loaded onto trucks to be delivered to food
distribution points for hungry beneficiaries.
WFP provided a full food basket of cereals, pulses
and vegetable oil to 1.3 million drought-affected
beneficiaries in Ethiopia during 2006. This was
on top of the 5.5 million people already being
assisted by WFP through other operations in the
country.
The scarcity of water and pasture resulted in the
migration of affected households in search of
better opportunities. Men and older boys moved
with their livestock looking for pasture and water.
Women, children, the elderly and the sick
remained behind.
Livestock that many families depend on for food,
succumbed in their thousands from exhaustion,

31

N atura l D i s a s t e r s
In other parts of Ethiopia, 2006 proved to be an
exceptional crop year. By the end of 2006, much
of the pasture in the previously drought-affected
areas, save from a few pockets, had rejuvenated
thanks to good rains.
Although over the years drought has become
more frequent in Ethiopia, there has been a
significant reduction in the loss of human lives.
During this most recent drought, more timely
humanitarian interventions, upgraded early
warning mechanisms and improved coordination
all converged to help save lives.

lack of water and fodder. Losses were reported to
be up to 60 percent in some areas. Calves and
weak animals were slaughtered. There was a
drastic reduction in the production of milk and
a 75 percent decrease in livestock prices.
Emergency and recovery interventions were later
required for some 54 million heads of livestock.

WFP’s contribution, the distribution of
120,000 tons of food to drought-affected
populations in the Somali region and Borena zone
in 2006, quite clearly played a significant role in
the humanitarian drama.

By February, 640,000 people alone required
emergency water in Somali region and some
100,000 in Borena zone. Meanwhile grain prices
continued to increase as did chaotic migration.

INDONESIA

EARTHQUAKE

On 27 May 2006, an earthquake measuring
6.3 on the Richter scale hit the Yogyakarta region
on the Indonesian island of Java just before dawn.
Early estimates put the number of dead at more
than 3,000 people, with at least 200,000 left
homeless.

In Ethiopia, with five major droughts in just two
decades, many families have never had time to
recover from one calamity before another befalls
them, wiping out crops and animals and
destroying livelihoods. Hundreds of thousands of
people are on the brink of survival every year. In
southeastern Ethiopia, about one in five children
are malnourished.

WFP began distributing emergency food rations
to survivors just 36 hours after the earthquake
struck. Stocks were drawn from food WFP
already had in Jakarta, and the nearby town of
Solo. A shortage of storage facilities in the
affected areas also prompted WFP to send mobile
warehouses previously used for its tsunami
operations.

A total of 200,000 malnourished people were
identified by WFP for targeted supplementary
feeding (TSF) in the Somali and Oromiya regions
during the drought. Of these, 135,400 were
children under the age of five and 63,698 were
pregnant and breastfeeding women. Some
9,400 tons of targeted supplementary food was
distributed to registered beneficiaries.

Following a UN Inter-Agency Rapid Needs
Assessment mission, WFP undertook to feed some
100,000 people over a period of six months,
including 40,000 children under five, pregnant

women and breastfeeding mothers. The cost of
the operation was estimated at US$5.3 million,
which would be absorbed by the existing
Indonesia PRRO.

CROP FAILURES

Lush with banana trees and green hills, the
countryside of Burundi doesn’t look like a deadly
trap. But Burundi was crippled by a lethal
combination of poor rains, crop disease and
extreme poverty even before rains came too late
and too heavy at the end of 2006, destroying a
substantial part of the November harvest in much
of the country.

However, a lack of resources for Indonesia as a
whole put the earthquake operation in jeopardy
and by mid-July, WFP was considering halting
deliveries to the affected population. Fortunately,
a contribution to WFP of US$2 million from
Saudi Arabia, as part of an overall donation of
US$5 million to assist earthquake recovery
operations in Indonesia, allowed WFP to
continue its work.

With national average annual food deficits of
300,000-400,000 tons, 41 percent of Burundi’s
population is chronically undernourished while
the country struggles to recover from 13 years of

civil war. The signing of a ceasefire with the last
remaining rebel faction in September 2006 was
surely the major political event of the year.

through the general targeted feeding, some
300,000 through FFW and nearly 200,000 in the
school feeding programme.

While many Burundians rely on rain-fed
subsistence farming, population growth exceeds
3 percent per year. Per capita agricultural
production has declined 24 percent since 1993.
Already scarce resources are stretched by returns
of IDPs and refugees.

During the first half of 2006, WFP assisted
1.3 million people affected by the regional
drought with 40,000 tons of food. In addition,
WFP also gave food in 2006 to 79,000 refugees,
returnees and people expelled into Burundi
from Tanzania. About 12,000 Congolese refugees
also received food aid from WFP in 2006.

2006 for Burundi was also the year of some new
worrying trends. In the past, insecurity has been
the main cause of population displacement.
While seasonal migrations to Rwanda and to
neighbouring areas are common, migration of
entire households to Tanzania and Uganda in
search of food, and the sale of productive assets, is
unusual and gives rise to concern.

During 2006, WFP worked with FAO to help
farmers with seeds in order to help people to
sustain themselves in the long run. WFP
distributed seed protection rations for the two
main agricultural seasons, reaching 207,000
families with 9,600 tons of food to stop them
eating the 4,000 tons of seeds distributed by FAO
mainly in northern and eastern provinces.

Overall in 2006, WFP fed 1.9 million people in
Burundi with 74,000 tons of food. Of all these
beneficiaries, over one million were assisted

Other projects to help people to create assets and
protect their fields have been implemented. Some
FFW activities were designed to help farmers with
the disastrous consequences of cassava disease.
More than 3,000 people received 200 tons of food
aid during the programme. Since 2002, the
production of this crop has dropped by 30 percent
globally and 95 percent in the most diseaseaffected areas. Cassava has a high tolerance to
drought, is the third most important subsistence
crop in Burundi and accounts for 60 percent of
the household food basket.
The year ended with a looming crisis when heavy
rains in November and December destroyed crops
and came on top of an already very food-insecure
situation in the north and northeast. These
unusual heavy rains also put other provinces in a
vulnerable situation. At the end of the year, the
whole country was affected as a result and some
10 out of 17 provinces severely so.

Valued at US$102 million and requiring
150,000 metric tons of commodities for
1.9 million North Koreans, the plan aimed to
provide vitamin-and-mineral enriched foods
produced in-country to young children and
women of child-bearing age, and cereal rations
to underemployed communities to build and
rehabilitate agricultural and other community
assets.

WFP

ended ten years of emergency
assistance to the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) on
31 December 2005 after the Government, citing
better harvests and domestic concerns about the
emergence of a dependency culture and the
“intrusiveness” of the agency’s monitoring,
declared it would in the future accept only
assistance that addressed medium- and
long-term needs.

Several donors expressed strong concerns about
the restrictions on monitoring and access that
the Government imposed. These included a
reduction in the number of international staff
from a peak of 46 to just 10, and in the number
of monitoring visits from about 400 per month
to a much more limited number.

In February 2006, WFP’s Executive Board
approved a two-year plan to build on the
agency’s decade of humanitarian assistance to
the DPRK by tackling nutritional deficiencies
and chronic hunger. Distributions resumed in
May, when WFP reached agreement with the
Government on new working arrangements after
months of negotiation.

Past WFP operations mobilised more than four
million tons of commodities valued at

Pr o tra c t e d E m e r g e n c i e s
By the end of the year, WFP’s targeted feeding
operation for DPRK was reaching more than
700,000 people, mostly children and pregnant and
breastfeeding women in 29 counties – a little over
half the number of counties and less than half the
number of beneficiaries envisioned when the new
programme was started six months earlier. Donor
reluctance and continued political uncertainty
called into question whether WFP’s DPRK
operation would be sustainable even in this much
limited form. A glimmer of hope for an improving
political climate, however, was provided by the
convening of the six-party talks in Beijing in
late 2006.

US$1.7 billion, supported up to one-third of the
population of 23 million, and contributed to a
significant reduction in malnutrition rates. While
largely designed to meet urgent needs, they
progressively sought to promote medium- and
long-term food security.
While in years past WFP’s resources were spread
across all accessible counties – 160 out of 203 for
much of 2005 – the new operation envisaged a
more focused approach, with 80 percent of the
food going to the 50 most vulnerable counties.
These are mainly in the heavily urbanised east of
the country and the remote, mountainous north.
The new operation soon ran into funding
difficulties. By November, the shortfall was
88 percent with WFP working in only 30 of the
intended 50 counties. Altogether, the DPRK
needed to overcome a shortfall of one million
tons of grain. The tight cereal supplies were likely
to have dire consequences for the nutritional
health of the population, especially after the
decision by South Korea to withhold 500,000
tons in bilateral aid following the DPRK nuclear
test in October. Bilateral food aid from China was
also down to about 75 percent of the level
maintained over previous years.

FROM EMERGENCY

TO RECOVERY

In April 2006, WFP wound up its emergency
operation to assist the victims of the 8 October
2005 earthquake and launched a two-year postearthquake recovery operation. This operation
was closely coordinated with WFP’s Pakistan
Country Programme. In total, WFP reached
nearly 3.5 million food-insecure people in
Pakistan in 2006, including 847,799 individuals
participating directly in programme activities,
and 2.7 million family members supported
indirectly through take-home food and non-food
assistance, the latter consisting of tools, material
and equipment to bolster their earning capacity
and resilience to natural shocks.
The year 2006 challenged WFP and its partners in
Pakistan to meet large unforeseen needs in
demanding environments and in addition to their
on-going programmes in education, health and
asset creation for rural women. WFP set ambitious
targets for itself, yet despite significant logistics
constraints, it was able to not only meet but to
exceed many of its targets while containing costs
and strengthening core management processes.

Colombia has the largest network of partners of
any WFP-assisted project in the world. The
relationship with them is one by which an
informal agreement is signed and thereafter
both the partners and WFP join efforts to reach
those most in need.

A number of evaluations showed significant
success by Food-for-Education (FFE) programmes
in increasing enrolment and attendance while
reducing drop-out rates, particularly for girls.
Support included on-the-spot feeding to address
short-term hunger and take-home incentives
reducing the gender gap. In 2007, WFP will focus
on only those areas where literacy is below 10
percent.
WFP was able to expand its support for motherand-child health and nutrition (MCHN) projects
and to make progress in pooling and focusing its
resources with the Government, WHO and other
partners to ensure greater impact. Wheat
fortification was introduced in several commercial
mills to address the pre-existing and chronic
micronutrient deficiencies in earthquake-affected
areas. Haemoglobin tests conducted revealed
significant reductions in iron and vitamin
deficiencies.

One of the greatest strengths of this network of
partners is their capacity to assist populations
located in isolated or marginalised places. The
partners also have the necessary knowledge of
local conditions and can therefore inform WFP of
security, transport and logistics issues.

organisations have strengthened their integration

The policy complemented recent UN moves
towards greater effectiveness through the creation

injections of cash to aid operations after disaster
strikes.

INSURANCE

March, WFP announced that the global
reinsurance company, AXA RE, had been
awarded the world’s first insurance contract for
humanitarian emergencies. The contract supplied
US$7 million in contingency funding in a pilot
scheme to provide coverage in the case of an
extreme drought during Ethiopia’s 2006
agricultural season.

Transferring weather risks from poor countries
like Ethiopia into the international risk market
on a larger scale would allow insurers to diversify
their portfolios. This diversification could help
stem the rising cost of weather-related insurance
in developed countries while providing more
effective financial protection to developing
countries.

The scheme was prompted by the problem of delay
that millions of people face after natural disasters.
Frequently, by the time relief assistance arrives,
people have exhausted their coping mechanisms,
sold off their livestock – or seen them die – and are
already destitute.

The pilot project was supported by the
Governments of the United States and Ethiopia.
Additionally, private sector advisors of Weil,
Gotshal and Manges LLP and MDA Federal
(EarthSat) made valuable contributions.

This was the first time that an insurance cover
transferring risk to financial players had been used
for protecting poor people against the consequences
of extreme drought. The contract with AXA RE
was aimed at heralding the beginning of an entirely
new way of financing natural disaster aid. The pilot,
developed by WFP together with the World Bank
Commodity Risk Management Group, would test
whether it was possible to insure against the
devastation caused by extreme drought.
The policy, a derivative based upon a calibrated
index of rainfall data gathered from 26 weather
stations across Ethiopia, takes advantage of
financial and technical innovations in the weather
risk market. Payment would be triggered when data
gathered over a period from March to October
2006 indicates that rainfall is significantly below
historic averages, pointing to the likelihood of

HUNGER ALLIANCE BUILDING

2006 was a year of preparation for the planned
launch in 2007 of ECHUI. A central plank of
WFP’s commitment to the MDGs, the initiative
aims to establish a global partnership to end child
hunger and undernutrition within a generation.
The partnership will focus the world’s attention,
will and resources on what is required to achieve
this. It is about raising awareness of the problem
and mobilising action; building capacity at the
country level, putting better nutrition at the
centre of national policies and programming; and
promoting access to affordable, proven and
effective interventions for those most in need.

Joining WFP and UNICEF in the developing
partnership have been a band of technical experts
drawn from key actors such as the World Bank,
WHO, FAO, IFAD, the UN Standing
Committee on Nutrition, Gates Foundation,
World Economic Forum, plus other independent
specialists. Together they spent most of 2006
devising a strategy document, the Global
Framework for Action on child hunger. In 2007, a
high-level partners’ group consisting of eminent
persons drawn from international agencies,
NGOs, civil society, the private sector and the
academic and scientific communities, will carry
the initiative forward at the global level. At the
country, district and community level, the
partnership will be taken forward by the critical
actors in the field, within existing frameworks
and institutions. A global campaign to raise
awareness is planned for the final quarter of 2007.

The effort is being led by WFP as the UN’s
frontline agency on hunger, in partnership
with UNICEF. WFP, the world’s largest
humanitarian organisation, already runs nearly
2,300 partnerships with NGOs on which to build

Focusing on the capacity of some 85 million
families-in-need in developing countries, ECHUI
is designed to enhance WFP’s wider efforts to
help feed the 854 million malnourished people
worldwide. For WFP, ECHUI will mean assessing
processes and programmes to ensure it takes the
fullest account of those that bear hunger’s
heaviest burden and yet are least able to carry it:
children.

GLOBAL STAFF SURVEY
In April 2006, WFP conducted its second Global
Staff Survey to collect staff views about working
conditions. More than 8,500 staff completed the
questionnaire, up from 5,600 in the 2004 survey.
This increased participation demonstrates that

staff trusted the confidentiality of the process, and
felt that what they said could make a difference.
Input from more staff means a broader picture of
the institution, of what works and what doesn’t,
and of how everyone can collaborate to help
increase staff satisfaction and to make WFP a
more effective organisation.

The network is designed to enable WFP to
respond to four major crises anywhere in the
world at any one time, delivering emergency
supplies within 48 hours of needs being declared.

Results of the 2006 survey portray a highly
motivated and gratified workforce, proud to work
for WFP. At the same time, the feedback
underlined areas still needing attention.

The Government of Ghana provided a plot of
land for the hub, conveniently located within the
perimeter of Accra’s Kotoka International Airport.

The survey also revealed that the vast majority of
staff are proud to work for WFP, are committed
and satisfied with their jobs and believe that the
organisation makes good use of their skills.

The depot stocks important stand-by supplies
such as high-energy biscuits, drugs and other
medical equipment, sanitation and hygiene
systems, radio and telecommunication equipment
and drinking water.

The StaffMatters process continues, and WFP is
committed to doing everything it can to ensure
the best possible conditions for the men and
women worldwide who carry out its vital
humanitarian mission.

LOGISTICS

Until the construction of the new premises is
complete, WFP’s corporate partner, TNT, the
global express, logistics and mail company, has
offered the use of its own premises at the airport
to stock supplies. The immediate running costs of
the hub were covered by a donation of up to
US$500,000 per annum from Irish Aid.

HUBS

In December, WFP opened a major logistics hub
for humanitarian operations in Accra, Ghana,
expanding its emergency response capacity in the
West Africa region.

ECUADOR

CAPACITY BUILDING

WFP has cooperation agreements in place with
the Government of Ecuador for the
implementation of three food-based programmes
that care for almost two million beneficiaries
(15 percent of Ecuador’s population). In 2006,
care was provided to a full range of groups – from
pregnant and breastfeeding women, to children
from six months to three years old, students up to
age 14, as well as other vulnerable groups such as
the handicapped and elderly. In 2006 alone, WFP

mobilized over 26,000 tons of food for these
groups which make up the lowest echelons of the
poor. Resources for these programmes come from
the General State Budget and are handed to WFP
for the bidding, purchase, storage, and
distribution of the food.
This large-scale logistical operation has been
made possible by a steady improvement of WFPmanaged integrated systems that were set up in
consultation with Ecuadorian Government
technicians and officials. At the same time,
because of uncertainty surrounding the
availability of government resources, WFP
continually carries out evaluations and discussions
regarding each food distribution operation –
to assess its viability and good functioning.

The Government of Ecuador has recently
provided a ten-year loan for the use of facilities
located close to the new Quito international
airport to build the new Humanitarian Assistance
Centre (CELAH, in Spanish) that is part of the
Latin American and Caribbean Emergency
Response Network, headquartered in Panama.
Besides a stockpile of food, the CELAH will have
a 100-person training centre, a communications
centre, and a situation room. It will also be used
to provide training in warehouse use and food
logistics. The aim is to continue robust efforts in
capacity building while at the same time
increasing effective response to emergencies.

Close collaboration with the Government of
Ecuador has fostered a new vision and a greater
sense of collective action in the way the region
responds to emergencies. In 2005, the year when

In

Immediate Response Account allocations
reached a record high of US$136 million. 2006
contributions to the IRA totalled
US$31.9 million, an increase over 2005, and
the amount revolved into the account totalled
US$82.6 million.

SUPPORT

2006, WFP carried out an analysis of
eight of its largest operations to determine
the effectiveness and timeliness of internal
Advance Funding Mechanisms (IRA, Working
Capital Financing (WCF), and Direct Support
Cost Advance Facility (DSCAF)) and UN
Common Funds (CERF and Common
Humanitarian Funds (CHF)). Specifically the
analysis examined how different mechanisms
minimized pipeline breaks and response time.

Of the countries studied, IRA funds were
released, on average within one week. The
quickest release was made in less than 24 hours
for the Somalia PRRO. The longest interval
between the request and the approval date was
two weeks for the Sudan EMOP. The IRA
mechanism also proved highly flexible in:

In the countries studied the combined use of the
facilities secured the equivalent of about one
million annual food rations for approximately
15 million targeted beneficiaries. Loans and grants
from advance funding mechanisms covered on
average 20 percent of project direct expenditures.
The monetary value of the food made available for
distribution in 2006 through the internal advance
funding mechanisms and UN Common Funds
corresponded to approximately 10 percent of the
monetary value of planned food requirements.

• covering imminent pipeline breaks, for
example for the Somalia PRRO by allowing
immediate local or regional purchases; and
• meeting associated costs and full cost recovery,
especially in twinning arrangements, for
example with an in-kind maize donation from
the Government of Kenya. Had the IRA not
been available, purchase orders would have
been delayed approximately two and half
months and pipeline breaks would have forced
either a reduction in the number of
beneficiaries by about 408,000 or a cut in
rations for all three million targeted
beneficiaries.

WFP often used these mechanisms in a
complementary manner to avert pipeline gaps and
ensure timeliness. Each mechanism provided a
substantial level of funding, helped to fill gaps and
covered the cost of essential operational
components, including support services. For WFP’s
largest operation, in Sudan:
• a CERF loan was used for pre-financing the
purchase of commodities;
• WCF loans prevented ration reductions, and
provided the opportunity to pre-proposition food;
• IRA funds were used to buy non-cereal
commodities to supplement cereals; and
• common humanitarian funds covered the
internal transport costs of commodities already
in-country.

42

and enabled the Kenya CO to borrow
commodities from other projects and avoid
pipeline breaks in the refugee operation.

The Direct Support Cost Advance Facility
proved to be a very efficient mechanism. Funds
were released in less than 24 hours to pay start-up
costs in the Philippines. DSCAF funds were also
flexible in that they were not tied to additional
food resources and were a unique source of
advance funding for development. Both the
Philippines CO and the Southern Africa
Regional Bureau experienced difficulties
in repaying direct support costs (DSC) advances
because of unanticipated shortfalls in
contributions. Revolving was also more difficult
when the DSCAF advance was a significant
proportion of the total DSC budget, and
contributions fell short of expected levels.

Early in the year, administrative processes delayed
the release of CERF funds; however, timeliness
improved as the year progressed. In Sudan, a
CERF grant was requested to assist IDPs in Darfur
at the beginning of May – it was approved within
three weeks. It also took three weeks to approve
the Kenya request for US$1.7 million for the
PRRO in September. In December, CERF grants
were requested to support two Sudan SOs; both
were approved within the same day.
Common humanitarian funds were established as
two independent CHF grants for Sudan and the
DRC. The amounts available were significant in
the case of Sudan – US$36 million primarily to
cover landside transport, storage and handling
(LTSH) costs. In the DRC, CHF funds supported
the UNHAS SO and the United Nations Joint
Logistics Centre (UNJLC) SO. CHF funds for the
two DRC SOs were released with almost no delay,
however for the DRC PRRO there was a delay of
about six weeks.

Working Capital Financing provided flexibility
to purchase commodities rapidly, allowing overall
cost savings. For example, the Sudan Regional
Bureau was able to purchase commodities before
the rainy season and pre-position stocks, reducing
the need for costly airlifts and airdrops. The
average interval between the loan request and
approval was approximately one month for Sudan
and for the occupied Palestinian territories.
Repayment terms are stringent for the WCF and
these offices experienced difficulties in meeting
repayment schedules. This was partially because
forecast contributions, which are the basis for
advancing WCF loans, were either delayed or fell
short of expectations.

PRIVATE

DONOR SUPPORT

Donations from the private sector have increased
steadily since 2003, from US$5.3 million to
US$55 million in cash, commodities and services
in 2006, coming from nearly 100 organisations. In
addition, there has been a 100 percent year-overyear increase in the number of individual
donations, bringing the total number of donors
to over 40,000 by the end of the year.

CERF resources were disbursed in cash with “no
use” restrictions. In 2006, WFP received
US$108 million or about 42 percent of total
CERF allocations, the largest of any UN agency.
CERF grants funded the SO in Somalia –
UNHAS air strip rehabilitation; facilitated the
twinning with an in-kind Sudan Government
donation for the EMOP; expedited the response
for the Afghanistan PRRO by covering
commodity, transport and administrative costs;

based relationship with TNT, WFP’s first major
corporate partner, is a prime example. 2006
donations included frontline support to several
emergencies; expertise to enhance WFP’s logistics
and fundraising capacities; and critical cash
resources for school feeding.

WFP welcomed a number of new donors in
2006. The year closed with the signing of a
three-year partnership with Unilever, aimed at
improving the nutrition and health of
undernourished school-age children through
WFP’s school feeding activities.

After forging a partnership with WFP in 2005 to
support tsunami relief and recovery efforts in
Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, the
American Red Cross renewed its commitment to
child and maternal health interventions in 2006
by contributing to WFP’s School Feeding and
MCHN programmes in the tsunami-affected
districts of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam province
in Indonesia.

It was also a year of strong support from
foundations, with a substantial grant from the
Howard Buffett Foundation, allowing Malawi to
buy a fleet of trucks to reach the country’s
remotest areas, and Angola to purchase food for
its under-funded relief operation. Likewise, the
Elma Foundation made a significant grant to
Malawi in support of primary school feeding, and
to capacity building activities in Zambia. Finally,
the leading mobile telecommunications company,
Vodafone, together with the United Nations
Foundation, helped develop an early warning
emergency system and provided valuable training
for emergency response IT teams.

Global corporate leaders contributed to the fight
against hunger in a variety of ways. International
Paper (IP) and Cargill remained close to our
beneficiaries in several different countries: IP
substantially strengthened its commitment to
school feeding for pre- and primary-school-age
children in four impoverished areas of Kenya;
whereas Cargill continued to support the
Essential Package in Côte d’Ivoire, Malawi,
Zambia and Nicaragua, helping to address the
full range of needs for schoolchildren, from food,
nutrition, and deworming, to sanitation and
safe schoolrooms.

WFP also received important contributions
from major companies’ regional or local
representations. In Asia, WFP partnered with
Credit Suisse Asia Pacific to support school
feeding programmes in Sri Lanka, ensuring that
61 school feeding facilities will be built and
19,000 schoolchildren will receive daily in-school
meals through 2008. And for the third year in a
row in Japan, the Japan Advertising Council
produced and executed a massive, pro bono public
education campaign on hunger.

Others, like Citigroup, The Boston Consulting
Group (BCG) and Spencer Stuart leveraged
their expertise for WFP. Citigroup and WFP
completed the development of the WFP
Emergency Network for corporate partners in
humanitarian crises – a forward-thinking
mechanism to pre-position private sector
in-kind support before disaster strikes. BCG’s

contributions came from American sports giants:
the National Football League helped sustain ongoing relief efforts for Indian Ocean tsunami

Sudanese NBA player Luol Deng.

2006 was a year of growing contributions from
the Middle East. Dubai developers, Nakheel,
Dubai Holdings and Emaar Properties
committed crucial funding in support of WFP’s
emergency preparedness. After visiting
numerous countries in Africa, WFP Goodwill
Ambassador, HRH Princess Haya Bint
Al Hussein of Jordan made major substantial
donations to Ethiopia and Malawi in support of
HIV/AIDS-related activities and school feeding.
WFP also received a substantial donation from
Saudi Arabia’s HRH Prince Al Walid Bin Talal

Awareness of WFP among the general public and
decision makers continued to grow as a result.
WFP’s concerted communications efforts to target
the most important donor countries and emerging
donors with tailored corporate messages and
carefully coordinated donor relations efforts played
a critical role in fundraising especially for newer
underfunded operations. More than 20,000 photos
were distributed to donors, many used in
publications.

VISIBILITY

WFP’s

Communications Division
helped make WFP a key voice
in alerting the world to immediate humanitarian
needs to ensure public and donor support. It also
significantly raised the awareness of the general
public, donors, the private sector and opinionmakers to a range of important WFP activities and
helped generate more financial support to carry
them out. A single media campaign in May, for
example, helped to generate around
US$108 million in confirmed contributions for
Darfur within three weeks.

WFP generated millions of dollars worth of media
exposure for its work and cause, and had more
than double the mentions in targeted, high-profile
international media compared to 2005. The
organisation’s use of opportunities through the
media, including editorials, advertising, advocacy
and celebrity support paid significant dividends.

Efforts to build WFP visibility were integrated into
fundraising strategies, giving higher profile to both
donors, especially Executive Board members, and
NGO partners. In 2006, WFP had record mentions
in key international media (globally, more than
44,311 published news clips monitored), more
editorials and letters to the editor published (44),
and more donated advertising including advertising

A total of 8,215 news clips highlighting WFP
activities were published in selected leading
newspapers, magazines and online news services
in 14 major donor countries (Australia, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
UK and the USA). These included editorials and
letters published in 82 different newspapers and
magazines including: the Cape Times, Financial
Times, Gulf News, Indianapolis Star, the
International Herald Tribune, Japan Times,
l’Unità, La Prensa, Le Droit, Mainichi Shimbun,
The Independent, The Times, Vart Land and
The Washington Post.
The division produced 24 TV and radio spots and
21 print ads internally, rather than hiring outside
advertising and public relations firms. These were
broadcast and published for free in international
and local media, including TV networks – among
them the BBC, CNN international and domestic,
al-Jazeera, MTV, ESPN, Fox, TF1 and ZDF –

newspapers, magazines, stadiums and cinemas.
The known commercial value of the advertising
donated was in excess of US$34 million,
including US$9 million for the TV spot featuring
world famous football player Ronaldinho which
was broadcast during the World Cup by
109 outlets in 32 countries, including 99 TV
networks. This figure represents just about a third
of ads placed by WFP for which the values
could be verified.

Results substantially surpassed targets, indicating
increased visibility for WFP and hunger-related
issues. In Japan, for example, overall recognition of
WFP has increased from 36.4 percent in June 2005
to 42 percent in June 2006 – a 5.7 point increase
from 2005, according to an independent survey
conducted by Nippon Research Centre, a member
of Gallup International. In 2006, the Japan
Advertising Council again provided WFP with
some US$20 million worth of advertising time.

The division successfully launched pro-active
multimedia (media, TV spots, print ads, web
banners and stories) campaigns to raise funds and
increase WFP visibility for key EMOPs, for
example the Darfur crisis, the Horn of Africa,
Lebanon and the Indonesian earthquake.

2006 along with Brazilian soccer star Kaka, who
extended his previous commitment to fight
hunger for another two years. All three gave
media interviews and Cucinotta and Kaka even
lent their voices to the Italian version of WFP’s
Food Force videogame.
Public service announcements (PSAs) starring
celebrity partners also proved to be highly
effective in promoting WFP’s mission. One of the
most successful PSAs of 2006 featured soccer star
Ronaldinho sitting down at a dinner table,
apparently intent on eating a football. It ends
with this statement: “Not everyone can live off
football. You can help those who can’t.”
Although its popularity peaked during the World
Cup in June, the PSA was aired between May
and November on stations all across the world,
from Singapore to Germany, Senegal to
Guatemala.

But in early 2006, WFP made it to the silver
screen in its own right. Warner Bros. studios
approached WFP to use its expertise, logos and
equipment for Blood Diamond, a film about the
diamond trade during the bloody Sierra Leone
civil war. WFP worked with Warner Bros. to
ensure accuracy during the filming, and was
rewarded when two of the film’s stars – Djimon
Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly – shot a PSA
to accompany the film during its release in
2007.

experiments with WFP fare, like corn soya
blend. Her initial goal of US$25,000 was more
than doubled when the final bids on prizes
yielded almost US$61,000. Techamuanvivit
plans to make WFP the beneficiary of her 2007

US$100,000.

CRICKET A GAINST HUNGER
Cricket is a complex game that either attracts
fanatical support or leaves you utterly
dumbfounded. The world seems to be divided
neatly between those countries that play this
game with a passion, and those who look upon
it as a quaint and unusual English sport with
incomprehensible rules.
Fortunately for WFP, cricket is popular in a
large swathe of countries where it works. In
Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka,
cricket is a way of life and the development of
a partnership between WFP and the England
and Wales Cricket Board could yield high
dividends across South Asia.
The Cricket Against Hunger partnership was
launched in November 2006 at the British
High Commission in Canberra, Australia, by
the former WFP Executive Director, James
Ingram and the England bowler, Ashley Giles.
Earlier in the year, Giles had visited a factory
in the Indian town of Jaipur which was
producing fortified food for WFP and he was
able to speak of the impact WFP’s work has on
the lives of children living in hunger.

has long recognized the need to
work in collaboration with
partners, in which food aid is provided as an
integral package of assistance to reduce hunger.
This approach was strengthened in 2006 – the
proportion of joint WFP/partner projects, with
WFP food aid complemented by inputs from
other UN and NGO partners, increased for the
third year to a record level.

NGO

PARTNERS

NGOs handled half of all WFP food in 2006,
more than two million tons. Partnerships with
NGOs increased by 44 percent between 2005
and 2006, with 3,264 operational partnerships
in 2006 (up from 2,270 in 2005), largely
because of a substantial increase in the
recording of NGO partnerships in Colombia.
Eighty-eight percent of WFP COs recorded
operational partnerships with NGOs. Nearly
every WFP CO worked with local or
international NGOs to deliver assistance. WFP
tended to turn to international NGOs to
manage large-scale food distributions in crisis
situations where local operational capacity was
lacking. WFP relied on smaller, local NGOs to
increase outreach to communities, or to
implement interventions designed to assist
smaller groups of beneficiaries.

AGENCIES

WFP worked with 13 United Nations agencies,
four international organisations and the World
Bank in 2006. Seventy-nine percent of
Emergency Needs Assessments that served as a
basis for EMOPs and PRROs were carried out
with UN partners. In both 2006 and 2005,
complementary inputs and services with
UN partners were most often in health and
nutrition; in 2004 they were in the provision of
technical assistance.
UNICEF was WFP’s largest UN partner, mainly
in projects to overcome child hunger, reduce
the impact of HIV/AIDS, and improve
education.

Complementary inputs from NGOs were most
common in MCHN and school feeding
interventions, as well as in the provision of
general food distributions. More than
323 NGOs participated in the identification,
planning and design of WFP interventions in
2006 – with involvement in project design
most common in PRROs and FFW
interventions. NGOs were also involved with
project design in nearly a quarter of EMOPs
and participated in 28 percent of emergency
needs assessments. Based on a best practice
review on the management of NGO
relationships in Sudan, a more systematic
approach to evaluating the performance of
NGOs was developed and has already proven
to be a useful tool in other countries, for
example Niger.

FAO was WFP’s second largest UN partner. The
two agencies also worked closely on food
security assessments. Recent initiatives included
setting up food security monitoring sentinel
sites in particularly vulnerable countries to
provide early warning of potential food crises.
UNHCR and WFP jointly provided assistance
for refugees and displaced people. The two
agencies regularly conducted joint assessment
missions to agree on which populations required
assistance, the level of resources needed and
appropriate exit strategies. In 2006, initiatives
included the first joint global work-plan, joint

His short river trip was one small part of a wider
visit by the head of the Anglican Church to
southern Sudan that was made possible by the
logistical support of WFP. Air – and water –
transport for Dr. Williams and the party of
clergymen and women travelling with him was
laid on by WFP, providing essential support to the
visiting dignitaries.

ISLAMIC RELIEF
In December 2006, WFP signed an agreement
with Islamic Relief Worldwide to increase
cooperation on a diverse range of vital
humanitarian operations delivering food aid to
the hungry and the poor.

During his first visit to southern Sudan,
Dr. Williams held the Ash Wednesday service in
the town of Malakal, and served food to
schoolchildren who are being assisted through
WFP’s school feeding programmes.

WFP Executive Director James Morris signed a
Memorandum of Understanding with his
counterpart, Dr Hany El Banna, President of
Islamic Relief Worldwide at a ceremony in the
London Central Mosque.

“I am anxious to see governments, UN agencies
and faith-based organisations working together to
strengthen all that makes for peace in a land that
has known far too much war,” Dr. Williams said
during his tour of southern Sudan.

The partnership between WFP and Islamic Relief
encompasses everything from EMOPs to longerterm interventions like school feeding
programmes or cooperation on PRROs.

Operational cooperation between WFP and the
Episcopal Church of Sudan has increased since
the Archbishop’s visit. Dr. Williams also used the
experience of his trip to inspire speeches and
sermons in the months that followed the trip,
mentioning the work of WFP on numerous
occasions, including in his traditional New Year
message.

Islamic Relief’s strong contacts in the Muslim
world are expected to reinforce WFP’s role in
providing assistance to Muslim communities
whose members make up approximately half of
WFP’s beneficiaries.

C ANTERBURY

It would have been a rare sight anywhere in the
world, but in southern Sudan it was the kind of
event that locals are only likely to witness once
or twice in a generation. In March 2006, the head
of the Anglican Church, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Dr. Rowan Williams, was seen
