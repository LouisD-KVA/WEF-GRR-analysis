Foreword
Technological innovations and openness of trade have
profoundly changed the face of global production.
Converting raw materials into parts and components,
assembling final products and delivering them to the
end consumer involves supply chains that span an
increasing number of economies across the globe.
The emergence of these so-called global value chains
has been a force for good: they have made a large range
of consumer products more affordable, stimulated
economic growth and promoted the integration of
developing countries into the global economy – creating opportunities for economic development and the
alleviation of poverty.
Intangible capital – notably in the form of technology,
design and branding – permeates global value chains
in important ways. It accounts for a good part of what
consumers pay for in a product and determines which
companies are successful in the marketplace. It also lies
at the heart of the organization of global value chains:
decisions on where to locate different production
tasks and with whom to partner are closely tied to how
companies manage their intangible capital.
A large number of research reports have been
published on the causes and consequences of the
rise of global value chains, and many of these reports
have acknowledged the key role played by intangible
capital. However, few insights are available on why, how
and how much. With our World Intellectual Property
Report 2017, we hope to help unpack the intangibles
black box, in particular by shedding light on how intellectual property (IP) fits into this box.
The report begins by reviewing how global value chains
have come about and how they are organized. Against
this background, it reveals new estimates of the macroeconomic contribution of intangible capital to global
value chain production. These estimates show that
intangibles account for around one-third of production
value – or some 5.9 trillion United States dollars in 2014
– across 19 manufacturing industries.
Following the approach of our 2015 report, we complement these economy-wide perspectives with case
studies of specific global value chains – namely, coffee,
photovoltaics and smartphones. These three cases
highlight the different mix of intangibles embedded
in different consumer products and provide concrete
insight into the role that different forms of IP play in generating returns to investments in innovation and branding.

In addition, they explore how developing economies
– notably China – have succeeded in participating in
global value chains by building their own intangibles,
and what opportunities may exist to pursue similar
strategies in the future.
The evolution of global value chains has been disruptive, with some companies thriving and others failing.
It has accelerated the structural transformation of
economies, with some workers losing their jobs and
others seeing their skills richly rewarded. Technology
continues to transform global patterns of production
and is bound to lead to further disruption. For example,
advances in 3D printing, robotics and automated manufacturing may well lead companies to relocate certain
production tasks closer to the end consumer. In addition, the fast growth of emerging economies is set to
prompt shifts in the geography of global value chains.
Policymakers need to respond to the disruptive forces
unleashed by globalized production. Global value
chains are a human creation and could be reversed, but
this would risk even bigger disruption. Shaping them
in such a way that they benefit societies as a whole is
thus an important policy imperative.
As always, a report of this nature leaves important questions open. Most importantly, while we present – for the
first time – concrete estimates of how much income
accrues to intangibles in global value chain production,
it remains to be established who ultimately gains this
income. At the level of countries, cross-border ownership and sharing of intangible assets make it difficult
to associate assets and earnings with a particular
country location. At the level of individual earnings,
little systematic evidence exists on how intangibles
affect the compensation of workers at different skills
levels. Future research that offers empirical guidance
on these questions would be of great value.
We hope that this report will inform discussions on the
evolving nature of global value chains taking place in
different policy forums, and look forward to exploring
the contribution of the IP system to global value chain
production in our ongoing dialogue with Member States.

Executive summary
A consumer buys a new smartphone. What exactly
is she paying for?
The phone consists of many parts and components
manufactured all over the world, and the price needs
to cover the cost of those. She is also paying for the
labor of the people who made the components and
assembled the final product, and for services such
as transportation and the retailing of the product in
a physical store or online. And, very importantly, she
is paying for intangible capital – the technology that
runs the smartphone, its design and its brand name.
Today, production is global. Companies perform
different production stages in different locations
around the world. At each stage of the supply chain
or global value chain for each product, value is
generated by workers, by production machinery
and, increasingly, by intangible capital – things one
cannot touch, but which are crucial to the look,
feel, functionality and general appeal of a product.
Intangible capital is crucial in determining success
in the marketplace – which companies succeed and
which fail.
Is it possible to quantify the importance of intangible
capital? What types of intangibles are most valuable at different production stages and for different
consumer products? How do companies manage
their intangible assets in global value chains, and
what role does intellectual property (IP) play in generating a return on these assets?
Although there have been numerous studies on the
rise of global value chains, little evidence is available
to answer these questions. This report endeavors to
help fill that gap. It does so at the macroeconomic
level, by presenting original estimates of the income
accruing to intangible assets in 19 global manufacturing value chains, and it also explores the role of
intangibles in greater detail through case studies of
specific value chains for smartphones, coffee and
solar cells.
Insight into the role of intangible assets in global
value chains matters from a policy perspective.
Investments in intangible capital are a key source
of economic growth, and better understanding how
those assets are generated and exploited in a globalized marketplace may help policymakers refine the
enabling environment for such investments.

Similarly, acquiring intangible assets is a key imperative for policymakers in developing economies seeking to support local firms that strive to upgrade their
production capabilities in global value chains.

The rise of global value chains
Production processes have been unbundled
and spread around the world…
The growth of global value chains is a key distinguishing
feature of the so-called second wave of globalization
that set in some time in the second half of the 20th
century. The invention of the steam engine in the 18th
century unleashed the first globalization wave, which
peaked early in the 20th century. International commerce
during the first wave mostly consisted of trade in
commodities and fully assembled manufactured goods.
What stands out about international commerce in the
second globalization wave is the unbundling of the
production process and the spreading of different
production stages across different locations around the
world. As a result, trade patterns have shifted toward
multidirectional trade in intermediate goods within
particular industries.
Several forces supported this shift in the organization
of global production:
• Falling costs of international trade made it costeffective to disperse production across a number
of locations. Cheaper and faster transportation had
already propelled international trade during the first
globalization phase. The advent of air transport, the
spread of containerization and other innovations
lowered transport costs even further.
• Progressively more liberal trade policies after the
Second World War – following the proliferation of
protectionist policies in the interwar period – also
helped to lower the costs of shipping goods from
one country to another.
• Modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) were critical in enabling dispersed
production. In particular, rapidly falling communication costs and ever more powerful computing technology allowed companies to coordinate complex
production processes involving many locations
around the world.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

As economies have grown richer, consumers’ preferences
have shifted toward goods that respond to differentiated
tastes and offer a broader “brand experience.”

… unleashing rapid growth in world trade,
outpacing global output growth
As a result, international commerce boomed. As parts
and components cross borders several times before
the resulting products are finally assembled – and often
exported again – growth in world trade has outpaced
global output. The ratio of trade to gross domestic
product (GDP) has more than doubled over the last
half-century (figure 1).

Intangible capital has become more important
in global value chain production
Global value chain production in the 21st century is
popularly characterized by the so-called smile curve
– first proposed in the early 1990s by the chief executive officer of the company Acer, Inc. As illustrated
in figure 2, the smile curve recognizes the increased
importance of pre- and post-manufacturing stages
and posits that those stages account for ever-higher
shares of overall production value. The growing smile
shown in figure 2 reflects that intangible capital – in
the form of technology, design and brand value as
well as workers’ skills and managerial know-how
– has become critically important in dynamically
competitive markets. Firms continuously invest in
intangible capital to stay ahead of their rivals.

10

While appealing and intuitive, the concept of the smile
curve has its limitations. It may reasonably portray
the distribution of value added for firms performing all
production stages. But it is more difficult to apply at the
economy-wide level, where firms’ value chains intersect
and overlap. In addition, it does not provide any insight
into what precisely generates value added at different
production stages. For example, “higher value added”
does not necessarily coincide with underlying activities
being more profitable, associated with better paying
jobs, or generally “more desirable.”
One can gain a better understanding of what generates value in global value chains by quantifying how
much income accrues to labor, tangible capital and
intangible capital used in global value chain production. In research for this report, economists Wen
Chen, Reitze Gouma, Bart Los and Marcel Timmer
performed precisely such an analysis (see chapter
1). Their approach consisted of two steps. First, they
assembled macroeconomic data on shares of value
added in 19 manufacturing product groups spanning
43 economies plus one rest-of-the-world region which
together captured around one-quarter of global output.
Then they decomposed value added at each stage into
the incomes accruing to labor, tangible capital and
intangible capital – as illustrated in figure 3.

The intangibles share is especially high – and more
than double the tangibles share – for pharmaceutical,
chemical and petroleum products. It is also relatively
high for food products as well as computer, electronic
and optical products. In terms of absolute returns, the
three largest product groups – food products, motor
vehicles and textiles – account for close to 50 percent
of the total income generated by intangible capital in
the 19 manufacturing global value chains.

Figure 4 presents the resulting income shares accruing
to the three production factors for all products manufactured and sold worldwide from 2000 to 2014. The
intangibles share averaged 30.4 percent throughout
this period, almost double the share for tangibles.
Interestingly, it rose from 27.8 percent in 2000 to 31.9
percent in 2007, but has stagnated since then. Overall
income from intangibles in the 19 manufacturing
industries increased by 75 percent from 2000 to 2014
in real terms. It amounted to 5.9 trillion United States
dollars (USD) in 2014.

These and other figures presented in this report offer
for the first time an estimate of the return to intangible
asset investments in global value chain production,
which has so far largely escaped measurement.
Nonetheless, they also leave a number of questions
open and come with methodological caveats. For
example, which economies harvest the returns from
intangible capital? The question is obvious, but the
answer is elusive. For one thing, through transfer
pricing and related practices, companies can easily
shift profits from one location to another. Thus, an
intangible asset may originate in one economy, but
most of its returns may show up in another. More
fundamentally, increasing cross-border ownership and
sharing of intangibles is undermining the very notion
of location-bound assets and earnings.

The precise nature of intangible capital and how it
affects the business models of global value chain
participants differs widely across industries. The
case studies on coffee, photovoltaics and smartphones in this report offer more concrete perspectives on the nature of intangible capital and prevailing
business strategies.

The case of coffee
Coffee is one of the most important traded agricultural commodities. It is the source of income for nearly
26 million farmers in over 50 developing economies,
but 70 percent of coffee demand comes from highincome countries. Most of the value added of coffee
sold also accrues to high-income countries. This
partly reflects the short shelf life of roasted coffee,
which implies that most of the roasting is done close
to where the coffee is consumed. More importantly,
it reflects the economic importance of downstream
activities in the global value chain.

12

Intangible capital in the coffee supply
chain mainly consists of downstream
technological innovations and branding
The case study on coffee highlights two key forms of
intangible capital in the global value chain (see chapter 2):
• Technology associated with coffee farming and
with turning coffee into a high-quality and appealing consumer product. Patent data suggest that
the most innovative value chain stages are those
closer to the consumer, including the processing of
beans and especially the final distribution of coffee
products (figure 5). The latter stage includes the
modern espresso machines and coffee capsules
found in many homes and offices.
• Brand reputation and image, which allow consumer
product firms to differentiate their offering from those
of their rivals. Branding plays an important role in
all coffee market segments, including soluble and
roasted coffee sold in grocery stores, espressobased coffee products and retail coffeehouses.

In addition to technology and branding assets, the lead
firms in the global coffee value chain benefit from longterm relationships with distributors downstream. As a
result, the global coffee value chain is largely buyerdriven and dominated by a relatively small number of
multinational companies headquartered in the large
coffee-consuming countries.

are interested in knowing where their coffee beans
are sourced, how they have been farmed and how
best to brew the beans in order to fully appreciate
the flavor, body, aroma, fragrance and mouthfeel
of the coffee. The coffee beans tend to be of superior quality to those used in the other two market
segments.

Different waves of coffee consumption…

… are reshaping the global coffee value chain…

Shifting consumer preferences have prompted three
waves of coffee consumption that have progressively
transformed the global value chain:

The first wave still accounts for 65 to 80 percent of the
total quantity of coffee consumed, but only 45 percent
of the global market value. This reflects higher unit
prices commanded in the second and third waves (see
figure 6). The second and – more recently – third waves
are reshaping the governance of the global coffee value
chain. In particular, sourcing of coffee in the first wave
has traditionally been market-based, with buyers blending different types of coffee from different parts of the
world. The introduction of VSSs in the second wave
established more direct ties between coffee growers
and downstream value chain participants. These ties
are of even greater importance in the third wave and
have, in fact, shortened the value chain by cutting out
intermediaries in the coffee trade.

• The first wave centered on consumers who largely
consume their coffee at home. The products –
in the form of packaged roasted coffee beans,
soluble coffee and, more recently, single-serving
capsules – are standardized, with price differences
reflecting variation in the quality of coffee blends.
• The second wave emerged with consumers who prefer to consume coffee in a social
setting. Products in this market segment range
from the typical Italian espresso to more elaborate concoctions of coffee plus foamed milk.
In addition to coffee itself, most of the coffee shops
in this market segment offer a distinct ambiance to
attract their consumers. The quality of the coffee
beans used in the second wave tends to be higher
than those in the first wave. In addition, the second
wave introduced voluntary sustainability standards
(VSSs), informing consumers of the coffee’s origin
and whether farmers receive fair wages.
• The third wave market segment targets
consumers with discerning coffee tastes,
willing to pay premium prices for their coffee. They

… with the third wave opening opportunities
for upgraded participation by coffee farmers
The shift in consumer preferences associated with
the second and especially the third wave has opened
up opportunities for upgraded participation by coffee
farmers in exporting countries. The emphasis in this
market segment is akin to the wine industry’s flavor
profile, which valorizes the terroir, grape variety and
craftsmanship involved in producing the wine.

13

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

Information on the origin and variety of the coffee beans,
how they were farmed and processed, and if the farmers
are adequately compensated has become an integral
part of selling coffee. For coffee farmers, direct communication with buyers can sometimes lead to the sharing of
technology and know-how, helping to upgrade the coffee
farm and its processing. Figure 6 shows how the higher
prices commanded in the third wave are associated with
better remuneration of coffee farmers.

Responding to coffee demand in the third wave, more
and more coffee growers are investing in efforts to
differentiate their offering from generic coffee, adopting their own branding strategies. In addition, some
coffee-producing countries are actively pursuing the
branding of coffees originating from their countries in
overseas markets, while associations of coffee growers
and other entities have been seeking IP rights to protect
their brand assets in key consumer markets – such as
the Juan Valdez brand from Colombia and the Jamaican
Blue Mountain Coffee label.

Thanks in part to supportive public policies, demand
for photovoltaic (PV) systems has grown exponentially
since the early 2000s. At the same time, rapid technological progress has led to dramatic reductions in the
price of solar PV modules – between 2008 and 2015
alone, prices fell by an estimated 80 percent.

competitive dynamics in the PV value chain

technology (see chapter 3). Their production entails five
main stages: purification of silicon, the manufacturing
of ingots and wafers, production of PV cells, assembly
of modules and their integration into PV systems. The
intangible assets of value chain participants largely
consist of advanced technology, especially in the
more upstream stages. This technology often requires
specific know-how which companies keep secret,
though patenting has grown rapidly, especially since
2005 (figure 7).
Companies in the United States, Germany, Japan
and Australia traditionally accounted for the bulk of
product innovation in the industry. However, over
time PV panels and systems have essentially turned
into commodities – the key competitive factor is how
much electricity they can produce per dollar invested.
As a result, the dynamics of the industry have been
profoundly driven by strategies to reduce production
costs. Successful market participants were able to
lower their cost structures by investing in more powerful
production equipment, realizing efficiencies through
complementary process innovations and achieving
large-scale production.

Innovation remains geographically concentrated
Innovation in PV technology remains geographically
concentrated. The vast majority of PV patents are filed
in China, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea and
the United States, with Chinese innovators emerging
as the largest source of patent filings from 2010 onward
(figure 7). Interestingly, the distribution of patenting
activity across origins varies markedly by PV-related
technology, with Chinese entities, for example, focusing more on solar module technology and less on cell
technology than other origins (figure 8).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

China has emerged as the dominant
force in the PV global value chain…

A few country origins account
for most PV patenting activity

Participation in the PV global value chain has shifted
markedly over the last decade, in particular with the
relocation of upstream and midstream production
activities to China. PV products initially invented in
high-income countries decades ago were no longer
protected by patents, and Chinese firms successfully
acquired the knowledge to manufacture PV components efficiently along the PV value chain. They did so
through two main channels:

The shift in global value chain production – combined
with the steep fall in prices – put many traditional
PV manufacturers in the United States, Europe and
elsewhere under competitive pressure, resulting in
bankruptcies and acquisitions. This partly explains
the decline in PV patent filings worldwide after 2011,
which was driven by the traditional origins of PV
innovation (see figure 7). China is the only major
patenting origin to have seen continued patenting
growth after 2011.

However, the picture is more nuanced. With a saturated solar PV market and low prices that result in
tight profit margins, surviving firms have stepped up
their investments in research and development (R&D)
to develop new cost-competitive PV technology. A
closer look at the patent data reveals that patent
applications per applicant have continued to grow
in the traditional origins since 2011, suggesting an
increase in patenting among surviving firms. Indeed,
among those firms patent filings have been growing
faster than R&D outlays, suggesting that patent rights
may well become more important in securing future
returns to R&D.

See figure 3.10.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

A second response to market saturation and tight profit
margins is for PV manufacturers to move downstream
by getting involved in project development and building
up reputational assets through branding activities. Such
a strategy can help companies generate demand for
their upstream products and increase profit margins,
especially in local and less competitive service markets.

The case of smartphones
Relatively few lead firms dominate
the smartphone value chain
Smartphone value chains are dominated by a relatively
small number of lead firms that operate under strong
brands and invest heavily in technology and product
design. The case study looks at three such lead firms
– Apple, Samsung and Huawei – and specific smartphone models they offer (see chapter 4). Key features
of the smartphone value chain are the following:
• In addition to their own technology, lead firms
source components and technology from third
parties which can also be innovative. Certain
components – such as phone chipsets and batteries – are highly complex and have their own global
supply chains behind them.

• Lead firms have their own stores as well as using
third-party retailers to distribute their products
to consumers, with Apple relying the most on its
own stores.

Estimates of value capture show that lead
firms generate substantial returns from their
intangible capital – especially Apple…
To obtain insight into the return to intangibles in the case
of smartphones, the case study estimates so-called
value capture shares of the three lead firms. These
value capture shares are conceptually similar to the
macroeconomic returns to intangible capital discussed
above, though there are important methodological
differences reflecting the availability of underlying data.
Figure 9 shows the value capture shares for three
smartphone models. For every iPhone 7 that Apple sells
for around USD 809, it gets to keep 42 percent. While
the value capture shares of Huawei and Samsung are
comparable, Apple captures more value in absolute
terms than its two competitors, reflecting the iPhone’s
premium price and its substantially higher sales volume.
These figures underscore the high returns accruing to
intangible capital in this industry, especially for Apple.

… though other firms benefit as well
• Lead firms require access to technology employed
in interoperability and connectivity standards,
such as the fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term
Evolution (LTE) cellular standard. Companies
such as Nokia, Ericsson, Qualcomm, InterDigital,
Huawei, Samsung, NT T DoCoMo and ZTE
contribute patented technologies to the development of such standards, which are defined
by standard-setting organizations. Access to
these technologies typically entails the payment
of licensing fees.
• Smartphones require a mobile operating system
and other dedicated mobile software applications, often from third parties. Samsung, Huawei
and others use Android developed by Google,
whereas Apple produces its own iOS system.
• In the case of Apple, assembly of the final product
is performed by large original design or contract
manufacturers. Samsung mostly internalizes the
assembly in its own factories, while Huawei uses
both internal and external assembly.

16

It would be too simplistic to conclude, however, that
only the lead firms generate returns to intangible capital.
Certain component suppliers offering proprietary technology in the United States and Asia achieve significant
margins, and so do technology providers such as
Qualcomm, but contract manufacturers performing final
assembly realize relatively low margins, reflecting the
minor importance of intangible capital at this production
stage. They benefit mainly from high-volume activity.

Smartphone value chain participants rely heavily
on IP to generate a return on their intangible capital
The case study also sought to map IP filings to smartphone products and technology. This is exceedingly
difficult. Existing patent classification schemes do not
provide off-the-shelf categories for all smartphonerelated inventions. Indeed, many inventions at the heart
of a smartphone’s functionality may not be found in
the classification categories most directly associated
with smartphones such as “portable communication
terminals” and “telephone sets.”

In addition, many inventions may not be unique to
smartphones or may not even have been thought of
as being relevant to smartphones when the patents
were filed, for example global positioning system (GPS)
technology. The broadest mapping approach suggests
that up to 35 percent of all first patent filings worldwide
relate to smartphones.
Similar difficulties arise in identifying industrial design
and trademark filings associated with smartphone
products. Available filing statistics show that Apple,
Huawei and Samsung rely heavily on these forms of
IP, but not all their filings necessarily relate to their
smartphone models. One particularly fast-growing
area of industrial design filing activity concerns graphical user interfaces (GUIs). At the European Union
Intellectual Property Office, Apple filed 222 industrial
design applications on GUIs between 2009 and 2014,
while Samsung filed 379.

Value capture is geographically
concentrated, but is shifting over time
Only a few country locations, mostly the United States
and a few Asian countries, have captured the vast
majority of value in smartphone production in recent
history (see figure 9). However, the smartphone value
chain is evolving dynamically, with new technology and
changing consumer tastes benefiting some players and
challenging others:
• Chinese market participants have rapidly upgraded
their technological capabilities. Huawei, for example,
has evolved from a supplier of telecommunications
equipment and low-end mobile phones to a lead
supplier of high-end smartphones, investing heavily in R&D and building up a global brand. Other
Chinese smartphone suppliers – such as Xiaomi,
Oppo and Vivo – have entered the top 10 in terms
of global sales.
• Firms traditionally associated with assembly operations such as Foxconn have created their own technological edge, having spent considerable sums on
R&D and building up large patent portfolios.
• Even the assembly of smartphones is undergoing
constant shifts, with lead firms at times struggling to
meet high demand, leading to experiments with new
manufacturers or assembly locations such as India
in the case of Apple and Viet Nam for Samsung.

18

• Participation in patent pools for newer technological standards such as LTE see relatively strong
participation by Internet firms such as Google and
companies from China and the Republic of Korea,
notably Huawei, ZTE and Samsung.

The future of global value chains
Global value chains have emerged as the 21st-century
face of international commerce. They have tied together national economies as never before and have
helped integrate numerous developing countries into
the global economy. How will they evolve further,
and what role is there for policy to ensure that they
support economic growth and rising living standards
around the world?
As shown in figure 1, the world’s trade-to-GDP ratio
has more than doubled over the past 50 years, but
it has not seen any increase since the global financial crisis unfolded in 2008. Research suggests that
the stagnating trade-to-GDP ratio may well reflect
diminished opportunities for global value chains to
spread any further (see chapter 1). This development
may suggest that greater global production sharing will not provide the same growth impetus in the
future that it did in the decades prior to the financial
crisis. At the same time, technological and business
innovations as well as shifting consumer preferences
will continue to transform global production. Most
prominently, developments in 3D printing, robotics
and automated manufacturing have already reconfigured supply chains in a number of industries, and
further progress in these areas may well unleash more
profound change. These developments may lead to
the “re-shoring” of certain production tasks, implying
less trade. But the deployment of such technologies
could still help spur economic growth.
Whatever their causes, shifts in global value chains
disrupt prevailing patterns of production – and
this should be the chief concern for policymakers.
Production tasks offshored abroad may lead affected
workers to lose their jobs or experience declining
wages. Trade protection is not the answer to such
disruption. Reversing open markets could be highly
disruptive in and of itself. Instead, policymakers should
aim to provide a social safety net that cushions the
adverse effects of unemployment and to institute
measures to facilitate the retraining of affected workers.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Indeed, policies aimed at addressing disruption arising
from global value chain shifts are, in principle, no different from policies that seek to address disruption naturally arising in any economy that undergoes structural
transformation as part of the economic growth process.
For policymakers in low- and middle-income economies, a key question is how they can support the
upgrading of global value chain production capabilities
by local firms. Experience from successful upgrading
in East Asia suggests that establishing a mix of policies
conducive for investments in intangible assets – including through balanced IP policies – should be a key priority. In addition, governments can play a constructive role
in identifying pre-existing industrial capabilities – often
at the level of sub-regions – and leveraging them by
removing constraints on entrepreneurial activity. In
doing so, it is important to adopt a global value chain
perspective as the opportunities and challenges of
local entrepreneurs evolve with global market trends.
Successful global value chain upgrading in all likelihood does not entail a zero-sum game among national
economies. While it may lead to the displacement of
some global value chain participants, it is an inherently dynamic phenomenon. Technological change
and new product cycles invariably prompt continuous
reconfigurations of global value chains that create entry
opportunities for some firms and may force the exit
of others. In addition, successful global value chain
upgrading generates economic growth that enlarges
the market for global value chain outputs as a whole.

Chapter 1
Global value chains: the face of
21st-century international commerce
Technology, business innovations and falling trade
costs have profoundly transformed the organization of
global production. The production process has been
unbundled, and different production stages spread
across different locations. Complex international
supply chains – also referred to as global value chains
– have emerged, whereby firms ship intermediate
goods across the world for further processing and,
eventually, final assembly. Among the most far-reaching changes unleashed by the growth of global value
chains has been the integration of selected developing
economies into the global economy, coinciding with
rapid economic growth in those economies. One
prominent scholar has characterized this development
as “perhaps the most momentous global economic
change in the last 100 years.”1
The rise of global value chains has gone hand
in hand with the growing importance of intangible
assets in economic activity. Previous editions of the
World Intellectual Property Report have documented
the rapid growth of investments in technology, design
and branding – outpacing the growth of traditional
bricks-and-mortar investments.2 In fact, the two trends
are directly connected. Intangible assets shape global
value chains in two important ways. First, the organization of international supply chains – and especially the
offshoring of labor-intensive manufacturing tasks to
lower-wage economies – entails the transfer of technological and business knowledge from one location
to another. Such knowledge is often subject to various
forms of intellectual property (IP), including registered
IP such as patents and industrial designs, and unregistered IP such as copyright and trade secrets. Second,
technology, design and branding determine success in
the marketplace and thus affect how value is distributed
within global value chains.

Despite a large number of studies on global value chain
trade, relatively little is known about how companies
manage their intangible assets when offshoring production abroad, and how much production value derives
from those assets. This report seeks to help fill that
knowledge gap. It does so in two parts. First, it distills
the insights from existing global value chain studies and
reveals original research on the macroeconomic contribution of intangible assets to value added. Second, it
explores the role of intangible assets at the microeconomic level in the case of three industries – coffee,
photovoltaics and smartphones. These case studies
will be presented in chapters 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
This opening chapter seeks to set the scene by reviewing how global value chains have come about, exploring
economic research on their organization and providing
new evidence on the contribution of intangible assets.
In particular, section 1.1 provides a brief summary of
the growth of global value chains over recent decades
and section 1.2 introduces key concepts surrounding
the organization and governance of global value chains.
Against this background, section 1.3 presents original
estimates of the returns accruing to intangible assets
in global value chain production. Section 1.4 then takes
a closer look at how firms participating in global value
chains manage their intangible assets, and how firms
in economies at early stages of industrial development
may acquire them. This discussion provides the context
for the case studies in chapters 2, 3 and 4. Finally,
section 1.5 offers some policy-oriented reflections on
the evolution of global value chains.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

1.1 – Characterizing the growth
of global value chains
The growth of global value chains is a key distinguishing feature of the so-called second wave of globalization that set in some time in the second half of the
20th century. The invention of the steam engine in the
18th century unleashed the first globalization wave,
which peaked early in the 20th century. International
commerce during the first wave mostly consisted of
trade in commodities and fully assembled manufactured goods. Countries’ export and import patterns
at that time largely reflected their sectoral comparative advantages and disadvantages.3 What stands
out about international commerce in the second
globalization wave is increased vertical specialization – countries concentrating on particular stages of
production. As a result, trade patterns have shifted
toward multidirectional trade in intermediate goods
and services within particular industries.4
Several forces supported greater vertical specialization. Falling costs of international trade made it costeffective to disperse production across a number of
locations. Cheaper and faster transportation already
propelled international trade during the first globalization phase. The advent of air transport, the spread
of containerization and other innovations lowered
transport costs even further. Progressively more
liberal trade policies after the Second World War –
following the proliferation of protectionist policies in
the interwar period – also helped to lower the costs
of shipping goods from one country to another. It is
worth noting that even small declines in trade costs –
whether due to cheaper transportation or less import
protection – can have a strong effect on global value
chain formation, because such costs occur every
time different parts and components cross national
borders before final assembly.5
Equally important, modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) were critical in enabling
dispersed production across several locations. As
will be further explained below, deciding whether or
not to geographically separate production involves a
trade-off between lower production costs offered by
dispersed production and higher coordination costs
associated with geographical separation. Rapidly
falling communication costs and ever more powerful
computing technology shifted this trade-off in favor
of dispersed production.6

One way of illustrating the rise of global value chains is
to calculate the share of export value added in overall
gross exports. If products’ parts and components
cross national borders several times before they reach
consumers, gross export values associated with these
products will exceed the export value added in each of
the production locations. Growing global value chain
trade should thus prompt a decreasing share of export
value added in gross exports; and figure 1.1 shows
that this has indeed happened – globally, the share
fell by 7 percentage points between 1995 and 2011.
Unfortunately, given the complexity of capturing value
added in trade statistics, export value added data are
not available before 1995 and after 2011. For both a
longer-term and more recent perspective, figure 1.2
depicts the evolution of the world’s trade-to-gross
domestic product (GDP) ratio. Trade as a proportion of GDP rose nearly 240 percent between 1960
and 2015. Note that trade and GDP values are not
directly comparable: trade captures traded output on
a revenue basis whereas GDP measures total output
on a value-added basis. Nonetheless, the sharp
increase over the last half-century likely reflects the
rise of global value chains – again, more gross trade
for every dollar of output.

Figure 1.2 also shows that the trade-to-GDP ratio
reached its peak in 2008, saw a sharp fall in the
course of the global financial crisis, and has stagnated since. It is still too early to tell whether this is
a cyclical phenomenon associated with the weak
economic recovery from the financial crisis or a
structural and lasting phenomenon. However, some
evidence suggests that vertical specialization may
indeed have reached its limits and global value
chains may not further proliferate as they have over
the past few decades.7

Notwithstanding the profound imprint of global
value chains on world trade, it is worth asking
whether global value chains have a truly global
reach. Figure 1.3 offers a perspective on this question by showing the share of domestic and foreign
value added in overall exports for selected middleincome economies. Foreign value added reflects the
imports of intermediate goods and services used
in the production of exported goods. The figure
also offers a breakdown of foreign value added by

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

At least two insights emerge from figure 1.3. First,
while virtually all economies have seen an increase
in the share of foreign value added, some are more
closely integrated into vertical production networks than
others. For example, the foreign value added shares in
Argentina, Brazil and Indonesia are substantially lower
than those of Bulgaria, China, Malaysia and Mexico.
India and Turkey stand out as having seen the largest increases in the foreign value added share of their
exports from 1995 to 2011. Second, global value chains
have a regional face: the United States accounts for the
largest share of foreign value added in Mexico’s exports;
East and Southeast Asian countries account for the
largest foreign value added shares in China, Indonesia
and Malaysia; and European countries account for the
largest shares in Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.
More generally, studies have identified East Asia, Europe
and North America as the three regional blocks with the
strongest supply chain relationships. In a nutshell, within
each of these blocks, high-income “headquarter” economies export technology-intensive intermediate goods
and services to middle-income “factory” economies
which then export assembled goods within and beyond
the region. Japan, Germany and the United States have
been the lead headquarter economies in the three
blocks.8 However, vertical production networks have
evolved substantially over time, with China in particular
increasingly entering the more technology-intensive
upstream production stages.

1.2 – How global value chains
are organized and governed
The concept of production in the 21st century has
evolved greatly from the first notions of mass production in the early 20th century. As epitomized by Ford’s
automotive assembly line, the focus back then was on
converting raw materials into parts and components
which were then manufactured into final products.
There were relatively few stages of production and they
took place within close geographical proximity, if not
under the roof of the same factory.
Production in the 21st century is popularly characterized by the so-called smile curve – first proposed in
the early 1990s by the chief executive officer of the
company Acer, Inc. As illustrated in figure 1.4, the smile
curve recognizes the increased importance of pre- and
post-manufacturing stages and, in fact, submits that
those stages account for ever-higher shares of overall
production value.

Stage of production
Note: Branding is shown as a post-manufacturing
production stage, although certain branding activities may
already occur at early pre-manufacturing stages.

The simple concept of the smile curve captures two
important structural shifts:
• First, technological progress has been considerably faster in manufacturing than in services. As
discussed in WIPO (2015), this trend has implied
a shift of labor and capital from manufacturing to
services and consequently a rising share of services
in economic output. In terms of figure 1.4, the share
of manufacturing in firms’ overall cost structure has
progressively fallen.
• Second, intangible assets – in the form of technology, design and brand value as well as workers’
skills and managerial know-how – have become
critically important in dynamically competitive
markets. Firms continuously invest in intangible
capital to stay ahead of their rivals. As economies
have grown richer, consumers’ preferences have
shifted toward goods that respond to differentiated
tastes and offer a broader “brand experience.”9
Faced with 21st-century smile curves, how have firms
organized production along the value chain? The
answer depends in part on the nature of the final
product and the technology underlying manufacturing.
In this regard, one can broadly distinguish two basic
supply chain configurations, as shown in figure 1.5.
On the one hand, there are “snake-like” configurations, in which production proceeds sequentially from
upstream to downstream, with value being added at
each stage – not unlike in the classic Ford example.



GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS: THE FACE OF 21ST-CENTURY INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE

On the other hand, there are “spider-like” configurations in which a variety of parts and components
come together for assembly of the final product.10
For example, as will be further discussed in chapters
2, 3 and 4, the coffee and photovoltaic supply chains
tend to resemble a snake configuration, whereas the
smartphone supply chain looks more like a spider. But
most supply chains are a complex mixture of these
two polar configurations.
In either configuration, firms face two overarching
questions. Should they perform different production
tasks themselves or outsource those tasks to other
firms? And where should those tasks be located?

As to the first question, one important insight from
economy theory is that firms outsource certain
production tasks whenever the transaction cost of
providing specific goods or services through the
market is lower than the costs of coordination within
a single organization.11 In practice, firms are more
likely to integrate different tasks whenever there are
strong synergies from doing so – say, from combining
product development and manufacturing. In addition,
concerns about technology and business know-how
leaking to competitors may also favor vertical integration (see section 1.4). Nonetheless, greater production
complexity, the increased importance of pre- and
post-manufacturing stages, the standardization of
certain manufacturing processes, and improved information and communication technologies have, over
time, favored greater firm specialization.
As to the question of where different production
tasks should be located, some tasks – notably in
agriculture and mining – depend closely on the location of natural resources. Where this is not the case,
various trade-offs apply. On the one hand, combining
different tasks in one location reduces coordination and trade costs. On the other hand, spreading
those tasks to different locations – whether within
the same country or abroad – allows firms to benefit
from the advantages different locations can offer.
These advantages may take the form of access to
specialized skills, lower cost structures, or proximity to end-consumer markets.12 The combination of
technological advances, business innovations and
falling trade costs has, over time, prompted the
progressive unbundling and geographical dispersion
of the production process.13

The most dramatic consequence has been the
offshoring of labor-intensive manufacturing stages
to developing economies with a relatively abundant
supply of workers and thus lower wage costs. Greater
vertical specialization across economies, in turn, has
pushed the trough of the smile curve downwards – as
illustrated in figure 1.4.14
Note that vertical specialization may occur within and
across firms. In some cases, firms have offshored
manufacturing by setting up a subsidiary in a foreign
country. In other cases, they have outsourced and
offshored manufacturing to independent firms.
The precise shape of global value chains – the
number of firms involved and their relationship to
one another – differs substantially across industries.
Nonetheless, it is possible to distinguish between
different governance models of global value chains.
In particular, academic research has juxtaposed
buyer-driven chains with producer-driven chains.15
In buyer-driven chains, large retailers and branded
merchandisers lead value chains and set production
and quality standards that independent suppliers
need to meet. In supplier-driven chains, the lead
firms possess advanced technological capabilities
and are more vertically integrated, but draw on
independent suppliers for specialized inputs.

Gereffi et al. (2005) develop a more elaborate theory
of global value chain governance based on how lead
firms interact with other firms in the value chain. They
consider three dimensions of such interactions: the
complexity of information and knowledge transfer
required for transactions in the value chain; the extent
to which this information and knowledge can be
codified and hence efficiently transmitted; and the
capabilities of the firms in relation to the value chain
transaction. On the basis of these three dimensions,
they identify five types of value chain governance, as
presented in table 1.1.
At one end of the spectrum, market-based governance
models require little coordination between suppliers and buyers connected at a particular stage in
the value chain, and both sides can switch partners
relatively easily. As the complexity of transactions
increases, the ability to codify relevant information and
knowledge decreases and the capability of supplying firms diminishes, high levels of coordination are
required and partner switching becomes progressively
more difficult. At the limit, arm’s-length relationships
between firms connected at a value chain stage
become impossible and lead firms have to perform
supply chain tasks in-house.

1.3 – What return accrues
to intangible assets?
While appealing and intuitive, the concept of the smile
curve has its limitations. It may reasonably portray
the distribution of value added for some global value
chain lead firms, but it is more difficult to apply at the
economy-wide level where firms’ value chains intersect
and overlap.16 More importantly, it does not provide any
insight into what generates value added at different
production stages. In particular, higher value added does
not necessarily coincide with underlying activities being
more profitable, associated with better-paying jobs, or
generally “more desirable.” For example, higher valueadded activities may be highly capital-intensive, in which
case it is not clear that workers involved in them receive
higher wages compared to lower value-added activities.17
Similarly, value-added figures alone do not reveal how
much intangible capital contributes to global value chain
production – the focus of this report – as value added
reflects the return of all the inputs into production.
Indeed, understanding what precisely generates value
in global value chains requires analysis of how much
income accrues to labor, tangible capital and intangible capital used in global value chain production. In
research performed for this report, economists Wen
Chen, Reitze Gouma, Bart Los and Marcel Timmer
performed precisely such an analysis. Their approach
consisted of two steps.



GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS: THE FACE OF 21ST-CENTURY INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE

Box 1.1
Assembling and slicing up global value chains
There are no readily available macroeconomic data on global
value chain production. Some information is available in
national accounts and in trade statistics, but neither offer a
full picture. National accounts statistics provide information
on production value added, but are classified by industrial
activity. For example, value added in the motor vehicle industry
captures the manufacture of auto parts and components as
well as the final assembly of cars. But it does not capture
the upstream production of materials, the business services
supporting production or the downstream distribution of
cars to the end consumer. To complicate matters further,
many parts and components come from abroad – which is
precisely what makes value chains global. Trade statistics
offer information on imported intermediate goods, but are
classified by product and not industrial activity.
To assemble metrics of value added in global value chains,
Chen et al. (2017) built on previous research that has sought
to track the flow of products across industries and countries. Relying on concordances between industry and trade
statistics, they combined national input-output tables with
international trade data to construct a world input-output
table (WIOT). This contains data on 55 industries – of which
19 are manufacturing – in 43 economies plus one rest-ofthe-world region, which together represent more than 85
percent of world GDP. One can think of the WIOT as a large
matrix which breaks down the value added of each industry in
each country into either intermediate inputs flowing to other
industries (either at home or in another country) or finished
products for final consumption (again, either at home or in
another country).

First, they assembled macroeconomic data on valueadded shares in 19 manufacturing product groups
spanning 43 economies plus one rest-of-the-world
region which together captured around one-quarter of
global output. Their data allowed them to divide global
value chain production into three stages: distribution,
final assembly and all other stages. As an example,
the resulting database showed the value added of the
distribution stage in the sales price of cars for which
the final assembly took place in Germany.
As a second step, Chen et al. (2017) decomposed
value added at each stage and in each country into the
incomes accruing to labor, tangible capital and intangible capital – as illustrated in figure 1.6. They did so
by first subtracting labor income and imputed tangible
capital income from value added – relying on available
data on wages, employment, tangible capital asset
stocks and an assumed rate of return on tangible capital
of 4 percent. The remaining residual then represents
the income accruing to intangible capital.

One complicating factor concerns the measurement of value
added in the distribution stage. Input-output tables represent
the distribution sector as a so-called margin industry, which
means that the final products that wholesalers and retailers buy
are not treated as intermediate inputs. To arrive at a measure
of distribution value added, Chen et al. calculated a distribution margin as the ratio of the price paid by final consumers
(less product taxes) to the price received by producers, then
applied the resulting margin to a product’s total sales.
The next step was to slice up the assembled value-added
statistics according to the incomes accruing to the underlying
production factors. First, labor income was calculated for
each industry in each country, drawing on national labor force
surveys and additional data sources. Second, Chen et al.
estimated tangible capital income by applying a rental price
for such capital to national accounts data on capital stock,
again in each industry and each country. The rental price
consisted of an industry-specific depreciation rate plus an
assumed real rate of return of 4 percent. Importantly, Chen
et al. removed selected intangible capital assets – notably
R&D, computer software and databases, and artistic originals
– from capital stocks wherever those assets were covered
in national account statistics. Intangible capital income was
then calculated by subtracting labor income and tangible
capital income from value added.
Finally, using the industry-product flow relationships contained
in the WIOT and the factor decomposition of value added in
each industry and each country, it was possible to calculate
the contribution of labor, tangible capital and intangible capital
at the level of product global value chains.

The logic behind this approach is to recognize that
intangible capital is firm-specific and different from
other factor inputs, because companies cannot freely
order or hire it. In other words, intangible capital is
the “yeast” that creates value from labor and marketmediated investment in assets.18 Box 1.1 provides a
fuller overview of the analytical steps performed by
Chen et al.; their research paper offers more detailed
technical explanations.
The research by Chen et al. (2017) breaks new
ground in at least two respects. First, it offers for
the first time an estimate of the return to intangible
asset investments in global value chain production.
Notwithstanding promising efforts to quantify such
investments, their macroeconomic value has so far
largely eluded measurement.19 Second, it includes
the distribution stage in the analysis, which is important as global value chains with major retailers – for
example, Nike – will likely realize returns to their
intangibles at this stage. 20

Which product global value chains use intangibles
most intensively? Table 1.2 presents the factor
income shares in 2014 for the 19 manufacturing
product groups in descending order of their global
output size. For all product groups, intangible capital accounts for a higher share of value added than
tangible capital. The intangibles share is especially
high – and more than double the tangibles share – for
pharmaceutical, chemical and petroleum products.
It is also relatively high for food products as well as
computer, electronic and optical products. In terms of
absolute returns, the three largest product groups –
food products, motor vehicles and textiles – account
for close to 50 percent of the total income generated
by intangible capital in the 19 manufacturing global
value chains.

Turning to the research findings, figure 1.7 presents
the income shares accruing to the three production
factors for all manufacturing products from 2000 to
2014. The intangibles share averaged 30.4 percent
throughout this period, almost double the share for
tangibles. Interestingly, it rose from 27.8 percent in 2000
to 31.9 percent in 2007, but has stagnated since then.
Overall income from intangibles in the 19 manufacturing
industries increased by 75 percent from 2000 to 2014
in real terms. It amounted to 5.9 trillion United States
dollars (USD) in 2014.21
One interpretation of the rising share for intangibles
is that global manufacturing firms benefited from
increased opportunities for offshoring labor-intensive
activities to lower wage economies. Intuitively, in
competitive markets, wage cost savings will lower final
output prices; if capital costs remain the same, the
intangibles share must go up by virtue of its definition
as a residual – intangibles will constitute a larger share
of a smaller whole. However, this trend appears to have
peaked in 2007 – just before the global financial crisis.
This finding seems consistent with the stagnating
trade-to-GDP ratio shown in figure 1.2 and empirical
studies suggesting that vertical specialization may
have reached its limits.22
28

While the intangibles share increased for almost all
of the 19 product groups during the period 20002014, it did so more sharply for some than for others.
Figure 1.8 depicts the trend for four of the largest
product groups. As it shows, the intangibles share
increased only slightly for food and textile products,
but more substantially for motor vehicles and electronic products.

This may suggest that opportunities to offshore production of food and textiles were already largely realized,
whereas the latter industries could still take advantage
of such opportunities between 2000 and 2007.
At what stage of production does income accrue to
intangible capital? The global value chain decomposition suggests that distribution and the final production
stage each account for around a quarter of the intangibles income, and the other stages for the remaining
half.23 This division signifies the importance of intangibles in upstream activities – not only the production
of parts, components and materials, but also a wide
variety of business services as well as agriculture and
mining activities.
The contribution of different production stages to intangibles income varies greatly across product groups, as
shown in figure 1.9. Intuitively, the pattern that emerges
seems to correspond broadly to the distinction between
buyer-driven and producer-driven global value chains
introduced in section 1.2.

Buyer-driven global value chains such as textile, furniture and food products realize larger returns to intangibles at the distribution stage whereas producerdriven global value chains such as motor vehicles,
electronics and machinery realize those returns before
final production.
The findings by Chen et al. (2017) underscore the
importance of intangible assets in generating value in
global value chain production. However, they also leave
a number of questions open and come with several
methodological caveats. One unresolved question
is what precisely accounts for the income attributed
to intangibles. Under Chen et al.’s methodology, this
income captures all the firm-specific returns that go
beyond market-mediated returns to tangible capital
and labor. That clearly includes brand reputation and
image, technological edge and design appeal that sets
apart the products of one firm from those of another –
intangible assets for which firms seek different forms of
IP rights. It also includes organizational and managerial
know-how that may be protected by trade secrets.

However, it may also include other factors – beyond
reputational and knowledge assets – that generate large
economic returns. For example, the high intangibles
share for petroleum products (see table 1.2) is likely to
reflect the resource rents accruing to oil producers.24
Supply-side and demand-side economies of scale may
be other sources of market power that may not relate
directly to intangible assets.
A second unresolved question is which economies
harvest the returns from intangible capital. The question is obvious, but the answer is elusive. For one thing,
through transfer pricing and related practices, companies can easily shift profits from one location to another
(see box 1.2). Thus, an intangible asset may originate
in one economy, but most of its returns may show up
in another. More importantly, increasing cross-border
ownership and sharing of intangibles is undermining
the very notion of location-bound assets and earnings.
Finally, several caveats apply to the research by
Chen et al. (2017) that should be kept in mind in interpreting their findings:25
• The validity of the findings relies heavily on the quality
of the underlying data. While there has been important
statistical progress in measuring global production
networks, important measurement gaps remain.
30

For example, it is hard to capture international
trade in services adequately, and there are also
challenges in measuring value added in the
distribution stage. In addition, the use of international
input-output tables relies on relatively strong
assumptions, such as firms in a given industry and
country exhibiting similar production structures.
• As already mentioned, transfer mispricing and
related practices – in particular between related
parties – may distort the distribution of value
added along the global value chain (see box 1.2).
This could lead to biases in the income share
estimates by production stage, as shown in figure
1.9. However, to the extent that such practices
merely shift profits from one production stage to
another, they should not affect the estimates of
income shares involving all production stages,
as presented in figures 1.7 and 1.8 and table 1.2.
• The allocation of intangible capital to different
production stages – as shown in figure 1.9 – may
also be affected by how global value chain lead
firms are classified statistically. For example, if
“factory-free” goods producers are classified as
retailers or wholesalers, returns to intangible assets
will be recorded at the distribution stage; if they are
classified as manufacturers, these returns will be
recorded at one of the other production stages.

1.4 – How intangible assets
permeate global value chains
In light of the substantial value generated by intangible
assets, a key question is how firms holding such assets
manage them within their global production networks. A
related and equally important question is how firms not
holding intangible assets can acquire them. To address
these questions, it is helpful to distinguish between two
types of intangible assets:
• Knowledge assets cover technology and design as
well as organizational, logistical, managerial and
related know-how. A common characteristic of
knowledge assets is that they are non-rival in nature
and – in contrast to tangible assets – not necessarily
tied to any particular location. For example, the R&D
for a new car may occur in one location, but once
the car is developed its production can be spread
across a large number of locations.

• Reputational assets consist of the goodwill that
consumers extend to a company’s brand – partly
because of satisfaction derived from previous
brand purchases and partly because of the image
associated with different brands. Reputational
assets are rival in nature: brands only have reputational value if used in relation to a single product
or firm. In addition, while brands can sometimes
gain an international reputation, they generally do
not seamlessly flow across borders; companies
may possess strong reputational assets in some
markets, but not in others.26

Managing knowledge assets
In order to reap returns from investments in innovation,
firms must be able to appropriate their knowledge
assets. Ideally, they would want to capture the full
rewards from those assets without any knowledge
leaking to competitors.27

In practice, such “perfect appropriation” is typically
not possible. How high a return a firm will reap will
depend, among other things, on how it controls the
flow of its knowledge.
At the outset, when generating new knowledge, firms
face a well-known trade-off. On the one hand, they
have incentives to keep their innovations secret to
maintain their edge over competitors. Trade secrecy
laws protect confidential information from unauthorized disclosure, though competitors may still be able
to reverse-engineer products placed in the market.
On the other hand, firms may be able to take out IP
rights for their innovations, in which case they need
to disclose them but benefit from exclusivity – at least
for a limited time. Several factors will influence the
preferred knowledge management strategy. Certain
knowledge assets – such as process technology and
organizational know-how – can easily be kept secret,
whereas others – such as product design – cannot.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

Box 1.2
How transfer mispricing and related practices
distort global value chain measurement
National accounts and trade statistics seek to measure the real
economic activity taking place in different countries as well as
the real economic value of trade in goods and services taking
place between countries. However, they rely on self-reported
financial accounts and customs declarations by companies
that do not always reflect the true market value of underlying
economic transactions. An important source of measurement
bias stems from strategies that seek to shift taxable profits from
high-tax-rate to low-tax-rate jurisdictions. Intangibles – frequently
in the form of IP rights – are often at the core of these strategies.
One widely noted practice is transfer mispricing. An example
is shown in figure 1.10. Company A in a high-tax-rate country
sells its IP to its affiliate B in a low-tax-rate country; affiliate B
in turn licenses this IP to a related company, C, in another hightax-rate country. To the extent that this multinational company
(MNC) understates the price for the IP purchase and overstates
the royalties for the use of IP, it is able to shift profits from the
high-tax-rate jurisdictions to the low-tax-rate jurisdiction.
One key enabler of transfer mispricing is the difficulty of valuing
intangible assets. Transfer pricing rules in financial and tax
accounting frameworks have established the arm’s-length
standard, according to which transactions between related
companies under common control are to be priced at a value
similar to a comparable transaction with an unrelated third-party
company. However, intangible assets are company-specific,
and comparable third-party transactions typically do not
exist, so transfer prices can only be imputed or estimated. In
addition, the value of intangible assets can be highly uncertain, especially at an early stage when the resulting goods or
services have not yet been commercialized. This uncertainty
offers companies substantial leeway in setting IP sales prices
and royalty rates between affiliated entities.
From a statistical perspective, transfer mispricing as outlined
in figure 1.10 leads to an understatement of value added in the
high-tax-rate jurisdictions and its overstatement in the low-taxrate jurisdiction. In addition, it distorts trade statistics – the lowtax-rate country’s imports of IP services would be understated
and its exports of such services would be overstated.28

Profit-shifting may take other forms. Instead of transferring IP to a foreign affiliate, companies may also over- or
under-invoice IP-intensive intermediate inputs traded within
company supply chains and for which, again, there are no
market-based reference prices. Such practices imply similar
shifts in value added from one country to another, but the
trade distortion would show up in goods trade statistics rather
than those for services. Other related practices include the
“merchanting of services” through Special Purpose Entities,
and arrangements whereby MNCs establish a commercial
presence in a country but are not considered permanent
establishments for tax purposes and thus not included in a
country’s national trade statistics – as further discussed in
Neubig and Wunsch-Vincent (2017).
While reliable figures are hard to come by, it is clear that
tax minimization practices of MNCs lead to sizeable shifts
in reported profits across jurisdictions. At the micro level,
Seppälä et al. (2014) study the value chain of a Finnish MNC
for a single precision machinery product. On the basis of
invoice-level internal company data, they conclude that
the geographical distribution of profits does not necessarily represent where the MNC’s most valuable assets
are located. At the macro level, using survey data from the
United States (U.S.) Bureau of Economic Analysis, Rassier
(2017) estimates the extent of profit shifting among U.S.
MNCs; he finds that R&D-intensive firms are more inclined
to book profits to foreign affiliates than non-R&D-intensive
firms, underlining the important role played by intangible
assets in tax minimization practices. Drawing on a variety
of sources and making several assumptions, Neubig and
Wunsch-Vincent (2017) conservatively estimate that global
profit shifting associated with cross-border IP transactions
alone could amount to USD 120 billion annually, or 35 percent
of the reported total cross-border trade in IP services. Most
prominently, Ireland’s GDP registered a 26 percent increase
in 2015 which largely reflected the inflow of intangible and
other internationally mobile assets from MNCs locating their
headquarters in Ireland. 29

GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS: THE FACE OF 21ST-CENTURY INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE

Similarly, IP rights extend to certain knowledge assets –
technological inventions in the case of patents – but not
to others, for example many types of service innovations.
Knowledge assets can sometimes also take the form of
specialized workers’ skills. Retaining those skills is often
an important part of a company’s knowledge management strategy. Yet it is also constrained by law; there are
limits, for example, on how far non-compete clauses in
employment contracts can prevent workers from starting
their own business or leaving to competitors.30

As mentioned in section 1.2, knowledge management
considerations determine the organization of global
value chains – in particular, whether firms vertically
integrate different production tasks or whether they
outsource those tasks to independent suppliers.31
Outsourcing may generate substantial cost savings,
but it may also risk key knowledge assets leaking to
future competitors. Much depends on the relationships
governing global value chains, as outlined in table
1.1. Knowledge leakage is bound to be a concern in
relational and captive value chains, especially when
global value chain lead firms transfer tacit knowledge
to partner firms that might emerge as future competitors. For this reason, MNCs sometimes limit knowledge transfers to older technologies, leakage of which
would not pose an immediate competitive threat.32 At
the same time, secure IP rights can help companies
in transferring proprietary technologies within the
supply chain and actually facilitate the outsourcing
of different production tasks.
In yet other circumstances, firms may openly share
or license some of their knowledge assets, partly to
encourage adoption of new technologies and partly to
obtain access to technology owned by other firms. The
latter consideration has been important for so-called
complex technologies – defined as technologies that
consist of numerous separately patentable inventions
with possibly widespread patent ownership. Complex
technologies include most ICTs, which have seen
the fastest growth in patenting over the past three
decades. Through cross-licensing arrangements,
companies negotiate access to technologies they
require to commercialize their own innovations.33
In most circumstances, IP protection is a crucial element
of a firm’s knowledge management strategy. One study
for the UK economy, for example, found that slightly more
than one-half of investments in intangible assets were
in assets protected by different IP rights.34

However, deciding for which knowledge asset to seek
IP rights, and in which countries, requires careful planning. Obtaining patent rights in particular is costly,
especially when pursued in many countries. For this
reason, companies often limit their patent coverage to
countries hosting the largest economies and countries
in which global value chain production takes place.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

This explains why the world’s five largest recipients of
patent filings from abroad – the national patent offices
of China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United
States as well as the European Patent Office – account
for close to 70 percent of the world total in non-resident
patent filings (see figure 1.11).35 Other than China, relatively
few patents flow to low- and middle-income economies.
Notwithstanding these general observations, the knowledge management strategies of firms depend crucially
on the nature of their knowledge assets and their business models, which differ widely from industry to industry. The case studies presented in chapters 2 to 4 offer
more concrete perspectives on prevailing strategies – at
least for the global value chains under consideration.

Managing reputational assets
Like knowledge assets, reputational assets can play
an important role in shaping the organization of global
value chains. Outsourcing parts of the production
process risks losing control over the quality of parts
and components. Defective or underperforming inputs
might expose a lead firm to substantial reputational
risks – especially when discovered after products
have been placed in the market. Similarly, consumer
perceptions of a lead firm might be influenced by how
its suppliers treat their workers and protect the environment. These considerations favor either outright
vertical integration or, at least, far-reaching intervention by lead firms in the business operations of their
suppliers. Product standardization and independent
supplier certification are additional mechanisms that
help firms to lower reputational risks arising in globally
fragmented supply chains.
The principal IP instruments protecting reputational
assets are trademarks and geographical indications
(GIs). While acquiring trademark rights is relatively
cheap, managing a global portfolio of trademarks
also requires careful planning and strategic decisionmaking. To begin with, trademarks may not only cover
product names, but also two- and three-dimensional
shapes, sounds, colors and other features associated
with them. In contrast to patents, which companies
mostly protect in countries where global value chain
production takes place, companies have strong reasons
to protect at least their main trademarks in all the
markets in which they are or plan to be active. Uncertain
trademark ownership can prove costly, especially once
new products have been commercialized.

34

For this reason, the global trademark portfolios of
large multinational enterprises often consist of tens
of thousands of trademarks. In addition, the distribution of non-resident trademark filings is less concentrated compared to patents: the five largest offices
– the national trademark offices of Canada, China, the
Russian Federation and the U.S. as well as the European
Union Intellectual Property Office – account for less
than 30 percent of the world total (see figure 1.11).

Catch-up and industrial development
As pointed out in the introduction to this chapter, the
growth of global value chains has coincided with both
rapid industrial development in certain low- and middleincome economies and the integration of these economies into the global economy. Above all, China has been
at the forefront of this transformation, with its economy
often referred to as “the world’s factory,” but a number
of other economies in Asia, Eastern Europe and other
parts of the world have also seen far-reaching industrial development through participation in global value
chains. The causal relationship between these developments is not clear-cut, however. Has global value
chain participation spurred industrial development in
a way that would not have been possible otherwise, or
did the successful economies just happen to have the
right preconditions for industrial development which
prompted their participation in global value chains?
Most likely, the answer lies somewhere in the middle.
Global value chains arguably embraced those economies offering the most conducive environments –
including competitive access to capital and labor,
needed skills, reliable infrastructure and fast-growing
markets. At the same time, the transfer of production
capacity to those economies likely offered opportunities for industrial upgrading that otherwise might not
have come about. One critical question in this context
is how firms in successfully industrializing economies
were able to “catch up” and acquire the knowledge
and reputational assets that enabled their global value
chain participation.
Economic research has long analyzed how knowledge
assets diffuse to catch-up economies. In particular, it
has distinguished among four main diffusion channels:36
• Firms in catch-up economies acquire knowledge through reverse engineering products
and technologies available in the marketplace.



GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS: THE FACE OF 21ST-CENTURY INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE

This form of knowledge diffusion may be seen
as the reverse side of the imperfect appropriability of knowledge assets by lead firms, as
discussed above. IP rights may limit the use of
reverse-engineered technologies by catch-up
firms – at least insofar as they are protected in
a given jurisdiction. At the same time, publicly
available patent records offer a rich source of
technological knowledge that catch-up firms
can and do employ in their own R&D activities.37
• Partnerships between global value chain lead
firms and catch-up firms can entail the transfer
of knowledge from the former to the latter. Such
partnership may take the form of technology
licensing contracts, which – in addition to licensing patented knowledge – often entail the transfer
of relevant non-codified knowledge. Instead of
licensing their technology to independent firms,
global value chain lead firms may insist on taking
an equity stake in the knowledge-acquiring firm,
leading to joint venture arrangements. At the limit,
they may only be willing to transfer knowledge to
a catch-up economy by establishing a whollyowned subsidiary. A key question involving this
diffusion channel is whether acquisition of the
knowledge asset is limited to the local partner
firm or whether it diffuses beyond that firm, for
example through customer and supplier linkages or skilled worker movements (see below).
• Firms in catch-up economies can gain access
to knowledge assets by importing capital goods
which embed technological knowledge. In particular, the import of production equipment can
allow catch-up firms to upgrade their manufacturing capabilities to the state-of-the-art. Foreign
sellers of such equipment may also train local
workers to use and maintain it – building up an
important complementary knowledge base.
• Finally, to the extent that knowledge assets take the
form of human skills, the movement of skilled workers
represents an important channel through which
knowledge diffuses from one firm to another.
Skilled workers may move from foreign global
value chain lead firms to catch-up firms, or they
may start their own firm. Equally important, they
may move from locally established foreign subsidiaries to local firms, thereby helping to diffuse
knowledge throughout the catch-up economy.

Public policies in relation to trade, investment, migration
and IP have a bearing on diffusion outcomes, although
the effects are not always clear-cut. For example,
restricting trade may inhibit diffusion through importing technology-intensive capital goods, but could also
promote diffusion by encouraging foreign investment.
Whatever the diffusion channel, successful technology diffusion relies critically on the absorptive
capacity of catch-up economies to understand and
apply foreign-grown knowledge. Effective absorptive
capacity relies on human capital able to understand
and apply technology, organizational and managerial know-how, and institutions that coordinate and
mobilize resources for technology adoption. In many
cases, absorptive capacity also entails the ability to
undertake incremental technological and organizational innovation in order to adapt technology to local
needs. Some countries have been more successful at
creating absorptive capacity than others. In particular, economists have argued that at least part of the
success of the fast-growing East Asian countries lay
in their ability to ignite a process of technological
learning and absorption that provided the basis for
economic catch-up.38
Economists have paid less attention to how firms
in catch-up economies can acquire reputational
assets. In addition to building product portfolios of
high and consistent quality, it is clear that strong
brand reputation and image require substantial
and often market-specific investments in advertising. Inducing consumers to switch brands may be
especially challenging in mature industries with
long-established competing brands. Firms’ branding strategies often evolve in line with their growing
manufacturing capabilities. For example, companies
in Japan, the Republic of Korea and more recently
China at one time pursued a low-cost and low-price
strategy; over time, they were able to raise prices and
quality, thus moving from largely generic products
into premium brands. Other companies, including
companies in the ICT industry, have made a name
as providers of certain components, or as assembly
and contract manufacturers – for example, Asus, Acer
and Foxconn; alternatively, they may have focused
on business customers before entering the endconsumer markets with a more established brand,
such as in the case of Huawei. Yet other companies
have bought established brands from companies in
high-income economies.39

35

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

Again, the opportunities and challenges for industrial
catch-up vary markedly from industry to industry and
the case studies presented in chapters 2 to 4 offer at
least selective perspectives on what has contributed to
catch-up in the global value chains under consideration.

1.5 – Concluding reflections
Global value chains have emerged as the 21st-century
face of international commerce. They have tied together national economies as never before and have
helped integrate numerous developing countries into
the global economy. How will they further evolve, and
what role is there for policy to ensure that they support
economic growth and rising living standards around
the world? Drawing on this chapter’s discussion,
this final section seeks to offer some policy-oriented
reflections on these two questions.

The future of global value chains
As described in section 1.1, the world’s trade-to-GDP
ratio has more than doubled over the past 50 years,
but it has not seen any growth since the global financial crisis unfolded in 2008. This may well reflect the
persistent shortfall in aggregate demand to which many
economists attribute the weak recovery from the crisis.40
Indeed, preliminary data for 2017 suggest trade growth is
again outpacing global output growth.41 At the same time,
several studies suggest that the stagnating trade-to-GDP
ratio may well have structural foundations and that vertical specialization may have reached a natural limit (see
sections 1.1 and 1.3). There is also some evidence that
the scope for further improvements in transport technology to increase trade may be exhausted.42
Should policymakers worry about the trade “slowdown”
having structural foundations? At one level, yes. Greater
vertical specialization in the world economy may not
provide the same growth impetus in the future as it has
throughout the second globalization wave. At the same
time, technological and business innovations as well as
shifting consumer preferences will continue to transform
global production. Most prominently, developments in
3D printing, robotics and automated manufacturing
have already reconfigured supply chains in a number of
industries, and further progress in these areas may well
unleash more profound change. These developments
may well lead to the “re-shoring” of certain production
tasks. Such an outcome would imply less cross-border
trade in intermediate goods. However, the deployment
of such technologies could help spur economic growth.
36

A declining trade-to-output ratio in this case would be
a sign of progress, rather than a source of concern.
Another key factor shaping global value chains is the
upgrading of production capabilities in catch-up economies. Chiefly, evidence suggests that Chinese firms
increasingly source parts and components domestically,
rather than importing them from abroad.43 This development similarly reduces reliance on cross-border trade
and may well have contributed to the world’s stagnating
trade-to-GDP ratio. However, upgraded production
capabilities should again ultimately enhance growth.44
Whatever their causes, shifts in global value chains
disrupt prevailing patterns of production – and this
should arguably be the chief concern of policymakers.
Production tasks offshored abroad may lead affected
workers to lose their jobs. More generally, evidence
suggests that greater vertical specialization has put
pressure on unskilled labor in high-income economies and contributed to rising income inequality. One
prominent study, for example, estimates that import
competition explains one-quarter of the decline in
U.S. manufacturing employment between 1990 and
2007.45 One important question in this context is how
the growing role of intangible capital in global value
chain production affects the compensation of workers
at different skills levels. One hypothesis is that the growing role of intangibles has been especially beneficial
for the most talented workers – so-called superstars.46
However, there is no systematic evidence supporting
this hypothesis.
How should policymakers respond to the disruption
brought about by shifting global value chains? Trade
protection is not the answer. As discussed in section
1.1, progressive trade liberalization has been one of
the factors enabling the growth of global value chains.
As global value chain formation is highly sensitive to
underlying trade cost, reversing open markets could
be highly disruptive in and of itself. In addition, it would
not re-establish old production patterns, as today’s
production technology has evolved greatly. Instead,
economists generally advocate providing a social safety
net that cushions the adverse effects of unemployment
and instituting measures that facilitate the retraining of
affected workers. Indeed, policies aimed at addressing disruption arising from global value chain shifts
are, in principle, no different from policies that seek to
address disruption naturally arising in any economy
that undergoes structural transformation as part of the
economic growth process.



GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS: THE FACE OF 21ST-CENTURY INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE

Upgrading global value chain capabilities
For policymakers in low- and middle-income economies,
a key question is how they can support the upgrading of
global value chain production capabilities by local firms.
This question is sometimes phrased in terms of “moving
up the value chain” or “capturing more value from global
value chain participation.” However, such value-oriented
perspectives can be misleading. As pointed out in
section 1.3, value added may not be the right metric to
evaluate the profitability or rewards accruing to capital
and labor from global value chain participation. In addition, the notion of “value capture” may suggest that
global value chain participation is “zero sum”, generating
large profits for some participants – presumably lead
firms – at the expense of others. However, while differences in bargaining power may well affect the vertical
distribution of profits, global value chain income largely
accrues to the capital and labor employed in global value
chain production. The returns to capital and labor, in turn,
depend on economies’ endowment with these production factors and how productively they are employed.
Indeed, the question of how to upgrade global value
chain capability is in principle no different from the
more general question of how to spur industrial development. Thus, policy prescriptions that economists
have formulated to promote industrial growth also
apply to global value chain upgrading. These include,
notably, building up institutions that promote technological learning and a growing absorptive capacity, as
described in section 1.4. Nonetheless, the growth of
global value chains raises some special considerations
for both industrial and trade policy.

At this analytical stage, it is also useful to ask what role
different forms of IP can play in supporting opportunities for global value chain upgrading.
As for trade policy, opportunities for successful global value chain participation rely, of course, on open
markets that allow companies to seamlessly import
intermediate inputs and export processed goods.
Equally important, they rely on deeper integration
measures that facilitate the conduct of business along
the supply chain. Such deeper integration measures
include promoting the compatibility of regulatory
measures, harmonizing product and technology standards and opening markets for business services
supporting global value chain production. In the area
of IP, for example, businesses face considerable costs
in protecting their different IP rights across a large
number of jurisdictions. Cooperation initiatives – such
as the WIPO filing systems for patents, trademarks and
industrial designs – help IP users lower these costs,
while leaving the final decision on whether to grant an
IP right to participating member states.
As a final note, successful global value chain upgrading
in all likelihood does not entail a zero-sum game among
national economies. While it may lead to the displacement of some global value chain participants – and can
thus create disruption, as pointed out above – it is inherently a dynamic phenomenon. Technological change
and new product cycles invariably prompt continuous
reconfigurations of global value chains that create entry
opportunities for some firms and may force the exit
of others. In addition, successful global value chain
upgrading generates economic growth that enlarges
the market for global value chain outputs as a whole.

As to the former, industrial policy strategies have seen
much evolution over the past decades – both in practice
and in academic thinking.47 Yet, if there is one evolving
consensus, it is that governments have an important
role to play in identifying pre-existing industrial capabilities – often at the level of sub-regions – and leveraging them by removing constraints on entrepreneurial
activity and appropriately targeting complementary
public investments.48 Depending on the industry in
question, it may be important to adopt a global value
chain perspective when analyzing the opportunities
and challenges faced by local entrepreneurs. Such a
perspective may be relevant, for example, in identifying
niche capabilities that could be further developed for
new or upgraded global value chain participation, or in
monitoring trends in end-consumer markets around the
world that create opportunities for local firms.

Coffee: how consumer choices are
reshaping the global value chain
Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages
in the world; nearly 35,000 cups are drunk every second
on any given day.1 In the United States – the biggest
market in terms of size and value – three-quarters of
the population drinks coffee.2
As a commodity, coffee is produced in the Global South
but mainly consumed in the Global North. Around 70
percent of the demand for it comes from high-income
countries. These countries tend to be located in the
northern hemisphere and are referred to as the coffeeimporting countries. The coffee-producing countries,
on the other hand, lie in the southern hemisphere and
fall within the low- to middle-income brackets.
Coffee is one of the most important traded agricultural
commodities, especially for producing countries. It is the
income source for nearly 26 million farmers in over 50
developing economies.3 For seven countries in particular,
coffee exports account for more than 10 percent of total
export earnings over the past three decades.4 While the
importance of coffee exports for countries’ incomes has
been decreasing over time, upgrading their participation
in the global coffee value chain can contribute to their
economic development, especially in combating poverty.
The popularity of coffee is growing. More and more
countries outside the traditional coffee-importing
countries such as Japan and those in Europe are
increasing their coffee consumption levels. The
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the
International Coffee Organization (ICO) separately
estimate that the growth in consumption is faster in
less developed economies.5 In addition, new coffee
products and services are attracting more consumers
to drink coffee by varying how, what, when and where
coffee products are consumed.
Studying the global value chain for coffee offers important insights into how poorer economies that rely on
agricultural commodities may upgrade their value
chain activities to benefit from international trade.
Traditionally, the coffee global value chain has been
dominated by market/buyer-driven governance, with
most value generated by downstream participants.
However, recent developments in a newer coffee
market segment offer opportunities for upstream coffee
producers to enhance their value chain participation.
One way for coffee participants to capture higher value
added along the coffee global value chain is investing
and owning intangible assets.

This chapter looks at the role of intangible assets in
the coffee global value chain. It starts by describing
how the chain has evolved over the decades, underlining the importance of coffee consumers in driving
today’s global value chain. Section 2.2 then focuses on
the role of intangible assets in the global value chain,
paying particular attention to how the distribution of
value added is influenced by these assets. Section 2.3
takes a closer look at how intangible assets have been
used in upgrading activities along the value chain, and
discusses how technology flows between different
participants in the chain.

2.1 – The changing nature
of the coffee value chain
2.1.1 – From coffee cherries on
a tree to the coffee in a mug – an
international value chain
As for most traded commodities, the coffee supply
chain resembles a snake. It begins with the farmer who
chooses the coffee tree variety, and farms and harvests
the coffee cherries. The mature coffee cherries then
undergo different post-harvesting processes to yield
green coffee. Depending on the market structures in
place in the different coffee-producing countries, postharvesting processes may take place at the farm site,
in a cooperative, at a wet or dry mill owned by local
traders, or even at a mill owned by exporters.
The exporters or cooperatives then select the green
coffees by their density, size and color, and pack them
according to specific definitions and standards set by
coffee importers or industrial users such as roasters
and soluble coffee producers.
Green coffees arriving in bulk in coffee-importing
countries are stored in warehouses. The importers
may mix and blend different green coffees from various
countries in response to requests from buyers. They
then sell these blends or the green coffee shipments
to roasters or soluble coffee manufacturers.
The roasters or soluble coffee manufacturers may
also blend the green coffee according to their needs.
They then roast the green coffee using their own roasting recipes and protocols to obtain particular flavor
profiles adapted to the regional taste preferences of
their customers.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

Box 2.1
Trading coffee is risky
Coffee prices are highly volatile because coffee yield is
sensitive to weather conditions and outbreaks of disease.6
This wide price fluctuation makes coffee transactions risky
for both buyers and sellers. In order to mitigate this risk,
the futures market is used as a reference for most green
coffee transactions.
The buyers – importers, roasters and soluble coffee producers – enter into a standard commercial contract with the
sellers – coffee farmers, exporters or importers – using price
benchmarks set by the international exchange platforms in
New York for Arabica coffee and London for Robusta coffee.7
These prices are usually defined in the contract on a priceto-be-fixed basis, with a given quality of coffee specified, to
be delivered at a specific delivery location within a specified
time frame. An agreed differential is established and is later
combined with the price of green coffee as fixed at different
intervals by the buyer and seller at the stipulated futures
delivery month.8

The absolute price received by the seller can be significantly
different from the price paid by the buyers because final future
prices are usually decided at separate times.
Certain key participants help to reduce the risk in coffee
trading. In particular, importers and trading houses play an
important role in facilitating coffee trade by taking on some
of the transaction risk. For example, the buyer-seller contract
will specify that acceptance of the coffee products on arrival
is “subject to approval of sample.” If the buyer rejects the
coffee shipment because the product fails to meet the quality
standard or a specific technical standard, the seller will need
to take possession of the coffee at the destination.
Coffee farmers and/or exporters based in coffee-producing
countries are usually unable to address or absorb this extra
cost and additional risk. Instead, intermediaries will be in a
better position to find a different buyer for the shipment, while
also finding an alternative solution for the original buyer who
has rejected it.

Roasted coffee beans

Downstream of supply chain

COFFEE: HOW CONSUMER CHOICES ARE RESHAPING THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN

Figure 2.1 shows the coffee supply chain. It is international in two main respects. First, as noted above,
most coffee is consumed in rich importing countries
such as the United States, Germany, Japan, France
and Italy. While coffee-producing countries have also
increasingly consumed coffee in recent decades, their
levels of consumption are still significantly below those
of their richer counterparts.9
Second, the short shelf life of roasted coffee beans
necessitates that most of the roasting is done close
to where it is consumed. Packaging and distribution
technologies were not adequate to preserve the quality and taste of roasted coffee beans until recently.
This slow technological development made it difficult
for roasters in coffee-producing countries to export
their roasted coffees worldwide. Therefore, coffeeproducing countries tend to export green coffee – as
an intermediate good in the value chain – and blending
and roasting tends to take place in importing countries.

2.1.2 – Putting consumers first – how
new forms of demand are changing
the global value chain
The coffee global value chain is traditionally characterized as being buyer-driven, with roasters, large
retailers and branded merchandisers capturing most
of the value. These downstream participants are
also the ones who set the production and quality
standards for the rest of the industry.
However, this market-based governance is slowly changing. Two new market segments of coffee
consumption are shifting the perception of coffee
consumption from coffee-as-a-product to a coffeeplus-social-content product and service. Drinking
coffee has become more social, and coffee consumers have become more discerning.
These new market segments provide opportunities
for different participants to upgrade their role along
the chain.
Demand for coffee is segmented into three market
categories: conventional, differentiated and experiential. These segments are also referred to as the
first, second and third waves, respectively. They
differ according to target consumers, product offerings and prices.

The first wave – a “conventional”
market segment
The first wave market segment accounts for the
largest share of coffee consumption in terms of
both volume and market value. Samper et al. (2017)
estimate that it constitutes 65 to 80 percent of total
coffee consumption, and USD 90 billion or 45 percent
of the total value of the global coffee market.10
The target consumers for this segment mainly drink
their coffee at home. Consumption is typified by
daily need-for-energy coffee drinking and reasonably
priced products which consumers can purchase
easily at any large retail chain or small grocery store.
The products – in the form of packaged roasted
coffee beans, soluble coffee and, more recently,
single-serving capsules – are standardized, but there
may be significant differences with regard to taste to
reflect regional preferences. The differences between
competing products can be reduced to the quality
of the coffee blend in relation to its price.
Until a few decades ago, the quality of most coffee
beans used in these products ranged from low to
mediocre, but that emphasis on lower-grade coffee
beans is shifting as large roasters such as JAB and
Nestlé have introduced new products to cater to more
sophisticated consumers. These products include
single-serving capsules from single-sourced origins
or blends of higher-grade coffee beans.
Governance of the coffee global value chain in this
market segment is market driven. The coffee buyers
– importers, roasters and soluble coffee manufacturers – purchase their green coffee based on cost
considerations. If prices of Arabica beans are higher
than those of Robusta beans, buyers may decide to
purchase more Robusta beans and process them
to attain specific standards. In addition, the origin
of the green coffee has not been a significant selling factor in this segment. Importers, roasters and
soluble coffee manufacturers will source coffee
beans from many different places as long as their
quality standard is met.
Participants in the coffee value chain take on risks
when trading green coffee on the open market.
Coffee prices tend to fluctuate significantly over
time, and so contracts in the futures market are used
(see box 2.1).
45

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

The second wave – a “differentiated”
market segment
The second wave market segment targets consumers who prefer to consume coffee in a social setting.
In this segment, consumers are able to appreciate
a wide range of espresso-based beverages in a
comfortable and convenient location.
Coffee products in the second wave range from the
typical Italian espresso to more elaborate concoctions of coffee plus foamed milk. These beverages
are prepared according to specific standard techniques by experienced servers, or baristas. In addition, importance is attached to the social element
of consuming coffee; most coffee shops in this
market segment offer a distinct ambiance to attract
their customers.
The quality of the coffee beans used tends to be
higher than those in the first wave. Over the last
couple of decades, specialty coffee shops have been
appealing to ethically aware consumers by offering
drinks made from sustainably farmed beans whose
farmers have been appropriately rewarded.
As with the first wave, governance of the global
value chain for the second wave is market-based.
However, the increased consumer interest in where
the coffee beans are sourced, how they are farmed
and whether the farmers receive fair wages offers
differentiation opportunities to participants, enabling
them to upgrade their activities along the value chain.
Voluntary sustainability standards (VSSs) contribute
to the image of specialty coffee shops, reinforcing
the impression of social responsibility and perceived
value, and distinguishing coffee in the second wave
from first wave brands.

The third wave – an “experiential”
market segment
The third wave market segment targets consumers
with discerning coffee tastes, and is priced accordingly. Consumers in this market are willing to pay
premium prices for their coffee. In exchange, they
want to know where their coffee beans are sourced,
how they have been farmed and how best to brew
the beans in order to fully appreciate the flavor, body,
aroma, fragrance and mouthfeel of the coffee.

46

The coffee products in this segment include the story
behind the farming of the coffee beans as well as their
roasting recipes and beverage preparation techniques.
The emphasis is akin to the wine industry’s flavor profile,
which valorizes the terroir, grape variety and craftsmanship involved in producing a wine.
The quality of the coffee beans tends to be superior
to the other two market segments. Producers in this
market focus on premium-grade coffee portfolios, with
different blending and roasting techniques tailored to
the beans. Baristas have deep product knowledge of
the coffee beans, and may even have played a role in
cultivating the coffee plants.
Governance of the third wave global value chain is
known to be relational. The emphasis on direct connection to the coffee farmers has led to a shortened value
chain (compare the traditional chains in black with the
newer chains in blue in figure 2.1). In this segment,
cooperation between farmers and baristas has often led
to product innovation, including new ways of preparing
coffee beverages.
In comparison to the first two waves, consumption
in this segment is still low relative to the market as a
whole, but it is growing fast.

2.2 – Intangible assets
and value added
Ownership of intangible assets plays an important role
in the coffee global value chain and helps explain how
income is distributed along the coffee global value chain.
Formal intangible assets such as technology, designs
and brands are important in helping participants in the
chain appropriate returns to their innovation investments. These intangible assets are usually protected by
formal intellectual property (IP) rights such as patents,
utility models, industrial designs, trademarks, copyrights
and trade secrets.
Informal intangible assets are also crucial in helping
participants gain a higher share of income. For example,
the baristas’ craftsmanship and know-how in blending
and roasting particular coffee beans account for significant value added in the third wave market segment.
Moreover, access to distribution channels in coffeeimporting countries is crucial in ensuring that coffee
products are seen by potential consumers.

2.2.1 – Drinking versus growing coffee:
an uneven income distribution
A significant share of the value added to coffee along
its production chain is added close to where the coffee
is consumed. Five factors account for this pattern.
First, roasted coffee beans lose their flavor and aroma
quickly, so most beans are exported as green beans
in order to preserve their quality.
Coffee is also exported as soluble coffee. However,
soluble coffee production is capital-intensive, which
may pose a barrier to entry in some coffee-producing
countries. And while these countries are increasingly
exporting coffee in soluble form, the unit value they get
is less than that of coffee-importing countries.11

One reason for this discrepancy in trade value is
likely due to branding capabilities and access to
distribution channels.12
Second, different continents and regions show distinctive preferences for the types of coffee beans used –
blends of Arabica and Robusta coffee beans, or single
origin – and even the degree of coffee bean roast. For
example, Northern European countries prefer their
coffee blends to consist of lighter roasted Arabica
beans, while their Southern counterparts prefer darker
roasts of coffee blends that include Robusta beans.13
Roasters and soluble coffee manufacturers located
close to consumers tend to be better placed than their
competitors in coffee-producing countries to tailor the
blend and roast to regional preferences.

47

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

In addition to tailoring blends and roasting degrees to
specific regional preferences, large roasters locate their
roasting facilities so as to benefit from economies of
scale. For example, a roasting facility in Germany may
roast and blend coffee for several European brands,
reducing its costs and increasing its production levels.
Third, industrial policies implemented in coffeeimporting countries tend to favor the importation of
unprocessed, mainly green, coffee beans over roasted
and processed (soluble) coffee. This trade restriction
in the form of tariff escalation inflates the cost of any
roasted or even processed coffee exported by coffeeproducing countries.
However, it is worth noting that for many coffeeimporting countries – particularly the more developed
economies – tariffs on coffee have been steadily reduced through various bilateral, regional and
multilateral trade agreements. And today, while tariff
escalation remains an issue, tariffs on roast and
processed coffee tend to be low in the European
Union and the United States; by contrast, India and
Ghana have duties on soluble coffee of 35 and 20
percent respectively.14
Moreover, a study conducted by ICO (2011) shows that
this tariff escalation is likely to have a higher impact
on coffee consumers residing in less developed countries than their developed counterparts. In particular,
consumers in developed countries will continue to
purchase coffee even when the price of coffee beverage increases. This implies that coffee consumers in
these countries will continue to consume their favorite
imported coffee even if there is an increase in tariffequivalent tax imposed on those imports.
There are also regulatory measures affecting the
import of roasted and processed coffee from coffeeproducing countries, such as sanitary and phytosanitary
measures, which are not trade restrictions per se but
may entail higher compliance costs for firms in coffeeproducing countries.
Fourth, most product and process innovations related to
processing coffee were developed in coffee-importing
countries. Many apparatuses were invented and introduced on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean to maximize
the taste and flavor of coffee by roasting, grinding and
even percolating the coffee beans.15

48

Soluble coffee manufacturing, which involves more
processing than coffee roasting, was arguably
invented during the U.S. Civil War so that soldiers
could easily drink caffeinated beverages.16 However,
Nestlé, with its patented technology for producing
powdered soluble milk, was able to improve on the
taste of soluble coffee, and so dominate the soluble
coffee market.17
Ownership of coffee-related patented technologies
has been useful in helping launch new coffee products and services. The patents and industrial designs
owned by Nespresso on its coffee machines and
capsules helped cement Nestlé’s strong presence in
catering to coffee consumers in the first wave market
segment. Most of these patents have now expired,
but both Nestlé and Nespresso continue to be strong
brand names in the coffee market.
And lastly, branding is an important investment to build
consumers’ trust and gain market share in the relatively saturated coffee market. Research has shown
that branded products can command higher prices
than their generic counterparts.18 Many roasters and
soluble coffee producers and retailers invest heavily in
this intangible asset, to differentiate themselves from
their competitors and gain goodwill. Both Nescafé and
Starbucks are well-recognized trademarked names,
popular with coffee consumers worldwide.
Coffee-producing countries are slowly adopting IP
protection to capitalize on their intangible assets.
While many of the latest advances in coffee-related
patentable technologies still take place in coffeeimporting countries (see part 2.2.3 below), some
coffee-producing countries are also developing
their own coffee-processing capacities. Brazil, for
example, has been producing roasted and soluble
coffee to rival roasters and soluble manufacturers in
more developed economies.
These countries are also pursuing branding more
actively as a way to differentiate their coffees from
others. For example, a few countries have been
investing in protecting their coffee beans through
geographical indications (GIs) and trademarks. Coffee
beans originating from Jamaica (Blue Mountain) and
Colombia (Milds) have fetched premium prices.19

COFFEE: HOW CONSUMER CHOICES ARE RESHAPING THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN

However, ownership of these formal intangible assets
is not enough to achieve the same level of access
to consumers in more developed economies. The
buyer-driven nature of the value chain, in addition
to the difficulty of accessing distribution channels
in the importing countries, makes it challenging
for upstream coffee producers to compete in the
downstream coffee market. But this rigid governance
structure is slowly changing with the rise of the third
wave market segment.

2.2.2 – How coffee participants’
income varies according to
the activity performed
Participants’ income is distributed according to the
activity they perform in the coffee value chain. As
mentioned in chapter 1, this value added by different activities is a function of the capital and labor
costs at the different steps of the chain. In particular,
intangible capital plays a crucial role in explaining the
value added along the chain.
The consumption traits characterized by the three
coffee market segments affect the contribution of
each participant. In some cases, the emphasis of
the market segment creates new opportunities for
participants, giving them a way to increase the value
added of their activity. For example, their role as intermediaries between coffee farmers and buyers means
importers and exporters can play an additional role
as agents promoting the supply and certification of
VSS coffees in the second wave.
In the third wave, by contrast, the direct link between
farmers and independent coffee retailers eliminates the
need for intermediaries and shortens the supply chain.
Participation in the different market segments also
affects participants’ ability to upgrade their activities
and gain higher remuneration, especially those in the
second and third waves. Table 2.2 provides a simplified overview of participants’ roles and the related
intangible assets. It relates back to figure 2.1 in showing how roles and links between participants have
changed in the newer market segments. For example,
direct trade between the farmers and independent
retailers (in blue in figure 2.1), emphasizes the new
intangible assets that farmers are now able to use to
their advantage (marked with an asterisk in table 2.2).

Intense competition in the first wave
As noted above, the first wave market segment
accounts for the largest share of the world’s coffee
consumption in terms of both volume and value.
The sheer volume of coffee products sold in this
market segment gives the downstream value chain
participants – roasters, soluble coffee producers and
retailers – significant power over the other participants in the supply chain. Cost-saving measures
obtained along the chain are usually absorbed by
these producers.
This market segment is a prime example of a buyerdriven global value chain.
However, competition between coffee producers in
this market segment is high. This has led to significant consolidation of brands in the last few decades.
Seven companies account for nearly 40 percent of
coffee sold by retail grocers. They include international brands such as Jacobs Kronung (Germany),
Maxwell House (United States), and Nescafé
(Switzerland). These brands compete side-by-side
with grocery store private brands for market share.
Due to the intense competition, the main consideration for downstream participants is to keep costs
low while maintaining standards that consumers
have come to know. Any slight change in price may
induce consumers to switch to a different brand.
Figure 2.2 illustrates the distribution of income
between coffee-importing and coffee-exporting
countries in the grocery retail market for the period
1965-2013.20 Since 1986, roasters and soluble coffee
manufacturers in coffee-importing countries (in light
blue in the figure) have gained a higher share of
the total income in the market than participants in
coffee-producing countries (in dark blue). In addition,
the figure shows how coffee-producing countries’
income moves in tandem with global coffee prices,
as captured by the ICO composite price index. There
has been a particularly close link between the two
since 1989, when the International Coffee Agreement
(ICA) quota restriction was abandoned (see box 2.2).

INCOME AT PRODUCING COUNTRIES
ICO INDICATOR PRICE

Source: Samper et al. (2017) based on data collected from the FAO and ICO.
Note: Retail prices of grocery sales attributed to coffee-importing countries are based on USD per pound of roasted coffee, while incomes in
coffee-producing countries and import prices are USD per pound of green coffee free-on-board (FOB). The weight loss refers to the hulling, drying,
export preparation and roasting of green coffee. The ICO indicator price is a benchmark price for green coffee of all major origins and types. The ICA
quota regime was generally in force from 1962 to 1989, but was temporarily abandoned because of high coffee prices during the period 1975-1977.

The high degree of competition in the first wave market
segment implies that the profit margin upstream – from
farmers to exporters in coffee-producing countries,
and in certain cases to importers in coffee-importing
countries – will tend to be small.21

Daviron and Ponte (2005) argue that the roasting, blending, grinding and vacuum packaging processes along
the coffee value chain are relatively low-tech and make
up a small share of downstream participants’ margins.
Rather, it is the investments they make to differentiate
their coffee products, particularly through branding,
that generate a significant share of the high value added
in coffee-importing countries.22

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

Box 2.2
The ICA quota restriction and its impact on income distribution
The global coffee trade was heavily regulated by an
International Coffee Agreement (ICA) between 1962 and 1989,
albeit not consistently.23

A rise in international coffee prices would shift a greater
share of income to coffee-producing countries, while a fall
would raise the share going to importing countries.

The aim of the agreement was to reduce coffee price
fluctuations and stabilize prices, especially when coffee
prices were low. Parties to the agreement, comprising
both coffee-producing and coffee-consuming countries,
agreed to a target band price for coffee and limited exports
of coffee by assigning export quotas to different producing
countries. Quotas were relaxed when coffee prices rose
above the target band, and tightened when they fell below it.
They were abandoned completely when coffee prices rose
well above the band, as was the case from 1975 to 1977.

More recent estimates of the income distribution generally
concur with the assessment that coffee-importing countries
account for a higher share of the income from coffee than
before. 25 Two factors explain the lower share of income accruing to coffee-producing countries – a real-terms decline
in international coffee prices and an increase in non-coffee
related costs in the coffee industry.

Coffee prices were relatively high between 1963 and September
1972, October 1980 and February 1986, and November 1987
and July 1989, because of quota restrictions. During 1973
and 1980 there was no agreement between the parties to the
agreement and so the quota restriction was suspended, and
after 1989 the agreement was abandoned.
According to an estimate of income distribution under the ICA
quota regime by Talbot (1997), approximately 20 percent of
coffee income was retained in the coffee-producing countries,
while coffee-importing countries accounted for 55 percent of
income.24 In contrast, when the ICA regime was abandoned,
the share of total income attributable to coffee-producing
countries dropped to 13 percent and coffee-importing
countries saw their share surge to 78 percent.
Talbot cautions that while the ICA quota restriction regime
may have been responsible for the higher share of income
accruing to the coffee-producing countries, price fluctuations
due to changes in global coffee production yields may have
had an effect on the income split between producing and
importing countries.

The importance of certification
in the second wave
The second wave market segment began in the 1990s
when the price of coffee fell sharply after the end
of the ICA quota restriction. 28 Soon thereafter, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) started highlighting
the impact of the low coffee prices on farmers, calling
for action to help alleviate this problem. In response,
coffee specialty shops such as Starbucks started
offering coffees that met the expectations of their more
socially conscious consumers. Sustainably farmed,
organic coffees and products that promised higher
prices for farmers started appearing in these shops
along with their traditional outlets in health-food stores.

52

There were many problems in maintaining production restrictions under the quota regime. First, coffee-importing
countries had to agree to higher prices than they would have
received without the regime. Second, efficient producers
in coffee-producing countries had to restrict their sales
of coffee beans even when prices were high, and so lose
potential revenue, in order to comply with the regulation.
Some countries destroyed coffee beans in high-yield years.26
And third, the quota restriction gave incorrect signals to
farmers with regard to their yield and planting decisions.
Since the price they received was disconnected from real
green coffee consumption needs, they were encouraged
to produce more than real market demand, causing further
downward pressure on international coffee prices. A more
recent study on the effects of the ICA quota restriction on
coffee yield argues that coffee harvests are lower today in
part because of the lower coffee price in place after the
agreement was dissolved. 27
Despite these problems, the restriction generally met its
objective of stabilizing prices for coffee producers when
it was in force.

Most specialty shops do not have direct access to
coffee farmers and so have to rely on intermediaries
to ensure that the coffee beans they purchase meet
their chosen criteria. Exporters in coffee-producing
countries, with relationships with both coffee farmers on the one hand and the importers or roasters
in coffee-importing countries on the other, are well
placed to arrange for the supply of certified beans
that comply with given farming methods and other
sustainability criteria. Some NGOs also help provide
certifications such as Fair Trade or Rainforest Alliance
certifications. 29

COFFEE: HOW CONSUMER CHOICES ARE RESHAPING THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN

The higher prices for these certified or labelled coffee
products – with their emphasis on more value flowing to participants upstream in the value chain – are
reflected in a different income level for farmers than in
the first wave (see table 2.3). A host of other benefits
clearly associated with VSSs have also been observed,
ranging from improved resource and environmental
conservation to better labor practices.30
However, researchers differ on whether farmers
receive significantly higher incomes. Some argue that
farmers participating in this market segment receive
higher prices than those in the first wave; others are
less convinced.31

The skeptics argue that the cost of implementing a
VSS and complying with certification standards may
offset the higher gross income received, or that price
premiums are declining.32

Knowing the origin of your third wave coffee
The third wave market segment places high
importance on appreciating the coffee beverage.
Information about upstream activities – such as the
origin of the coffee beans, how they were farmed
and the climate conditions – is seen as almost as
important as the downstream coffee activities of
roasting, blending and brewing.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

This market segment arguably has the highest potential to increase participants’ income along the global
value chain. First, there is direct trade between coffee
farmers and independent retailers. This vertical integration shortens the supply chain and ensures that
farmers earn higher wages for their green coffee. The
average price differential between coffees that identify
the grower and those that do not can reach USD 8 per
pound.33 Moreover, one study focusing on the U.S.
market estimates that single-origin coffee protected
using IP instruments fetches at least three times the
average U.S. retail price for roasted coffee.34
Table 2.3 illustrates the different incomes that coffee
farmers receive in the different market segments. The
farm-gate price per pound of coffee that a farmer
supplying the second or third wave market segments
receives is higher than in the first wave. In particular,
the average third wave farmer’s income per pound is
triple that in the first wave. While this jump in income
is impressive, it reflects the differentiation strategies employed upstream in the supply chain. In the
second wave, differentiation is achieved through
participation in a VSS, while third wave farmers look
to differentiate both by emphasizing the quality of
coffee bean and through direct trade with roasters in
coffee-importing countries.
The closer relationship between upstream and downstream supply chain participants means there is more
interaction between them. Roasters are able to learn
more about how coffee is farmed and may help farmers
improve their farming methods as well as their marketing, while the farmers are able to supply the high-quality
coffee that roasters need.
In this context, both upstream and downstream
coffee participants increase the value they derive
from their activities – the coffee farmers by upgrading
their farming in line with roasters’ needs, the roasters
by using the enhanced knowledge they gain about
the farmed coffee to help them produce very highquality beverages.
Figure 2.3 presents the income distribution in the
market segments in a more graphic way. Whereas
figure 2.2 above showed the historical trend of income
distribution for the first wave market segment, figure
2.3 is a snapshot of the three different waves based
on prices in 2014.

2.2.3 – Ownership of intangible assets
can help participants capture value
The distribution of income along the coffee value chain
can in part be explained by the ownership of intangible
assets. As seen in the previous subsection, investments
in innovation and branding are likely factors in explaining
the high value added toward the tail end of the chain.
One way to measure innovative activities is examining
the ownership of patents, utility models and industrial
designs for coffee-related inventions, while branding
activities can be measured through registered and
unregistered trademarks and GIs, where applicable.35

Most coffee-related IP is owned by
participants in coffee-importing countries
As mentioned in part 2.2.1, coffee-importing countries tend to own most of the related formal intangible
assets. Figure 2.4 compares the use of IP by the top
five producing countries, on the one hand, and the
top five importing countries plus China on the other.36

COFFEE: HOW CONSUMER CHOICES ARE RESHAPING THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN

Not surprisingly, the figures show that participants in
importing countries account for large numbers of the
IP rights related to coffee.
The United States, Switzerland and Italy are the
top three countries of origin of participants filing for
patents related to coffee. For trademarks filed at the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO),
European countries – specifically, Italy, Germany and
the United Kingdom – are the top three filers, other
than U.S. nationals.37

China, however, is a stark exception to the general
picture in figure 2.4. IP filings related to coffee from
China-based applicants rival those from the top five
coffee-importing countries. Prior to 1995, the number of
coffee-related patents from applicants in China was in
the same low range as those for many coffee-producing
countries such as Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. But since
1995, China has ranked among the important markets
where patent protection is sought, along with traditional
coffee-importing countries such as the United States
and several European countries (see box 2.3).

Box 2.3
China – huge growth potential both in production and as a market
China is one of the newer coffee-producing countries, producing Mild Arabica coffee in the Yunnan province.38 China’s
production of coffee has doubled every five years over the
past two decades. It is a market with high growth potential
for coffee consumption; its consumption pattern is similar to
the evolution of demand for coffee in Japan 50 years ago.39
China’s IP activities seem to coincide with its increase in coffee
production. It has seen a leap in both patent and trademark
filing activities over the past decade, rivalling the higher-income
coffee-importing countries.

IP ownership mirrors the distribution
of income along the value chain
Figure 2.5 compares the distribution of patenting
activities and firms across the different segments of
the coffee value chain.42 It shows the proportion of
participants at each stage of the chain (in light blue)
and their share of total coffee-related patent filings
(in dark blue).
Over 90 percent of all coffee-related patenting activities are concentrated in the bean processing and
final distribution segments.43 These two segments
account for nearly two-thirds of the total number
of firms in the coffee industry worldwide. These
participants typically include roasters, soluble coffee
manufacturers and retailers that also do their own
roasting such as specialty coffee shops and independent coffee retailers.
In contrast, the activities that usually take place in
coffee-producing countries such as coffee farming, harvesting and post-harvesting do not see
much patenting. The farming and harvesting/postharvesting segments together account for less than
2 percent of overall coffee-related patent filings.
Branding activity is growing among participants at
the final distribution stage of the chain. Figure 2.6
plots the number of trademark filings at the USPTO
by U.S. coffee retail brands in the first, second and
third waves.

56

Since 1995, applicants in China have filed nearly the same
number of coffee-related patents as those in France, and
more than those in the United Kingdom.40 In addition, nearly
3,300 coffee-related technologies are protected through utility
models.41 However, most Chinese patent filings are made in
China only and do not have a foreign orientation is in contrast
to those from France, Italy and the United Kingdom.
But China filed nearly 2,400 trademarks at the USPTO in relation
to coffee-related goods and services, ahead of Germany’s filing
of approximately 2,200. This suggests that Chinese companies
have a significant presence in the U.S. coffee market.

While trademark filings relating to coffee-related
goods and services have generally been on the
rise since 1980, the number of applications filed by
second and third wave participants nearly tripled
between 2000 and 2016. Filings from independent
retail operators in the third wave account for a significant share of this growth.
This increasing reliance on trademark filings reflects the
importance placed on branding activities for the coffee
industry in general, but particularly for the second and
third waves. These market segments started gaining
traction from 2000 and 2010, respectively.

Branding activities are increasing,
unlike patenting
Trademark filings in relation to coffee-related goods
and services have risen over the years. Figure 2.7
shows that the ratio of coffee trademark filings to all
other trademark categories has increased in recent
decades. Notable jumps in coffee-related trademark
filings occurred in 1991, 2000 and 2010, coinciding with
the birth and uptake of the second and third waves.44
In contrast, growth in patenting of coffee-related
technologies during this period has been uneven.
While the number of coffee-related patents has
increased, they have declined as a proportion of all
patents since 2005. Annual filing of coffee-related
patents peaked that same year, with more than 1,500
applications filed worldwide.

COFFEE: HOW CONSUMER CHOICES ARE RESHAPING THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN

2.3 – Managing intangible assets
in the coffee value chain

2.3.1 – Protecting coffee in
important markets

Participants in the global value chain for coffee protect
and manage their intangible assets in four main ways:
(i) protecting their patentable technologies where
competitors are located, (ii) using differentiation strategies and especially branding to separate themselves
from their rivals, (iii) building more direct connections
to coffee farmers, and (iv) securing coffee yield by
addressing climate change and coffee disease issues.

As noted above, most of the formal intangible assets in
the coffee global value chain are owned by participants
in the more developed, coffee-importing economies.
These participants protect their intangible capital in
countries where they face competitors, usually other
more developed coffee-importing economies.
Figure 2.8 shows where patented technologies were
protected worldwide in the periods 1976-1995 (top) and
1996-2015 (bottom).

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

Two points stand out. First, coffee-related technologies are protected mainly in more developed
economies; that was true in 1995 and remains true
today. Brazil, China and Mexico are the only coffeeproducing countries where patent protection is
being sought for coffee-related inventions. Second,
however, IP offices in sizable markets like China and
Russia now receive a higher share of coffee-related
patent filings than they did in the period before 1996,
likely reflecting the growth of coffee consumption in
those countries.
But the rise in patenting activity in China is unique.
Most filings at the State Intellectual Property Office
of the People’s Republic of China (SIPO) are filed
only in China and nowhere else, while patents filed
in other countries tend to be protected in more than
one jurisdiction.

2.3.2 – Using branding as a
differentiation strategy
Branding strategies differ across
the three market segments
In the first wave, market-led governance implies that
most intangible assets are controlled by the buyers, that
is, coffee roasters and soluble coffee manufacturers.
Here, long-term relationships with distributors, investments in introducing newer technologies and branding
activities continue to ensure buyers’ market share in
a competitive marketplace. A prime example of the
importance of branding is Nestlé and its introduction
of at-home, single-portion espresso coffee machines
and capsules through Nespresso and the Nescafé
Dolce Gusto brands. These machines introduced the
novelty of consuming single-portion quality espresso
beverages at home.
The second wave market segment also has a marketbased governance structure. Participants invest
heavily in branding to differentiate themselves from
their competitors. Starbucks, for example, is one
of the biggest coffee brands in the world.45 But the
specialty coffee shops in the second wave have a
different business model from the first wave which
connects them directly to their consumers. These
coffee shops pay close attention to consumption
trends and often position themselves to cater to
specific lifestyle images.

60

The second wave’s emphasis on certification and labelling is being adopted by first wave roasters and soluble
coffee manufacturers. More and more coffee packaging
now includes third-party certification labels to indicate
how the beans were farmed and reassure consumers
that the farmers were adequately remunerated.
Figure 2.9 plots the number of trademarks filed in the
U.S. by retail coffee brands in the first, second and
third waves. Almost all of the retail coffee brands in
the first wave have a trademark filed. While the second
and third waves have more filings than the first wave in
total, there is less likelihood that a brand in these two
market segments will have trademark protection than a
first wave brand. Only 12 percent of brands in the first
wave have no trademark, while nearly 30 percent and 45
percent respectively of second and third wave brands
are not protected through trademark registration.
In other words, participants in the first wave are more
likely to use trademarks than those in the newer market
segments, highlighting the value of the underlying brands.
Moreover, the types of trademark application vary
according to the target consumers in the three market
segments. Retail brands in the first wave tend to file
for more goods-related trademarks than those in the
second and third waves, reflecting the former's focus
on at-home consumption. The two newer markets
have a higher share of applications for services-related
trademarks, reflecting their focus on in-person services.
What might explain the relatively low use of trademark
protection in the third wave? The defining traits of this
market segment – close connections between specialist
retailers and coffee farmers, greater emphasis on transparency and knowledge than in the older segments –
suggest that branding is crucial intangible capital that
should be protected. However, the data on trademark
filing show that barely half of third wave retailers have
applied for a trademark. The share of third wave retail
brands with no trademark is 45 percent in comparison
to nearly 30 percent in the second wave and just 12
percent in the first wave.
One possible explanation for this apparent anomaly
is that most third wave retail brands tend to be small
niche brands that may not need to rely on trademark
protection for brand recognition. By contrast, first and
second wave brands are more likely to be bigger and
target the global coffee market, so may need to rely on
more formal IP protection.

While the third wave remains small in terms of traded
volume, it has already had an impact on how business
is being conducted in the other two market segments.

2.3.3 – The third wave gives coffee growers
opportunities to upgrade
The third wave, with its relational governance, has
influenced how intangible assets are managed in
the coffee industry. Its shortened value chain, which
allows for direct trade with farmers, has opened up new
opportunities for participants to upgrade, particularly
farmers and buyers in the form of independent coffee
shop retailers.
First, information on the origin and variety of coffee
beans, how they were farmed and processed, and if
the farmers are adequately compensated has become
an integral part of selling coffee. This information and
knowledge translates into higher prices for coffee,
which can be reinvested to upgrade coffee farms.
Second, sourcing high-quality coffee beans is
increasingly important for many buyers. Direct trade
is one way buyers can ensure they are purchasing
high-quality coffee.

In addition, buyers learn more about the coffee and
may then be able to communicate its history to their
customers. For coffee farmers, direct communication with buyers can sometimes lead to sharing of
technology and know-how, helping to upgrade farms
and processing.
A case in point is the Italian roaster Illycafé and its
relationship with Brazilian coffee farmers since the
late 1980s. For Illycafé, partnering directly with coffee
growers ensured that it had a relatively stable supply of
Brazilian coffee beans that met its high-quality specification. For the farmers, the partnership helped them to
upgrade their coffee-growing and post-harvest methods and processing facilities, and included substantial
formal training systems.
Third, the origin of the coffee bean has become
an important aspect of coffee, and features on the
packaging of coffee products. Single-sourced beans
are now being offered by roasters, soluble coffee
manufacturers and specialty coffee shops in both the
first and second wave market segments. This emphasis
on the origin of the coffee provides an opportunity
for coffee farmers to differentiate themselves from
suppliers in other coffee-producing countries.
61

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

More coffee-producing countries are
adopting differentiation strategies
The second and third wave market segments show
that participants in coffee-producing countries may
be able to obtain a higher income from the value
chain by differentiating their products. Now, more
and more coffee-producing countries are investing
in efforts to distinguish their production from generic
or commoditized coffee.
First, some coffee farmers and/or associations are
actively protecting the branding of coffees originating from their countries in overseas markets. In the
United States, participants file trademarks to protect
their coffee products. Brazil, Jamaica and Mexico
have all used collective and certification marks there.46
Colombia, Ethiopia, Jamaica and Kenya also use trademarks to protect the origin of their coffee products.
In the European Union, there are two GIs on coffee
originating from Thailand, and one each for Colombia,
the Dominican Republic and Indonesia, four EU trademarks related to the word “coffee” for Jamaica and
Ethiopia, and five trademarks on logos for coffee from
Colombia and Jamaica.
Governments such as those of Colombia and Ethiopia
have supported initiatives to secure IP rights like GIs
and trademarks to ensure that their countries’ products stand out. In Colombia, the Colombian Coffee
Growers Federation (FNC) implemented a differentiation strategy that involved actively protecting coffees
originating from its regions, compliance with certain
VSSs and demonstrating that its coffee beans were
suitable for espresso-based beverages. The FNC’s
efforts include supporting the 100% Colombian Coffee
Program, which allows certain coffee blends in the first
wave as well as other market segments to be labelled
with the 100% Colombian logo.47
In Ethiopia, the Ethiopian Coffee Trademarking and
Licensing Initiative, a public-private partnership
consortium, has been actively branding coffees
originating from its regions in an effort to promote
them.48 It has applied for trademark rights in Australia,
Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, South
Africa and the United States, to name a few. The
consortium has also hired a U.K.-based company
to help market its coffees worldwide. Its initiatives
have helped to increase the popularity of Ethiopian
coffee (see box 2.4).

62

Box 2.4
How the Ethiopian trademark
filing challenge at the USPTO
raised its coffees’ popularity
In 2005 the Ethiopian Intellectual Property Office (EIPO), on
behalf of the Ethiopian Coffee Trademarking and Licensing
Initiative, applied for trademark protection at the USPTO
for the brands Yirgacheffe, Sidamo and Harrar. However, it
faced a challenge regarding the names Sidamo and Harrar.
The media reported that Starbucks was one of the driving
forces behind that challenge. A year later, the Ethiopian
Government and Starbucks came to a mutually beneficial agreement. Starbucks signed a voluntary trademark
licensing agreement to acknowledge Ethiopia’s ownership
of the Yirgacheffe, Sidamo and Harrar names, whether
trademarked or not. In return, the EIPO licensed the use
of those names to Starbucks under a royalty-free licensing scheme.
The media coverage of Ethiopia’s trademark challenge
at the USPTO and Starbucks’ role may have helped to
increase the popularity of Ethiopian-sourced coffee. The
former director general of the EIPO commented that the
price of Yirgacheffe coffee increased by USD 60 cents per
pound after the media coverage.

Second, countries like Colombia and Brazil have
entered the downstream coffee supply chain by roasting and selling products to markets overseas. Colombia
has also entered the coffee retail business by opening
specialty shops akin to Starbucks in different parts of
the world. These shops carry the Juan Valdez brand
and only serve Colombian coffee. By 2016, there were
371 Juan Valdez coffee shops in operation, 120 of them
located outside the country. The Juan Valdez brand
had accumulated USD 37 million in royalties for the
Colombian coffee association by the end of that year.
Third, more and more coffee farmers are liaising
directly with coffee buyers by participating in coffee
community networks.

Building reputation by mobilizing
the coffee community
The coffee community includes a network of baristas
and roasters organized into guilds and associations.
These guilds and associations hold contests and
meetings whereby participants learn from one another
and showcase their craftsmanship to gain recognition
for their work.

COFFEE: HOW CONSUMER CHOICES ARE RESHAPING THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN

One contest that benefits coffee farmers and buyers
is the Cup of Excellence (COE). The COE recognizes
coffee farmers for their investments in producing highquality coffee. It provides an opportunity for the farmers
to promote their coffees in an international setting.
Coffees that rank among the top 10 of the COE are
auctioned off and often receive premium prices. Their
farmers and farms gain recognition and usually enter
into long-term relationships with coffee buyers.49 This
form of branding confers substantial value on successful competitors.
An independent assessment of the COE programs
in Brazil and Honduras put the value generated for
these countries at USD 137 million and USD 25 million,
respectively. These gains in value were estimated to
come from direct auction sales, an upsurge in direct
trade and increased access to specialty coffee markets.
Successful COE participants saw their profit margins
increase by two to nine times those of their conventional counterparts.50
The coffee community adheres to standards to simplify
the trade between buyers and farmers. Codified quality
concepts and measurements such as the cupping and
grading standards of the Specialty Coffee Association
(SCA) facilitate this trade. These standards motivate
coffee farmers to produce higher-quality coffee while
also assuring baristas and roasters of the quality of the
coffee they purchase. The more coffee participants that
recognize a standard, the easier it becomes for transactions to take place directly between coffee suppliers
and buyers in the global marketplace.
However, climate change issues and cof fee
diseases are threatening the production of coffee
beans worldwide.

2.3.4 – Creating new coffee varieties
through public-private partnerships
Coffee production faces several challenges, including climate change, coffee diseases and pests, labor
shortages and land pressures.
These challenges are particularly acute for the production of high-quality Arabica coffee. First, there is little
diversity in the Arabica coffee plant species, making
it highly susceptible to diseases and climate change.51
Second, rising temperatures due to climate change are
likely to reduce suitable coffee-farming areas.52

More resilient coffee plant varieties are needed to
ensure the supply of coffee worldwide. Research
institutions in certain African coffee-producing countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, the United
Republic of Tanzania and Uganda and Latin American
countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica and
Honduras have been able to develop new coffee varieties for their regions.53 There are also efforts by NGOs
to help develop stronger coffee varieties. One notable
example is World Coffee Research, which has been
working closely with coffee-producing countries to
share coffee varieties worldwide in an effort to develop
hardier varieties. More recently, private coffee value
chain participants such as Starbucks, Nestlé and Ecom
Agroindustrial Corporation have been engaging with
local research institutes too.
Most of the research outputs in this area are publicly
available. Two reasons may explain why. First, research
institutions and governments may request that work
remain public. Second, plant varieties are specific to
a region and its climate, so a coffee variety that has
proven successful in one area may not easily be transferred to and used in a different region. In many cases,
research institutions in different coffee-producing countries have to develop varieties specific to their environments, multiplying the effort and investment needed.
An initiative by World Coffee Research attempts
to save effort and investment in identifying strong
coffee plant varieties by sharing these varieties across
countries within particular world regions. By closely
collaborating with governments and coffee growers, this NGO is helping transfer technology from its
research group to farmers.
Another possible way to facilitate this technology transfer is through relying on plant breeders’ rights (PBRs).
A few countries have relied on the system under the
International Union for the Protection of New Varieties
of Plants (UPOV) to protect the coffee plant varieties
developed. The UPOV system aims to provide incentives to plant breeders to develop new plant varieties
and encourage their dissemination.54
The first application for PBRs under the UPOV system
was in Brazil in 2004.55 Currently, there are 46 PBRs filed
on the coffee plant varieties of Arabica and Canephora,
as disclosed to UPOV.56 These 46 PBRs originated from
Brazil (19), Colombia (19), Costa Rica (1) and Kenya (7)
and most of them are filed by public research organizations and coffee associations.

2.4 – Conclusion
As with many commodities produced in the Global
South and consumed in the Global North, the distribution of income along the coffee value chain is
uneven. Roasters, brand holders and retailers downstream in the coffee-importing countries capture the
lion’s share of the total value of the market.
Intangible assets play an important role in the coffee
global value chain. As seen in chapter 1, intangible
capital accounts for 31 percent of total income in the
food, beverages and tobacco product group. This
chapter has shown how the income from coffee is
currently distributed along the chain, and how ownership of intangible assets helps explain this allocation.
The first wave market segment dominates due to its
consumption volume and market value. Competition
in this market is intense and, more importantly,
based on keeping the production cost low. Decisions
regarding the origin of the coffee and whether Arabica
or Robusta beans are used to cater to this market
segment are based on price. Until recently, the
origin of the coffee has been of minor importance;
rather, downstream coffee participants – large
roasters, soluble coffee manufacturers and large
coffee retailers – rely on branding to differentiate
themselves from their rivals. These participants
capture a significant share of the total market income,
reflecting the economic importance of these activities
in the global value chain.
The beginning of the second wave market segment
in the mid-1990s revived coffee-drinking culture and
reintroduced the social aspect of coffee consumption. This market segment emphasizes higher-quality
coffee and personal service and highlights the importance of where and how coffee has been sourced.
The rise of this segment coincided with increasing
social and ethical awareness among consumers;
demands for fair remuneration of coffee farmers
and environmental sustainability of coffee farming
became relevant as selling points. In responding to
these demands, downstream coffee participants
in this segment began to focus on issues of transparency, such as providing more information and
knowledge about upstream coffee-related activities
through certification and VSS compliance.

64

The third wave market segment has added another
layer in terms of quality and knowledge. As well as
seeking to address social and ethical concerns about
how farmers are paid and the sustainability of coffee
farming, this market segment emphasizes direct links
between specialist retailers and coffee farmers, and
retailers’ and consumers’ in-depth knowledge of how
best to brew beans in order to fully appreciate their
flavor, body, aroma, fragrance and mouthfeel.
The newer coffee consumption trends of the second
and third waves are changing the coffee industry
landscape. First, ways to address social and ethical concerns pioneered by second wave roasters
and retailers through various certification and VSS
schemes have become a big differentiating point for
selling coffee. The price differential between coffees
that identify the grower and those that do not can
reach up to USD 8 per pound.57
Second, direct links between retailers and farmers
provide upgrading opportunities for both upstream
and downstream coffee participants. This new way of
doing business in the coffee industry facilitates learning and technology transfer between participants. It
also helps coffee farmers to create awareness of their
coffees through branding efforts which may include
marketing and/or filing for formal IP protection of
trademarks and GIs.The farm-gate prices that coffee
farmers receive by supplying to the second or third
wave market segments are higher than those in the
first wave; farmers’ income in the third wave is triple
that of first wave farmers.
Third, focusing on activities upstream in the coffee
value chain helps to increase the income of both
upstream and downstream participants.
The new way of doing business pioneered in the third
wave is being assimilated by the first and second
waves due to its fast growth and potential to expand
coffee consumption. Indications include the recent
acquisition by Nestlé – a large first wave roaster – of a
notable third wave firm, Blue Bottle, signaling its entry
into the third wave. And it is not the only one. Its close
competitor, JAB, has purchased brand names Peet’s
and Stumptown to ride the third wave. Starbucks,
from the second wave, recently tested the waters by
introducing its Reserve brand.58

COFFEE: HOW CONSUMER CHOICES ARE RESHAPING THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN

The adoption of the third wave business strategy in
other market segments creates further opportunities for
upstream coffee participants to increase their income,
particularly by leveraging their brands. The extent to
which these participants are able to do so will depend
on consumers’ recognition and awareness of these
brands. This will require more investment to raise
awareness among both consumers and large retailers
in coffee-importing countries.
The growth potential of the Third Wave is increasingly
attractive to traditional roasters and soluble coffee
manufacturers, even if it represents a small share of
the coffee industry. So far, this business model seems
to be highly profitable for every member of the coffee
global value chain. If coffee growers are to benefit more
from this attention, they must not only focus more on
the array of differentiation opportunities, but may also
need to consider using IP instruments to retain the
value they create.

7.

Most coffee beans consumed in
the world come from the Arabica

latter is commonly referred to as
Robusta coffee. Arabica coffees
are considered higher quality and
fetch higher prices than
Robusta coffees.

for a “Process of preserving the
aromatic substances of a dry
soluble coffee extract.”

Daviron and Ponte (2005) show this
point well in their breakdown of the
coffee costs in the Uganda-Italy
value chain for Robusta coffee.

22. Daviron and Ponte (2005) refer to
these differentiation strategies
as investments in “symbolic

reflection of the high coffee stock
that was dumped on the market,
causing an oversupply of green

Wollni and Zeller (2007). Daviron

under the Fair Trade scheme
receive an income similar to those
during the ICA quota restriction
regime, approximately 20 cents
to the dollar, but they caution that
when their study was conducted,
the Fair Trade scheme covered
less than 1 percent of the coffee
market. Dragusanu et al. (2014)
updated the data and reviewed
global evidence to find general
but not universal benefits.

32.

A recent analysis by GarcíaCardona (2016) argues that coffee
producers that participate in these
certification standards do not
necessarily receive a higher price
for their certified coffee. The cost
to farmers of complying with and
maintaining the various certification
standards is often high. See

to the specific geographical
origin of the product, and that
product possesses qualities or a
reputation associated with that
origin, the terroir. See box 2.2 in
WIPO (2013) for a more detailed
explanation.
36. U.S. trademark filings at the
USPTO have been excluded from
this analysis.
37.

The USPTO’s trademark data was
chosen for two reasons. First, the
U.S. market is a big and important
market for coffee consumption.
Second, the USPTO has a use
requirement, which paints a
more accurate picture of actual
coffee-related product and service
competition (see chapter 2 of WIPO
(2013) on intention to use versus
actual use of trademarks).

The Ukers (2017) directory has
a large database of firms in the
coffee industry, from farmers
associations to roasters and
suppliers of coffee machines
as well as other coffee-related
services such as coffee-specific
packaging companies. Firms
are classified according to their
respective value chain segment.
However, the list of firms does not
include individual coffee farmers
in different parts of the world, and
thus underestimates the size of
coffee participants in this particular
segment.
Participants in these two segments
tend to overlap. Most coffee
roasters also perform their own
bean processing activities.
The second wave market segment
was introduced in the 1990s but
did not take off until the year
2000, while the third wave market
segment took off in 2010 after
beginning around the year 2000.
In 2012, Starbucks was in the
news for its transfer pricing
and tax activities in the United
Kingdom. The company had used
international accounting rules to
price its intangible capital in such a
manner that it had avoided paying
U.K. taxes (Bergin 2012). See

Chapter 3
Photovoltaics: technological catch-up
and competition in the global value chain
New technologies related to renewable energy are a
pillar of sustainable economic growth and development. Recent decades have seen increasing global
interest and demand for successful innovations capable of transforming solar, wind or geothermal energy
– among other sources – into electricity.1

Any PV system that is used purely for own consumption
needs to rely on batteries or be hybridized with other
fuel sources to ensure a consistent supply of electricity
throughout the day.

This chapter explores how the global value chain for
solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies has evolved to
meet the demand for sustainable electricity generation.
It focuses on the importance of intangible assets as a
crucial means of adding value in the different segments
of this particular global value chain, where technological
innovation and diffusion have played a key role.

Demand for PV is growing
exponentially

As with many technologies, an accidental discovery
led to the initial development of solar PV technology
for electricity generation. In the late 1930s and early
1940s at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, United
States, Russell Ohl discovered that shining light
on a monocrystalline material registered electric
potential on a voltmeter. He patented a device that
employed this principle in 1941. 2 Ohl was not the
first scientist to discover a material that conducted
electricity – known as the semiconductive effect –
when exposed to sunlight. The earliest documented
incident was almost a century earlier in France, when
Edmund Becquerel noted that an electric current was
produced when two metals immersed in a liquid were
exposed to sunlight. Though several scientists had
managed to produce PV cells from different materials between the discoveries of Becquerel and Ohl,
it was really the scientists at Bell Laboratories who
developed the first crystalline PV cell.3
Nowadays, two different solar PV cell technologies
are being commercialized – wafer-based crystalline
and thin-film PV cells – but the former accounts for
over 90 percent of the PV market. Present systems
based on either PV cell technology can provide electricity similar to a conventional power plant, known as
utility-scale generation. Such systems can act as a
power plant generating electricity exclusively for the
grid. Alternatively, large industrial plants – or other
loads such as data storage centers – can generate
electricity from PV systems on a large scale solely for
their own consumption, thereby potentially offsetting
some or all of their electricity consumption from the
grid. Smaller-scale PV systems can also be used for
residential or commercial uses. These too may be
either connected to the grid or used solely for own
consumption, particularly in remote, off-grid areas.

Demand for PV systems has grown exponentially
since 2000 (figure 3.1). In 2016, 34 percent more new
capacity was installed worldwide than in the previous year, and growth hit 126 percent in China. Until
2011, growth occurred mainly in Europe. Demand
has become more evenly distributed since then, and
China is now the largest market. Figure 3.1 shows
additions to annual PV capacity by origin of demand
from 2000 to 2015. The growth trend is exponential,
with an increase from little more than zero in 2000
to 50.6 GW in 2015. Capacity growth in Europe has
slowed markedly since 2011, but it remains strong in
China, Japan and North America.
Government support policies have been the main
drivers of development in the solar PV market (figure
3.2). Historically, regulators have mostly used feedin tariffs (FITs), which impose guaranteed prices
for electricity generated from solar energy sources
on grid operators. This mechanism allows solar PV
power generated at higher cost to benefit from a
higher price than power generated from conventional
sources, accelerating investments in PV technology
that spread upward through the value chain.
71

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

However, such mechanisms limit the price information
passed from the supply side to regulators, which in
turn to some extent limits the incentives to invest in
cost-reducing PV technologies along the value chain.
As the price is set by the regulator, supply margins
depend on the quality of its information about the
costs of generating electricity through PV technology.
Experience suggests that regulators have regularly
overestimated these costs, as installed capacity has
almost systematically exceeded the quantities that were
initially planned to be commissioned.
As an alternative, regulators now tend to rely more
on auctioning and competitive mechanisms, such as
FITs through tender or power purchase agreements
(PPAs). These policies rely on clearer price signals
from suppliers, giving current suppliers and project
developers stronger incentives to reduce their costs.
Arguably, PPAs can spread cost-reducing innovations
more rapidly along the whole value chain, as solar
PV developers submit bids to develop new power
generation projects and the government agrees on
the purchase for the most cost-competitive bids.
However, FITs without tender still accounted for almost
60 percent of the PV market in 2015.

This chapter is organized in three main sections. In
section 3.1, the evolution of the global value chain
is analyzed. Section 3.2 examines how intangible
assets – particularly product and process innovations
– have shaped the global supply chain. Section 3.3
explores the role of IP protection, notably patents, in
the new business environment that has emerged from
major recent changes in the industry. A final section
summarizes the main findings.

3.1 – The evolution of the
PV global value chain
A linear value chain structure
This section describes the structure of the value chain
for wafer-based crystalline PV cells, which constitutes
the vast majority of the PV market. Following the
taxonomy described in chapter 1, the typical value
chain structure for wafer-based crystalline PV
technologies is snake shaped, as schematized in
figure 3.3. The upstream and midstream segments
concern all the processes involved in the production
of PV systems. These segments rely heavily on
production equipment, which has played a crucial
role in technology dissemination in the PV industry.4
The downstream segments concern the services
involved in generating electricity from PV systems.

The production of crystalline PV systems involves five
main segments. The first stage is the purification of
silicon from silica (SiO2) found in quartz sand. The
ultra-high purity required for the PV industry – greater
than 99.999 percent pure – is obtained through
a heavy and highly energy-consuming chemical
process, resulting in a material called polysilicon.
The semiconductor industry also makes use of polysilicon, but the PV industry accounts for 90 percent
of polysilicon production.5 The second stage is the
manufacturing of ingots and wafers, which consists
of growing cylinders or bricks of pure silicon (ingots)
and slicing them into thin layers (wafers). Stage three
is the production of crystalline PV cells by assembling
two differently doped wafers to form a p-n junction
responsible for the photovoltaic effect. Many treatments or process modifications can be applied at
this stage to increase the PV efficiency. Stage four
is the assembly of modules, where PV cells are
soldered together and encapsulated in glass sheets,
forming a module which will be cooked in a laminating machine. The fifth stage is integration into PV
systems: modules are combined with complementary
equipment – such as batteries or inverters – to deliver
electricity to devices or to the grid.
Regardless of whether crystalline or thin-film solar PV
technologies are used, there are two main downstream
segments. The first is installation of PV systems in the
end-user market, which includes all market services
related to the development of PV projects, financing,
logistics, certifications and labor.

The second is the generation of electricity from PV
systems, including all services related to operating
and monitoring installed PV capacity.

Despite the crisis, the PV industry is booming,
with increased market competition
Despite the financial crisis of 2008, demand for PV
systems, and consequently production, increased
between 2005 and 2011. Demand is still booming,
and more production capacity is being created everywhere. As an illustration, between 2005 and 2012
global ingot manufacturing capacity grew by 9,590
percent, and capacity to manufacture wafers grew
by 3,991 percent. The traditional main players in the
sector – Germany, Japan and the United States – as
well as new ones like China and India all multiplied their
production capacities in the upstream and midstream
segments of the crystalline PV value chain between
2005 and 2011.6
This boom also involved market entry of new players,
which in turn induced more competition. In 2004, the
different production segments were heavily concentrated, with the five largest players supplying most
global production. As depicted in figure 3.4, in 2004
the top five producers accounted for between 80
and 100 percent of production in most segments.
The only exception was the module segment, and
even there the top five accounted for over 50 percent
of module production. But by 2012 their share of
production in the other four segments had dropped
markedly to around 30 percent.

These developments resulted in a dramatic decrease in
solar PV prices from 2008. Solar PV module prices are
estimated to have decreased by more than 80 percent
between 2008 and 2015, with price reductions of 26
percent for each doubling of capacity.7 Prices have fallen
for all solar PV components, which to a great extent are
now considered as commodities, competing on price
only, rather than differentiated goods, where both price
and quality are important for success in the market.
Prices fell sharply until early 2012, and have continued
to decline since then, but more gently (figure 3.5).
The decrease in solar PV prices is making PV systems
cost-competitive with conventional energy sources,
particularly in markets with high conventional electricity
prices, high levels of solar radiation and low interest
rates. These conditions have increased incentives to
install solar generation for self-consumption, and so
demand in that market has also increased. It is not
surprising that the increase in PV demand from regions
other than Europe has coincided with the steep price fall
observed since 2011. Moreover, the abovementioned
government support policies based on tenders are
likely to have reinforced the downward price trend.
For example, in 2016 Abu Dhabi and Mexico achieved
some of the lowest bids for solar PV pricing contracts.

PHOTOVOLTAICS: TECHNOLOGICAL CATCH-UP AND COMPETITION IN THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN

China: the new big player in the PV value chain
The global distribution of the PV value chain has
changed dramatically in the last decade, with a massive
relocation of upstream and midstream activities to
China.8 While traditional producing economies did
manage to increase their production output and
capacities between 2005 and 2011, growth was much
larger and faster in China.

Figure 3.6
China is now the top supplying
economy in all upstream and
midstream PV market segments

Until 2004, demand and production was largely concentrated in Europe, where governments gave generous
support to accelerate the deployment of PV capacities. This created powerful economic signals in countries with a strong semiconductor industry – such as
Germany, Switzerland, Japan and the United States –
which initially became leaders in providing production
equipment for wafer-based crystalline PV technologies.
Production and demand then slowly started to catch
up in Asian economies, most notably in China. This
led to overcapacities, drastic price decreases and the
exit of many upstream and midstream Western firms.

By 2015, China had become the main PV market and
the lead economy in all upstream and midstream
production segments. Figure 3.6 contrasts the evolution of Chinese market shares with those of the leading
economy in the production of each segment in 2005.
The trend is clear: by 2012 the Chinese economy was
the main supplier of the global PV market in all these
segments. It concentrated more than 60 percent of
production in all segments of the chain except polysilicon production. Chinese companies did enter the
polysilicon market and became the main supplier there
too, accounting for one-third of production by 2011;
but compared to the other production segments, they
entered much later and have concentrated appreciably
less of the global market.

The steep price fall mentioned above caused competitive pressures against U.S. and European solar PV
companies, which had enjoyed significant profits prior
to 2008. This resulted in an increase in bankruptcies
and acquisitions in 2011 and 2012.9
As a result, solar PV manufacturing associations in both
the United States and Europe petitioned their respective
governments to impose tariffs against Chinese solar
PV products.10

Note: Top supplier economies in 2005 were the United
States for polysilicon and crystalline PV modules, Europe for

They argued that Chinese solar PV firms benefited
from subsidized loans from their government, allowing
them not only to set up production facilities, but also to
sustain production even when market prices fell below
the cost of production.11 This led both the U.S. and EU
governments to impose anti-dumping duties on different Chinese crystalline PV products in 2012 and 2013.
These duties are currently still in place due to extensions
in both the United States and the EU.12
75

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

Furthermore, other countries that have set up market
support mechanisms for solar PV have invoked local
content requirements, meaning a certain percentage of technologies used in local PV markets must
be sourced from local manufacturing facilities. Such
requirements were introduced in India, South Africa
and Ontario, Canada, although Ontario eventually had
to revoke its measures following a ruling by the World
Trade Organization.13
Chinese firms have partially bypassed these trade
barriers by setting up manufacturing plants in Brazil,
Germany, India, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Thailand
and Viet Nam.14 These plants serve the domestic
markets in these countries, but are also used as
export bases to other markets that currently have
duties against them. Thus, political economy factors
– such as how trade restrictions affect market access
– can play an important role in the geographical
distribution of the global value chain.

Surviving through vertical integration
The distribution of gains in the PV value chain has
changed drastically in the last decade. Before 2011,
generous subsidies in Europe maintained prices well
above production costs in all segments of the value
chain. Following the price downturn in 2011, upstream
and midstream players suffered a fall in profit margins
that made it difficult for companies to survive (see box
3.1 and figure 3.7).
Although the economic environment has improved
since then, several companies operating in different segments continue to face serious difficulties. In
general, midstream firms’ margins fall short of the average in the semiconductor industry. Low market prices
for upstream and midstream segments of the value
chain mean that a greater proportion of the value in
the chain now lies downstream, in the market development segment. In consequence, many upstream and
midstream solar PV companies have consolidated with
downstream companies (see table 3.1).15

PHOTOVOLTAICS: TECHNOLOGICAL CATCH-UP AND COMPETITION IN THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN

Box 3.1
Creative destruction in the PV value chain?
All major midstream players started losing money in 2011 or
2012 (see figure 3.7). In 2012, Q-Cells, a German-based cell
manufacturer that led the market in most of the 2000s, went
bankrupt and was then bought by Hanwha of the Republic
of Korea. Chinese PV giant Suntech also defaulted in 2013,
leading to a complete restructuring of its activity. Since then,
the situation has become less severe, but it remains difficult.
Companies like REC Silicon and Centrotherm Photovoltaics,
which operate in different segments, continue to face serious
difficulties. In general, midstream firms’ margins fall short of
the average in the semiconductor industry.
Vertical integration has been the solution for many companies
in the PV value chain. As can be seen in table 3.1, several
upstream and midstream players, such as GCL, First Solar,
Canadian Solar, SunPower and Jinko Solar, have also vertically
integrated downstream activities.
Many argue that process innovation is the only possible
survival strategy for upstream and midstream companies.16

First Solar provides an interesting case in point. Specializing in thin-film cells, which account for a minor share
of the market – just 7 percent in 2015 – has enabled
it to become the most profitable midstream company.
What drives its commercial success is being able to manufacture innovative PV components below the market price
and production costs of competitors. Its thin-film PV cell has
power conversion efficiencies nearing crystalline PV levels,
but with production costs substantially below the retail market
price for crystalline PV. First Solar can maintain its comparative advantage because other companies do not know how
to reproduce its product – a PV cell made from cadmium telluride materials – and because it uses specialized production
equipment protected by intellectual property rights.
But how replicable is this example? First Solar was able to
attract finance, scale up production and commercialize its
technology when solar PV technology prices were high.17
It is hard to see such a window of opportunity in current
market conditions.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

Solar PV manufacturers are increasingly moving
downstream by getting involved in market development. This trend was initially observed during the
financial crisis of 2008, when orders for solar PV technologies were cancelled due to the inability of solar
PV project developers to obtain financing support.18
Prior to the crisis, most developers financed their
solar PV projects through bank loans. Banks were
willing to finance solar PV projects – along with other
renewable energy projects – because governments’
FIT policies provided guaranteed prices for at least
20 years. However, the financial crisis hit the liquidity of banks and their capacity to provide loans to
project developers.
As a result, project developing companies had to
cancel their projects, which in turn meant cancelled
orders for PV products upstream in the value chain.
Solar PV manufacturers that had enjoyed high profits
up to this time faced cancellation of their orders and
could not resell them to other project developers.
Those companies with strong balance sheets started
moving downstream to project development in order
to generate demand for their own upstream products.

3.2 – How do intangibles add value
in the PV global value chain?
As described in the previous section, the past decade
has seen a striking relocation of most upstream and
midstream activities to China. As a direct consequence,
a significant share of the economic activities related to
the PV value chain – including total value added – has
also been transferred to that country.
But the story in regard to the creation and returns to PV
intangible assets is less straightforward.19 First, knowledge assets in the PV value chain were not necessarily
tied to either the main production location (China) or
demand locations (Europe). Second, as suggested
in the previous section, knowledge assets relate not
only to product innovations, but also to cost-reducing
process innovations. Third, it is important to understand
how China acquired the knowledge assets needed to
reshape the current global PV value chain.
This section explores how knowledge assets have
shaped the current structure of the PV value chain. The
role of reputational assets in downstream segments is
explored in the next section.

Box 3.2
The photovoltaic revolution
There are now four different families of solar PV cell technologies: (i) wafer-based crystalline, (ii) thin-film, (iii) high-efficiency
(often referred to as Group III-V) and (iv) organic PV cells. Only
the first two are currently commercialized, while the latter two
show great promise. Wafer-based crystalline PV cells account
for over 90 percent of the PV market.20
Newer PV technologies have to overcome two challenges
to reach the market. First, the technology has to generate
electricity reliably and stably in non-laboratory settings, and
second, production costs have to be lower than competing
market prices for existing PV technologies. As of today, certain
types of thin-film and high-efficiency PV cells have achieved
higher power conversion efficiencies than commercialized
technologies, but they struggle to meet the prices of the
marketed technologies, partly because they are produced
on a smaller scale.21
This makes process innovation along the value chain crucial
for the PV industry (see figure 3.3). Two major production
processes are used for polysilicon production: the Siemens
process and the fluidized bed reactor (FBR) process.22

78

Since the production of polysilicon is electricity-intensive,
a large part of decreasing costs lies in improving the energy efficiency of these processes, with the FBR process
being more efficient than the Siemens one. Companies in
the United States, Canada and Norway are trying alternative and proprietary metallurgical processes to reduce the
energy and production costs of polysilicon. Another way
in which companies attempt to reduce electricity costs
is relocating plants to regions where electricity is cheap.
Cost-reducing innovations in the production of ingots and
wafers have also been achieved through innovations in
the production equipment installed in those factories. For
ingots, this is done by growing larger crystals and improving the seed crystals needed to reduce process time and
increase yield.23 Other production equipment improvements
include cutting ingots into thinner wafers, reducing loss of
unused ingot material (known as kerf), increasing recycling
rates and reducing consumables. 24 Other process innovations include reducing the amount of metallization pastes/
inks containing silver and aluminum, which are the most
process-critical and expensive non-silicon materials used
in current crystalline silicon cell technologies. 25

PHOTOVOLTAICS: TECHNOLOGICAL CATCH-UP AND COMPETITION IN THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN

Where are PV knowledge assets created?
Since 1975, the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) has been tracking the stakeholders – companies and academic institutions – achieving the world’s highest power conversion efficiencies
of PV cells in any of the different PV cell technologies
(see box 3.2). Over that period, world records have
been broken frequently within each PV cell family.
Moreover, record power conversion efficiencies
across all PV cell technologies have been achieved
almost every year since 2010, after two decades of
very slow progress. There has also been fast progress in all alternative technologies to crystalline PV,
such as multi-junction, single-junction, thin-film and
emerging PV cell technologies. 26

Who is behind these current and alternative PV product innovations? As shown in table 3.2, the United
States achieved 56 percent of the 289 observed world
efficiency records, followed by Germany (12 percent),
Japan (11 percent) and Australia (6 percent). These
four countries account for most of the documented
PV product innovations. The United States dominates
the best-in-class landscape across all PV cell types,
with particular strength in the alternative thin-film
and multi-junction PV cell innovations. Australia is
second in terms of breaking records for the current
crystalline PV cells, but has not achieved any record
for alternative PV technologies. Conversely, other
countries such as the Republic of Korea, Canada
and Switzerland have set records only in alternative
PV technologies.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

It seems that frontier innovation has not driven the
market dominance of Chinese firms. The greatest product innovations – in terms of improved
conversion efficiencies of different PV cell families – still appear to occur in other countries.
In contrast to these economies, China has achieved
global best-in-class technology only five times,
including three records in thin films, a technology
that is not yet commercialized.
A similar but more detailed picture can be seen when
patent applications for PV-related technologies are
analyzed (see figure 3.8). Growing market demand
for solar PV installations has been accompanied by
parallel growth in the number of patent applications
worldwide. First patent filings increased from less
than 2,500 in the early 2000s to over 16,000 in 2011.
Until 2008, most of these technologies originated in
Japan and the United States. Since then, China has
seen rapid growth in PV patenting, becoming the top
PV filing economy by 2010 and accounting for the
majority of filings by 2014.

Figure 3.8

With over 46 percent of the world’s first filings in the
period 2011-2015, China has now become the global
leader in PV-related patent filings (figure 3.10). It ranks
first in first filings for technologies related to each PV
segment, and has the majority of these in the case
of silicon, ingots/wafers and modules. But when
the specialization of Chinese firms between current
(crystalline) and alternative cell-related technologies is considered, a different picture emerges. As
observed for the world’s efficiency records, China
seems to have specialized more in alternative cell
technologies than crystalline ones. Indeed, China
holds the largest share of alternative cell patent
filings, while still behind Japan, the United States
and the Republic of Korea in filings for crystalline
technologies. These figures contrast with China’s
current competitive advantage as regards crystalline
PV cell production.

Most patenting activity happens in the two midstream
segments. More than half of all PV-related patents
filed in the period 2000-2015 concerned module
technologies, and almost a third related to cell ones (see
figure 3.9). Technologies related to silicon, ingots and
wafers accounted for less than 10 percent of patents.

This is not to say that innovation is less frequent in
the upstream and production equipment segments.
Indeed, field studies have found that companies patent
minor inventions intensively – particularly in China –
but critical inventions are usually kept secret. Many
of these critical innovations focus more on process,
which is often not carried out in specific R&D departments but directly on production lines, and protected
by secrecy rather than patenting. This is the case not
only for new-entrant Chinese companies, but also
for major Western and Japanese silicon producers,
which have developed advanced know-how on purifying silicon at reasonable cost that they keep secret.27

Cost-reducing process innovations
Neither power conversion records nor patents can
ensure the successful introduction of PV product innovations. As noted in box 3.2, for a new PV technology
to achieve success, it needs to be both reliable and
competitively priced, and while certain alternative PV
cell technologies have achieved impressive results
in the laboratory, they are not yet being offered on a
competitive scale.

Moreover, the products already in the market along the
PV value chain – from purified silicon to solar panels
– are highly standardized. Market competitiveness of
these mainly derives from the capability to manufacture
products that satisfy a standard level of quality at an
affordable cost. In this context, successful entry into
and survival within each market segment requires
access to state-of-the-art production technology, which
in turn requires international markets for production
equipment that are competitive.
This means that process innovations are instrumental
for introducing new PV products into the market and
maintaining existing ones. New technologies can only
be introduced into price-competitive markets if they
achieve large-scale production and are supported
by complementary process innovations to reduce
costs. In fact, several companies in the upstream and
midstream segments of the crystalline PV cell value
chain have only survived through high-level process
innovations that allowed them to reduce their production costs faster than their competitors operating in
the same segment.28

Who generates PV production equipment innovations?
Production equipment for crystalline PV initially came
from companies specialized in producing equipment
for the semiconductor and electronics industry. These
companies applied their technological capabilities
in the semiconductor industry to produce equipment suited for manufacturing ingots, wafers, cells
and modules. Semiconductor companies based in
the United States, Germany and Japan consistently
featured as the top companies in terms of market
share and quality of equipment for solar PV production equipment (see table 3.3).
Patent mapping complements this picture. Until 2012,
the United States and Japan largely dominated the
landscape of patent filings relating to production equipment. Since then, such filings have declined sharply;
they fell by around 60 percent between 2012 and 2015
(see figure 3.11). The drop was higher for the United
States and Japan, allowing China to claim the largest
share in this segment in 2012.

82

China accumulated one-third of the patents filed
during the period 2011-2015. Nevertheless, the United
States still accounted for almost half of all patent
filings relating to production equipment for crystalline or alternative cells in that period (see figure 3.10).
Japan and the Republic of Korea also rank higher
than China, which holds a very low proportion of
such patents.

How did China catch up technologically?
What has been the role of intangible assets in shaping
the current global PV value chain? Addressing this
question primarily entails understanding how Chinese
upstream and midstream firms acquired the necessary knowledge assets to enter at different stages
of the value chain. There were two main channels for
technology transfer to China: production equipment
and skilled human capital.

Chinese companies mostly acquired PV technologies
by purchasing production equipment from international suppliers.29 Pioneering Chinese firms entered
the market by purchasing production equipment from
Western providers.30 But technological knowledge
diffusion to China went beyond the transfer of such
equipment. Indeed, evidence of technological catchup is apparent from the progressive emergence of
equipment goods suppliers that are solely Chinese.
By 2016, almost half the world’s production equipment
firms were headquartered in China, with the next most
significant headquarter locations being the United
States, Germany and Japan (see table 3.4).

For instance, the founder and CEO of Suntech, China’s
largest PV company until 2013, studied at the University
of New South Wales in Australia and then worked for the
Australian company Pacific Solar. Three of the largest
Chinese companies – Shungfeng Suntech, Yingli and
Trina – were created by Chinese nationals who had
formerly been researchers in Australia, and nearly
two-thirds of the board members of the four largest
Chinese PV firms in 2016 – Trina, GCL Poly, Jinko Solar
and Canadian Solar – had studied or worked abroad.
All big companies have recruitment programs to attract
senior management from abroad.

The circulation of a skilled workforce has been another
factor aiding the success of Chinese firms in upstream
and midstream segments of the value chain.31 When
entering the industry in the 2000s, Chinese PV companies benefited strongly from the arrival of highly skilled
executives who brought capital, professional networks
and technology acquired in foreign companies and
universities to China.

Conversely, there is little evidence to support the
hypothesis that investment by multinational firms was
a decisive factor in the emergence of the Chinese
industry.32 Table 3.5 presents the top six cell or module
manufacturers located in China. Only two of them have
investment links with foreign companies. Moreover,
these FDI-based firms turn out to be late entrants
whose creation has followed in the footsteps of strictly
Chinese pioneer firms.

3.3 – What is the role of IP
in the PV industry?

How the PV value chain protects
its knowledge assets

This section looks in more detail at the role of IP in
protecting knowledge and reputational assets. It will
first consider how IP has been used to protect knowledge assets and its role in future technological appropriation by China, then examine recent trends in the
use of IP to protect reputational assets and ornamental
features of PV products.

Throughout the first decade of the 21st century, there
was a growing tendency to use patents to protect
knowledge assets for all the technologies in the
PV value chain (figure 3.11). The largest increases
were observed for cells and modules, which
peaked in 2011 at around 15,000 and 20,000 patent
applications, respectively.

PHOTOVOLTAICS: TECHNOLOGICAL CATCH-UP AND COMPETITION IN THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN

The growth in PV patenting activity has reversed
recently. Between 2011 and 2015, the number of
PV-related patent applications fell by 44 percent.
PV patent filings have also fallen as a share of global
patenting activity, decreasing 30 percent in just four
years. The fall has occurred across all segments of
the value chain, from silicon to module technologies,
but is particularly pronounced for silicon, cells and
equipment (figure 3.11).

There has also been dramatic change as regards the
country of origin of patent applications. PV-related
patent filings have fallen in all major innovating countries
with the notable exception of China (see figure 3.8).
At first sight, the downward trend in global PV patenting
since 2011 suggests that the outlook for technological
innovation in the sector is gloomy. Is patenting becoming
less attractive in the PV industry?

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

In fact, it appears that the decrease is driven by two
different forces. First, the number of applicants has
collapsed.33 Between 2011 and 2014, the number of
applicants from the United States, Germany, Japan
and the Republic of Korea declined, and entry of new
applicants fell even more sharply. This also implies
that, on average, the number of patent applications
filed per applicant has increased, particularly in the
main PV-producing countries. These trends are even
more marked for alternative types of PV cells, where
the decline in patent filings has been much lower.
The evolution of R&D intensity at major PV firms is
consistent with these patent figures (see table 3.6).
Almost all major players increased their R&D intensity
between 2010 and 2015 – sometimes substantially
– but their patenting activity grew even more. While
the relation between R&D expenditure and patents
is not straightforward, the disproportionate increase
in patenting activity compared with R&D intensity
suggests an increase in patenting intensity among
surviving firms across the industry.
In other words, what seems to be happening is the
following. Many players have exited the market and
entry is becoming even more difficult. However, surviving firms are reacting by increasing their innovation
efforts and filing more patents. In addition, these players
are reacting to the industry shake-up by focusing their
innovation efforts on the next generation of technologies. This suggests that IP-protected knowledge assets
may become more valuable in this time of sectoral
recomposition.

of PV technologies differs substantially across origins
and destinations (table 3.7). U.S. applicants are the
most foreign oriented across the main origins. Although
they file less than 40 percent of their applications in
any of the other main patent offices, the proportion is
even lower for applicants from Europe, Japan and the
Republic of Korea. Chinese applicants are the least
likely to file for foreign protection, which reinforces the
overall statistical trend away from internationalization
as they are the only ones increasing their PV-related
patent applications.

The second driving force is a reduction of the internationalization of PV patents. Patent applications can
be divided into first applications for patent protection
of an invention (known as first filings) and extensions
of protection to another country for existing patent
applications (known as subsequent filings). Both first
and subsequent filings grew rapidly in the PV industry
in the 2000s, but since 2011 both have fallen, with
subsequent filings falling even faster than first filings. In
the mid-2000s, each PV invention was filed on average
in three different patent offices; by 2015, that average
was only one-and-a-half.
This reduction suggests that more and more PV patent
applicants opt out of seeking international protection.
Virtually all PV patent applications from the main origins
are filed domestically first. But the internationalization

86

Worldwide extension of patent protection for PV-related
innovations is very limited. Indeed, a handful of economies – notably China, the United States, Japan, the
Republic of Korea and European countries – are
among the few locations where some patent protection is sought. Figure 3.12a shows that PV technologies
are virtually unprotected in all remaining economies,
including Australia, the Russian Federation, Latin
America, Africa and the Middle East. The huge number
of recent Chinese PV patent applications – most
protected only domestically – may affect these results
(see figure 3.12b). But the general distribution remains
qualitatively the same when these are excluded, as
shown for the distribution of PV patent families from
the United States in figure 3.12c.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

Can China sustain its position in PV
production without IP protection?

Crystalline PV cells

A striking finding from the patent analysis is the relative absence of Chinese applications at major patent
offices. This is a phenomenon that is not unusual in
terms of Chinese patenting activity generally; most
foreign extensions of Chinese patents are confined to
ICT-related technologies. The proportion of Chinese
PV-related patent applications filed at all main foreign
IP offices has never exceeded 2 percent. Shares for
PV technologies are slightly higher than those for
Chinese applications filed in these offices overall, but
still remarkably low.

PHOTOVOLTAICS: TECHNOLOGICAL CATCH-UP AND COMPETITION IN THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN

As shown in figure 3.13, there is some variation in the
internationalization of Chinese patent protection across
PV segments. Patents are more likely to be filed internationally in relation to PV cells than for any other PV
segment. In particular, international filings related to
PV cells peak at roughly 7 percent in both the United
States and through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)
System. The generally very low internationalization
rates for Chinese PV patenting contrast with Chinese
companies’ market share of around 80 to 90 percent
in most segments of the PV value chain.

Figure 3.14 illustrates this trend. All the main sources of
trademark data – the USPTO, WIPO’s Global Brands
Database and the Madrid System – support this finding, with figures for 2016 four to six times higher than
those for 2005.

Figure 3.14
Brand protection is increasingly
important in the PV market

There are, however, some differences across the type
of PV technology. The internationalization rate is significantly higher for Chinese patent filings related to crystalline cell technologies and production equipment for
both crystalline and alternative cells (figure 3.13). China
has a relatively small number of patents in these three
technologies, but they are remarkably likely to have
foreign extensions, especially in the United States.
It remains to be seen what the long-term impact of the
absence of international protection for most Chineseowned PV technologies will be. Will protecting them in
China only be enough to maintain Chinese producers’
commercial success, or does it give other industry
players an opportunity to come back? Only time will tell.

This is particularly the case if alternative technologies to
crystalline PV cells finally make their way to market. In
this respect, a few highly innovative firms and research
institutes with large patent portfolios and highly efficient
cells – such as Fraunhofer ISE, Sharp, IPFL and Boeing
Spectrolab – may be better positioned to exploit PV
products currently on the shelf.

MADRID SYSTEM

A brand new PV world?
There is increasing evidence of a growing role for reputational assets in downstream segments. This is very
relevant for at least two reasons. First, these are the more
profitable segments, where value added must to a great
extent be produced locally. Second, these segments
have a broader geographic distribution than upstream or
midstream ones, remaining located largely in industrialized economies such as Europe and the United States.
A sign of consolidation in the PV industry is the increasing
importance of branding-related activities. As demand
for PV technologies and their capacity have grown
exponentially in the past 10 years, so too has the use
of trademark protection for PV products and services.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

What lies behind this trend? One direct cause is simply
the rapid growth of the market. A complementary
explanation relates to the tight margins and vertical
integration discussed above. Most solar PV projects
are financed through debt financing from banks, meaning that interest rates account for a significant part of
the project cost. Interest rates are determined not just
by market risk, but also by technological risk, making
it particularly important for solar PV project developers to source technologies from recognized players.
The bank has to have confidence in both the project
developer’s reputation and the technological inputs
that will be employed. PV projects will be considered
“bankable” if they have demonstrated well-functioning
technologies in the market, providing stable electricity
generation and reliable project yields.
One way in which upstream and midstream companies have managed to maintain their profit margins is
by moving downstream to project development, to
demonstrate how well their technologies function in the
market. In this process, vertically integrated companies
have invested in building upstream and midstream
reputation – the so-called Tier 1 and 2 brands.
The increasing importance of private end-users of PV
technologies may also change the role of other knowledge and reputational assets along the PV value chain.
A disproportionate increase in PV-related service marks
hints at this downstream pull for branding activities in
the PV industry. Another increasingly important aspect
of intangibles concerns the aesthetics of PV modules
that are installed in private consumers’ residences.
Following this trend, other forms of IP – notably industrial designs – are likely to become more important in
the PV industry (see figure 3.15).

3.4 – Conclusion
The spatial evolution of the solar PV value chain resembles
that which occurred in many other industries such as
semiconductors, electronics and domestic appliances.
PV panels and systems are now mostly commodities rather than differentiated goods: their most relevant quality is how much electricity can be produced
per dollar invested. In this context, the dynamics of the industry have been profoundly driven by
strategies to reduce production costs, rather than
by product innovation.

90

An indication is that the market is still dominated by
the most mature technology – crystalline PV – while
alternative PV technologies bore great hopes in the
early 2000s, when market demand and prices for
solar PV technologies were high due to policy support
mechanisms in Europe.
As a result, PV products initially invented in the Western
world decades ago were no longer protected by
patents, and Chinese firms needed only to acquire the
knowledge to manufacture their components efficiently
along the value chain. This highlights two channels of
technology transfer. First, Chinese firms got access
to production equipment and turnkey fabrication lines
supplied by U.S., European and Japanese firms. The
production equipment was protected by patents to
some extent, but there was enough competition in
international markets to maintain reasonable prices.
Second, Chinese firms also relied on knowledge transmission through human capital, in the form of their
founders and workers who studied abroad in regions
that engaged with innovation in solar PV technologies. The PV industry is a case study of a complete
form of technology transfer to an emerging economy,
as indicated by the fact that Chinese firms have now
also become the leaders in PV production equipment.
Understanding how channels of knowledge transfer affect the spatial distribution of the value chain
has implications for future innovation. The solar PV
market is now saturated with an incumbent technology
whose depressed prices provide tight profit margins
for companies. Firms can dedicate their R&D efforts
either to high-level process innovations that will reduce
production costs in the dominant technology, or to new
solar PV product innovations whose production prices
are below those for the incumbent technology.
The major changes undergone by the global PV industry
during the last decade have been accompanied by a
renewed interest in intellectual property protection, as is
illustrated by the fact that companies that survived the
collapse in PV prices worldwide seem to have increased
their patenting propensity recently.
As this chapter has documented, IP protection of intangible assets was not a key determinant in the success
of Chinese companies, but it may well nevertheless
become a key ingredient for commercial success in
the coming decades.

Smartphones: what,s inside the box?
Smartphones are cellular telephones with an operating
system that allows consumers to tap into increasingly
rich mobile applications. They are produced by global
value chains composed of a few handset manufacturers that draw on a large range of communications
technology, component and software suppliers.
This chapter takes a look inside the smartphone global
value chain. It quantifies the value capture for three
recent top-end smartphones from market leaders
Apple, Huawei and Samsung, with a focus on the
creation and valorization of intangible assets.1 Section
4.1 details the characteristics of the underlying global
value chain; section 4.2 identifies who captures the
value of smartphone sales; section 4.3 assesses the
role of intangible assets and intellectual property in
value capture; and section 4.4 discusses the process
of technological learning.

4.1 – The smartphone
global value chain
Despite the leadership of a few firms in terms of
consumer market shares, a vast network of firms
operating in the electronics and software industry is
ultimately responsible for the conception and production of smartphones.

4.1.1 – The evolving nature of
the smartphone market
Over the last 20 years, cellular communications have
shifted from basic phones used for voice communications to smartphones used also for data-intensive
content applications. The smartphone industry has
grown from 124 million units sold in 2007 to 1.47
billion unit sales in 2016 with a total market value of
USD 418 billion.2 Globally, there are 3.8 billion users
today, and that figure is expected to reach 5.8 billion
by 2020, with growth mainly driven by uptake in
developing countries.3
While growth in the smartphone market has been
steady and strong, the handset providers leading the
industry have changed over time. The brands initially
dominating global smartphone sales were Nokia and
BlackBerry, but Apple and Samsung have taken their
place since 2011. The market continues to experience
exit and entry (table 4.1). Huawei, which only entered
in 2010, took third place in 2015.

Apple (57 percent) and Samsung (25 percent) dominate
the market for high-end phones – those costing more
than USD 400.4 The average selling price (ASP) of a
smartphone has declined from USD 425 in the period
2007-2011 to USD 283 in 2016, and phones fitted with
the Android mobile operating system are now significantly cheaper than Apple devices running iOS (see
table 4.2). The proportion of high-end smartphones
sold as a share of the entire smartphone market is
also declining, due partly to competition in the highend segment and partly to the rise of cheaper Chinese
brands in the mid- to low-end segment.5 While Chinese
smartphone makers Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo are still
relatively unknown to the average consumer outside
China, they are now among the top 10 in terms of global
smartphone sales.6

4.1.2 – Innovation in and the shape of
the global smartphone value chain
The smartphone global value chain involves the usual
stages of research and development (R&D), design,
manufacturing, assembly, marketing, distribution and
sales. It is organized not as a linear value chain, but
rather – to use concepts introduced in chapter 1 – in
a producer-driven “spider” form (see figure 4.1).
In this set-up, the lead firm operates under a strong
brand and is responsible for considerable R&D, product
design and product specifications. But Apple, Huawei
and Samsung source components and technology from
third parties, who are sometimes equally innovative and
active in producing intangible assets.
First, these lead firms require components and
access to standards-related technology. Apple
sources mainly from outside suppliers whereas
Huawei and Samsung source mainly from within
their firms. Certain inputs are commoditized, for
example resistors and wiring, while other, high-value,
components such as phone casings and chipsets
are highly specialized.

96

All these components also have their own global supply
chains. For example, a chip may be designed by a
specialized U.S. company for a smartphone supplier;
it is then manufactured in China and packaged in
Malaysia to reach the end-consumer.
Second, smartphone producers require access to
technology employed in interoperability and connectivity standards, such as the fourth-generation (4G)
Long-Term Evolution (LTE) cellular standard or the
802.11 Wi-Fi standard. Large companies such as
Nokia, Ericsson, Qualcomm, InterDigital, Huawei,
Samsung, NTT DoCoMo and ZTE contribute patented
technologies to the development of such standards,
which are defined by standard-setting organizations.
Typically, these technologies are licensed separately,
entailing the payment of licensing fees.
Third, smartphone firms require software – not only
a mobile operating system, but also other dedicated
mobile software applications, often from third parties.
Samsung, Huawei and others use Android, developed
by Google; Apple produces its own system, iOS.

Fourth, the assembly of the final product is often
undertaken by large original design or contract manufacturers such as Flextronics, Foxconn and Wistron.
These assemblers compete for high-volume – but often
low-margin – opportunities. Samsung, however, mostly
internalizes the assembly in its own factories, whereas
Huawei does both.
Finally, to distribute and retail its phones, Apple is
vertically integrated with its own online and physical
stores, whereas Samsung operates more through
regular distributors. Huawei operates a growing
number of exclusive retail outlets, not only in Asia.
Other Chinese brands still lack international distribution channels.8
As shown in table 4.3, the global value chain is made
up of some of the most R&D-intensive firms in the
world. These firms also regularly top the rankings of
innovative firms, including one of the newly emerging Chinese smartphone brands, Xiaomi.9 Innovation
occurs throughout the above smartphone value
chains, including both product innovation (i.e., the
introduction of new product features) and product
differentiation (i.e., the extent to which existing products differ along a set of characteristics).10 These
innovations occur in all parts of the global value chain:
(i) in cellular technology; (ii) in the various smartphone
components, in particular in the field of semiconductors as well as in batteries and displays; (iii) in the
design and functionality of smartphones, including
graphical user interfaces (GUI); and (iv) in the area
of software and applications. Even firms traditionally
associated with simple assembly, such as Foxconn,
spend considerable sums on R&D and own large
patent portfolios (see table 4.3).
This highly innovative smartphone global value chain,
composed of exclusive technology providers, is far
from stable. As the experiences of BlackBerry and
Nokia have shown, changing technology and consumer tastes can lead former top brands to drastically lose
market share. And as evidenced in the daily press,
change also occurs frequently within the supply chain.
Lead firms often decide to shift away from established
component suppliers; for example, Apple recently
shifted its purchases from Qualcomm to Intel.11 They
often also attempt to build high-value components and
IP internally, as seen in Huawei’s and Xiaomi’s quest to
develop their own chipsets and Apple’s efforts to build
graphics processing units (GPUs), turning away from
its former supplier, Imagination Technologies Group.12
98

Even the assembly of smartphones is shifting constantly, with lead firms often struggling to meet high demand,
leading to experiments with new manufacturers or
assembly locations such as India in the case of Apple
and Viet Nam in the case of Samsung.

4.2 – Value capture along the
smartphone value chain
Who captures most of the value from innovation along
the smartphone value chain?
This section addresses this question at the level of
specific phones and companies, for the Apple iPhone
7, Huawei P9 and Samsung Galaxy S7. For these
phones, released in 2016, estimates are produced by
subtracting the costs of purchased intermediate inputs
and direct labor costs along the various stages of the
global value chain from the wholesale price of each
phone (see box 4.1). The residual balance – referred
to as “value capture” or gross profits here – accrues
to Apple, Huawei or Samsung as lead firms in the
smartphone global value chain and as compensation
for their intangible assets.
Value capture at the product and firm level is the closest
one can get to the concepts of the global value chain
residual calculation and “returns to intangible assets”
developed in chapter 1. The underlying work in Chen
et al. (2017) discussed in that chapter can be seen as
the macro-equivalent of the calculations by Dedrick
and Kraemer (2017) presented here.
According to this approach, smartphone lead firms
and suppliers of high-end components capture a vast
part of the value generated from the sale of these three
top-of-the-line phones.

4.2.1 – A look inside a smartphone
Smartphones consist of anywhere between 1,500 and
2,000 physical parts. The most expensive input – up
to 20 percent of the total cost – is the touchscreen
module (see table 4.4). In decreasing order, the other
most expensive items are processors, memory and
storage, casing, camera, battery, printed circuits,
sensors, and assembly.
The location of core activities is depicted in table 4.5.
R&D and design usually occurs near the company’s
headquarters. Development is done jointly by the lead
firm and engineers from contract manufacturers.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

Suppliers of electronic components, whether low or
high end, are mostly located in the United States,
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan (Province of
China) and China.
Specifically, the role of U.S.-based suppliers ranges
from 29 percent to 45 percent of value capture for
handsets from the U.S. and the Republic of Korea,
but only 9 percent for Huawei’s P9 phone. Republic of
Korea-based suppliers account for 31 percent of the
value capture of suppliers for Samsung, while Chinesebased suppliers make up 34 percent of all suppliers
for Huawei.The leaders are in the U.S. (Apple, Google,
Qualcomm, Intel and a number of other component
makers), the Republic of Korea (Samsung, LG and
SK Hynix), Singapore (Broadcom), Taiwan (Province
of China) (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company, TSMC and some smaller chip and component makers), Japan (Japan Display, Sony, Murata) and
China (Foxconn, Huawei and its subsidiary HI Silicon,
plus Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and Lenovo).
Assembly is left to turnkey suppliers, mostly in China,
Japan and East Asia, and with little activity in other
world regions except incipient activity in Brazil and India.

4.2.2 – Value capture for high-end
smartphone models
Only a few country locations, mostly the United States
and a few Asian countries, capture the vast majority
of value in smartphone production. Besides the cost
of materials, a significant share goes to retailing, to IP,
and directly as value capture to the lead firm. Indeed,
the “lead firm advantage” – associated in earlier studies only with Apple – also extends to other high-end
smartphone manufacturers.
The breakdown of smartphone retail prices shows that
the value capture of the lead firm is far more than the
combined value captured by, or gross profits of, all the
suppliers; USD 283 for Apple as compared to USD
71 for suppliers; USD 228 for Samsung as compared
to USD 76 for suppliers; and USD 188 for Huawei as
compared to USD 47 for suppliers (see box 4.1).
Applying the above methodology, figure 4.4 shows
the value captured in USD terms as a percentage
of the smartphone retail price. The results underline the advantageous position of the lead firms in
general, and Apple in particular. At the macro-level,
the electronics sector saw an increase in the share
100

of intangible asset income as a percentage of total
value over the period 2000-2014 (see chapter 1). It
also confirms that in producer-driven global value
chains, the returns do indeed rest with activities
before the final production stage.
As a proxy for value capture, Apple keeps 42 percent
of the retail price of each iPhone sold (or USD 270),
Huawei 42 percent (USD 203) and Samsung 33
percent (USD 221.76). Huawei’s selling price is lower,
thanks to its reliance on low-cost components in part
produced internally by its subsidiary Hi-Silicon, and
reflecting its pricing strategy as it competes with
a large number of other Android phone makers.
Samsung’s value capture is hurt by its greater reliance on retailers and carriers to sell its products.
The figures for value capture include wages and
salaries for R&D, design, management, marketing
and whatever these lead firms do to generate a
competitive advantage.

SMARTPHONES: WHAT'S INSIDE THE BOX?

Box 4.1
The smartphone value capture model – analytical approach and limitations
Value capture at each stage of the global value chain is calculated by subtracting the costs of purchased intermediate
inputs and direct labor costs along the various stages of the
global value chain and the distribution costs from the selling
price of the specific phone (see figure 4.2 and figure 4.3). This
amount includes the direct cost of materials used in creating
the product along with the direct labor costs used to produce
it – including assembly and testing – defined as “cost of goods
sold” (COGS).13 Teardown reports from IHS Markit are used to
estimate these costs to arrive at the residual value capture.14
The value capture pays for selling, general and administrative
expenses (SG&A), R&D and other indirect costs, with the rest
being the return to the firm or ultimately the shareholders, which
also ultimately constitutes the lead firm’s return on its tangible
and intangible capital. Figure 4.3 compares the concept of
value capture to value added. Five limitations are noteworthy.
First, the supplier and component lists in teardown reports
are incomplete, and prices – so-called “rack rates” – may be
overestimates when firms are able to negotiate bulk discounts
or they produce these components internally. For example, the
display in the Samsung S7 – the most expensive component
– is sourced from Samsung Display by Samsung Electronics.
In the teardown reports the market value of USD 55 is applied,
whereas the actual cost may be lower.15
Second, independently of the country in question, firm-level
information about pure value added is not readily available
because publicly listed companies do not generally reveal the
amount of their wages for “direct labor.” Instead, the wage bill for
assembly by third parties is hidden within “cost of goods sold”
or “cost of sales.” As a result, the difference between “net sales”
and “cost of goods sold” is used as a proxy for value capture.
Third, it is assumed that R&D and other intangible asset-related
value capture originates and accrues to the company headquarters, including in the form of R&D staff wages.

Today, these multinational companies arguably conduct a
share of such functions abroad. The “stickiness” of value or
profits to the headquarters location that is assumed in such
accounting-based studies – and thus the assumption that
all value captured by Apple, for example, is generated and
kept in its main location, the U.S. – may thus be exaggerated.
Indeed, Apple’s 2017 Annual Report shows that the U.S. has
less than one-half of its global operating income, and less
than two-thirds of its long-lived assets. Furthermore, since
Apple’s public stock is owned by global investors, its profits
distributed as dividends or capital gains are widely distributed
globally. So more information is needed to better measure key
metrics for affiliated entities within a global value chain of a
multinational corporation, and more data to test or specifically
analyse the geographic location of economic activity, including
profits from IP, across jurisdictions.
Fourth, teardown reports focus on physical components; they do
not cover intangibles, including payments for IP. To get a sense
of the total return to intangible assets, obtaining estimates for
IP-related value is necessary. This is challenging as IP-related
transactions are often undisclosed and sometimes indirect.16
As a proxy, in this exercise the licensing royalties for SEPs
are calculated as 5 percent of the phone’s cost on average
(section 4.2.2). Other IP-related value or payments are even
harder to trace, notably those related to internally developed
or externally sourced software. For example, the actual cost
of using third-party software is unknown. This may well inflate
the value capture of the lead firm, though without reducing the
estimate for overall returns to intangible capital. In addition,
some IP-based transactions such as cross-licensing do not
leave a monetary trace, but are still very valuable.17
Finally, this methodology abstracts from the large interconnected revenues of the telecommunications operators, and the
increasing share of lead-firm revenues driven by accessories,
content and services.18

SMARTPHONES: WHAT'S INSIDE THE BOX?

Figure 4.4 also shows the value captured by other
firms in selected countries. For example, other U.S.
firms capture 3 percent of the retail price of an iPhone.
As outlined in box 4.1, it is important to remember that
the full value capture may not accrue to the headquarters location; subsidiaries in other countries may share
in the benefit.19 Apple is a multinational company with
entities spread throughout the world (e.g., Ireland). To
enable more detailed, country-specific breakdowns,
more information would be needed to better measure
key metrics for affiliated entities within a global value
chain of a multinational corporation, and more data to
analyze the geographic location of economic activity,
including profits from IP, across jurisdictions.
Finally, figure 4.4 shows that the amount paid for IP
to third parties varies from USD 34 per phone for
Samsung to USD 32 for Apple to USD 24 for Huawei.
In the following discussion, these costs are subtracted
to ultimately yield the value capture of the lead firm,
but for our broader analysis these sums constitute an
important part of the return to intangible assets across
the global value chain, earned here by the owners of
cellular technology. Firms such as Qualcomm and
others which do not generate revenues from the
sale of smartphones spend considerable amounts
on communication-technology-related R&D, thereby
enabling the functionality of smartphones. These
payments help to finance these high R&D costs, and
allow for specialization in the marketplace.

4.2.3 – Who reaps most of the value
of high-end smartphone sales?
For all three phones, capture of value added is largely
detached from the flow of physical goods. 20
While the value capture shares of the three firms are
comparable at the level of the product (the individual
phone), at the firm level Apple accounts for a large
chunk of overall profits in the industry. By selling
only high-end phones, Apple is able to capture a
whopping 90 percent of the profits of all smartphone
makers, according to third-party estimates, even
though it only accounts for 12 percent of all smartphones sold. 21
Apple captures most of the industry profits thanks to
its high prices, large profit margins and the volume
of iPhone sales worldwide (see table 4.6).

Its value capture in U.S. dollars is much larger than
Samsung or Huawei’s, as Apple sells significantly more
high-end phones (over 215 million units, compared to 88
million for Samsung and 25 million for Huawei; see table
4.6). When the three companies’ high-end phone sales
for 2016 are compared, Apple walks away with 83 percent
of the combined profits generated by the Apple iPhone 6,
Huawei P8 and Samsung Galaxy 6 (see table 4.6). These
exceptionally large benefits for Apple are a function of its
investments in R&D, design and other intangible assets.
They also allow it to spread its significant marketing and
overhead costs over a higher volume of sales.
Samsung and Huawei capture high value on their most
expensive phones, but their overall margins are reduced
by the large number of low-cost products they sell.
Furthermore, this calculation abstracts from the smartphone content and services revenues generated on
the basis of the handheld device after its sale. Apple’s
strategy to integrate everything from the supply of
the phone to the delivery of content and services and
related standards plays a significant role in its value
capture outside, driven by platform lock-in, network
externalities and the ability to bundle products efficiently.22 And, although omitted here, these revenues
are on the rise in absolute terms and as a share of
Apple’s revenues.23 Other lead firms, however, see these
added value and profits accrue to other providers as
they do not partake in the added revenues generated
in the sale of digital items, online content and services.
Yet Apple is not alone in capturing high profits and
value. Component suppliers reap significant revenues
and margins too, in particular when linked to proprietary technologies. As opposed to volume effects,
smartphone suppliers experience significant variance
in their margins. Qualcomm, for example, stands out for
its significant value capture, a result of the performance
of its baseband chipsets.24 Qualcomm’s value capture
is far higher than that of MediaTek, reflecting the fact
that it sells to premium-tier phone makers whereas
MediaTek sells to low-price phone makers. In markets
such as displays and memory, too, the dominant player,
Samsung, earns 60 percent margins, while memory
maker Micron Technologies settles for 20 percent.25
This high variance continues to the level of the
contract manufacturers. Most earn low margins
while still benefiting from high-volume activity and
an important opportunity for technological learning
(discussed further in section 4.4).

4.3 – The role of intangible assets in
value capture
How do intangible assets, and IP in particular, relate
to the value capture discussed above?
The ability to sell a smartphone at a profit depends
largely on its performance, features, brand name,
design and applications. In this chapter, value capture
is a measure of the return to the firm’s intangible
assets. To protect their intangible assets and reap
some related dividends, the actors in the smartphone
industry which benefit from high value capture – as
set out in section 4.2 – make extensive use of the full
spectrum of IP rights.26
But is IP the main cause of value capture?
A leading study on the Apple iPhone calculates the
value of patentable technologies in the iPhone as a
part of Apple’s total stock market value.27 Estimates
of brand value, smartphone design and their value as
driver of a firm’s market value also exist (discussed
further below in sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3).
104

But these studies rest on a number of strong assumptions. Despite a high correlation between value
capture and the use of IP, a direct causal relationship
between these two factors is hard to estimate, as is
the specific value captured by selected IP assets.
IP is usually only a source of competitive advantage
when combined with complementary assets such
as organizational expertise and human capital plus
management skills and effective firm strategies. 28
When enforceable without excessive costs, the value
of IP is both direct (i.e., with revenue impacts) and
indirect (i.e., it produces defensive or strategic value).
In light of these complexities, even smartphone
makers themselves are unlikely to have full evidence
of the specific value of their different IP assets.
The next sections shed light on the role of intangible
assets and IP in value capture. Less formal appropriation schemes such as trade secrets play an important
role, but are not included in the analysis as they are
even harder to measure.

SMARTPHONES: WHAT'S INSIDE THE BOX?

4.3.1 – Smartphone inventions drive a
significant number of patent filings
Most industry experts and academics agree that
a vast number of patents are part and parcel of
modern smartphones.
One widely used source states that 27 percent of
patents granted in the U.S. were related to mobile
phones, up from 20 percent in 2012 and 10 percent
in 2002.29 The following calculations show that this is
potentially an underestimate, if a broad definition of
smartphone-related patents is used (see figure 4.5).
Another frequently cited source dating back to 2012
claims that one in every six patents in force – or about
16 percent of all active patents filed at the United States
Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) – are smartphonerelated; other estimates argue that the number of active
patents relevant to today’s smartphones has increased
from 70,000 in the year 2000 to 250,000 now, mainly due
to the expanded set of features and functionalities.30 The
methodologies by which these sources arrive at these
figures are mostly undisclosed and unverifiable.
Mapping the exact number of smartphone-related
patents is a ferociously complex task (see box 4.2
on the approaches taken in this chapter). No simple
technology field in international or national patent
classifications easily corresponds to the smartphone
product, and several issues further complicate the
smartphone patent mapping.
First, a smartphone consists of many different technological components, some of which might not be
unique to smartphones alone. Instead the components
identified in section 4.2 range from semiconductors to
memory, to other types of computer or communication
technologies. While these items are integral to smartphones, they are also core to most other information
and communication technology (ICT) products, and
increasingly also to other product types which have
connectivity as a built-in component, e.g., cars, fridges
and medical technology. Assigning them to smartphones uniquely would be wrong.
Second, a number of inventions are core to the smartphone but are not found in the technology fields most
strictly related to modern smartphone technology, for
example patent classifications which relate directly to
“portable communication terminals” or “telephone sets.”

Some are inventions in traditional sectors, outside the
ICT industry, such as glass-related patents providing for
more durable smartphone casing. Others are inventions
in high-technology fields such as navigation displays,
sensors and fingerprint technology. If one opens the
door to software and other mobile applications which
relate to e-commerce, social networks, payment, fitness,
or health, the number of potentially relevant patents is
even higher. Consequently, it is challenging to identify
all relevant patents by traditional search methods which
rely on patent classifications or keywords such as
“smartphone”; in any case, the related inventions are
also typically not unique to smartphones alone.
In the patent-mapping exercise conducted for this report,
both a “narrow” and a “broad” smartphone grouping
were calculated (see box 4.2). Invariably, the approaches
chosen in smartphone patent-mapping exercises will be
too constricted in the narrow category or too comprehensive in the broad category. The gap between the
two estimates does, however, give a good sense of the
sheer number of potential smartphone patents involved.
That said, by any account, smartphone-related patents
have increased steadily in recent years, including as a
share of total patents.
In the aggregate data, in 2016 patent applications under
the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) at WIPO related to
digital communication accounted for the largest share of
total PCT applications, followed by computer technology (17,155).31 In fact, digital communication overtook
computer technology – which held the top position in
2014 and 2015 – to become the top technological field
in 2016. It has been experiencing some of the fastest
growth in terms of new PCT filings. In 2014, the latest
year for which national patent filing data are available,
the field of digital communication also saw its fastest
annual growth of any year since 2005.32
The patent mapping performed for this chapter shows
that between 1990 and 2013 the number of smartphone
first patent filings worldwide grew from about 100
patents in the early 1990s to about 2,700 patents in
the narrow category in 2013, and from about 230,000
first filings (or about 350,000 patents overall) in the
early 1990s to more than 650,000 first filings (or about
1.2 million patents overall) in the broad category. In
the broad category – and bearing in mind that many
of these patents are not exclusive to smartphones –
this represents about 30-35 percent of patents filed
worldwide between 1990 and 2013.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

Box 4.2

Figure 4.5

Mapping smartphone patents

The number of smartphone patent
filings is large and growing

To mitigate the complexity of identifying smartphone
patents, two approaches were chosen for the patentmapping analysis discussed in this chapter. One uses a
narrow choice of applied patent classifications as relevant
to smartphones, the other a broader combination of more
comprehensive lists of pertinent patent classifications plus
company names and keywords.
1. The narrow approach
A list of restricted Cooperative Patent Classification
(CPC) codes was used – mainly H04M 1/72519 (“Portable
communication terminals with improved user interface to
control a main telephone operation mode or to indicate the
communication status”) and H04M 1/247 (“Configurable
and interactive telephone terminals with subscriber controlled features modifications”), plus a number of related
sub-codes.33 As the figures in this chapter show, these
narrow choices necessarily lead to a gross underestimate
of smartphone patents.
2. The broad approach
This involved the application of a broad list of International Patent Classification (IPC) codes generated by the
identification of the most pertinent IPC categories in:

Some of these IPC classes are strictly related to smartphones and mobile communication in general. Others were
generated by conducting keyword searches within the
IPC classes and in patent databases – mostly Espacenet
and the database of the German patent office – with the
help of patent examiners.35 A list of companies involved
in the smartphone global value chain was compiled for
further checks of the data. The objective was to single
out IPC codes which might cover smartphone-related
technologies, going beyond a narrow subset, but also
covering the multiple technology areas highlighted later
in figure 4.10, for example. This search strategy yielded
patents in fields such as vehicles, cameras and some of
the fields mentioned above, but the problem with this
approach is that it yields a large number of patents, and
some IPC classes such as semiconductors or cameras
are essential but not exclusive to smartphones.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

On both the narrow and broad definitions, the U.S.,
China, Japan and the Republic of Korea are the
leading origins of smartphone patents worldwide,
followed by patent filers based in Canada, Germany
and Finland in the narrow category, and Germany,
France, the Russian Federation and Canada in the
broad category. Across both definitions, two trends
stand out: (i) the shares of Japan and Germany (and in
the narrow category, Germany and Finland) declined
between 1990-1999 and 2005-2014; and (ii) the shares
of China and the Republic of Korea rose markedly
– mostly at the expense of Japan but not the U.S.,
whose share is increasing in the broad category. These
trends correspond with the finding that IP capacity in
relation to smartphones has built up significantly in
these two economies (see figure 4.6). The U.S., Japan
and the Republic of Korea are the leading origins of
smartphone patents at the USPTO.
Where are smartphone patents filed worldwide, including by firms such as Apple, Huawei and Samsung?
Although the lead firms involved in producing smartphones are heavily concentrated in a few countries
such as the U.S., the Republic of Korea and China,
smartphone inventors seek protection in multiple
destinations; see figure 4.7, depicting smartphone
patent families.36 The U.S. is the most sought-after
destination, followed by Europe, Japan and China,
the Republic of Korea and, to a significant but lesser
extent, Canada and Australia. Additional jurisdictions
across the world also receive smartphone patent
applications, including many economies in Latin
America, the Russia Federation and Central Asia,
other parts of Asia including Indonesia, but also South
Africa, other parts of Africa and Australia.
The strong growth in smartphone-related patenting is
first and foremost a reflection of the desire of inventors to appropriate the returns to their considerable
innovation investments.37
In addition, the use of IP goes beyond the appropriation
of innovation rents alone. In the smartphone industry,
IP is also an important enabler of collaboration.38 A
smartphone would not see the light of day without
extensive vertical and horizontal partnerships, and
these are often enabled by IP. In the case of certain
technologies, hundreds or sometimes thousands of
patent holders, both firms and universities, supply
inventions to form a new technology.

108

In the case of Bluetooth 3.0, which enables short range
connectivity between the smartphone and other devices, more than 30,000 patent holders have contributed,
including 200 universities.39
The use of IP also allows specialization. While most
smartphone-related patents are held by large firms,
including for defensive purposes, smaller and/or
specialized component suppliers make extensive use
of the IP system, affording scope for market entry.40
For example, Corning, the producer of the Gorilla glass
in Apple iPhones and a leading glass maker, files a
significant number of patents.
In addition, major technologies relevant for smartphones are published via the patent system years, or
sometimes decades, before actual commercialization of
the knowledge, leading to effective knowledge transfer
and possible technological learning.41
At the same time, the smartphone industry has experienced quite a patent build-up and related high-profile
disputes in recent years. In the U.S., for example, the
Apple-Samsung case produced one of the five largest
initial adjudicated damages sums in the period 19972016, attracting considerable media attention.42 In this
context one may ask: do the increasingly strategic
use of IP and the increase in legal disputes harm the
smartphone industry?
In truth, the exact litigation costs to firms and the
system-wide costs are unknown.
On the one hand, such disputes and their eventual resolution are a means for firms to attempt to appropriate
the returns to their intangible assets. They are a reflection and byproduct of competition in a highly innovative
marketplace with high stakes.43 They are also a reflection of the substantial use of IP in this industry. And the
smartphone industry is by no means special. Based on
U.S. IP litigation data, other industries such as consumer
products, biotech and pharma, computer hardware and
software are considerably more litigation intensive.44
On the other hand, litigation may well impose considerable costs on firms without necessarily creating
legal certainty. The Apple-Samsung case provides
a prominent example – ongoing in multiple jurisdictions, and with heterogonous and fluctuating
outcomes. In this respect, a related source of concern
is the amount of litigation and the possible deadweight losses in legal expenditures.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

An important question arises from an economic
point of view: does the large number of smartphone
patents truly incentivize investment in discovery and
innovation? Or do these patents instead facilitate anticompetitive behavior by allowing incumbent firms to
block key technologies, thereby reducing competition
rather than rewarding continued innovation? In other
words, the effects of large volumes of smartphone
patents on follow-on innovation or market entry are
of considerable interest.
Again, the definitive verdict on this issue is not out yet,
but recent history testifies to continued smartphone
innovation on both the hardware and application sides,
and by both smartphone lead companies and an everchanging array of component and service suppliers.
And the rapid changes in the market shares of key
firms in recent years would also seem to indicate
solid competition among both large and smaller firms.
Moreover, firms have increasingly used market-based
strategies to overcome scattered IP rights and solve
disputes. Firms engage in collaborative IP strategies
involving technology cross-licensing, patent pools,
patent clearing houses and other collaboration. IP
disputes have often been the effective trigger for
amicable solutions – a recent example being the
patent licensing deal signed by Nokia and Apple in
the first half of 2017, ending all IP-related litigation
between the two companies and triggering other
forms of collaboration.

Standard-essential patents
The identification of standard-essential patents (SEPs)
related to smartphones is simpler than mapping all
smartphone-related patents. The IPlytics database
was used; this combines IPC/CPC clusters with industry concordances focusing on SEPs in the ICT field.
A relatively high share of smartphone patenting relates
to SEPs in the field of communication technologies
(see figure 4.1).45 These IP-enabled standards expand
the potential licensing markets, encouraging investment in R&D.46
Over time, and as faster cellular and more complex
technologies are developed, SEPs associated with
these technologies have increased.

110

As illustrated in figure 4.8, the fourth-generation
LTE cellular standard is associated with almost four
times as many declared SEPs than the earlier, less
complex, second-generation Global System for Mobile
Communications (GSM) standard, and almost double
the number for the third-generation Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System (UMTS).

Figure 4.9 shows the breakdown for the GSM (top)
and the more recent, fourth-generation, LTE standard
(bottom). Over time, European and U.S. telecommunication companies’ share of SEPs has declined whereas
new entrants in the U.S. (mostly Internet firms such as
Google) and new smartphone brands in the Republic of
Korea (Samsung) and China (ZTE, Huawei) have seen
their share grow – in part to utilize cross-licensing,
reduce payments and fend off litigation. In addition to
highlighting the fact that Asian players have become
very active in contributing to the development of standards, these figures also demonstrate that firms such
as Apple contribute less to their development.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

Some of these SEPs were developed internally whereas
others were acquired as part of patent portfolios, with,
for example, Apple, Microsoft and others buying the
Nortel patent portfolio, Google buying the Motorola
portfolio and Lenovo buying an SEP portfolio from
Unwired Planet that Unwired Planet had originally
acquired from Ericsson. Lenovo also later acquired
parts of the Motorola portfolio from Google.47 Moreover,
patent assertion entities (PAEs) such as Intellectual
Ventures and Rockstar have been increasing their
ownership share.48
While the share of litigated SEPs in total declared SEPs
has been increasing over time up to 2015, the broader
ownership of patent portfolios seems to have encouraged cross-licensing deals and patent pools, potentially
reducing litigation in years to come. A drop in related
litigation has been observable since 2012.49
Looking forward, firms are currently working on obtaining a stake in fifth-generation mobile technology, with a
lead role for Huawei, Samsung and selected Japanese
firms, but also for European and U.S. companies such
as Nokia, Qualcomm, Ericsson and Orange. Other
Internet firms are also claiming their stake; Google, for
example, has made related acquisitions.50
For the purposes of this study, sensible estimates
for the value of SEP-related licensing payments are
required so as to better approximate total returns to
intangible assets.

The percentages used here – and also to derive value
capture in section 4.2 – are conservative estimates.
Moreover, they exclude IP revenues generated via
technologies covered by implementation patents.

Implementation patents

Unfortunately, most suppliers do not report licensing
data, and for those who do, it is challenging to single
out the income which is indeed driven by smartphone
SEPs. Fortunately, a number of reports exist in the
field, with some – often from the camp of licensees –
suggesting that so-called “royalty stacks” are excessive
while others – often from licensors – argue that they
are reasonable.51 Based on these studies, it is assumed
here that SEP licensing costs range from 3 to 5 percent
of the retail price of a phone (see box 4.1 and table 4.7).52

Implementation patents involve technologies that can
provide differentiation for specific products for individual manufacturers. Both lead firms and component
suppliers patent and license such technology. The
former, for example, might acquire a license to use
a microprocessor from companies such as ARM.54
For some firms, including Microsoft and BlackBerry,
licensing their patents to third parties is at the core of
their operations, whereas firms such as Apple do not
license their patents.

At the level of individual firms the related incomes
are significant. Annual reports show that Nokia, for
example, generated about USD 1 billion in licensing
revenues in 2016 (and a predicted EUR 800 million in
2017), while Ericsson earned around USD 1.2 billion
in 2016.53 Two-thirds of Qualcomm’s revenues in 2016
came from chip sales (USD 15.4 billion), and one-third
from licensing its technology (USD 7.6 billion).

Figure 4.10 illustrates the technology areas with the
majority of implementation patents beyond the SEPs
discussed earlier.55 In terms of technology fields, the
most important ones are in the areas of image display
and screen (and more recently organic light-emitting
diode screens), battery, antenna and more softwarerelated ones like mapping, calendar management,
voice recognition and other features in the field of
artificial intelligence.56

Smartphone patents worldwide are led by Samsung
Electronics, LG Electronics, NEC Corporation – a
Japanese IT services and product firm – and Qualcomm
in the broad category, and LG Electronics, Samsung
Electronics, Research in Motion and Nokia in the
narrow category. Over time, NEC and Motorola have
become less important players while others such as
Apple, Microsoft and Google have joined the fray (see
figure 4.11). As expected – see also table 4.8 – Apple’s
share of patent filings is more significant in the narrow
smartphone category than if one considers broad fields
of related technologies in which other firms excel.

Casing

Smartphone patents at the USTPO during the period
2000-15 were led by Samsung Electronics and Apple
when the narrow definition is applied, and by IBM and
Samsung under the broad definition (table 4.8). Thanks
to its recent strong wave of patent filings, Huawei now
ranks among the top 40 smartphone patent filers at
the USPTO. In the broad category, however, Honghai
Precision files more USPTO patents than Huawei,
echoing a trend signaled earlier in this chapter. Table
4.8 also features some non-practicing entities such as
ELWHA, a holding company of Intellectual Ventures, as
well as universities such as the University of California.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

The patents and other rights related to software and
applications are important intangible assets, possibly
determining a large share of future value capture.
By using its own mobile operating system, Apple
gains greater control of the downstream market for
applications and content, such as on the App Store,
typically asking 30 percent of in-app purchases from
application developers, dropping to 15 percent under
special conditions later.57 According to information
produced in IP-related litigation and unconfirmed
reports in the press, firms such as Google paid
Apple USD 1 billion in 2013 and possibly three times
that amount in 2017 to be the default search engine
in mobile Safari, the pre-installed web browser on
iPhones and other iOS devices.58
Android is monetized in a different way, not through
charging a direct usage fee. If phone makers want
to run Android on their phones, they need to install
the Google ecosystem (Search, Play Store, Maps)
on their phone. Google makes money from Android
in two ways: it takes a proportion of the sales of
apps and media on the Google Play Store, and it
shows display advertising to Android users. Google
excludes phone makers from any revenue from the
Play Store, reducing their ability to generate revenues
from downstream content and services markets.
Firms such as Samsung using the Android system
have also decided to pay significant patent royalties to
Microsoft to settle claims by Microsoft that Google’s
Android violates Microsoft patents. Samsung made a
royalty payment of over USD 1 billion to Microsoft in
2013, according to court filings and news articles.59

4.3.2 – Smartphone design
is critical to consumers
The literature, consumer surveys and court decisions
find that smartphone design – both physical and
software-related – is one of the most critical factors
driving consumer purchase decisions, technology
acceptance and later brand loyalty.60 This is particularly the case when technical features are the same
across phones.
Understandably, then, all three handset lead firms in
question invest considerable sums in new designs
and related partnerships, and in recruiting a large
number of designers.

116

Industrial designs are held mostly by large lead
firms rather than component suppliers and smaller
entities.61 An econometric study suggests that in the
case of Apple, filing industrial designs – referred to as
design patents in the U.S. – is actually more important
to the evolution of the firm’s stock market value than
patents.62 In the well-known Apple-Samsung case,
industrial design infringement and the copying of the
look of Apple’s smartphones – including elements
of GUIs, especially icons – were the subject of legal
dispute in U.S. and other courts.63 Since the Apple
-Samsung jury award in 2012 in the U.S., industrial
design filings have also been increasing at the USPTO
– potentially in part due to the high damages initially
awarded to Apple (see also figure 4.12).64 At time of
writing, this case is not fully closed in the U.S.: the
Supreme Court reversed the first trial decision in
December 2016. Furthermore, related litigation is
still pending or has produced different outcomes in
other jurisdictions. All of this illustrates the inherent
legal uncertainty associated with enforcing industrial
designs. Still, the court cases and ensuing design
filing activity reflect a broader movement toward
using industrial designs as a tool for appropriating
innovation rents in conjunction with other IP forms.
A look at the leading industrial design filers illustrates the point: Samsung, Sony, Microsoft, LG,
Hon Hai Precision/Foxconn and Apple were among
the top holders of design patents at the USPTO in
2015.65 Identifying industrial designs which relate to
the specific smartphones used in section 4.2, or to
smartphones in general, is complicated by various
factors.66 For a start, there is no specific classification
for smartphones in the International Classification
for Industrial Designs under the Locarno Agreement,
or in the United States Patent Classification System
(USPC). Industrial designs for smartphones do not
just concern the device itself, but also GUIs, icons,
display screens, and so on. Moreover, some of the
GUIs and icons are used across different product
groups. For example, an industrial design for an
Apple icon or GUI is likely to be used across all Apple
family products (iPhone, iPad, iPod, etc.), and is thus
not exclusively a smartphone design. Some Samsung
GUIs may apply to washing machines, fridges, photo
cameras or video cameras.

Figures 4.11 and 4.12 present the industrial designs
protected by Apple, Samsung Electronics and
Huawei using data from the USPTO and the European
Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). In the
case of the USPTO, USPC class D14 (Recording,
Communication, or Information Retrieval Equipment)
was used as a starting point to then filter further
using patent titles. The same approach was used
for the EUIPO, with the difference that the initial
dataset included all applications for classes 14-03
(Communications Equipment, Wireless Remote
Controls and Radio Amplifiers) and 14-04 (Screen
Displays and Icons) of the International Locarno
classification for Industrial Designs.

The design portfolios of Apple and Samsung at the
USPTO and the EUIPO are large and have been growing, with a particularly big spike in 2012 or 2013 (see
figure 4.12). As noted above, Apple’s initial success in
enforcing a GUI design against Samsung in the U.S.
courts may have contributed to this GUI filing growth.
The number of registrations by Samsung Electronics
far outstrips those of Apple, but this most likely also
reflects potential measurement issues as Samsung
is a more diversified electronics conglomerate than
Apple. While Huawei has started registering industrial
designs in recent years, Apple and Samsung still
own considerably more extensive design portfolios.
The portfolios of designs protected by the three
companies are also distinct. A large proportion
of Huawei designs protected at the USPTO (41.9
percent, or 18) in the period 2007-2015 were designs
of phones themselves. In contrast, most of Apple’s
designs in the same period were for GUIs (75.2
percent). Samsung Electronics designs were also
mainly GUIs (43.7 percent of total), but followed
in absolute number of registrations by designs for
phones themselves (30.9 percent). Apple’s design
registrations at the EUIPO were largely for GUIs
(70.1 percent of total), while all of Huawei’s were for
phones. There was a major peak in design registrations around 2012-2013, following the AppleSamsung legal dispute. Industrial designs in these
two years alone represent 42.4 percent of all Apple’s
designs at the USPTO in the period 2007-2015, and
22.2 percent at the EUIPO. For Samsung they represent 44.1 percent of total designs in the period 20072015 at the USPTO and 44.3 percent at the EUIPO.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

Over time, the design portfolios of the three companies
have also changed. Apple was an early mover in the
industry. It filed a total of 370 designs at the EUIPO
in 2007 and 2008 – 35.7 percent of its total in the
period 2007-2015 – coinciding with the release of
the first iPhone. None of these registrations related
to the smartphone design itself, but rather to GUIs
(69.2 percent) and icons (30.8 percent). This is not
surprising given that most of Apple’s designs are
not iPhone specific, but are used across Apple
products. Since then, Apple has been registering
industrial design registrations (or design patents in
the U.S.) at the USPTO and the EUIPO less frequently.
It is hard to know the exact reasons for this trend,
but one possible explanation is that Apple’s design
ecosystem and identity have now been set up and
are relatively mature.
In contrast, Samsung’s portfolio has been more
volatile. Its registrations of designs of GUIs and
icons have increased over time, while those for
smartphones themselves have decreased. Samsung
could be following Apple’s strategy and adapting
to the market, particularly after 2012 and the GUI
legal dispute.
Finally, Huawei is an emerging player in the industry,
with a low absolute number of design registrations
relative to Apple and Samsung. All its registrations
at the EUIPO are for the smartphone itself, although
it has patented designs for GUIs at the USPTO.
Protection of designs for smartphones and related
GUIs and icons seems to be increasingly important.
In many jurisdictions, these types of designs are
among the fastest growing and represent the types
of designs for which industrial design protection is
most frequently sought, by both local designers and
those based abroad.67 Often, GUIs impact not only
appearance but also functionality – not covered by
industrial design rights – and ease of use. Different
IP rights offer different protection and have different
eligibility requirements, and there may be significant
variations in both protection and eligibility criteria
across jurisdictions. Patent, design and copyright
protection are the most likely options for legal protection.68 In the U.S. a special form of trademark, trade
dress, which covers the appearance of a product, its
box, shape or otherwise, may also be relevant, for
example to protect the distinctive design of Apple’s
iPhone boxes.

118

Figure 4.13 sets out filings (or registrations) by Apple
and Samsung with respect to GUIs and icons. The
number of GUI industrial designs filed by Apple
and Samsung Electronics has grown considerably
since 2012 at both the USPTO and the EUIPO. At the
EUIPO, Apple filed 222 designs on GUIs between
2009 and 2014, while Samsung filed 379. In 2007,
the same year the first iPhone was released, half (38)
the industrial designs filed by Apple at the USPTO
were for GUIs, and the other half were icon designs.
In 2008, GUI industrial designs accounted for 89
percent (41) of Apple’s filings at the USPTO. About
66 percent (189) of Apple’s filings at the EUIPO in
2008 were for GUIs, and 34 percent (98) were icon
designs. Icon designs have also grown, particularly
for Samsung, which more than tripled its number of
icon design applications at the USPTO between 2012
and 2013. Remarkably, Huawei filed only 17 designs
for display screens with GUIs between 2012 and 2015
at the USPTO, and has so far filed no GUI designs
at all at the EUIPO.
Comparing the absolute number of industrial designs
filed by these firms is challenging, however. First, the
methodology used to identify smartphone industrial
designs is not exact. Second, Samsung Electronics
is a conglomerate filing for a large product range
of smartphones and other electronics products,
whereas Apple has released 15 iPhone models onto
the market since 2007.69 Finally, Apple’s designs for
GUIs and icons are used across all Apple products
and in many cases across iPhone models, which can
result in even fewer absolute filings.
Lastly, in some cases an overlap between trademark
and design protection arises, if and when firms later
trademark a design, claiming distinctiveness. An
industrial design and a trademark may be obtained
covering the same subject matter:70 the former grants
a limited period of protection for a design, while the
latter may in effect provide perpetual protection for
the same design as a mark.

4.3.3 – The high value of the brands
behind the leading smartphones
The World Intellectual Property Report 2013 outlined the
importance of brands – and trademarks – as intangible
assets, and as a driver of the ability to command higher
prices, including in the smartphone sector.71 Brands were
also shown to play an important role in explaining why
lead firms capture a majority of profits along the way.
Apple, Samsung and more recently Huawei spend
heavily on advertising (see figure 4.14). Echoing the
interrelationship between branding and innovation,
all three firms put marketing on par with R&D for the
development of innovative products. Apple increased
spending to USD 1.8 billion in 2015 (with 2016 figures
unavailable), while Samsung spent USD 3.8 billion in
2016 – rivalling companies with the largest advertising
budgets worldwide such as Coca-Cola, after a sustained
decision as of 2012 to vastly increase its yearly advertising spend, mainly to promote its Galaxy brand.72 Official
advertising data for Huawei are not available, but the
ever-more global marketing campaigns around the
company and its P-series smartphones demonstrate its
intent to move out of the low-margin segment by building
a premium brand.73
Identifying the value of brands for the smartphone business in general, or for specific smartphone models in
particular, is challenging. Much of a brand’s value rests
with the reputation and image of the lead firm, such
as Apple, Samsung or Huawei, and this brand value is
particularly high, with Apple and Samsung at the top of
brand rankings, and Apple in the number one spot for
two out of the three rankings (see table 4.9 of this report
plus table 1.1 and box 1.6 in WIPO, 2013 for a technical
critique of these brand values). Huawei is worth less as
a brand, but is catching up. Newer Chinese smartphone
firms are still distant.
The three companies follow similar branding and trademark strategies. According to estimates produced for this
report, Apple started registering trademarks related to its
iPhone at the USPTO in 2006, including a trademark for
the name “iPhone.”74 Sustaining its lead-time advantage,
the company then registered a total of 15 trademarks in
2007, the year it introduced the iPhone. Samsung and
Huawei started registering smartphone-related trademarks only in 2009 and 2011, with Samsung seemingly
filing a relatively high number of trademarks without
necessarily using them in the marketplace subsequently.

While Huawei registered few trademarks – just 10
in all over the entire period – Samsung immediately
began to register a large number of trademarks; it has
registered a total of 300 over this period. Samsung’s
spike in trademark registrations in 2012 coincided
with the previously mentioned increased advertising
that year (see figure 4.15).

Few trademarks seem to relate specifically to a
particular smartphone model, reinforcing the conclusion that the brand value draws mainly on the generic
company trademark. For example, Apple has not
protected the term “iPhone 7” via a trademark.
Samsung filed a trademark for “S7” or “S7Edge” but
abandoned it at the USPTO, though it is protected at
the EUIPO. Huawei is the only company that pursues
a trademark strategy that protects the brand name
displayed on the device, the name of the product
series and the specific product name, for example
“Huawei P9” at the USPTO. All three market leaders
have, however, sought to protect the product series
such as “iPhone”, “Galaxy” and “Huawei P.”
In addition, trademarks are registered on underlying
hardware or software innovations which become
distinctive product features. Examples are “retina
display” (Apple) and “Infinity display” (Samsung) and
– in Apple’s repertoire – “assistive touch”, “AirPort
Time Capsule” and “A10 fusion chips.”
Figure 4.16 shows the smartphone trademarks of
Apple, Huawei and Samsung Electronics by Nice
class – the international classification of goods and
services applied for the registration of trademarks
– over time.75 The relevant class for smartphones is
class 9, and all three companies submit their greatest
number of filings in this class, with Apple filing 68 in the
period 2007-2016, Samsung close to 300 and Huawei
around 10. The most interesting aspect of this graph
is the distribution across classes, precisely because
the companies do not file only in class 9, but spread
their trademarks across classes, especially services.
122

This is important for two reasons: (i) it helps them to
build brand value and use their brand for a larger range
of product and service categories than just “traditional”
electronic products and (ii) occupying as much space
across classes as reasonably possible means they
are better placed to avoid the appropriation of brand
value by competitors and other firms (and squatters),
but bearing in mind that a mark must be used for the
relevant class in order to be protected. The graph also
shows that Huawei is starting to change its approach
by filing in more classes.

Huawei filed exclusively in class 9, but Apple and
Samsung also filed smartphone-related trademarks in
a number of other classes, including those related to
services. For example, the first iPhone trademark in 2006
was also filed in class 28, which comprises games and
toys, as a “hand-held unit for playing electronic games.”
The most common service class is class 38, which
covers telecommunication services, but there are also
a number of filings in class 42, which covers design and
development of computer software, among other things.
As suggested earlier, Apple holds three trademarks on
the design (trade dress) of its iPhone. Samsung also
attempted to get such IP protection at both the USPTO
and the EUIPO but failed. Rights in relation to packaging
are interesting too. Apple has a trademark as well as a
design right on the shape of the iPhone box.
In addition, some component suppliers also own trademarks which handset brands use when marketing their
phones, such as Corning’s Gorilla Glass trademark or
Huawei’s use of the Leica trademark to market its new
smartphone camera.

Handset makers and component suppliers also refer to
and license trademarks on standards and third-party
technologies essential to the networking capacity of
the phone, such as “LTE”, “Wi-Fi” and “Bluetooth.”
Such marks are usually owned by standard-setting
organizations or industry alliances, not individual
component suppliers.76
Finally, elements which relate to smartphone software,
content and services such as “Siri” for Apple and
“Bixby” for Samsung, “iTunes” or “Apple Pay” are also
protected by trademarks.77 Some are owned by thirdparty providers such as “Android.”
Trademarks are also filed on GUIs and icons related to
smartphone applications and accessories. Apple and
Samsung are particularly keen on filing for trademark
and industrial design protection on GUIs, underling the
notion that GUIs distinctively identify products.

4.4 – Perspectives on technological
learning and intangibles
How has technological learning occurred in the smartphone global value chain? Is value capture shifting?
And what role might IP play in this process?
Once more, a simple answer is impossible; the factors
at work are too manifold. But it is useful to recall the
timetable for smartphone innovation, and the small
number of firms and locations involved.
In terms of the inventions required for smartphones,
the development of mobile phones and underlying technologies dates back several decades. The first handset
was launched by Motorola in 1973.78 Cell phones also
depend on a vast set of other technologies, including
processors, which have their own long history.79 The
first critical patent for wireless communication, for
example, can be traced back to 1974.
In terms of market penetration, NTT DoCoMo – a
Japanese firm – reached relatively high penetration in
Japan with its first smartphones, introduced in 1999. Still,
it was in 2007 that Apple’s iPhone made an important
breakthrough. Apple was followed by Samsung in 2009,
and only somewhat later by Huawei.80 Apple defined the
dominant design for a smartphone. In the innovation literature, establishment of dominant design is an important
milestone, as the ensuing competition happens within
these design parameters.
To this day, also, technological learning remains relatively
concentrated among a few core firms and countries. There
has been a shift in capacity, from Europe, Japan and the
United States initially to selected firms in the Republic
of Korea (Samsung and LG), Taiwan (Province of China)
and China (Huawei and ZTE). As with other advanced
technologies, participation in these technologies does
not reflect a divide between developed and developing
countries; Europe, for example, is no longer a serious
contender, whereas China has become an important one.
There are important differences between the
newcomer countries. The Republic of Korea built its
capacity largely internally, supported by government
policies and the strength of its domestic conglomerate
enterprises. China’s technological learning was
shaped by extensive involvement with foreign
entities, in particular through providing assembly
services for foreign entities and foreign direct
investment in China.
124

There were really two or three learning pathways in
China. One involved companies from Taiwan (Province
of China) setting up production facilities for multinationals in China (e.g., Foxconn assembling products for
Apple and others). Another involved Chinese companies
such as Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo that had established
product lines (networking equipment and personal
computers) subsequently moving into the smartphone
market. A potential third pathway is the set of new
Chinese firms selling cheap phones for China’s home
market without initially relying on strong internally
generated technological inventions. As a result, China
has a major role in the smartphone industry, but without
necessarily having a large presence of mainland China
firms in the global value chains of multinationals like
Apple and Samsung.
Apart from these firms and countries, each with its
own distinctive features, there has been little transfer
of intangibles or creation of either new competitors or
new participants in the smartphone global value chain.
The only newer geographic shifts in global value chain
participation can be seen in some limited transfer of
assembly activities to countries outside East Asia.
Among the leaders, what do Apple, Samsung and Huawei
have in common in terms of the development of their
innovation capacity and the role of intangible assets?
First, before entering the smartphone market all three
firms had backgrounds and innovative capacity in
related fields of technology.
• Apple’s history is well known. It started in the
late 1970s with a focus on computer technology,
and also developed core know-how in the field
of drives, printers, input devices, displays and
networking technologies over the course of the
following four decades. It took some time for
Apple to move from its audio player, the iPod,
introduced in 2001, via software-related innovation such as iTunes to the simultaneous introduction of the iPhone and the iPad. Its capacity in
internal component development is weaker than
Huawei’s or Samsung’s – with the exception of
the most expensive and strategic components
such as processors and, more recently, graphics processing units. 81 In addition, Apple has
substantial capacity in product design, integration
and software.

SMARTPHONES: WHAT'S INSIDE THE BOX?

• Samsung Electronics was always part of a larger
conglomerate, entering initially as a supplier of
components (specifically telecommunications
hardware and phones) to other firms, beginning in the 1980s. Samsung Electronics initially
manufactured inexpensive, imitative electronics
for other companies. Samsung also produced
a lot of its own-brand products for the Republic
of Korea. Already back then, many of its plants
were set up abroad, arguably benefiting from
access to foreign-trained skills and labor. However,
in 1996 it made a major shift towards developing internal design capabilities and building its
own brand.82 Today, Samsung remains unique
in its reliance on internal transfer of technology,
and production and product design capacities.
• Huawei started much later and with fewer integral
capabilities, but had become the global leader in
telecommunications networks by 2012.83 Unlike
other firms in China or Taiwan (Province of China),
Huawei did not act as a contract manufacturer for
Western entities. Instead, it focused consistently
on telecom-related innovation and building its
extensive relationships with operators worldwide. In 2003, Huawei started producing phones,
mostly low-end types for Chinese telecom carriers.
Since 2011, however, it has developed high-end
devices. Rather than relying on joint ventures to
secure technology transfer from foreign companies, Huawei focused on local R&D and on learning
by reverse-engineering of foreign technologies
(Chong, 2013). Today, Huawei is actually more
R&D-intensive than Apple or Samsung (see table
4.3) and is maintaining this high R&D investment
despite falling revenues and margins.84 Academic
studies show that this rapid catch-up by Huawei
was due to its technological capabilities rather
than cost advantages alone – by creating its own
technological path rather than remaining a technological follower. Huawei grew rapidly by developing technologies that are different from those of
Ericsson, a main competitor, with Huawei relying
on recent scientific knowledge in its innovation
strategies.85 More recently, Huawei has looked to
upgrade, setting up a number of partnerships or
joint ventures with firms such as IBM, Siemens,
3Com and Symantec plus R&D partnerships with
Motorola and other telecommunication operators,
and it has also learned management practices
from Western firms.

While each company has followed a different development path, all three have been heavily involved in the
creation of innovation capacity and related intangibles,
including brands. All three are highly R&D-intensive with
an express goal of increasing their in-house production
of technologically sophisticated, high-margin components such as chips. All three have also learned to use
IP intensively, and now operate large IP portfolios and
have significant IP litigation experience. Moreover,
Samsung and Huawei are involved in related standardsetting technologies and IP.
Second, all three firms operate in extensive value
networks and with component suppliers (sections 4.1
and 4.2). Learning and upgrading does not occur just
within these smartphone lead firms, but also in related
technology fields. These interactions lead to two-way
flows of knowledge in the process of co-designing and
manufacturing. At the component level, the “fabless” chip
model adopted by major chip makers such as Qualcomm,
Broadcom and Apple involves close collaboration with
foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Corporation (TSMC) to design chips to meet specific manufacturing processes.86 Partnerships between
Qualcomm and Huawei to create next-generation mobile
chipsets also involve significant knowledge exchange.
Involvement in the smartphone global value chain
entails learning and upgrading right down to the level
of contracted manufacturing. When Apple works
with Foxconn on processes such as plastic molding,
machine tooling and quality control, learning is involved.
Firms such as Foxconn started by making simpler
contributions but nowadays add value to the iPhone
through their own intangible assets (machine tooling,
rapid prototyping, high volume ramp-up, supply chain
management), some of which may soon take place at
Foxconn’s plant in the United States.87
When Huawei assembles outside Asia, for example in
Brazil, knowledge transfer ensues.88 In the same vein,
knowledge transfer also occurs within multinational
corporations. Samsung, for example, manufactures half
its mobile phones in its own plants in Viet Nam. Apple
has software developed in various countries. These
activities lead to knowledge spillovers to domestic
research institutes, suppliers and competitors, including business understanding as well as technological
knowledge. In general, a great deal of the knowledge in
these set-ups is tacit – never codified but flowing within
and across organizations – whereas other knowledge
gets codified to facilitate collaborations.

Third, acquisitions have helped these companies to
progress. For example, Samsung purchased firms in
areas as diverse as mobile music services, speech
recognition technologies and nanotechnology firms
delivering display solutions in 2016 and 2017 alone.
This is also true of upcoming firms such as Foxconn,
which bought Sharp in 2016 and is bidding for Toshiba’s
chip business.89
Fourth, labor mobility plays a large role. Firms such
as Samsung benefited from labor mobility by learning
from Japanese engineers in the 1990s, and by having
access to Korean engineers trained in the United States.
Huawei is known to have hired Western professionals in
the area of marketing and public affairs, and key design
experts from Apple or Samsung, and has set up design
centers in London.90 Apple also regularly hires from top
U.S. firms such as Qualcomm or from U.S. universities.
Fifth, insourcing of technology and IP-based exchanges
have been an important source of knowledge exchange
and of firms’ ability to operate. All three firms are
engaged with SEPs, including through cross-licensing
or licensing (e.g., licensing deals with Nokia).
Finally, another important factor in this story is the role
of government policy and the broader environment for
doing business and innovation. All three companies
operate in countries with a pronounced emphasis on
innovation-driven growth, a strong private and public
commitment to science and R&D, excellent (or rapidly
improving) research infrastructures, an abundance of
engineering and science skills and a recognition of the
value of technological and non-technological innovation. All three countries had a strong commitment to the
borderless operation of global value chains, and their
participation within them. They also had frameworks
and policies in place to encourage IP filings and foster
telecom standards; historically, China jumped on this
bandwagon last, but it has made considerable progress
in a short time.
From the perspective of international trade, all three
firms benefited from very open international markets in
the field of information technology products – markets
secured through the Information Technology Agreement
concluded in 1996 at the World Trade Organization,
among others.91
All in all, government policy – and sometimes also the
absence of explicit policy intervention – has played a
role in fostering the smartphone industry.

It is not always the lead firm that
pays the bill; sometimes component
suppliers may pay. This is the
case for Apple, which does not
hold a license for Qualcomm’s IP
but instead relies on agreements
between its contract manufacturers
and Qualcomm.

Dedrick et al. (2011) found that the
carriers capture most value, ahead
of handset makers.

WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPORT 2017

Technical notes
Country income groups

The unit of analysis in trademark data is any filing for
trademark protection at any of the sources employed –
This report uses the World Bank income classification namely the USPTO, the Madrid System and the national
to refer to particular country groups. The classification offices included in WIPO’s Global Brands Database.
is based on gross national income per capita in 2016 This definition includes trademarks for both products
and establishes the following four groups: low-income and services. It also includes renewals of existing
economies (USD 1,005 or less); lower middle-income trademarks and trademarks claiming a priority based
economies (USD 1,006 to USD 3,955); upper middle- on existing trademarks.
income economies (USD 3,956 to USD 12,235); and
high-income economies (USD 12,236 or more).
Imputing country of origin
More information on this classification is available at
http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications.

IP mappings
The case studies in chapters 2, 3 and 4 rely on mappings
of patents and trademarks developed for this report.
The patent data for these mappings come mainly from
the WIPO Statistics Database, the EPO Worldwide
Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT, April 2017) and
the USPTO Trademark Case Files and Assignment
Datasets (2016). Key methodological elements underlying the mapping exercise include the following.

Unit of analysis
The main unit of analysis in patent data is the first filing
of a given invention. Mappings include data on utility
models whenever available. The date of reference for
patent counts is the date of first filing. The origin of
the invention is attributed to the first applicant in the
first filing; whenever this information was missing an
imputation strategy has been applied, as described
further below.
The only departure from this approach occurs when
analyzing the share of patent families requesting protection in each patent office (e.g., see figures 2.8 or 3.12). In
this case, an extended patent family definition – known
as the INPADOC patent family – has been used instead
of the one relying on first filings. In addition, only patent
families with at least one granted application have been
considered for this analysis, and the date of reference
is the earliest filing within the same extended family.
The main rationale for using the extended patent family
definition and imposing at least one granted patent within
the family is to mitigate any underestimation arising from
complex subsequent filing structures, such as continuations and divisionals, and from small patent families of
lower quality such as those filed in only one country and
either rejected after or withdrawn before examination.
134

When information about the first listed applicant’s
country of residence in the first patent filing was missing, the following sequence was adopted: (i) extract
country information from the applicant’s address; (ii)
extract country information from the applicant’s name;
(iii) make use of the information from matched corporations (as described further below); (iv) rely on the most
frequent first applicant country of residence within the
same patent family (using the extended patent family
definition); (v) rely on the most frequent first inventor’s
country of residence within the same patent family
(again, using the extended patent family definition); and
(vi) for some remaining historical records, consider the
IP office of first filing as a proxy for origin.

Mapping strategies
The patent mapping strategy for each of the three
sectors is based on existing evidence and experts’
suggestions. Each strategy was tested against existing
alternative sources whenever possible.
The coffee patent mapping is based on the following
combination of CPC and IPC symbols and keywords
sought in titles and abstracts.
IPC/CPC symbols: A01D46/06, A23C11/00, A23F5*,

The trademark mapping strategy for the photovoltaic
industry in chapter 3 is based on the following keywords
sought in trademark statement descriptions: solar
panel*; photovoltaic*; *polysilicon*; fotovoltaic*; solar
module; solarmodul*.

The trademark and industrial design mapping strategy
for the smartphone chapter draws on an unpublished
background report by Christian Helmers, June 16, 2017.
Apple, Samsung Electronics and Huawei’s industrial
designs and trademarks were mapped using USPTO
and EUIPO data. USPC class D14 was the starting point
The patent mapping strategy for the smartphone indus- in USPTO industrial design data, and Locarno classes
try in chapter 4 follows a narrow and a broad definition 14-03 and 14-04 in the EUIPO one. The resulting data
which are based on the following combinations of CPC were filtered into four categories – mobile phones, GUIs,
and IPC symbols, respectively:
display screens and icons – using the industrial design
titles. A manual check was then performed for each

Intangibles such as technology, design
and branding are a crucial part of products
in today’s global marketplace. But how
much is intangible capital really worth?
This authoritative study from WIPO, the
United Nations specialized agency for
intellectual property (IP), presents new
evidence. Macroeconomic analysis is
complemented by case studies of the global
value chains for three products – coffee,
photovoltaic energy cells and smartphones –
to give an insightful picture of the role of IP
and other intangibles in modern production.
