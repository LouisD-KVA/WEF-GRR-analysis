FOREWORD

evidence in this year’s report corroborates the
rise in world hunger, thus demanding an even
greater call to action. Furthermore, while we
must sow the seeds of peace in order to
achieve food securit y, improve nutrition and
“leave no one behind”, we also need to
redouble efforts to build climate resilience for
food securit y and nutrition.

In September 2017, we jointly launched The State
of Food Security and Nutrition in the World,
marking the beginning of a new era in monitoring
progress towards achieving a world without
hunger and malnutrition, within the framework
of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
This report monitors progress towards the targets
of ending both hunger (SDG Target 2.1) and all
forms of malnutrition (SDG Target 2.2), and
provides an analysis of the underlying causes and
drivers of obser ved trends. While the prevalence of
undernourishment is at the forefront of monitoring
hunger, the prevalence of severe food insecurity –
based on the Food Insecurit y Experience Scale
(FIES) – was introduced last year to provide an
estimate of the proportion of the population
facing serious constraints on their abilit y to
obtain safe, nutritious and sufficient food.

In 2017, the number of undernourished people is
estimated to have reached 821 million – around
one person out of ever y nine in the world.
Undernourishment and severe food insecurit y
appear to be increasing in almost all subregions
of Africa, as well as in South America, whereas
the undernourishment situation is stable in most
regions of Asia.
A more encouraging finding last year was that
the rising trend in undernourishment had not
yet been ref lected in rates of child stunting;
this continues to be the case this year.
Nonetheless, we are concerned that in 2017,
nearly 151 million children under five have
stunted growth, while the lives of over
50 million children in the world continue to be
threatened by wasting. Such children are at a
higher risk of mortalit y and poor health,
growth and development. A multisectoral
approach is needed to reduce the burden of
stunting and wasting, and to appropriately
treat wasting to reduce childhood morbidit y
and mortalit y.

The report also tracks prog ress on a set of
indicators used to monitor World Health
Assembly global targets for nutrition and
diet-related non-communicable diseases, three
of which are also indicators of SDG2 targets.
The challenges we face are indeed significant.
Of great concern is the finding last year that,
after a prolonged decline, the most recent
estimates showed global hunger had
increased in 2016. Last year we obser ved that
the failure to reduce world hunger is closely
associated with the increase in conf lict and
violence in several parts of the world, and
that efforts to fight hunger must go hand in
hand with those to sustain peace. New

people’s livelihoods in response to climate
variabilit y and extremes.

contributes to overweight and obesit y, which
partly explains the coexistence of these forms of
malnutrition in many countries. In 2017,
childhood overweight affected over 38 million
children under five years of age, with Africa and
Asia representing 25 percent and 46 percent of
the global total, respectively. Anaemia in women
and obesit y in adults are also on the increase at
the global level – one in three women of
reproductive age is anaemic and more than one
in eight adults – or more than 672 million – is
obese. The problem of obesit y is most significant
in North America, but it is worr ying that even
Africa and Asia, which still show the lowest rates
of obesit y, are also experiencing an upward
trend. Furthermore, overweight and obesit y are
increasing the risk of non-communicable diseases
such as t ype 2 diabetes, high blood pressure,
heart attacks and some forms of cancer.

Building climate resilience will require climate
change adaptation and disaster risk reduction
and management to be integrated into short-,
medium- and long-term policies, programmes
and practices. National and local governments
can find g uidance in the outcomes and
recommendations of existing global policy
platforms: climate change (governed by the
UNFCCC and the 2015 Paris Agreement); disaster
risk reduction (the Sendai Framework on Disaster
Risk Reduction); humanitarian emergency
response (the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit
and the Grand Bargain); improved nutrition and
healthy diets (the Second International
Conference on Nutrition [ICN2] and the UN
Decade of Action on Nutrition 2016 –2025); and
development as part of the overarching 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development. Currently
many of these global policy platforms are still too
compartmentalized and not well aligned.
Therefore, we must do more to work towards a
better integration of these platforms to ensure
that actions across and within sectors such as
environment, food, agriculture and health,
pursue coherent objectives to address the
negative impacts and threats that changing
climate variabilit y and increased climate
extremes pose to people’s food securit y, access to
healthy diets, safe nutrition and health.

In addition to conf lict and v iolence in many
parts of the world, the gains made in ending
hunger and malnutrition are being eroded by
climate variabilit y and exposure to more
complex, frequent and intense climate
extremes, as shown in Part 2 of this report.
Hunger is sig nificantly worse in countries w ith
ag ricultural systems that are highly sensitive to
rainfall and temperature variabilit y and severe
drought, and where the livelihood of a high
proportion of the population depends on
ag riculture. If we are to achieve a world w ithout
hunger and malnutrition in all its forms by
2030, it is imperative that we accelerate and
scale up actions to streng then the resilience
and adaptive capacit y of food systems and

METHODOLOGY
The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018 has been prepared by the FAO Agricultural
Development Economics Division in collaboration with the Statistics Division of the Economic and Social
Development Department and a team of technical experts from FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, W FP and W HO.
A senior advisor y team consisting of designated senior managers of the five UN publishing partners
g uided the production of the report. Led by FAO, this team decided on the outline of the report and
defined its thematic focus. It further gave oversight to the technical writing team composed of experts
from each of the five co-publishing agencies. The technical writing team involved external experts in
preparing background papers to complement the research and data analysis undertaken by the members
of the writing team.
The writing team produced a number of interim outputs, including an annotated outline, first draft and
final draft of the report. These were reviewed, validated and cleared by the senior advisor y team at each
step in the preparation process. The final report underwent a rigorous technical review by senior
management and technical experts from different divisions and departments within each of the five UN
agencies, both at headquarters and decentralized offices. Finally, the report underwent executive review
and clearance by the heads of agency of the five co-publishing partners.

KEY MESSAGES
è In addition to conflict, climate variability and
extremes are among the key drivers behind the recent
uptick in global hunger and one of the leading causes
of severe food crises. The cumulative effect of changes
in climate is undermining all dimensions of food
security – food availability, access, utilization and
stability.

è New evidence continues to signal a rise in world
hunger and a reversal of trends after a prolonged
decline. In 2017 the number of undernourished
people is estimated to have increased to 821 million
– around one out of every nine people in the world.
è While some progress continues to be made in
reducing child stunting, levels still remain unacceptably
high. Nearly 151 million children under five – or over
22 percent – are affected by stunting in 2017.
è Wasting continues to affect over 50 million children
under five in the world and these children are at
increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore,
over 38 million children under five are overweight.

è Nutrition is highly susceptible to changes in climate
and bears a heavy burden as a result, as seen in the
impaired nutrient quality and dietary diversity of foods
produced and consumed, the impacts on water and
sanitation, and the effects on patterns of health risks
and disease, as well as changes in maternal care,
child care and breastfeeding.

è Adult obesity is worsening and more than one in
eight adults in the world – or more than 672 million –
is obese. Undernutrition and overweight and obesity
coexist in many countries.

è Actions need to be accelerated and scaled up to
strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity of food
systems, people’s livelihoods, and nutrition in response
to climate variability and extremes.

è Food insecurity contributes to overweight and
obesity, as well as undernutrition, and high rates of
these forms of malnutrition coexist in many countries.
The higher cost of nutritious foods, the stress of living
with food insecurity and physiological adaptations to
food restriction help explain why food insecure families
may have a higher risk of overweight and obesity.

è Solutions require increased partnerships and
multi-year, large-scale funding of integrated disaster
risk reduction and management and climate change
adaptation programmes that are short-, medium- and
long-term in scope.
è The signs of increasing food insecurity and high
levels of different forms of malnutrition are a clear
warning of the urgent need for considerable additional
work to ensure we “leave no one behind” on the road
towards achieving the SDG goals on food security
and nutrition.

è Poor access to food increases the risk of low
birthweight and stunting in children, which are associated
with higher risk of overweight and obesity later in life.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
ADVANCING FOOD SECURITY AND
NUTRITION MONITORING IN THE ERA OF
THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT

Conference on Nutrition (ICN2) Framework for
Action and the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition
2016 –2025. The scope of the report was expanded
to include a set of six nutrition indicators used to
monitor World Health Assembly global targets for
nutrition and diet-related non-communicable
diseases, three of which are also indicators of the
SDG2 targets. The report also introduced for the
first time a new indicator of food securit y, the
prevalence of severe food insecurit y based on the
Food Insecurit y Experience Scale (FIES), which is
an estimate of the proportion of the population
facing serious constraints on their abilit y to
obtain sufficient food.

Last year, The State of Food Security and Nutrition
in the World marked the start of a new era in
monitoring progress towards achieving a world
without hunger and malnutrition in all its forms
– an aim set out in the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda).
Addressing the challenges of hunger, food
insecurit y and malnutrition in all its forms
features prominently in the second Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) of the 2030 Agenda:
Ensuring access to safe, nutritious and sufficient
food for all (Target 2.1) and eliminating all forms
of malnutrition (Target 2.2). It is also understood
that attainment of SDG2 depends largely on –
and also contributes to – the achievement of the
other goals of the 2030 Agenda: ending povert y;
improving health, education, gender equalit y and
access to clean water and sanitation; decent work;
reduced inequalit y; and peace and justice, to
name only a few.

EVIDENCE CONTINUES TO POINT TO A
RISE IN WORLD HUNGER IN RECENT
YEARS, AN IMPORTANT WARNING THAT
WE ARE NOT ON TRACK TO ERADICATE
HUNGER BY 2030
Evidence continues to signal a rise in world
hunger. According to available data, the number
of people who suffer from hunger has been
growing over the past three years, returning to
levels from a decade ago. The absolute number of
people in the world affected by undernourishment,
or chronic food deprivation, is now estimated to
have increased from around 804 million in 2016
to nearly 821 million in 2017. The situation is
worsening in South America and most regions of
Africa; likewise, the decreasing trend in
undernourishment that characterized Asia until
recently seems to be slowing down significantly.
Without increased efforts, there is a risk of falling
far short of achieving the SDG target of hunger
eradication by 2030.

This transformational vision embedded in the
2030 Agenda provides an imperative for new
ways of thinking, acting and measuring. For
example, the growing global epidemic of obesit y,
which is increasingly affecting lower income
countries and rapidly adding to the multiple
burden of malnutrition and non-communicable
diseases, also points to the need to re-examine
how we think about and measure hunger and
food insecurit y as well as their linkages with
nutrition and health. Fortunately, data gathering
and measurement tools are rapidly evolving to
meet the monitoring challenges presented by the
new agenda.

CHILD UNDERNUTRITION CONTINUES TO
DECLINE, BUT LEVELS OF ADULT OBESITY
AND ANAEMIA IN WOMEN OF
REPRODUCTIVE AGE ARE INCREASING

Last year, this report included several
innovations aimed at promoting new ways of
thinking about food securit y and nutrition in the
context of the 2030 Agenda and responding to the
challenges of the Second International

Good nutrition is the lifeblood of sustainable
development and drives the changes needed for a
more sustainable and prosperous future.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Climate variabilit y and extremes are a key driver
behind the recent rises in global hunger and one
of the leading causes of severe food crises. The
changing nature of climate variabilit y and
extremes is negatively affecting all dimensions of
food securit y (food availabilit y, access, utilization
and stabilit y), as well as reinforcing other
underlying causes of malnutrition related to child
care and feeding, health ser vices and
environmental health. The risk of food insecurit y
and malnutrition is greater nowadays because
livelihoods and livelihood assets – especially of
the poor – are more exposed and v ulnerable to
changing climate variabilit y and extremes. What
can be done to prevent this threat from eroding
the gains made in ending hunger and
malnutrition in recent years?

Progress, although limited in magnitude and
pace, has been made in reducing child stunting
and increasing exclusive breastfeeding for the
first six months of life. Nonetheless, while the
prevalence of overweight in children under five
years may not have changed significantly in
recent years, adult obesit y continues to rise and
one in three women of reproductive age in the
world is anaemic.
Children with low weight-for-height (wasting)
have an increased risk of mortalit y. In 2017,
7.5 percent of children under five were affected
by this form of undernutrition, with regional
prevalences ranging from 1.3 percent in Latin
America to 9.7 percent in Asia.
Multiple forms of malnutrition are ev ident in
many countries. Poor access to food and
particularly healthy food contributes to
undernutrition as well as over weight and
obesit y. It increases the risk of low birthweight,
childhood stunting and anaemia in women of
reproductive age, and it is linked to over weight
in school-age g irls and obesit y among women,
particularly in upper-middle- and high-income
countries. The higher cost of nutritious foods, the
stress of liv with food insecurit y and
physiolog ical adaptations to food restriction help
explain why food insecure families have a higher
risk of over weight and obesit y. Additionally,
maternal and infant/child food deprivation can
result in foetal and early childhood “metabolic
imprinting”, which increases the risk of obesit y
and diet-related non-communicable diseases
later in life.

This report launches an urgent appeal to
accelerate and scale up actions to strengthen
resilience and adaptive capacit y in the face of
chang climate variabilit y and increasing
extremes. National and local governments are
facing challenges in tr y to determine
measures to prevent risk and address the effects
of these stressors. They can be g uided by
existing global policy platforms and processes
whereby climate resilience is an important
element: climate change (governed by the
UNFCCC and the 2015 Paris Ag reement);
disaster risk reduction (the Sendai Framework
on Disaster Risk Reduction); humanitarian
emergency response (the 2016 World
Humanitarian Summit and the Grand Bargain);
improved nutrition and healthy diets (the
Second International Conference on Nutrition
[ICN2] and the UN Decade of Action on
Nutrition 2016 –2025); and development (as part
of the overarching 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development). However, it is important to
ensure better integ ration of these global policy
platforms and processes to ensure that actions
across and within sectors such as env ironment,
food, ag riculture and health pursue coherent
objectives. The success of policies, prog rammes
and practices that national and local

contribute simultaneously to undernutrition as
well as overweight and obesit y, resulting in
the coexistence of multiple forms of
malnutrition at the countr y level and even
within the same households.

Part 1 of this report presents the most recent
trends in hunger, food insecurit y and
malnutrition in all its forms with a focus on
monitoring progress on SDG Targets 2.1 and
2.2. This year the report also provides a
deeper exploration of the indicator of wasting
among children under five years of age. The
last section of Part 1 aims to build the bridge
between the first two sections by exploring
the links between food insecurit y and various
forms of malnutrition. The current state of
knowledge is presented on the pathways
through which poor access to food can

Part 2 closely scrutinizes the extent to which
climate variabilit y and extremes are undermining
progress in the areas of food securit y and
nutrition through different channels. The
analysis ultimately points to g uidance on how the
key challenges brought about by climate
variabilit y and extremes can be overcome if we
are to achieve the goals of ending hunger and
malnutrition in all forms by 2030 (SDG Targets
2.1 and 2.2) as well as other related SDGs,
including taking action to combat climate change
and its impacts (SDG13).

end, and was possibly in reverse. This was largely
attributed to persistent instabilit y in conf lictridden regions, adverse climate events that have
hit many regions of the world and economic
slowdowns that had affected more peaceful
settings and worsened the food securit y
situation. Now, new evidence confirms that lower
levels of per capita food consumption in some
countries, and increased inequalit y in the abilit y
to access food in the populations of other
countries, have contributed to what is projected
to be a further increase in the percentage of
people in the world having insufficient
dietary energy consumption in 2017. The latest
FAO estimates show that the share of
undernourished people in the world population –
the prevalence of undernourishment, or PoU –
appears to have been growing for two years in a
row, and may have reached 10.9 percent in 2017
(Figure 1 and Table 1).1

1.1

KEY MESSAGES
è New evidence continues to point to a rise in
world hunger in recent years after a prolonged
decline. An estimated 821 million people –
approximately one out of every nine people in the
world – are undernourished.
è Undernourishment and severe food insecurity
appear to be increasing in almost all regions of
Africa, as well as in South America, whereas the
undernourishment situation is stable in most regions
of Asia.
è The signs of increasing hunger and food insecurity
are a warning that there is considerable work to be
done to make sure we “leave no one behind” on the
road towards a world with zero hunger.

Even though the absolute increase in this
percentage may seem negligible from a historical
perspective, considering continuing population
growth, it implies that the number of people who
suffer from hunger has been growing over the
past three years, returning to levels from almost
a decade ago (Figure 1). The absolute number of
undernourished people in the world is now
estimated to have increased from around
804 million in 2016 to almost 821 million in 2017.
This trend sends a clear warning that, if efforts
are not enhanced, the SDG target of hunger
eradication will not be achieved by 2030.

TARGET 2.1

“By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by
all people, in particular the poor and people
in vulnerable situations, including infants, to
safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year
round.”

These new estimates (see Box 1) unfortunately
confirm that the prevalence of undernourishment
in Africa and Oceania has been increasing for a
number of years (Table 1). Africa remains the
continent with the highest PoU, affecting almost
21 percent of the population (more than
256 million people). The estimates also reveal

that the decreasing trend that characterized Asia
until recently may have come to an end.
The projected PoU for Asia in 2017 points to a
situation in which 11.4 percent of the population
is estimated to be undernourished, which
represents more than 515 million people,
confirming it as the region with the highest
number of undernourished people in the world.

In Africa, the situation is more pressing in the
region of sub-Saharan Africa where an estimated
23.2 percent of the population – or between one
out of four and one out of five people in the
region – may have suffered from chronic food
deprivation in 2017. An increase in the
prevalence of undernourishment has been
obser ved in all subregions of sub-Saharan Africa
except for Eastern Africa. A further slight
increase is seen in Southern Africa, while a
significant uptick is seen in Western Africa,

A closer look at the subregions of Asia reveals
that Western and South-eastern Asia are among
those contributing to this slowdown in the
decreasing trend, ref lecting the fact that

Although still in a context of a relatively low
level of undernourishment, the situation is
deteriorating in South America, where the
PoU has increased from 4.7 percent in 2014 to
a projected 5.0 percent in 2017. Such trends
may be the result of persisting low prices in
main export commodities – particularly crude
oil – which have drained financial resources
for food imports, reduced the capacity of
governments to invest in the economy and
significantly reduced the fiscal incomes
needed to protect the most vulnerable against
rising domestic prices and loss of income.

possibly ref lecting factors such as droughts, 2
rising foods prices 3 and a slowdown of real per
capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. 4 The
dynamics in the prevalence of undernourishment,
combined with rapid population growth, have led
to a dramatic increase in the total number of
undernourished people (Table 2). The number of
undernourished people in sub-Saharan Africa rose
from 181 million in 2010 to almost 222 million in
2016, an increase of 22.6 percent in six years, and –
based on current projections – may have increased
further to more than 236 million in 2017.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

BOX 1

REVISED SERIES OF ESTIMATES OF THE PREVALENCE OF
UNDERNOURISHMENT AND PROJECTIONS FOR 2017
Projection of the DEC. The latest available data from
national food balance sheets for most countries refer
to a year between 2013 and 2016. To estimate a
DEC value for the most recent years, data on the per
capita availability of cereals and meats – available
from the Trade and Market Division (EST) of FAO –
are used to estimate the likely rates of change in per
capita dietary energy availability from 2013, 2014,
2015 or 2016 (depending on the country) to 2017.
Such rates of change are then applied to the latest
available DEC values to project them up to 2017.

In preparation for each edition of The State of Food
Security and Nutrition in the World, the Statistics
Division of FAO conducts a thorough revision of the
entire series of PoU estimates, to reflect all updated or
additional evidence gathered since the publication of
the previous edition. As a result, the PoU series from
different issues of the report cannot be directly
compared; the reader is advised to refer to figures
presented in the same issue to evaluate the evolution
of undernourishment over time.
 In this edition, one major revision involves the
series of population data used for all countries.
National population figures are now obtained
from the 2017 revision of the World Population
Prospects 5 released by the United Nations
Department of Economic and Social Affairs
(DESA) Population Division in May 2017. It is
worth noting that the new series of population
estimates may present different figures also for
earlier years, as official statistical series are
revised retrospectively each time new data
become available and inconsistencies are
corrected. Population figures, both in terms of
level and age/sex composition, have several
implications for PoU estimates, as they enter into
the computation of per capita levels of dietary
energy supply (DES) and into estimates of the
minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER)
parameter and are used to calculate the number
of undernourished people.
 This edition also includes updated DES estimates
for a number of the countries with the largest
undernourished populations in the world,
resulting from a revision of the methodology
used to compile the Food Balance Sheets.

Projection of the CV. As no household survey data are
available for 2017, in most countries the CV estimated
from the last available food consumption survey data
was projected up to 2017 with no change. However,
when available, estimates of the prevalence of severe
food insecurity – based on the Food Insecurity
Experience Scale (FIES) – were used as auxiliary
information in projecting the CV. Since 2014, FIES
data provide timely evidence on changes in the
prevalence of severe food insecurity (FIsev) that might
closely reflect changes in the PoU. Such changes can
be used to make inferences regarding the likely
changes in the CV that might have occurred in the
most recent year. Detailed analysis by the FAO
Statistics Division of PoU data and the underlying
parameters shows that, on average, CVs explain
about one-third of the differences in PoU after
accounting for differences in DEC and MDER. Thus, for
the countries that agreed to disseminate national
estimates of their prevalence of food insecurity based
on the FIES, changes in FIsev from 2016 to 2017 were
used to determine the likely changes in the CV over
the same period. For those countries only, the CV was
revised by the amount that would generate a change
of 1 percent in the PoU every time a change of 3
percent is observed in FIsev.

As usual, PoU estimates are presented as three-year
averages at the country level and as annual values at
the regional and global level. Projections are needed
in order to generate figures for the most recent time
period. As in the past edition of The State of Food
Security and Nutrition in the World, PoU estimates for
2017 are obtained by making a separate projection
for each of the model’s parameters: the dietary energy
consumption (DEC), the coefficient of variation (CV) of
this consumption and the minimum dietary energy
requirement (MDER).

Projection of the MDER. The MDERs in 2017 are based
on the projected population structures from World
Population Prospects (2017 revision, medium variant)
produced by the Population Division of UN DESA.
These projections are subject to revision in the future
editions of this report as new data from surveys and
new official data on Food Balance Sheets components
become available. For further details, see the
methodological note in Annex 1.

HOW ARE HUNGER AND FOOD INSECURITY MEASURED?

PoU cannot monitor further progress in reducing
hunger when levels of PoU are already very low.

Prevalence of undernourishment
The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) is the
traditional FAO indicator used to monitor hunger at
the global and regional level. It was developed at a
time when very few national governments,
particularly in lower-income countries, collected data
regularly on food consumption. The methodology
relied on aggregated country-level data available for
most countries and on the occasional data on food
consumption available for a few countries, to produce
an estimate of the proportion of the population that
does not have regular access to enough dietary
energy for a healthy, active life. Over time, thanks to
progress in the implementation of national household
surveys, the number of countries able to provide
information on the inequality in access to food in
their population has increased. Now more countries
in the world collect information on people’s access to
food in periodic national population surveys,
generating data that are increasingly being used to
improve FAO country-level PoU estimates.
As most household surveys do not provide direct
evidence on individual food consumption, the PoU is
estimated using a statistical model where the
distribution of habitual consumption is modelled for
the population’s representative individual. A caveat of
the approach is that the inference can only be made
at population group level, and disaggregated only to
the point allowed by the representativeness of the
surveys in which the data were collected. Given
current data availability for most countries, PoU
estimates cannot be produced at sufficiently
disaggregated levels to be able to identify specific
vulnerable populations within countries, which is a
limitation for monitoring the very ambitious goal of
zero hunger in an agenda that aims to “leave no one
behind”. Also, due to the probabilistic nature and the
margins of uncertainty associated with the parameters
of the model, which usually imply confidence intervals
of about 5 percentage points around the estimate, the

The prevalence of severe food insecurity in the
population based on the Food Insecurity
Experience Scale
To complement the information provided by the PoU
and to allow for monitoring SDG Target 2.1 globally in
a more effective way, FAO took inspiration from
countries already using a different approach to
measuring food insecurity and scaled it up to the
global level. The approach is based on asking people,
directly in a survey, to report on the occurrence of
conditions and behaviours that are known to reflect
constraints on access to food. The Food Insecurity
Experience Scale (FIES) survey module is composed of
eight questions that have been carefully selected and
tested, and proven effective in measuring the severity
of the food insecurity situation of respondents in
different cultural, linguistic and development contexts.
FIES data are easy to process, so that results can be
produced in a very timely manner, providing a realtime picture of the situation.
The FIES has two features that make it a valuable
tool to meet the monitoring challenges presented by
the 2030 Agenda. First, being a direct survey-based
measure, when included in large-scale national
population surveys, results can be disaggregated,
thus helping identify which subpopulations within a
country are most affected by food insecurity. Second,
it is possible to estimate the prevalence of food
insecurity at different levels of severity. Someone
experiencing severe food insecurity is likely to have
gone entire days without eating due to lack of money
or other resources (see top figure next page).
Although based on different methods and sources
of data, the PoU and the prevalence of severe food
insecurity are both measures of the extent of severe
food deprivation in the population (see Box 3 and
Figure 4).

corresponding to about 770 million people. At
the regional level, values range from 1.4 percent
in Northern America and Europe to almost
30 percent in Africa. As in the case of the PoU,
severe food insecurit y has been on the rise at the
global level, driven by trends obser ved in Africa
and Latin America (see Figure 2, Table 3 and Table 4).

Examination of differences in development
outcomes between men and women is
particularly important to reveal where gender
disparities exist, what their potential causes
are, and how to address them. One interesting
feature of data collected using the FIES module
at the individual level is that it is possible to
examine gender differences in food security.

It is important to note that the prevalence of
severe food insecurit y, based on the FIES, should
not be confused with other indicators that use
similar terminolog y to describe conditions of
food insecurit y (see Box 4).

Analysis of FIES data collected by FAO in more than
140 countries reveals that, in Africa, Asia and Latin
America, the prevalence of severe food insecurity is
slightly higher among women, with the largest
differences found in Latin America (Figure 3). n

A COMBINED LOOK AT THE PREVALENCE OF UNDERNOURISHMENT AND OF
SEVERE FOOD INSECURITY
Even though these two measures are based on
different data and a different approach, the evidence
provided by figures and trends in severe food
insecurity, based on the FIES, is consistent with that
provided by the series of figures on the PoU. This is
not surprising when we consider that a condition of
severe food insecurity, and the resulting reduction in
the quantity of food consumed, might lead to the
inability to cover dietary energy needs (i.e. the
condition of “undernourishment” as defined in the PoU
methodology). The combined analysis of the two
indicators reinforces our belief that we are adequately
capturing real trends.
Having two alternative views of the hunger
problem also provides an important opportunity to
cross-check the values of the two indicators for
given countries. With reference to the average over
the 2014–2016 period, the estimated prevalence

of undernourishment and of severe food insecurity
can be compared across a number of countries.
The chart in Figure 4 shows that the two indicators
provide a consistent picture for most countries, but
still with some differences.
The chart is useful for identifying countries for
which the difference between the two indicators is
very large, pointing to the need for further
investigation in order to detect potential data
issues.10 There are countries for which the PoU is
much larger than the FIsev (points in the lower-right
section of the chart). In some cases, the estimated
PoU may be too high because the CV could not be
updated due to lack of access to recent survey
data,11 while in other cases, the FIsev may be too
low. In other countries (points in the upper-left section
of the chart), the PoU may be underestimated or the
FIsev estimates may be too high.

DIFFERENT FOOD SECURITY ASSESSMENTS FOR DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES

and is based on reporting on a number of key,
globally valid and comparable indicators. It relies
on rigorous quantitative indicators, agreed upon
by the Interagency and Expert Group on SDG
indicators of the UN Statistical Commission. FIES
data presented in this report are collected in the
context of nationally representative surveys of the
population, usually with a 12-month recall period.
Measures obtained with the FIES are calibrated
against a global reference scale of severity and
used to estimate the prevalence of food insecurity
in a globally comparable way.
IPC, on the other hand, has the specific
objective of identifying populations in need of
urgent action. To achieve this, IPC is based on
convergence of evidence from a number of
sources. To reach technical consensus on the
classification of the severity of the food insecurity
situation, a team of analysts conducts a critical
evaluation and analysis of all available evidence
on food security, which is compared against
global standardized indicators and then
interpreted with reference to local contexts. As a
result, IPC analyses provide evidence needed to
support emergency response planning. IPC
analysis can be a snapshot of the food insecurity
status in subnational areas – typically using data
that is not older than two or three months – to give
an overview of the current and projected situation
and to provide information to decision-makers on
ongoing and upcoming response needs. While
extremely valuable for strategic response, IPC
numbers are not intended to be used for
monitoring achievements towards global
development goals.

Since estimates of the prevalence of severe food
insecurity (FIsev) based on the FIES were first
published in 2017, there is an ongoing need to
clarify the relationship between this and other
indicators that may use similar terminology to
describe conditions of food insecurity. In
particular, given the widespread use of the
Integrated Food Security Phase Classification
(IPC), it is common for people to request
clarification regarding the relation between the
number of people experiencing severe food
insecurity estimated using the FIES and the number
of people classified as acutely food insecure and
in need of urgent action (Phase 3 or worse) in IPC
reports (for examples of such reports, see
www.ipcinfo.org).
The scope, methods, purpose and meaning of
the numbers produced in the context of IPC
analyses are different from the statistics produced
for food security monitoring in the context of
development agendas such as the SDGs. The most
commonly known IPC scale is the Acute IPC
analysis – this is the one referred to here.
Percentages or numbers of acutely food-insecure
people published in IPC reports cannot and should
not be equated nor confused with the prevalence
or numbers of severely food-insecure people based
on the FIES (a component of SDG indicator 2.1.2,
which is the prevalence of moderate or severe
food insecurity). Understanding the differences
between the two is critical for the correct
utilization of each set of figures, as both are
valuable for supporting strategic decision-making.

objective of monitoring development achievements

sustainable development, and drives the
changes needed for a more sustainable and
prosperous future.

KEY MESSAGES

In the 2012 World Health Assembly ( W H A),
Member States approved six global targets for
improving maternal, infant and young child
nutrition to be met by 2025. These W H A
targets call for measures to: i) reduce anaemia
in women of reproductive age; ii) reduce low
birthweight in newborns; iii) increase rates of
exclusive breastfeeding in infants; iv) reduce
stunting; v) reduce wasting; and vi) halt the
rise of overweight among children under five
years of age. The latter three are also part of
the SDG monitoring framework. To align with
the 2030 deadline of the SDGs, this set of 2025
targets has been extended to 2030 to establish
global targets for nutrition (see Box 5). In
addition, the W H A plan of action for the
prevention and control of non-communicable
diseases also called for a reduction in adult
obesit y by 2025.

è Over 50 million children under five in the world
are affected by wasting. Roughly half live in
Southern Asia and one-quarter in sub-Saharan
Africa. Addressing the burden of wasting will
require a multipronged approach, including
prevention, early identification, and treatment.
è Progress has been made on reducing child
stunting. However, nearly 151 million children
under five in the world – or 22 percent – were still
stunted in 2017, down from 25 percent in 2012,
due mainly to progress in Asia. Over 38 million
children under five are overweight.
è Prevalences of anaemia in women and obesity
in adults are increasing. More than one in eight
adults in the world is obese and one in three
women of reproductive age is anaemic.

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the
World 2018 tracks progress on six of the seven
above indicators. Low birthweight estimates
will be released later in 2018 after the
publication of this report and are thus not
presented here.

TARGET 2.2

“By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition,
including achieving, by 2025, the
internationally agreed targets on stunting and
wasting in children under five years of age,
and address the nutritional needs of
adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating
women and older persons.”

Global trends
Globally, the proportion of children below
the age of five who are stunted continues to
decline, with 22.2 percent affected in 2017.
The number of stunted children has also
decreased from 165.2 million in 2012 to
150.8 million in 2017, representing a
9 percent decline over this five-year period.
In 2017, 7.5 percent of children under five
years of age – 50.5 million – suffered from
wasting. Since 2012, the global proportion of
overweight children seems stagnant, with
5.4 percent in 2012 (baseline year of W H A
targets) and 5.6 percent (or 38.3 million)
in 2017.

Nutrition is central to the 2030 Agenda.
Target 2.2 calls for an end to all forms of
malnutrition, and good nutrition also lays
the foundation for achieving many of the
SDGs (Figure 5). Improvements in nutrition
directly support the achievement of
ensuring healthy lives (SDG3), while also
playing a role in ending povert y (SDG1),
ensuring qualit y education (SDG4),
achieving gender equalit y (SDG5),
promoting economic growth (SDG8), and
reducing inequalities (SDG 10). In this way,
good nutrition is the lifeblood of

EXTENDING THE WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY NUTRITION TARGETS TO 2030

2017 were calculated for each indicator for all
countries with trend data. After excluding countries that
had already achieved a low level of malnutrition, the
20th percentile among all the rates of improvement
was selected as an ambitious rate of improvement, but
also one that has proven to be feasible in a large
number of countries. This 20th percentile of the annual
rate of improvement was then applied to the baseline
prevalence globally to calculate a new 2030 target.
Final numbers were rounded. For two of the indicators
(low birthweight and anaemia in women of
reproductive age), the past rate of improvement has
been too slow to achieve the WHA target, even by
2030. Thus, for these indicators, the revised 2030
target is the same as the 2025 target, since the level of
ambition for 2030 should not be less than that agreed
upon for 2025.
For the other indicators, more ambitious targets for
2030 are proposed.

In 2012, the World Health Assembly (WHA) agreed
on six global targets for improving maternal, infant
and young child nutrition to be achieved by 2025.
Subsequently, in 2015, the Sustainable Development
Goals established a global agenda for substantial
improvement in nutrition by the year 2030, setting a
specific objective of ending all forms of malnutrition
by 2030, including achieving the 2025 targets and
addressing the nutritional needs of adolescent girls,
pregnant and lactating women, and older persons.
To align with the deadline year of 2030 for all SDG
targets, UNICEF and WHO then extended the WHA
nutrition targets up to the same year – in the process
making some of them more ambitious – keeping in
mind the original methodology used, the ambition
declared in the SDGs to “end all forms of malnutrition”,
and the feasibility of achieving the new targets.12
The 2030 nutrition targets have been calculated
based on a similar approach to that used for the 2025
targets. The rates of improvement between 1999 and

LEVERAGING THE UNITED NATIONS DECADE OF ACTION ON NUTRITION 2016–2025
have applied socio-economic measures to reduce
vulnerability and strengthen resilience of communities
at risk of climate hazards and emergencies.
However, in order to meet the global targets set,
country implementation has to be scaled up,
investments for nutrition need to be increased and
enhanced policy coherence is required. The Nutrition
Decade encourages governments to set country-specific
SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic,
and time-bound) commitments for urgent investment,
action and collaboration at national level. The first UN
Secretary-General report calls for more actors and
networks to join and engage, specifically city
networks, communities acting on women’s and
children’s health, human rights, water and climate
change.14
The Nutrition Decade also provides a clearly
defined, time-bound cohesive framework and is a
space for aligned action on nutrition by all relevant
actors. The Nutrition Decade provides countries with
mechanisms such as Action Networks for sharing good
practices, illustrating successes and challenges,
promoting improved coordination and building
political momentum to scale up global action.

The United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition
2016–2025, also referred to as the “Nutrition
Decade”, was declared by the UN General Assembly
in 2016 to provide all stakeholders with a unique,
time-bound opportunity to strengthen joint efforts and
achieve a healthier and more sustainable future.
Countries acknowledged the need for accelerated and
sustained action to end malnutrition in all its forms,
everywhere, leaving no one behind.
The first report on the implementation of the
Nutrition Decade was presented by the UN SecretaryGeneral to the UN General Assembly during its
seventy-second session.13 The report provides a review
of the progress made in the implementation of national
nutrition commitments. Currently, 183 countries have
national policies that include nutrition goals and
actions: 105 countries have health sector plans with
nutrition components, 48 countries have national
development plans with integrated nutrition objectives
and about 70 countries have made efforts to
mainstream food security and nutrition in sectoral
policies and investment programmes. Moreover,
57 countries have implemented prevention and
reduction of food insecurity risks, while 28 countries

has seen an upward trend in the number of

estimates for Oceania are too large to make
clear conclusions.
In 2017, 50.5 million children under five were
affected by wasting, with two regions – Asia and
Oceania – seeing almost one in ten affected,
compared to just one in one hundred in Latin
America and the Caribbean. Most of the burden is
concentrated in Asia, with seven out of ten wasted
children in the world residing in that region.

Rates of exclusive breastfeeding in Africa and Asia
are 1.5 times those in Northern America where
only 26.4 percent of infants under six months
receive breastmilk exclusively. Conversely, the
prevalence of anaemia among women of

times higher than in Northern America. No region

malnutrition are small mid-upper arm
circumference and bilateral pitting oedema. This
year’s The State of Food Security and Nutrition in
the World report takes a closer look at the
problem of wasting among children under five
years of age.

General conclusions

Global targets for wasting are to reduce the
prevalence below 5 percent by 2025 and below
3 percent by 2030. In 2017, 7.5 percent of children
under five were affected by wasting, with
regional prevalences ranging from 1.3 percent
(Latin America and the Caribbean) to 9.7 percent
(Asia). Across all regions, around one-third of all
children identified as wasted were severely
wasted, with the exception of Latin America and
the Caribbean, where one-quarter of those
affected suffered from severe wasting (Figure 8 and
Figure 9).

Overall, there has been some progress regarding
stunting and exclusive breastfeeding, although it
may not be sufficient to achieve the global
nutrition targets. Conversely, the scenarios for
childhood overweight, adult obesit y and anaemia
among women of reproductive age are not
improving.
To achieve the W H A 2025 and SDG 2030
nutrition targets will require increased
investment in nutrition inter ventions, scaled-up
implementation of policies and programmes,
enhanced policy coherence, and a greater number
of national commitments.

Children affected by wasting have a higher risk
of mortalit y. An analysis from 2013 indicated that
875 000 deaths (or 12.6 percent of all deaths)
among children under five years of age were
related to wasting, of which 516 000 deaths
(7.4 percent of all deaths among under-fives) were
related to severe wasting.16 Whereas the
mortalit y risk associated with wasting is highest
in the first few years of life, low weight-forheight continues to be a nutritional problem even
for older children (see Box 7).

Global attention on addressing malnutrition in
all its forms is unprecedented, with ICN2
galvanizing nations around a clear action agenda.
As a follow-up to ICN2, the UN Decade of Action
on Nutrition 2016 –2025 has become an umbrella
framework for countries to share experiences,
promote improved coordination and build
political momentum to scale up action towards
eliminating malnutrition in all its forms (see
Box 6). The Scaling Up Nutrition movement,
comprising 60 countries, continues to galvanize
multisectoral action to end stunting and all forms
of malnutrition. All partners and stakeholders
can coordinate efforts around this momentum to
scale up nutrition inter ventions and work towards
eliminating malnutrition.

The main underlying causes of wasting are poor
household food securit y, inadequate feeding and
care practices, and/or poor access to health,
water, hygiene and sanitation ser vices.
Suboptimal breastfeeding, poor complementar y
foods and poor feeding practices can lead to
rapid weight loss or growth failure. Lack of
knowledge about proper food storage,
preparation and consumption by parents and
caregivers may be contributing factors. Wasting
may be part of a vicious cycle with infection:
undernutrition increases the susceptibilit y to
infection, and infection then leads to greater
weight loss due to appetite loss and poor
intestinal absorption. Diarrhoeal disease, in
particular, often leads to rapid weight loss, and
poor access to appropriate and timely health care
slows the recover y from such illnesses. It is not
yet well understood how much wasting
contributes to conditions such as stunting, low

Spotlight on wasting
Wasting is defined as having a low
weight-for-height ratio according to the W HO
Child Growth Standards.15 Specifically, wasting
is defined as weight-for-height below minus two
standard deviations, and severe wasting is
defined as weight-for-height below minus three
standard deviations, from the median
weight-for-height in the reference population.
Wasting ref lects a reduction or loss of body
weight and is considered a relevant indicator of
acute malnutrition. Additional indicators of acute

situations often restrict access to health care, and

concomitant increase in diseases.

All of the underlying causes of undernutrition
described above can be exacerbated in

particularly dangerous in resource-poor settings
where ongoing food scarcity leads to monotonous

Wasting is t y pically measured in terms of its
prevalence at the time of a sur vey. However,
because wasting is often a short-term condition
compared to other forms of malnutrition, the
prevalence at a point in time underestimates the
number of new cases that occur during an entire
calendar year (i.e. incidence). Estimates of
wasting prevalence can var y across seasons.

Sur vey 2015 –16 (NFHS 2015 –16) spanned an
entire year. During a full year, India experiences
several seasonal variations – such as har vest
season, droughts and rains – which may affect
wasting prevalence. Thus, the large geographical
difference in the prevalence of child wasting
obser ved in India may be inf luenced by when the
sur vey was conducted in specific regions.
However, other factors may also contribute to
the wide gaps noted in prevalence of wasting by
state. For instance, in the state with the highest

the households do not have access to sanitation
facilities and almost half (46.1 percent) of the

Because wasting is often inaccurately considered
to be a condition that occurs only during
emergency situations, ongoing programmes to
address this form of malnutrition outside of the

children under the age of five years were
admitted to treatment programmes for severe

with the deliver y of an infant and young child

any given point in time during the year 2016, far
too few (i.e. one in four) were admitted into these
life-saving programmes. Funding to care for
children with severe wasting is often short-term
and is focused primarily on humanitarian
situations. Sustainable and adequately resourced
programmes to prevent malnutrition in all its
forms are necessar y to reach the SDG targets for
nutrition, including child wasting.

Prevention of wasting requires addressing the
underlying causes of malnutrition. Breastfeeding
support and nutrition counselling for families –
particularly regarding how to improve the
qualit y of complementar y foods and feeding
practices – and early care for common childhood
illnesses are essential. Food systems need to
ensure that they deliver nutritious, safe and
affordable diets for infants and young children, »

Addressing the burden of wasting will require
a multipronged approach, including prevention
in infancy and early childhood, early
identification before children develop medical
complications, and treatment of affected
children, particularly those with severe
wasting. An analysis from 2013 indicated that
management of acute malnutrition, combined

also high (>15 percent) in Afghanistan, Bangladesh,
Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The global
prevalence of thinness has barely changed over the
past decade, with less than a percentage point drop
in prevalence since 2005.
School nutrition programmes can be an effective
platform for providing nutritious meals or snacks,
micronutrient supplements, and nutrition information,
education and counselling. There is also a need for more
nutrition intervention programmes among school-age
children in addition to programmes for preschool
children. Schools are increasingly being recognized as
an effective platform for providing nutrition and health
interventions to school-age children and adolescents.
School feeding programmes can help prevent hunger,
increase school enrolment, reduce absenteeism and
improve learning outcomes. Interventions such as
deworming and micronutrient supplementation are also
linked to better nutrition and learning. The promotion of
good nutrition and health in school settings is viewed as
an effective tool to improve the growth and development
of children and reduce risk factors for non-communicable
diseases. In addition, SDG2 highlights the importance of
nutrition for adolescent girls.

Whereas the mortality risk associated with wasting
is highest in the first few years of life, low
weight-for-height continues to be a nutritional
problem even for older children. Thinness among
children 5–9 years of age and adolescents 10–19
years of age is associated with higher risk of
infectious diseases, delayed maturation, and
reduced muscular strength, work capacity and bone
density later in life.21 Improved nutrition leads to
better growth, development and educational
achievements in school-age children.22 For girls,
thinness (defined as low Body Mass Index (BMI) for
age) is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes
including maternal mortality, delivery complications,
preterm birth, and intrauterine growth retardation.
Globally, over 10 percent of children aged 5–19
have a BMI-for-age below -2 standard deviations
from the median of the WHO reference population.
As is the case with wasting among preschool-age
children, there are dramatic differences in the
prevalence of thinness among children aged 5–19
years by region of the world. Thinness in school-age
children is extremely high in India, where over onequarter of children are too thin. The prevalence is

PART 1 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD IN 2018

è Access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food must
be framed as a human right, with priority given to the
most vulnerable. Policies that promote
nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food systems are
needed, with special attention to the food security and
nutrition of children under five, school-age children,
adolescent girls and women in order to halt the
intergenerational cycle of malnutrition.

» including the most v ulnerable. Water, hygiene
and sanitation programmes need to ensure
access to safe drinking water and sanitation
facilities. Furthermore, social protection and
safet y net programmes need to ensure access to
healthy diets for children and families left
behind by mainstream development.
Improved growth monitoring and
promotion, for instance by vaccination
ser vices and during child health and
nutrition days, could help identif y children
at risk of severe wasting and at risk of
morbidit y and mortalit y, such as those who
are moderately wasted and those in need of
treatment. Furthermore, medical and
nutritional treatment of severe acute
malnutrition needs to be scaled up as part of
routine health and nutrition ser vices for
children to improve childhood sur vival.
These key areas are outlined in the sets of
recommended actions in the ICN2
Framework for Action that countries are
encouraged to implement, as appropriate,
under the umbrella of the UN Decade of
Action on Nutrition. n

At first glance, the preceding sections may
appear to be telling different stories, confirming
the trends described in the 2017 State of Food
Security and Nutrition in the World report: hunger
and food insecurit y are on the rise, while child
stunting continues to decline. In addition, the
prevalence of obesit y among adults in the world
increased steadily between 1975 and 2016 – and
at an accelerated pace over the past decade. How
can these seemingly contradictor y food securit y
and nutrition trends be reconciled?
The focus on child wasting in the preceding
section shows the challenges involved in building
knowledge on the relationship between food
insecurit y and nutrition outcomes. Like child
wasting, the causes of child stunting and other
forms of malnutrition are complex, multisectoral
and rooted in political and economic structures
and ideological factors that influence control over
resources. 23 When looked at through the lens of
food systems, additional aspects of the food supply
chain, food environment and consumer behaviour
that influence the basic and underlying causes of
malnutrition come to light. 24 These interplaying
factors var y from context to context – across
regions, countries, areas within countries, and
even among and within households.

KEY MESSAGES
è Food insecurity contributes to overweight and
obesity, as well as undernutrition, and high rates of
these forms of malnutrition coexist in many countries.
The higher cost of nutritious foods, the stress of living
with food insecurity, and physiological adaptations to
food restriction help explain why food-insecure
families may have a higher risk of overweight and
obesity.

As the discussion in Part 2 of this report
highlights, food securit y is a necessar y but not
sufficient condition to prevent malnutrition and
ensure adequate nutrition. Part 2 depicts the
complex interplay of multiple food and non-food
factors affecting nutritional status, including the
four dimensions of food securit y – availabilit y,
access, utilization and stabilit y (see Figure 28).

è Poor food access increases the risk of low
birthweight and stunting in children, which are
associated with higher risk of overweight and obesity
later in life.

Using this as an analytical basis, this section
takes a closer look at one small part of the larger
conceptual framework of causes and effects of
food securit y and nutrition: the pathways from
food access to malnutrition. This is important

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

because different pathways can lead to nutritional
outcomes as disparate as stunting in children and
obesit y in adults. Such details are seldom
captured in existing conceptual fig ures linking
food securit y and nutrition, yet they are essential
for illuminating the mechanisms by which food
insecurit y can lead to different manifestations of
malnutrition. Awareness of these pathways is
crucial for understanding obser ved trends and
designing effective policies and programmes
aimed at improving nutrition.

that are often energ y-dense, high in saturated
fats, sugars and salt, and low in fibre.
Such changes bring w ith them a shift in the
profile of nutritional status and diet-related
diseases. In pre-transition conditions, the
nutritional problems that predominate among
the more v ulnerable population g roups are
undernutrition and nutrient deficiencies.
T he transition g radually brings about increased
energ y consumption in the population,
including among the more v ulnerable. Under
such conditions, undernutrition and some
nutrient deficiencies beg in to decline, while the
excessive consumption of energ y-dense,
processed foods high in fats, salt and sugars
becomes a major issue. T hese consumption
habits lead to increasing rates of over weight and
diet-related non-communicable chronic
diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and
diabetes. Table 5 shows how dietar y and
nutritional profiles change over three stages of
the nutrition transition.

Following is an over view of the current body of
knowledge on the relationship between food
insecurit y (specifically the experience of not
having access to safe, nutritious and sufficient
food due to lack of money or other resources) and
selected indicators of malnutrition. The different
pathways from food insecurit y to malnutrition
are discussed in detail to dispel
misunderstandings about the apparent hungerobesit y paradox and to shed light on the
implications for policy-making. The aim is to
advance the discussion of food securit y and
nutrition to align it with the ambitions of the
2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.

The trends presented in the previous section are
characteristic of the global nutrition transition. 25
Rapid demographic, social and economic changes
in many low- and middle-income countries have
led to increased urbanization and changes in
food systems, lifest yles and eating habits. As a
consequence, dietar y patterns have shifted
toward increased consumption of processed foods

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

Figure 13 shows countries that have a high
prevalence of more than one form of
malnutrition. The size of each box is
proportionate to the total number of countries
with a high prevalence of the respective form of
malnutrition: child stunting, 73 countries; child
wasting, 14; child overweight, 29; adult obesit y,
101; and anaemia in women of reproductive age,
35. The prevalence threshold that is considered
high for child stunting is 20 percent or above;
for child wasting and child overweight, the
threshold is 10 percent or higher. 28 Among these
countries, Indonesia is the only one that shows
a high prevalence of all three of these forms of
child malnutrition, whereas nine countries have
simultaneously high prevalence of child
stunting and child overweight. Six of these nine
countries also have a prevalence of adult obesit y
exceeding 20 percent, which is considered to be
a high threshold. Eleven countries have
simultaneously high rates of overweight among
children and prevalence of adult obesit y above
20 percent.

Food insecurit y, in terms of poor food access,
contributes to these situations in ways that are
not always obvious. Moderate levels of food
insecurit y are often associated with diets that are
energ y-dense yet poor in micronutrients, because
resource constraints may force people to reduce
the nutritional qualit y of their diets. For example,
these diets can cause micronutrient deficiencies
in children that impede their growth and may
also lead to obesit y in mothers. At the same time,
a diet that increases obesit y may be lacking in
iron, and thus may result in both obesit y and
anaemia in the same woman.

Pathways from food insecurity to malnutrition
There are multiple pathways whereby the
experience of food insecurit y – defined here as
uncertain access to sufficient, safe and
nutritious food – may contribute to forms of
malnutrition as seemingly divergent as
undernutrition and obesit y. Figure 14 illustrates
details of the link between food access and
nutritional outcomes that are difficult to
capture in comprehensive conceptual
frameworks depicting the many basic,
underlying and immediate causes of food
insecurit y and malnutrition.

With respect to anaemia among women of
reproductive age, W HO considers a prevalence of
40 percent or higher to be of severe public health
significance. 29 Three countries have a high
prevalence of anaemia in women and levels of
adult obesit y above 20 percent, and one of these –
Haiti – also suffers from a high prevalence of
child stunting. Twent y-nine countries have a high
prevalence of anaemia in women and also of
child stunting, with eight of these also suffering
from a high prevalence of child wasting.

As the fig ure shows, the main pathways from
food insecurit y to malnutrition pass through food
consumption, or diet. Indicators of dietar y intake
are crucial to understanding the pathway from
food insecurit y to nutritional outcomes. More
information on the food environment and food
intake is needed to shed light on this
relationship.

The multiple burden of malnutrition is more
prevalent in low-, lower-middle and middleincome countries and concentrated among the
poor. Obesit y in high-income countries is
similarly concentrated among the poor. 30 The
coexistence of multiple forms of malnutrition can
occur not only within countries and communities,
but also within households – and can even affect
the same person over their lifetime. Various
examples of such situations are found at the
household and individual level. A household may,
for instance, have both a stunted child and an
overweight or obese mother. At an individual
level, a woman could be both overweight and
suffer from anaemia, and a child could be
simultaneously stunted and overweight. 31

Figure 14 illustrates a number of key links and
nexuses that make up the pathways from food
insecurit y to malnutrition. Two pathways are
depicted: one leading from food insecurit y to
undernutrition and another leading to overweight
and obesit y. Below they are examined in more
detail along with the evidence from studies that
investigated these links using experience-based
food insecurit y metrics in combination with
indicators of nutritional status. 32

stunting and wasting and micronutrient

because it is intuitive. A diet characterized by
insufficient intake of calories, protein,
vitamins and minerals will impede foetal,
infant and child growth and development.
Such diets contribute to maternal
undernutrition and consequently to higher risk
of low birthweight, which in turn are both risk
factors for child stunting.
Existing research points to a link bet ween

Little evidence is currently available supporting
the association between food insecurit y and
child wasting. Three out of fifteen studies on
this link reported a positive association, mostly
in low- and lower-middle-income countries
(Table 6). 36 As discussed in the preceding section,
wasting is an indicator of acute malnutrition,
which is strongly inf luenced by factors other
than food insecurit y (such as infections and
diseases often caused by a lack of access to safe
water, sanitation and qualit y health ser vices).
Child wasting may also be the result of
short-term shocks and humanitarian crises.

Food insecurit y is a risk factor for anaemia in
women of reproductive age. Six out of eight
studies reviewed from diverse countries and
regions found a significant association between
the two (Table 6). 37
The stress of living with food insecurit y can also
have a negative effect on the nutrition of infants
by compromising breastfeeding. Exclusive
breastfeeding in the first six months protects
against child stunting and wasting as well as
against obesit y later in life. 38 The existing
evidence suggests that infants in food-insecure
| 31 |

PART 1 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD IN 2018

for food-insecure families may result in diets
high in energ y and low in diversit y,
micronutrients and fibre. 41 Food-insecure people
are often less likely to have physical access to
markets where they can buy nutritious and
healthy foods at affordable prices, particularly in
high-income countries. The negative effect of
food insecurit y on diet qualit y has been
documented in low-, middle- and high-income
countries alike. 42

households are at a higher risk of not being
exclusively breastfed. 39 Household food
insecurit y is associated with higher rates of
maternal depression and stress in
lower-middle-income as well as high-income
countries, and this can undermine maternal
confidence and self-efficacy, adversely affecting
initiation and duration of breastfeeding and
age-appropriate complementar y feeding. 40
Thus, as shown in Figure 14, food insecurit y can
both directly (through compromised diets) and
indirectly (through the impact of stress on infant
feeding) cause child wasting, stunting and
micronutrient deficiencies. Nutritional knowledge
and food habits may play a role by moderating
the effects of household food insecurit y on diet
and, consequently, on nutritional outcomes.
Finally, it is important to bear in mind that lack
of access to clean water, sanitation and qualit y
health care can cause diarrhoea and infectious
diseases that interfere with the body´s abilit y to
absorb nutrients. Recurrent infections and
disease are serious contributing factors to
wasting and stunting in children.

There is a psychosocial route from food insecurit y
to obesit y as well. The experience of not having
certain or adequate access to food often causes
feelings of anxiet y, stress and depression, which
in turn can lead to behaviours that increase the
risk of overweight and obesit y. These include
patterns of binging or overeating when food is
available (and continued availabilit y uncertain),
or choosing low-cost, energ y-dense “comfort
foods” rich in fat, sugar and salt. Such foods have
been found to have physiological effects that
reduce stress in the short term. As mentioned
previously, the stress of living with food
insecurit y can also have a negative effect on
breastfeeding and young child feeding practices,
which in turn increases the children’s risk of
obesit y in adulthood. 43

The food insecurity–obesity link. Although it
may appear to be a paradox, food insecurit y is
often associated with overweight and obesit y.
As such, it may lead policy-makers in countries
where many of the poor and food insecure are
overweight to question the allocation of
resources for food assistance. However, the
association between food insecurit y and
overweight and obesit y is in fact not
contradictor y, and can be understood by
considering the obesogenic pathway presented
in Figure 14.

Metabolic changes caused by disordered eating
patterns and food deprivation are another
component of the obesogenic pathway from food
insecurit y to malnutrition. Physiological
adaptations in response to “feast-and-famine”
cycles have been associated with an increase in
body fat, decrease in lean muscle mass, and more
rapid weight gain when food becomes
plentiful. 44 In addition, maternal and infant/child
food deprivation can result in foetal and early
childhood “metabolic imprinting”, which
increases the risk of obesit y and diet-related
non-communicable chronic diseases later in life.
Maternal undernutrition – as well as overweight
– caused by lack of stable access to adequate diets
can programme metabolic, physiological and
neuroendocrine functions in offspring, fuelling
an intergenerational cycle of malnutrition. 45

The link between food insecurit y and overweight
and obesit y passes through diet, which is
affected by the cost of food. Nutritious, fresh
foods often tend to be expensive. Thus, when
household resources for food become scarce,
people choose less expensive foods that are often
high in caloric densit y and low in nutrients,
particularly in urban settings and upper-middleand high-income countries. In the context of
globalized food markets where the relative cost
of foods that are high in fats and sugar is low
compared to fresh products such as fruits,
vegetables and leg umes, the prioritization of cost

As mentioned, food insecurit y is associated with
low birthweight in infants. 46 Low birthweight is a
risk factor for child stunting, which in turn is
associated with overweight and obesit y later in
| 32 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

children under five and anaemia in women of
reproductive age. It also interferes with exclusive
breastfeeding of children in the first six months
of life. Moreover, food insecurit y is linked with
overweight in girls older than five and is a risk
factor for obesit y among women, particularly in
upper-middle- and high-income countries.

life. According to a 2016 W HO report of the
Commission on Ending Childhood Obesit y:
“Children who have suffered from undernutrition
and were born with low birthweight or are shortfor-age (stunted) are at far greater risk of
developing overweight and obesit y when faced
with energ y-dense diets and a sedentar y lifest yle
later in life.”47 It is also worth noting that
children who are stunted have a higher risk of
being simultaneously overweight.

These findings, needless to say, are heavily
dependent on context and research methods.
Contextual factors such as countr y income level,
or urban versus rural area, may explain some
differences in the obser ved relationships between
food insecurit y and nutritional outcomes.
Moreover, the majorit y of the studies are
cross-sectional, meaning they did not involve
obser vation of the same group over time.
Longitudinal research, therefore, is necessar y to
understand the potential effects of food
insecurit y on nutritional outcomes throughout
the life cycle, from before and during pregnancy
to infancy and into adulthood.

Evidence on the association between poor access
to food and obesit y or overweight is growing, in
resource-rich and resource-poor settings alike. In
the context of the nutrition transition, overweight
and obesit y are not just problems for high-income
countries, but increasingly an issue for low- and
middle-income countries as well.
Evidence of the impact of food insecurit y on
malnutrition via the obesogenic pathway is
especially notable in countries that have
undergone the nutrition transition. Adult
women who live in food-insecure households
are at a higher risk of obesit y, particularly in
upper-middle- and high-income countries. 48
However, this link is weaker or absent for men,
and there are no conclusive results for
children, although food insecurit y does appear
to be associated with overweight in girls older
than five.

It is equally important to analyse food insecurit y
at the individual level to highlight possible
differences within households. The distribution
of food and resources within households is
inf luenced by a number of cultural and social
factors. Especially under conditions of scarcit y,
women and children are sometimes discriminated
against in the distribution of food; mothers may
subsequently adjust their food intake to buffer
the effect of food insecurit y on their children.
Gender inequalities in societ y and women’s roles
inf luence decision-making power and access to
food within the household, with important
consequences for women’s own food securit y and
nutrition as well as that of their children.

According to the 2016 W HO report mentioned
above, in high-income countries, childhood
obesit y is more prevalent among the lower
socio-economic groups. The opposite is currently
true in most low- and middle-income countries,
although this pattern is rapidly changing. Indeed,
certain subpopulation groups in these countries,
such as indigenous populations, are at an even
higher risk of becoming obese. In addition,
according to the W HO report, “Childhood
obesit y is a strong predictor of adult obesit y,
which has well known health and economic
consequences, both for the individual and societ y
as a whole.”49

It is important to highlight that the experience of
food insecurit y also has other harmful
consequences for the well-being of children and
adults beyond malnutrition. Food insecurit y has
negative impacts on the academic performance of
children and is associated with behavioural
problems. Food-insecure children are more likely
to face adverse health outcomes and
developmental risks. 50 For children as well as
adults, lack of reliable access to food can lead to
anxiet y, stress, depression, interpersonal
tensions, and the alienation that comes with
social stigma. These psychological and social

In summar y, there is little doubt that food
insecurit y is among the determinants of various
forms of malnutrition via the pathways depicted
in Figure 14. Food insecurit y particularly increases
the risk of low birthweight, stunting among

on Nutrition.

effects have important consequences for overall
health and well-being, regardless of nutritional
status, and have negative economic impacts on
individuals, households, communities and
nations. They can contribute to a vicious cycle of
food insecurit y, wherein social isolation,
depression and stress, as well as poor health and
poor cognitive development, all impede people
from reaching their full potential, with possible
negative consequences for earning capacit y and
access to food.

“Double-dut y actions” have been proposed by
W HO that can simultaneously reduce
undernutrition and overweight and obesit y. 51
They highlight the need to be careful so that
strategies to address undernutrition in early life
do not exacerbate overweight and obesit y later
in life. Existing programmes should be
redesigned and leveraged, and new
inter ventions should be developed, to reduce the
risk of multiple forms of malnutrition. Trade,
investments and agriculture policies must be
nutrition-sensitive and improve access to
healthy diets, rather than promoting commodit y
crops that provide a cheap source of starch, fat
and sugar in the food supply. 52

So what can be done?
As more data become available on food securit y
(food access), dietar y intake and nutritional
outcomes, integrated analysis of these data will
yield better information to shape policies that
address the multiple forms of malnutrition.
Existing evidence supports the need for
implementing and scaling up inter ventions
aimed at g uaranteeing access to nutritious foods
and breaking the intergenerational cycle of
malnutrition. The 1 000 days between
conception and a child’s second birthday is a
window of unsurpassed opportunit y to both
prevent child stunting and overweight and
promote child nutrition, growth and
development with lasting effects over the child’s
life. The origins of growth faltering begin as
early as before and during pregnancy, with
short- as well as long-term consequences. Child
undernutrition can cause impaired cognitive
development in children, with dramatic
consequences in terms of self-realization and
productivit y. This can result in an
intergenerational cycle of malnutrition,
perpetuated by undernourished girls becoming
undernourished mothers at risk of giving birth
to infants with low birthweights. Exclusive
breastfeeding in the first six months and
adequate complementar y foods and feeding
practices up to two years of age are key to
ensuring normal child growth and development
during this crucial window of opportunit y.

The discussion illustrates why it is so important
– especially in the context of the UN Decade of
Action on Nutrition and the 2030 Agenda – to
improve the way hunger and food insecurit y are
conceptualized and measured. Food insecurit y
can exist in all countries, and it can contribute to
multiple forms of malnutrition – undernutrition
and micronutrient deficiencies as well as
overweight and obesit y. Experience-based
metrics of food insecurit y like the FIES, and
awareness of the different pathways from food
insecurit y to malnutrition, can contribute to the
design of more effective inter ventions and policy
coherence across sectors. The consequences for
people´s health, well-being and productivit y are
far-reaching.
In conclusion, evidence continues to point to a
rise in world hunger and food insecurit y in
recent years. Progress is being made on child
stunting – though too slow to meet global
targets and with significant interregional and
intraregional disparities. Simultaneously, rates
of anaemia in women of reproductive age and
obesit y in adults are increasing. It will not be
possible to end all forms of malnutrition
without ensuring access to safe, nutritious and
sufficient food all year round. This will require
expanding the reach of social protection

Given this evidence, policies must pay special
attention to the food securit y and nutrition of
infants and children under five, school-age
children, adolescent girls and women. These
groups have been identified as the most
v ulnerable to the harmful consequences of poor

policies to address inequalities and ensuring
that they are nutrition- and gender-sensitive in
terms of: targeting; design; and in the
identification of complementar y health care
and agriculture inter ventions to enhance
nutrition outcomes. At the same time, a
sustainable shift must be made towards
nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food
systems that can provide safe and high qualit y
food for all promoting healthy diets in line
with the recommended action of the ICN2
Framework for Action and the Work
Programme of the UN Decade of Action on
Nutrition. 53 Market reg ulations that discourage
consumption of unhealthy foods are also called

for, in conjunction with policies that promote
the availabilit y and consumption of healthy
foods. 54 All of these actions require
strengthened public governance and
addressing conf licts of interest and imbalances
in power among stakeholders. Access to food
must be framed as a human right, prioritizing
the access of the most v ulnerable to safe,
nutritious and sufficient food.
Part 2 takes an in-depth look at a factor that
already appears to be having an impact on
food securit y and nutrition, raising
additional policy considerations: climate
variabilit y and extremes. n

THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE
ON FOOD SECURITY
AND NUTRITION
WHY FOCUS ON THE
IMPACT OF CLIMATE
VARIABILITY AND
EXTREMES ON FOOD
SECURITY AND
NUTRITION?

As shown in Part 1 of this report, the number of
people who suffer from hunger has been growing
over the past three years, returning to levels that
prevailed almost a decade ago. Equally of concern
is that 22.2 percent of children under five are
affected by stunting in 2017.

2.1

Last year this report obser ved that three factors
are behind the recent trends affecting food
securit y and nutrition in multiple ways and
challenging people’s access to food: conf lict,
climate and economic slowdowns. After an
in-depth study of the role of conf lict in the 2017
report, this part of the 2018 report focuses on the
role of climate – more specifically, climate
variabilit y and extremes.

KEY MESSAGES
è Climate variability and exposure to more complex,
frequent and intense climate extremes are threatening
to erode and even reverse the gains made in ending
hunger and malnutrition.

Here in Part 2, the report aims to understand
how climate variabilit y and extremes are
adversely affecting food securit y and nutrition.
The channels through which this is occurring are
identified on the basis of existing evidence
complemented with original analysis. The
ultimate purpose is to provide g uidance on how
the key challenges brought about by climate
variabilit y and extremes can be overcome in order
to achieve the goals of ending hunger and
malnutrition in all forms by 2030 (SDG Targets
2.1 and 2.2) as well as other SDGs, including
taking action to combat climate change and its
impacts (SDG13).

è Climate variability and extremes are a key driver
behind the recent rise in global hunger and one of the
leading causes of severe food crises.
è Severe droughts linked to the strong El Niño of
2015–2016 affected many countries, contributing
to the recent uptick in undernourishment at the
global level.
è Hunger is significantly worse in countries with
agricultural systems that are highly sensitive to rainfall
and temperature variability and severe drought, and
where the livelihood of a high proportion of the
population depends on agriculture.
Mounting evidence points to the fact that climate
change is already affecting agriculture and food
securit y, which will make the challenge of ending
hunger, achieving food securit y, improving
nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture
more difficult. 55

Climate change takes place over a period of
decades or centuries. There are also shorter-term
climate variations (e.g. in temperature and
rainfall) and extremes (leading to drought,
f loods, storms, etc.) associated with periodic or
intermittent changes related to different natural
phenomena (such as El Niño, La Niña, volcanic
eruptions or other changes in earth systems). 56
However, these shorter-term climate variations
are not all attributable to climate change.

climate change occurs over a period of decades
or centuries, what people experience in their
daily life is climate variabilit y and climate
extremes, 57 regardless of whether or not these
are driven by climate change. Third,
unsurprisingly, all dimensions of food securit y
and nutrition, including food availabilit y, access,
utilization and stabilit y, are potentially affected
even in the short term by climate variabilit y and
climate extremes.

In any case, the attribution of climate variations
and extremes to climate change is beyond the
scope of this report.

Changes in climate are already undermining
production of major crops (wheat, rice and maize)
in tropical and temperate regions and, without
adaptation, this is expected to worsen as
temperatures increase and become more
extreme. 58 Climate-related disasters have come to
dominate the risk landscape to the point where
they now account for more than 80 percent of all
major internationally reported disasters. 59 Of all
natural hazards, f loods, droughts and tropical
storms affect food production the most. Drought

The focus on climate variations and extremes is
prompted by three considerations. First, the
number of extreme events, including extreme
heat, droughts, f loods and storms, has doubled
since the early 1990s, with an average of 213 of
these events occurring ever y year during the
period of 1990 –2016 (Figure 15). Second, while

impacts of climate change, and to foster climate
resilience and lower greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions without jeopardizing food production.

in particular causes more than 80 percent of the
total damage and losses in agriculture, especially
for the livestock and crop production subsectors.
In relation to extreme events, the fisheries
subsector is most affected by tsunamis and
storms, while most of the economic impact on
forestr y is caused by f loods and storms. 60

Agricultural production and food systems are
major sources of GHG emissions and are
particularly sensitive to climate. These systems
need to be a priorit y for climate change
adaptation and mitigation action. The challenge
is to increase agricultural production in ways
that are both more sustainable (for example,
through enabling sustainable healthy diets) and
more climate-resilient, while at the same time
reducing emissions.

New information from countr y food balance
sheets points to reductions in food availabilit y
and price increases in regions affected by the El
Niño phenomenon in 2015 –16. This event
resulted in large climatic deviations and
anomalies compared to historical norms, which
were experienced in different ways and to
var ying degrees of intensit y in various parts of
the world (Box 8). In some areas, severe drought
conditions have resulted from the El Niño
phenomenon, particularly in regions where many
low- and middle-income countries are situated.

Addressing climate variabilit y and extremes
and their impact on food securit y and nutrition
requires cross-sectoral action with stakeholder
engagement at all levels. A challenge is that
existing global policy strategies are
compartmentalized into several dialog ues:
climate change, governed by the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) and the 2015 Paris
Agreement; disaster risk reduction, under the
Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction;
and the humanitarian–development nexus and
resilience building, broadly addressed in the
2016 World Humanitarian Summit and
subsequent discussions.

While hunger is on the rise, it is equally alarming
that the number of people facing crisis-level food
insecurit y continues to increase. In 2017, almost
124 million people across 51 countries and
territories faced “crisis”61 levels of acute food
insecurit y or worse, requiring immediate
emergency action to safeg uard their lives and
preser ve their livelihoods. 62 This represents an
increase compared to 2015 and 2016, when 80 and
108 million people, respectively, were reported as
facing crisis levels. As with increased levels of
hunger, major contributors to crisis-level food
insecurit y are climate-related, in particular
droughts. Moreover, climate variabilit y and
extremes are also contributing to the alarming
levels of malnutrition, as can be seen below.

At the same time, nutrition, health and the links
between them – which are all impacted by
climate variabilit y and extremes – are addressed
in the outcome documents of the second
International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2),
where countries recognized the need to act. The
Work Programme of the UN Decade of Action on
Nutrition provides a framework for helping
countries to implement relevant commitments
and recommendations.

The 2030 Agenda: advancing progress through
strengthened resilience and adaptive capacity in
response to natural hazards and climate-related
disasters

Similarly, these global policy dialog ues are
elaborated in a number of national action plans
related to climate change, disaster risk reduction
and resilience and nutrition. These include
National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), Health
National Adaptation Plans (HNAPs) and
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),
which g uide national climate change adaptation
and mitigation action. The HNAPs usually
include food and nutrition securit y. »

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
makes an explicit link between sustainable
development and climate action. Through SDG13,
the 2030 Agenda calls for strengthened resilience
and adaptive capacity in response to natural
hazards and climate-related disasters in all
countries. 63 It also calls on all countries to
establish and operationalize an integrated strateg y
– one that includes food security and nutrition – to
improve their ability to adapt to the adverse

ocean processes, but also on global weather and
climate. As shown in the figures below, El Niño

to achieve the overarching goal of sustainable
development that is embodied in the 2030
Agenda. The challenge is to use policy and crosssectoral strategies to strengthen resilience and
adaptive capacities to climate variabilit y and
extremes (SDG13). Meeting this challenge
through integrated solutions is absolutely
necessar y to end extreme povert y and hunger,
achieve food securit y, improve nutrition, and
make agriculture sustainable (SDGs 1 and 2).

Increasing and more variable temperatures
The Earth’s climate has experienced rapid
warming of approximately 0.85 °C during the last
centur y. 65 Based on historical obser vations, there
is a clear global trend of an overall increase in
warm days and nights, with a reduction in cold
days and nights. Land and ocean surface
temperature have clearly been rising over time
and this rise has been accelerating in the last few
decades. 66 Trends in increased average
temperatures are often ref lected in one or more
measures of extreme temperature (e.g. hot/cold
days and hot/cold nights).

The importance of changing climate variability
and extremes to agriculture, food security
and nutrition
There is strong evidence of global climate change
in the form of rising air and sea surface
temperatures, receding glaciers, shifting climate
regimes, increasing frequency and intensit y of
extreme events and sea level rises. 64 The
accelerated warming of the planet continues to
lead to modified ecosystem processes, changing
climate variabilit y and more intense
climate-related events across the globe, including
extreme temperatures (cold and hot spells) and
variations in rainfall (f loods and droughts).
However, as noted, not all t ypes of climate and
temperature extremes are easily attributable to
climate change. For example, droughts are
sometimes difficult to connect to warming trends
because they are inf luenced by a complex
interplay of temperature, precipitation and soil
moisture, with precipitation in particular
exhibiting high natural variabilit y. Hurricanes

In Australia, southern Africa, and northern,
central, eastern and western Asia, there have
been increases in hot days and hot nights. Even
so, a few subregions have demonstrated spatially
variable warming and cooling trends, such as
eastern Africa, western and south-eastern South
America, central North America and the eastern
United States of America, along with decreases in
hot nights in north-eastern Canada. Overall, in
the northern hemisphere, 1983 –2012 was the
warmest 30-year period of the last 1 400 years. 67
Most recently, the 2015 –2016 El Niño was a
significant source of regional temperature
anomalies, including both higher (e.g. Brazil) and
lower (e.g. Kenya, the United Republic of
Tanzania) surface temperatures. 68

The temperature anomalies associated with El
Niño ser ve to show that climate variabilit y and
extremes affect agriculture. The period 2015 –
2016 witnessed the most recent El Niño event,
and 2011–2016 witnessed the longest recent
time span with only one El Niño event (the
previous was in 2010); both also align with the
noted increase in PoU in many areas of the
world. Hence it is useful to describe climate
anomalies over these two periods in order to

unpack the possible links between climate and
increasing PoU.
It can be noted that average temperatures over
agriculture cropping areas are higher in most
countries during both periods, compared with the
long-term average of 1981–2016 (Figure 16). Where
this occurs, there has likely been an impact on
crop yields and production. There are some

lower crop yields and other consequences that
undermine food securit y and nutrition.
Temperature anomalies over agriculture
cropped areas continued to be higher than the
long-term mean throughout 2011–2016, leading
to more frequent extremely hot conditions in
the last five years (Figure 17). Many countries,
including Brazil, Ethiopia, Indonesia and some
others in East Africa and Central Asia have
experienced three or more years where
maximum daily temperatures were much more
frequently extreme.

High spatial variability in rainfall

extreme climate events (droughts, f loods or
storms) but rather are aspects of climate
variabilit y that affect the growth of crops and the
availabilit y of pasture for livestock, with
potentially significant implications for food
securit y and nutrition.

Annual precipitation (or rainfall) is naturally far
more variable from year to year than temperature,
and a range of drivers from local to global are
responsible for this. Total rainfall changes
depend on the variations in both frequency and
intensit y, which can either compensate or
reinforce each other. For example, between 2011
and 2016, increases in rainfall frequency over
Central Asia were compensated by decreases in
intensit y, whereas over Southern Africa both
frequency and intensit y declined. 69 Also,
historical trends in rainfall are far more diverse
depending on the region, although there seem to
have been more regional increases than decreases
in heav y rainfall.

For example, in the Afram Plains region of
Ghana, farmers are noticing delays in the
onset of the rainy season, mid-season
heatwaves and high-intensit y rains that cause
f looding, which are resulting in crop loss, low
yields and reduced availabilit y of household
food. 70 Similarly in Wenchi, Ghana, farmers
consider both poor rainfall distribution and
frequent droughts as the most important
climate-related changes. 71 Farmers in the
Nigerian savannah and the Kagera region in
the north of the United Republic of Tanzania
are also noticing changing rainfall patterns
and shorter growing seasons. 72 Ver y few
studies, however, have linked farmer reports
of changing seasonal patterns to actual
climatic data. 73

Recent years show large spatial variabilit y in
rainfall data, displaying both strong positive and
negative anomalies when compared with the
historic average (Figure 18). Most notable are the
below-normal rainfall levels over a large area of
the globe in 2015 –2016, some of which are also
evident during the 2011–2016 period – again
highlighting the inf luence of climate variabilit y
(especially strong global events such as ENSO)
on the sub-decadal periods in which they occur.
These anomalies are also apparent when
aggregated over agriculture cropping areas
(Figure 18c, d), which is equally striking, with
below-normal precipitation levels during
2015 –2016 in Africa, Central and South America,
South-eastern Asia, the Philippines and Papua
New Guinea. These are regions where the
livelihoods of millions of small-scale family
farmers, pastoralists and agropastoralists depend
on rainfall – but above-normal rainfall is often
hazardous and leads to crop damage, soil erosion
and f looding. During the 2015 –2016 El-Niño,
large parts of Asia experienced higher than
normal rainfall.

It is difficult to understand the causes and
impacts of changes in seasonal rainfall
distributions, lengths of seasons and start/
end of seasons, as these depend on the
specific crop and livestock system, as well as
the multitude of differing agriculture
calendars. However, the frequency and
intensit y of daily rainfall (see Figure 20) provide
some evidence that many countries and
regions have experienced changes in the
distribution of rainfall over cropped areas in
the last few years.
Africa is one region where the inf luence of
climate on production and livelihoods is both
strongest and most complex. Much of the
v ulnerabilit y to climate shocks stems from the
dr yland farming and pastoral rangeland
systems that dominate livelihood systems for
70 –80 percent of the continent’s rural
population. 74 A heav y reliance on rainfed
agriculture (crops and rangelands) makes rural
populations more v ulnerable. Furthermore, in
arid, semi-arid and dr y subhumid areas, the
impacts of human activities aggravate
conditions of desertification and drought. This
is particularly relevant to Africa as farming

Changes in seasonality
In addition to increasing temperatures and
changes in rainfall, the nature of rainfall seasons
is also changing, specifically the timing of
seasonal climate events. This is related to the
late/early start of rainy seasons, the unequal
distribution of rainfall within a season (e.g.
periods of dr y and rainy days) and changes in
temperatures during the rainfall season.
Within-season changes may not register as

countries in southern Africa (Angola,
Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi,
Namibia and South Africa), blue areas suggest
that the El Niño period 2015 –2016 had the
poorest production. The same applies to parts
of northern Africa, which experienced a major
drought in 2016. Furthermore, 2011 was the
year with the poorest growing season for a
significant part of eastern Africa, which
experienced a major drought in that period
following the 2010 La Niña. The period
2004–2005 also witnessed many droughts
across the continent, with minimal biomass
production in many regions.

Droughts are extreme climate events
characterized by prolonged periods of rainfall
deficits that can result in food insecurit y and
malnutrition, largely through cascading negative
effects on agriculture production, food prices,
value chains, water supplies and livelihoods,
affecting access to income and food.
Evidence shows that recent years (2011–2016)
have been characterized by a number of severe
droughts in many regions. Some of these feature

prolonged and spread over larger areas (e.g.
Somalia, Southern Africa, India and the Dr y
Corridor of Central America). 76

Severe floods and storms

Counting the number of years when large
precipitation deficits were obser ved during the
last five years (Figure 20a) shows that a number
of countries experienced large negative
rainfall anomalies with higher frequency
during the period 2011–2016, compared with
the longer period of 1981–2016. Several
countries – notably in Africa, Central America
and South-eastern Asia – experienced
drought, not only through abnormally low
total accumulated rainfall (Figure 20a), but also
through lower rainfall intensities and fewer
days of rainfall (Figure 20b, c).

Floods cause more climate-related disasters
globally than any other extreme climate event,
with f lood-related disasters seeing the highest
increase – 65 percent – in occurrence over the last
25 years (Figure 22a). Asia is the region with the
highest occurrence of f lood disasters. However,
f lood-related disasters in Africa have declined
dramatically since 2006 and were surpassed by
those in Latin America and the Caribbean
in 2013.
The frequency of storms is not increasing as
much as that of f loods (Figure 15), but storms are
the second most frequent driver of
climate-related disasters. Storm-related disasters
are again highest in Asia, averaging between 20
to 30 ever y year (Figure 22b). Some parts of Africa
also register a high number of storm-related
disasters, but these tend to be more localized.

Significantly lower frequency and smaller
amounts of precipitation for larger areas lead
to drought, which is particularly worr ying for
agricultural production. The duration of a
drought is often a critical factor in its overall
impact on food securit y and nutrition.
Indicators of frequency and duration include,
among others, rainfall deficits and
normalized difference vegetation index
(NDV I) anomalies during growing seasons. 77
Globally, the years 2004–2006 and 2015
registered the highest frequency of drought
conditions for crops since the mid-2000s,
coinciding with ENSO anomalies (El Niño in
2004–2005, 2006 –2007 and 2015 –2016). The
same data suggest that 2009 and 2011 were
also important drought years, for example in
large parts of eastern Africa. 78

River f loods, oceanic storm surges and tropical
cyclones negatively impact low-lying areas, f lood
plains and deltas. A detailed study of 33 deltas
around the world found that 85 percent had
experienced severe f looding in the past decade,
affecting an area of 260 000 km 2 . 80
Although f lood- and storm-related disasters have
generally increased in number over time, fewer
people are now affected by them. An analysis of
annual fatalities from tropical cyclones revealed
these to be heavily concentrated in low-income
nations, though there was high exposure in many
upper-middle- and high-income nations as well
(with larger economic losses in these nations). 81

The impact of the 2015 –2016 El Niño on
agricultural vegetation is clearly visible when
comparing the frequency of drought
conditions in 2015 –2017 with those of
2004–2017 (Figure 21). The 2015 –2017 map
shows that large areas in Africa, parts of
Central America, Brazil and the Caribbean, as
well as Australia and parts of the Near East
experienced a large increase in frequency of
drought conditions in 2015 –2017 compared to
the 14-year average. Although there is
regional variabilit y, since the end of the 1960s
the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and southern
Africa have been particularly affected by

A regional analysis of changes in exposure,
v ulnerabilit y and risk indicates that although
exposure to f loods and cyclones has increased
since 1980, the risk of mortalit y has generally
fallen. 82 Nonetheless, evidence suggests that food
insecurit y and malnutrition risks are magnified
due to the high v ulnerabilit y of agriculture, food
systems and livelihoods to climate extremes
including f loods and storms (see next section).

PART 2 THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

Although the analysis is not causal and data
limitations prevent a statistical inference of
association, the outcome of so many
corresponding occurrences suggests that drought
could be one important contributing factor to the
recent PoU increases in some cases. This change
point analysis does support the hypothesis that –
particularly for the period of 2014–2016 – extreme
drought linked to the strong El Niño of
2015 –2016 is one of the drivers behind the
increases in PoU. This association is further
corroborated by a number of studies that show a
strong link between drought and stunting in
children. For example, drought events in
Bangladesh are associated with a higher stunting
rate around five and nine months after the
beginning of the drought event. 86 In rural
Zimbabwe, one- to two-year olds exposed to
drought face significantly lower growth velocit y
compared to children of the same age living in
areas with average rainfall. 87 In sub-Saharan
Africa, warmer and drier climates are related to
declining food availabilit y and increased
prevalence estimates of childhood stunting. 88

event, such as a severe drought, that critically
challenges agriculture and food production. If a
drought is severe and widespread enough, it
can potentially affect national food availabilit y
and access, as well as nutrition, thus
magnif ying the prevalence of
undernourishment (PoU) nationally. 83 This is
particularly the case where a countr y’s
agricultural production is highly v ulnerable to
climate variabilit y and extremes and the
countr y does not have in place sufficient
support measures to counter the fallout.
A lthough it is difficult to establish a direct causal
relationship considering the way the PoU is
computed and smoothed over time, 84 it is
possible to examine whether change points in
the PoU time series correspond to occurrences of
severe drought. 85
A change point analysis of PoU time series,
identif y years of increasing
undernourishment after years of reduction or
stabilization, indicates that out of 91 PoU change
points in 76 countries, 28 of them in 27 countries
occurred in correspondence w ith severe drought
stress conditions bet ween 2006 and 2016 (see
A nnex 3 for methodolog y). In other words, for
almost 36 percent of the countries that
experienced a rise in undernourishment since
2005, this coincided w ith the occurrence of
severe drought. Out of 27 countries w ith change
points occurring under severe drought stress
conditions, most (19 countries) are in A frica,
w ith the remaining 4 in Asia, 3 in Latin A merica
and the Caribbean, and 1 in Eastern Europe
(Figure 23).

Increased exposure and vulnerability to
climate extremes
The extent to which climate variabilit y and
extremes negatively affect people’s food securit y
and nutrition situation depends on their degree
of exposure to climate shocks and v ulnerabilit y
to these shocks. In the analysis that follows,
climate shocks are defined as the occurrence of
extreme rainfall and/or temperatures over
agriculture areas but also complex events (e.g.
droughts, storms and f loods) in each year of a
given timeframe. In the last 20 years, not only
has exposure to climate shocks risen in terms of
both frequency and intensit y, but this has
occurred in countries already v ulnerable to the
risk of food insecurit y and malnutrition.
Specifically, there has been an increase in
climate shocks caused by drought, f loods, storms
and heat spells in countries where
undernourishment, production and yields are
v ulnerable to climate extremes.

Most striking is the sig nificant increase in the
number of change points related to severe
drought conditions in 2014 –2015, in which
nearly t wo-thirds of the change points
occurred. In these cases, the PoU increased
from 2015 onwards and this can be linked
to severe droughts driven by El Niño in
2015 –2016. A closer rev iew reveals that many
countries have w itnessed periods of increased
undernourishment over the past years;
however, during the period of the ENSO event
of 2015 –2016, this change across so many
countries contributed to a reversal of the PoU
trend at the global level.

Looking at countr y exposure to climate extremes,
evidence indicates that the number of low- and
middle-income countries exposed to climate
extremes has increased, from 83 percent of
countries in 1996 –2000 to 96 percent in

2011–2016 (Figure 24). Most striking is that the
frequency (number of years exposed in a fiveyear period) and intensit y (multiple t ypes of
climate extremes in a five-year period) of
exposure to climate extremes have both increased
too. Considering the frequency, or number of
years exposed in each subperiod, countries’
exposure increased by more than 30 percent
between 1996 –2000 and 2011–2016. In terms of
increasing intensit y, 36 percent of countries were
exposed to three or four t ypes of climate
extremes (extreme heat, drought, f loods or
storms) in 2011–2016, compared with 18 percent
in 1996 –2000. In other words, the number has
doubled in the last 20 years (see Annex 2 for
definitions and methodolog y).

extremes compared to the global averages. For
instance, the occurrence of three or more
different t ypes of climate extremes has increased
by 160 percent for countries in Africa, from
10 percent in 1996 –2000 to 25 percent in
2011–2016. Similarly, the percentage of Asian
countries experiencing multiple shocks more than
doubled to 51 percent in 2011–2016, up from
23 percent in 1996 –2000. The intensit y of climate
extremes in Latin America and the Caribbean
also more than doubled (from 26 percent in
1996 –2000 to 56.5 percent in 2011–2016).

early or delayed onset of seasons, 29 experienced
seasons of shorter length, and 28 experienced
both. This is an added risk factor affecting food
securit y and nutrition. Furthermore we obser ve
that all countries exposed to interseasonal
variabilit y are also exposed to climate extremes.

Simple correlations show higher levels of food
insecurity in countries with high levels of
exposure to climate shocks. 89 Those countries
experiencing climate extremes for more than three
years in the period of 2011–2016 are defined as
having high exposure, irrespective of whether they
are countries of low or middle income. This
indicates a high frequency of exposure to climate
shocks, repeated within a short period of time.

Undernourishment has been on the rise over the
past three years and, as explained here, exposure
of countries to climate variabilit y and extremes is
also a rising trend. Nonetheless, the latter seems
to have started much earlier than the former in
low- and middle-income countries. This begs the
question: Are these trends associated? It would
appear so.

In 2017, the average of the PoU in countries with
high exposure to climate shocks was
3.2 percentage points above that of countries with
low or no exposure (Figure 25). Even more striking is
that countries with high exposure have more than

chains and natural resource-based livelihoods,
need to be at the centre of the analysis.

Of the 51 countries identified as experiencing high
exposure to climate extremes in 2011–2016,
23.5 percent are low-income countries and
76.5 percent are middle-income. In terms of
geographical location, most (76 percent) are in
Africa and Asia (39 and 37 percent, respectively),
15.5 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean,
and the rest in Oceania and Europe (see Annex 2).

There are marked (i.e. statistically significant)
differences in the PoU of the 128 countries
identified in the present analysis when
considering high levels of v ulnerabilit y to climate
extremes that pose risks to food securit y. Risks
exist where cereal production and/or yields are
sensitive to climate variabilit y and extremes, and
where livelihoods are sensitive to climate. Risks
also exist where severe drought conditions
correspond to rises in the PoU (see Box 9 for
definitions and indicators analysed).

Because low- and middle-income countries are
increasingly exposed to climate extremes, the
vulnerability to these events is an important risk
factor for food security and nutrition that merits
more study. Vulnerability here refers to the
conditions that raise the probability that climate
extremes will negatively affect food security.
Vulnerability of national agriculture production
and yields to climate extremes, along with
increased vulnerability of related food supply

For example, analysis conducted for this report
shows that, in 2017, the average of the PoU was
15.4 percent for all countries exposed to climate
extremes. At the same time, the PoU was
20 percent for countries that additionally show
high v ulnerabilit y of ag riculture production/

(29 percent).

What is striking is that the uptick in PoU occurs
earlier in time for low-income countries, and with
sharper increases, especially in those with high
v ulnerabilit y of agriculture production/yields and
high sensitivit y of PoU to severe drought
(Figure 26). 90
The finding is different for middle-income
countries where the rise in PoU is less
pronounced and occurs later (from 2015 –2016).

FOOD SECURITY VULNERABILITY FACTORS
ANALYSED
Vulnerability refers to the conditions that
increase the probability that climate extremes
will negatively affect food security. Although
there are many other vulnerability factors, the
below are selected due to their relative
importance for food availability and access as
identified later in the report.
 Vulnerability related to climate-sensitive
production and/or yields: countries with at
least part of their national cereal production
or yield variance explained by climate
factors – i.e. there is a high and statistically
significant association between production
and climate or biophysical indicators such
as temperature, rainfall and vegetation
growth (see Figure 29a for production and see
report cited below in source for yield).
 Vulnerability related to severe drought
food security sensitivity: countries with
severe drought warnings corresponding
with the occurrence of PoU change points
(see Figure 23).
  Vulnerability related to high dependence on
agriculture: countries with a high
dependence on agriculture (measured by the
percentage of people employed in the sector
according to World Bank, 2017), where it is
expected that many derive their livelihood
and income from the sector.

The increase in PoU is even more pronounced
and begins in 2011 for those countries with both
high exposure to climate extremes (more than
66 percent of the time) and high levels of
v ulnerabilit y (Figure 27).
Countries highly dependent on agriculture show
the highest levels of PoU, whereas countries
experiencing both climate-sensitive v ulnerabilit y
of production/yields and v ulnerabilit y to severe
drought show the sharpest increase in
undernourishment starting from 2011, followed
by countries with either production/yield
v ulnerabilit y or v ulnerabilit y to severe drought.
What is striking about Figure 27 is that, as noted
above, most countries (close to three-quarters)
with high exposure to climate extremes are
actually middle-income countries, yet we see an
uptick in PoU from 2011 (Figure 26) which is mostly
driven by low-income countries.

Climate extremes as a major driver of global
food crises
In 2017, almost 124 million people across 51
countries and territories faced “crisis” levels of
acute food insecurit y or worse (IPC Phase 3 and
above or equivalent) 91 requiring urgent
humanitarian assistance to safeg uard their lives
and preser ve their livelihoods. In 34 of these
countries more than 76 percent of the total
populations facing crisis levels of acute food
insecurit y or worse – nearly 95 million people –
were also affected by climate shocks and
extremes (Table 7).

climate variability and extremes on agriculture and food security: an analysis of

Where conf lict and climate shocks occur
together, the impact on acute food insecurit y is
more severe. In 2017, 14 out of the 34 food-crisis
countries experienced the double impact of both
conf lict and climate shocks, which led to
significant increases in the severit y of acute food

impacts of increased exposure to climate
extremes, but may not have been able to cope as
well in the 2015 –2016 period, possibly due to the
severit y of exposure to El Niño. Other factors
may have also come into play during this period,

urgent life-saving assistance (IPC 4 and above).

Drought is a driving climate factor in 21 out of the
34 countries. However, drought occurs without
other climate shocks in only seven of these
countries. In most cases, countries are also exposed
to drought combined with floods, cyclones, and
other less extreme but equally detrimental climate
events, including dry spells and erratic rainfall, and
late onset of rainy seasons (Table 7).

Most climate-related food crisis countries
are not affected by conf lict, yet climate
shocks and stressors are a major factor
driving emergency levels of acute food
insecurit y (20 out of 34 countries). For these
climate-affected food crisis countries,
29 million people required humanitarian
assistance (IPC Phase 3 and above),
including 3.9 million people in need of
urgent life-saving emergency assistance
(IPC 4 and above).

Africa is the region where climate shocks and
stressors had the biggest impact on acute food

people in 24 countries and requiring urgent

2.2

There is also a high burden of acute malnutrition in
areas or countries affected by drought/floods,
including northern Kenya, the Sindh province in
Pakistan, Ethiopia and Madagascar.92 Climate
shocks exacerbate the factors that underlie acute
malnutrition, including: high levels of food
insecurity; inadequate access to diverse and
nutrient-rich foods; high prevalence of diseases,
such as diarrhoea, malaria and fever; poor access to
primary health care and safe water; inadequate
sanitation; and suboptimal breastfeeding practices.

KEY MESSAGES
è Climate variability and extremes are undermining
in multiple ways food availability, access, utilization
and stability, as well as feeding, caregiving and health
practices.

Many studies have shown that the health and
nutritional status of children in particular is
especially v ulnerable to climate-related disasters,
both in the emergency phase and – due to
malnutrition and undernutrition – also in the
aftermath. 93 The impacts of f loods and droughts
on peaks in acute malnutrition (through crop
damage or disease) are well documented. 94

è Direct and indirect climate-driven impacts have a
cumulative effect, leading to a downward spiral of
increased food insecurity and malnutrition.
è Climate variability and extremes are harming
agricultural productivity, food production and
cropping patterns, thus contributing to food
availability shortfalls.

Summary
In the twenty years (1996–2016) considered in the
analysis presented here, both the frequency and
intensity of countries’ exposure to climate extremes
have increased. As a result, more countries are
vulnerable to the risk of food insecurity and
malnutrition. Where agriculture production, food
systems and livelihoods are vulnerable to climate
variability and extremes, countries face the greatest
risk of food insecurity and malnutrition.

è Food price spikes and volatility, often combined
with losses in agricultural income, follow climate
extremes, reducing food access and negatively
affecting the quantity, quality and dietary diversity of
food consumed.
è Changes in climate impact heavily on nutrition
through: impaired nutrient quality and dietary
diversity of foods produced and consumed; effects on
water and sanitation, with their implications for
patterns of health risks and disease; and changes in
maternal and child care and breastfeeding.

Although climate variabilit y and extremes are not
the only factor driving the obser ved increases in
global hunger, the analysis indicates that they are
important for some countries. They also
exacerbate other driving factors of food insecurit y
and malnutrition, such as conf lict, economic
slowdowns and povert y. 95 It is thus critical to
investigate in more detail how climate variabilit y
and extremes can undermine the different

To adequately respond to the challenges that
changing climate variabilit y and extremes create
for food securit y and nutrition, it is critical to

cumulative effect of these direct and indirect

For example, a direct impact occurs when drought

reduced food production. On the other hand,
crop failures can indirectly reduce food access if
food prices rise significantly. Similarly, f loods

immediate and underlying causes of food
insecurit y and malnutrition in all their forms.
These include food availabilit y, access, utilization
and stabilit y (see Annex 4 Glossar y), as well as
individual caregiving practices, qualit y health
ser vices and a healthy living environment.
Because these basic causal factors of food
insecurit y and malnutrition are all potentially
affected and interdependent, responses to
address these causes must be comprehensive and
well integrated.

Impacts on food availability
Climate variabilit y and extremes are negatively
affecting agricultural productivit y – the amount
of agricultural outputs per inputs used to
generate them – at global, national and
subnational scales. This is ref lected in changes in
crop yields (the amount of agricultural
production har vested per unit of land area),
cropping areas (area planted or har vested), and
cropping intensit y (number of crops grown
within a year). Countries tr y to compensate for
domestic production losses through imports,
though supplies are often limited. Overall, the
resulting shortfalls in agricultural output are
damaging for food securit y and nutrition in both
the short and long term.

During the second half of the twentieth centur y,
global food availabilit y and access developed
rapidly enough to keep abreast of population
growth. As a result, many countries improved
their food securit y and made impressive
achievements in reducing hunger and
malnutrition by 2015. 96 However, as described in
the previous section, increasing climate
variabilit y and extremes over the last decade
(together with other factors such as conf licts)
have beg un to threaten and potentially reverse
these gains. 97

Losses in productivity undermine food production
Crop yields in many countries have suffered from
changes in temperature and precipitation, which
have affected global aggregate wheat and maize
yields. 99 There is also strong evidence that
climate variabilit y driven by major ENSO events
associated with El Niño plays a key role in
decreasing crop yields.100

Climate variability and extremes have the
strongest direct impact on food availability, given
the sensitivity of agriculture to climate and the
primary role of the sector as a source of food and
livelihoods for the rural poor. However, the overall
fallout is far more complex and greater than the
impacts on agricultural productivity alone.98 Food
security and nutrition are also dependent on food
access, utilization, consumption patterns and the
overall stability of the system.

Studies point to significant heat and water stress
resulting in significant global interannual
variabilit y of yields for wheat and maize. 101 It is
estimated that roughly one-third (around
32–39 percent) of obser ved yield variabilit y
(maize, rice, wheat and soybean) is due to
climate factors.102

Nutritional status is determined by the
interaction between dietar y intake and health
status. Illness and disease become more likely if
climate variabilit y and extremes prompt people to
consume inadequate or insufficient food, or to
engage in crisis and emergency coping strategies.
There can be further repercussions for access to
and utilization of food if people’s immune
systems are compromised or if people are more
exposed to disease risk factors vectors,
particularly in situations with insufficient
health ser vices.

Throughout the growing season, crops are highly
sensitive to extreme daytime temperatures of
around 30 °C, resulting in lower yields.103
Analysis of global crop yield variabilit y during
the 1961–2014 period shows that heat and
dr yness significantly reduced yields of maize,
soybeans and wheat, although the effects for rice
were not significant.104
Most regions, particularly those with large
numbers of undernourished people, are
experiencing reduced yields due to increased
climate variability and extremes. In sub-Saharan
Africa, a region that already has the lowest crop

are negatively affecting food securit y and
nutrition is an important first step towards

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

yields globally, increasing temperatures reduced
yields for maize, sorghum and groundnuts.105 In
rural India, higher numbers of hot days during the
agricultural season are leading to lower crop
yields.106 There are regions that show increased
yields due to changes in climate, but these are
fewer: for example, north-east China, the United
Kingdom and Ireland have seen some improvement
in yields, given their higher latitudes.107

countr y. Differences in overall aggregate
impacts on national food production arise
not only due to variations in t y pe and
geographical distribution of climate
variabilit y and extremes, but also due to the
diversit y and complexit y of agricultural
systems. Divergences exist between crops,
cropping patterns, farming technologies (e.g.
rainfed vs irrigated, high and low input
ratios, nomadic pastoral vs intensive
livestock production) and agriculture
management systems.

While the impact of drought on decreasing crop
yields is widely documented,108 the effects of
other climate extremes, such as tropical cyclones,
are not well quantified, though their inf luence in
some regions is evident. Crop destruction due to
tropical cyclones can include salt damage from
tides blowing inland, insufficient ox ygen caused
by overhead f looding, f lash f loods, wind damage
to plants, and water stress induced by enforced
respiration, all of which can occur at the same
time.109 For example, in Bangladesh cyclones
cause increased salinit y from seawater to coastal
and freshwater fisher y communities, negatively
affecting production due to insufficient access to
fresh water.110

Despite these nuanced and varied elements, there
is evidence that for many countries, climate
factors at least partially explain national cereal
production variance (Figure 29a). Especially in
semi-arid climate regions such as Central Asia,
the Near East, and Northern Africa, cereal
production is highly dependent on climate
variabilit y. In these regions, it is not unusual to
have 80 percent or more of interannual
production variabilit y explained by climate.
Although the inf luence of climate on
production can be seen in a large number of
countries, the relationship is strongest but
also most complex in Africa. In this continent,
the production of each countr y shows a
different mix of climate variable dependence,
both in terms of strength and correlation. In
contrast, in many Asian countries – such as
China, India and Kazakhstan – there is no
significant correlation with single climate
indicators, but only with biophysical
indicators such as NDV I, partly due to the
complex dependence of agricultural
vegetation growth on many climate and
non-climate factors.

A focus exclusively on yields may bias
assessments of the v ulnerabilit y of agriculture to
climate shocks. Although there is no global
over view, a number of case studies provide
evidence that both cropping intensit y and planted
areas are negatively affected by climate variations
and extremes.
For example, in the Viet Nam Mekong Delta,
variations in the timing and extent of f looding
in the wet season and salinit y intrusion in the
dr y season are affecting rice cropping cycles.111
Severe f loods in 2000 led to crop failure, except
for f loating rice varieties. In contrast,
below-normal seasonal rainfall in 2004 reduced
water availabilit y for irrigation due to high
salinit y, and as a result the dr y-season rice that
year could not be har vested.112 Based on the
existing countr y evidence, it is clear that efforts
to reduce climate impacts on agriculture should
seek to limit production losses resulting not
only from crop yields, but also from changes in
cropping area and frequency.113

Drought is one of the most important climate
events that have been shown to have a negative
impact on production. For many countries, there
is a high negative correlation between drought
indicators and food production (Figure 29b). The
highest correlations occur in semi-arid countries
or drought-prone continental climates (e.g.
Central Asia), while in many equatorial areas
there is no correlation between drought
indicators and production (e.g. central Africa,
Central America).

For example, Ethiopia has experienced large

recent decades, yet it reg ularly reports acute
and localized food insecurit y and malnutrition
crises, often associated with droughts.114 The
greatest adverse impacts occur in the most
marginal livelihood zones in the drier east of

production and livelihoods that leave people

always affect aggregate national food
production but can significantly affect
subnational areas with often devastating
impacts on the food securit y and nutrition

especially the case in areas dominated by
small-scale family farmers and pastoralists,
whose production losses may be significant for
their own livelihoods and food securit y and
nutrition situation, but not necessarily for

in China found that even though the most
negative impacts of precipitation for each

Other examples include the Afram Plains region
of Ghana, where farmers report delays in the
onset of the rainy season, mid-season heatwaves,
and high-intensit y rains that cause f looding,
resulting in crop loss and low yields that reduce
the availabilit y of household food. However, due
to the localized and marginal nature of most of
the region’s agriculture areas, this is not ref lected
in national production losses.116 Similarly, a study

populations and fisheries activities are closely
linked to weather and climate dynamics. The
strongest economic impacts on forestr y are
caused by f loods and storms.119 While the impact
of f loods and storms on forests can be
significant, deforestation exacerbates the
negative impact of f loods and storms, triggering
a vicious downward cycle.

At the regional level, the Southern Africa
Development Communit y (SADC) declared a
regional drought disaster and issued a regional
humanitarian appeal, seeking local and
international assistance to cover a response plan
funding gap of USD 2.5 billion for an estimated
41 million affected people (about 14 percent of
the total SADC population), with 26 million
requiring immediate humanitarian assistance.124

FAO agricultural databases were used to conduct
a statistical analysis of 140 medium- and
large-scale climate-related disasters (affecting
at least 250 000 people) that occurred in
67 developing countries between 2003 and
2013.120 The analysis estimates losses equivalent
to 333 million tonnes of cereal, pulses, meat, milk
and other commodities, or an average of
7 percent of national per capita dietar y energ y
supply (DES) after each natural disaster. This is
already significant at the national level, but is
likely higher at the subnational one, where losses
in calories may increase household food
insecurit y unless relevant measures are taken to
compensate and fill the gap in DES.121

Production shortfalls lead to increased food imports
Climate variabilit y and extremes also affect food
imports as countries tr y to compensate for
domestic production losses.125 It is expected that,
as production falls, exports will follow suit,
resulting in a deterioration of trade f lows. For
low- and middle-income countries, high
temperatures, low rainfall and low NDV I
generally show a significant correlation with high
cereal imports, indicating v ulnerabilit y to climate
variabilit y and extremes (Figure 31). This applies to
the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) countries
and those in western and southern Africa, while
in eastern Africa and Central America
temperature seems to be the single indicator most
directly linked to imports.

The Dr y Corridor in Central America – in
particular in El Salvador, Guatemala and
Honduras – was one of the regions heavily
impacted by El Niño in 2015 –2016. The drought
impact was severe and prolonged, with late and
irreg ular onset of rains, below-average rainfall,
above-average temperatures and river levels 20 to
60 percent lower than normal. The drought was
one of the worst in the last ten years and resulted
in significant reductions in agriculture
production, with losses estimated at
50 –90 percent of crop har vest.122 In Guatemala
alone, the Ministr y of Agriculture, Livestock and
Food estimated that 82 000 tonnes of maize were
lost, representing a total financial loss of
USD 30.8 million, while 118 200 tonnes of black
beans were lost, at a cost of USD 102.3 million.
More than 3.6 million people were in need of
humanitarian assistance as result of this drought.

Nonetheless, as shown in Figure 32, estimated
agricultural commodit y decreases in exports and
increases in imports owing to the harmful effects
of climate-related shocks on domestic production
tend to be, on aggregate, largest for Asia and
Latin America and the Caribbean. This can be
considered an indirect effect of losses to domestic
production and consequent rise in demand for
imported food. In the case of Africa, although the
ratio of exports to imports has continuously been
falling since the 1970s and the continent became
a net food importer in 2000, the findings show
that increases in agricultural imports after
disasters are proportionally lower than losses in
domestic production.126 In some cases, the
compensating increase in imports in Africa can
be as much as half the losses. Humanitarian
response in Africa is high and can fill some of the
gap, but there are still negative consequences for
food availabilit y.

The same period saw the worst drought in 35
years hit southern Africa, leading to extensive
regional-scale crop failure and a regional cereal
deficit of 7.9 million tonnes in early 2016.123 The
impacts were magnified further as depleted food
supplies and reser ves spurred rising food prices.
In response, six countries (Botswana, Eswatini,

Medium- and long-term impacts on food availability

An in-depth analysis of the impact of drought in
sub-Saharan Africa provides a stark illustration
of this. The study estimates that after the
occurrence of droughts between 1991 and 2011
in the region, food imports increased by
USD 6 billion and exports of the same
commodities fell by nearly USD 2 billion.
Further, countries lost an average of 3.5 percent
of agriculture value-added growth after each
drought – a fig ure that is likely to be more acute
at the subnational level.127

Beyond production losses and trade deterioration,
medium- and large-scale disasters can lead to
significant impacts across the food value chain,
with negative consequences on sector growth,
food and non-food agro-industries and ultimately
national economies. In fact, these disasters can
inf lict high levels of damage and economic loss
on agriculture (Figure 33). The financial cost to
developing countries alone, in terms of losses to
crops and livestock, was estimated at USD

96 billion for the decade 2005 –2015.128 For many
countries, it can take years to recover from
damages and losses and the negative effects can
extend to the long term where agriculture growth
and lifelong nutrition and health (and therefore
economic productivit y) are affected.

Pakistan’s agriculture sector was affected by three
consecutive climate-related disasters (cyclone/
floods in 2007; floods in 2010; floods in 2011),
which together caused USD 7.6 billion in
accumulated damages and losses. This is almost
four times what the Government of Pakistan spent
on the agriculture sector between 2008 and 2011.130

More than 25 percent of all economic losses and
damages inf licted by medium- and large-scale
climate-induced hazards in developing countries
occur in the agriculture sector. Where extreme
climate events lead to recurring climate-related
disasters, the accumulated costs for the
agriculture sector are even more significant. For
example, between 2006 and 2013 the Philippines
was struck by 75 disasters – mostly t yphoons,
tropical storms and f loods. These caused
damages and losses of some USD 3.8 billion to
the countr y’s agriculture sector, an average of
USD 477 million each year – about one-quarter
of the national budget allocated to the sector
in 2014.129

The FAO analysis noted above also showed a
significant negative trend in agriculture
value-added growth in 55 percent of the
disasters. 131 The study found that after each
disaster there is an average loss of 2.6 percent
of national agriculture value-added growth,
with a much more significant impact likely at
subnational levels.
This section focuses mainly on the production of
primar y staple crops, for which data are widely
available. However, attention is drawn to the fact

Substantial efforts have been made recently to
link the effects of climate on crop yields to prices,
income and trade.133 There is strong statistical

and, interestingly, the effect can last for up to
nine months.134

Although prices depend on many factors, there is
evidence from correlation analyses that higher
average temperatures coincide with higher maize
prices in some countries, such as Bangladesh,
Benin, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Malawi, Nicaragua, Togo
and Yemen.135 The positive temperature and price
correlation is visible also for some wheat-producing
countries, and the relationship appears typical for
wheat produced in tropical countries, for example
in Eritrea, Ethiopia, the Sudan and Yemen.136

A study covering the period 1960 –2014 found
evidence that the effects of variabilit y in climate
shocks on international maize price volatilit y
intensified during the El Niño phase in spring/
summer. Soybean price volatilit y was also found
to respond to climate variabilit y, decreasing
slightly during autumn/winter meteorological
seasons and increasing during spring/summer.137

needs and nutrition (fruits and vegetables,
leg umes other than soybean, etc.) that are not
well researched. Future research needs to address
the data gap on how climate variabilit y and
extremes affect production of these foods.132

The impact of price volatilit y falls heaviest on the
urban poor, who may spend as much as
75 percent of their income on food.138 However,
sharp food price increases and price volatilit y can
also significantly undermine the livelihoods and
income of small-scale food producers, agriculture
labourers and the rural poor who are net food
buyers, forcing them to reduce their consumption
in quantit y and qualit y.

Impacts on food access
The impacts on production discussed up to this
point will inevitably translate into loss of income
for people whose livelihoods depend on
agriculture and natural resources, reducing their
abilit y to access food. This is another key factor
to keep in mind in understanding how climate
variabilit y and extremes affect the immediate and
underlying causes of food insecurit y and
malnutrition (Figure 28).

Global food price spikes often follow climate
extremes in major producing countries. Figure 34
shows trends in international food and cereal
prices, with vertical lines indicating events when
a top five global producer of a crop had yields
25 percent below the trend line, indicating a
seasonal climate extreme. In many of these
instances, global food prices rose.

Spikes in food prices and volatility follow

events, alter agricultural yields, production and

Climate shocks in major global producers
contribute to price increases and volatilit y;
however, other factors also play a strong role,
thus making attribution difficult. Public and
private sector responses to extreme climate
events may lead to serious knock-on effects
through trade-induced amplification of
climate-related food risks that expand across
borders. These risks include food price spikes,
food safet y issues and interactions with conf lict
and migration, to name but a few. A clear
example of a domestic policy response to food
price crises is export bans which, in turn, can
contribute to more f luctuations.139 The stabilit y of

food prices is also increasingly associated with
f luctuations in energ y prices.

Income loss for those whose livelihoods depend on
agriculture and natural resources
The majorit y of people most v ulnerable to climate
shocks and natural hazards are the world’s
2.5 billion small-scale farmers, herders, fishers
and forest-dependent communities, who derive
their food and income from renewable natural
resources.140 Small-scale farmers produce 63 and
69 percent of the food in Kenya and the United
Republic of Tanzania, respectively, whereas
70 percent of small family farms are food

PART 2 THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

producers in Nepal and 85 percent in the
Plurinational State of Bolivia.141

agriculture for their incomes, the financial
impacts of climate variabilit y can be high.

Climate shocks not only negatively impact on
households’ own food production but also rural
incomes as agricultural production falls. In
food-insecure regions, many small family farms
both consume their produce and sell it in local
markets. This exposes them to climate
variations as they have less of their own food
production available for consumption and less to
sell. Their income is more seriously constrained
to maintain a more costly basic consumption,142
as demonstrated by a wealth of evidence.

For those whose livelihoods depend on livestock,
climate shocks can lead to significantly depleted
income and food resources due to loss of animals,
milk production and trade. Furthermore, many
livestock diseases are linked to climate variabilit y
and extremes, both geographically and
temporally, which can lead to significant losses in
income and food. 145
For example, Rift Valley Fever (RV F), endemic in
large parts of Africa, is a mosquito-borne viral
disease in livestock that has repeatedly caused
severe epidemics leading to high levels of
morbidit y and mortalit y among affected animals.
RV F outbreaks and patterns are closely associated
with shifts from El Niño to La Niña. In East
Africa, over half of El Niño occurrences have
been accompanied by corresponding RV F
outbreaks. An RV F outbreak in northeastern
Kenya in 2006 –2007 killed more than 420 000
sheep and goats and projected milk losses were
estimated to be more than 2.5 million litres due
to abortions in cattle and camels.

Household studies provide evidence that
access to food and income of small family
agriculture households is negatively impacted
by climate variabilit y and extremes. For
example, in the United Republic of Tanzania
an increase in the variabilit y of rainfall in the
past five to ten years is associated with about
a 35 percent decrease in total income and
increased variabilit y of temperature is
associated with a decrease of about 11 percent
in daily calorie intake.

Because the impact of climate shocks on income
and food can be significant, it is crucial that
those affected are able to cope with their losses
and adapt their livelihoods to deal with
changing climate variabilit y and extremes.
Identif ying the effects of climate shocks on
livelihoods and coping and adaptation strategies
is key to addressing the impact on food securit y
and nutrition, as will be seen later in a
subsequent section.

In Malawi, the occurrence of a 1 °C increase in
temperature (i.e. 1 degree more than the upper
confidence inter val of the comfort zone) reduces
overall consumption per capita by about
20 percent and food calorie intake by almost
40 percent. In Ethiopia and the Niger, both
rainfall and maximum temperature variabilit y
are shown to negatively affect household income
and consumption expenditure. This points
towards the absence of capacit y to cope or
options for income-smoothing behaviour.143
There is also evidence that climate shocks not
only affect the level of income, but affect also the
variabilit y of incomes. Household studies for
Malawi and Zambia show that increased
variation in seasonal rainfall (defined over 30
years) not only decreases the expected incomes
but also increases their variance.144

Impacts on food utilization and food safety
Climate variabilit y and extremes have
repercussions for food utilization as they
jeopardize the nutritional qualit y of food
produced and consumed, as well as food safet y.
Although the impacts on food utilization are
relatively under-researched – compared with
those on availabilit y and access – a number of
studies suggest that climate variabilit y
negatively affects the nutrient qualit y and safet y
of food. In many countries, food variet y and diet
diversit y f luctuate across seasons. Increased
inter-seasonal climate variabilit y thus magnifies

Climate shocks that negatively impact
agricultural production also negatively impact
demand for agricultural labour, thus indirectly
affecting access to food and income for rural
agriculture labourers. Given the high level of
dependency of poor and food-insecure people on

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

Food variet y, dietar y diversit y, and food/nutrient
intake f luctuate across seasons.151 Delayed on-set
of the growing season or variabilit y in the
distribution of seasonal rainfall can worsen
f luctuations in food and nutritent intake across
seasons. In Malawi, during the lean season –
between planting and har vesting – there are
substantive decreases in per capita dietar y energ y
consumption and other nutrient acquisition as
compared to the post-har vest season. At the
individual level, dietar y diversit y decreased by 26
percent and 30 percent respectively, between the
planting and har vesting seasons.152

nutrient intake f luctuations, exacerbating the
negative effects on nutrition.

Reduced quality and diversity of diets due to income
reductions and high food prices
Households engage in coping strategies in
response to food and income reductions and
increased prices following climate shocks. This
may compromise the qualit y of the food they
consume and the diversit y of their diets. Coping
strategies that compromise dietar y diversit y and
qualit y include eating fewer meals per day and
less at each meal, skipping meals and eating less
nutrient-dense foods and/or more calorie-dense
foods high in fat, sugars and salt.

A study carried out in a mountainous area of
northern Viet Nam among children aged
24–59 months showed significant seasonal
f luctuations in total energ y intake: highest in
autumn, lower in spring and winter, and lowest
in summer. In addition, the intake of
carbohydrates, protein and lipids in autumn was
higher than in other seasons. Winters are cold
and dr y (November–Februar y) and summers are
rainy and hot (May–Aug ust). Spring
(March–April) and autumn (September– October)
are the two short transitional seasons. Focus
group inter views revealed that cool weather in
autumn made children eat more than in other
seasons.153

This link between climate shocks, the adoption of
coping strategies and the resulting negative
impacts on dietar y diversit y and qualit y of food
are well documented.146 For example, in
Bangladesh climate shocks that affect rice
production often lead to higher rice prices, which
are strongly associated with greater prevalence of
child underweight and poorer dietar y diversit y.147
Similar findings are reported for Indonesia in a
study conducted at the household level.148 In both
studies, high rice prices negatively affect
nutrition mainly through the reduction in the
level of expenditures on non-grain food items.
People living in Rufiji, on the coast of the United
Republic of Tanzania, have been affected by both
prolonged dr y seasons and f loods. Consequently
their eating habits have changed due to a lack of
sufficient leg umes and fish in the past years, as
well as poor har vests of crops due to climate
variabilit y and rising food prices. During
prolonged dr y seasons, this means instead of
eating three meals per day, people in Rufiji eat
two or even one. New diets include stiff porridge
and cooked unripe mangoes.149

In some Pacific Small Island Developing States
(SIDS), the recurrence of climate shocks that
impact on national/local food production, coupled
with insufficient recover y time, undermines food
securit y and nutrition in the longer term. This is
seen in reduced agricultural and fisheries
productivit y, increased reliance on short-term
humanitarian food assistance, gradual erosion of
traditional food systems and intensified
permanent shifts away from diversified, healthy
traditional diets to greater exposure to imported
processed foods often high in salt, sugar and fat.
Associated dietar y changes heighten the risk of
overweight, obesit y and diet-related
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), as explained
next.154

In many countries, there are seasonal variations
in childhood acute malnutrition, where the
prevalence increases two- or threefold in the
months immediately preceding the har vest. This
period often coincides with the rainy season,
when food shortages and a lack of dietar y
diversit y combine with a higher incidence of
infection.150 Increased seasonal climate
variabilit y often worsens these seasonal
variations in acute malnutrition in children.

Reduced quality and safety of food
More erratic rainfall and higher temperatures
along with other extreme events affect the
quality and safety of the food in the post-harvest
value chain. In relation to safety, higher intensity
| 73 |

PART 2 THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

increased by 5.5 percent for each 1 °C increase in
mean monthly temperature in Kazakhstan.158

rainfall is likely to create conditions that lead to
mould growth and the subsequent contamination
of crops that are still ripening in the field with
mycotoxin contamination, toxins that are
naturally produced by certain moulds. This is
particularly exacerbated in cases where drying
efficiencies are lost and where crops are damaged
by insects – both highly favourable conditions to
a sharply and at times dramatically increased
mycotoxin contamination of important staple
crops,155 which eventually renders crops unfit for
use as food or as feed. For example, for certain
toxins produced by mould (aflatoxins causing
liver cancer in all consumers and stunting in
children), a combination of drought stress in the
pre-harvest period and higher intensity rainfall
during harvest and post-harvest stages is ideal
for food contamination. Higher temperatures
also favour pest and fungi development during
storage that can accelerate processes that lead to
nutrient deterioration.

Rising sea surface temperature can cause a
higher mobilization of heav y metals and is
leading to changing patterns and new
geographic areas that are affected by harmful
algal bloom. The toxins produced by the algae
that multiply explosively during an algal bloom
often get enriched in the food chain and –
though not a threat to fish and seafood
themselves – can ultimately cause seafood in
the affected areas to be unsafe for human
consumption. At a local level, this has direct
consequences on coastal communities for which
fish can often be the only source of protein.
Globally, with seafood being the most
internationally traded food commodit y,
consumers are affected ever y where. While algal
bloom has been endemic in certain tropical
areas, climate changes cause this to occur more
and more frequently in areas that have not
previously been affected, where the local
population is unprepared to manage such a new
threat to their health. Where a concentration
builds of heav y metals, they too will
accumulate in the food chain and ultimate
harm consumers.

Many bacteria, viruses, and parasitic protozoa are
strongly climate-dependent and sensitive to
climate extremes. Changing climate conditions
and extremes such as temperature and humidit y
alter their sur vival and transmission patterns and
can lead to increased bacterial, viral and
pathogenic contamination of water and food.
Even increased contamination of water used for
irrigation can affect the safet y of crops and
animals that consume them, as well as their
resulting food output.

In terms of qualit y, climate extremes can affect
the qualit y of diets through disruption of
transport infrastructure, resulting in spoilage
and/or reduced access to fresh fruit and
vegetables, meat and dair y products. Increasing
temperatures and changes in precipitation have
already resulted in farmers around the world
introducing various climate change adaptation
strategies such as crop diversification, mixed
crop-livestock farming systems, changing
planting and har vesting dates, and using
drought-resistant varieties and high-yield
water-sensitive crops. While such strategies help
maintain food production, the introduction of
new crops and cultivation methods also
increases the risk of introducing food-borne
diseases that people and health systems are not
familiar with.159

Unsafe water and food create a vicious cycle of
diarrhoea and malnutrition, threatening the
nutritional status of the most v ulnerable.
Where food supplies are insecure, people tend
to shift to less healthy diets and consume more
“unsafe foods”, in which chemical,
microbiological and other hazards pose health
risks and further aggravate an already marginal
nutritional status.156
Some food-borne pathogens have sur vival or
multiplication rates sensitive to climate
variabilit y and extremes. For example, the
multiplication of Salmonella spp., a major
contributor to food-borne disease and estimated
to be responsible for over 50 000 deaths in
2010,157 markedly depends on temperature. A
recent study indicates that cases of salmonellosis

Impacts on health and nutrition
Climate-driven human health impacts are
critical to food securit y and nutrition. As seen
| 74 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

in Part 1, disease interferes with the body´s
abilit y to absorb nutrients, which can negatively
affect the nutritional status of adults and
children. Furthermore, recurrent infections and
disease are serious contributing factors to both
wasting and stunting in children. Disease is
also a significant risk factor for impaired
maternal nutrition, affecting not only the
nutritional status of the mother but also the
nutritional status and health of the unborn
child. These climate-related negative impacts
can undermine a person’s abilit y to work as
well as reduce their productivit y, which can
seriously threaten access to food and income,
qualit y of diet and ultimately food securit y
and nutrition.

Climate variabilit y and extremes can affect
human health directly, through changes in
temperature and precipitation and natural
hazards such as heatwaves, f loods, cyclones,
droughts; as well as indirectly, through the effect
of climate on ecological-mediated risks (e.g.
vector-borne and other infectious diseases, crop
failures), food safet y risks (mycotoxins, heav y
metals, harmful algal blooms, etc.) and social
responses to climate shocks (e.g. displacement of
populations following prolonged drought)
(see Figure 35).160

direct heat stress and heatstroke to worsening of
pre-existing conditions such as heart failure,
along with a higher incidence of acute kidney
injur y from dehydration in v ulnerable
populations. Elderly people, children younger
than 12 months, and people with chronic
cardiovascular and renal disease are particularly
sensitive to these changes.161 An estimated
125 million additional v ulnerable adults were
exposed to heatwaves between 2000 and 2016,
with a record 175 million people exposed to
heatwaves in 2015.162

Extreme water-related events make water-borne
disease outbreaks more probable. Water-borne
disease outbreaks are most commonly a result of
excessive precipitation (55 percent of outbreaks)
and f loods (53 percent) as well as the subsequent
contamination of the drinking water supply.168
Multiple epidemiological studies also have linked
El Niño events with increased incidence of
disease in human populations. For example, in
both rural and urban locations in Bangladesh,
cases of cholera and shigellosis rise following
greater monsoon f looding and higher sea
temperatures as a result of El Niño. Single-study
associations between climate variabilit y and
extremes and higher disease incidence have been
reported for other diseases, including hepatitis A
in Australia; dysenter y in eastern China; and
Bartonellosis, dermatological infection, and
Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection in Peru.169

Heatwaves can increase morbidity and mortality
associated with heat stress and people with obesity
and diet-related NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and
cardiovascular disease) are at higher risk. During
the 2003 European heatwave, mortality rates among
people with cardiovascular disease were 30 percent
higher and there were 30 percent more in-patient
admissions than comparable periods without
heatwaves. Fatal heatstroke occurs 3.5 times more
frequently in overweight or obese adults than
normal-weight adults. 163
High and rising temperatures not only pose a risk
to mortalit y for v ulnerable populations but also
threaten occupational health and labour
productivit y, particularly for people undertaking
manual, outdoor work in hot areas.164 Accounting
for the impact of heat stress on productivit y, it is
estimated that labour capacit y diminished by
5.3 percent between 2000 and 2016, with a
dramatic decrease of more than 2 percent
between 2015 and 2016.165

Diarrhoeal diseases are particularly worr ying as
they can reduce food intake and diminish
nutrient absorption, leading to undernutrition,
while underlying malnutrition increases the risk
of diarrhoeal disease.170 Greater frequency and
severit y of f loods and droughts can exacerbate
the occurrence of diseases, due to deterioration in
water qualit y, water scarcit y, and higher burdens
of malnutrition. A number of studies show the
link between climate variabilit y and seasonal
diarrhoea, particularly among children under five
years of age.

Though there are some peaks of increased labour
capacit y, the overwhelming trend is one of
reduction. This trend is most notable in some of
the most v ulnerable countries in the world
(Figure 36). Loss of labour capacit y has important
implications for the livelihoods of individuals,
families and communities, potentially affecting
wage and income opportunities for those relying
on subsistence farming and agricultural wage
labour for food and income.

In the northwestern Amhara region of Ethiopia,
for example, a recent study revealed that
increases in temperature and rainfall in the area
are significantly correlated with higher rates of
childhood diarrhoea morbidit y, the second
leading cause of childhood death in the
countr y.171 Another example is Cambodia, where
a significant association has been found
between f looding and increased diarrhoea cases
in children. Given the two-way interaction
between nutrition and diarrhoeal disease and
the fact that malnutrition is already a public

Although the global number of deaths associated
with infectious diseases has largely decreased
overall since 1990,166 changing climate variabilit y
poses a challenge given the significant
association between increasing temperatures,

Malaria mainly occurs in Africa and South-eastern
Asia and is highly sensitive to increases in
temperature, rainfall and humidity. There is
evidence that El Niño is associated with a greater
risk of certain diseases – not only cholera but also
malaria – in specific geographical areas.175 Malaria
by far affects the largest number of people,
estimated at 220 million cases per year. Although
controversial, recent research shows a strong and
significant relationship between malaria and
malnutrition, especially for children in high
transmission areas.176 The disease can exacerbate
iron deficiency anaemia and contribute to
maternal anaemia, with substantial risks for
pregnant women, foetuses and newborn babies.177

blood-sucking arthropods, such as mosquitoes –
are sensitive to variations in rainfall, humidit y

best-studied diseases associated with climate
variabilit y and extremes due to their widespread
occurrence and sensitivit y to climatic factors.174
Malaria and deng ue are not only the most

have the highest reported impact in terms of
health, affecting more than 270 million people

over the past 50 years.178 It is also the only
disease associated with climate variables at both
global and local levels at high confidence.179 Each
year there are about 390 million deng ue
infections worldwide, of which roughly 50 million
present symptoms. Three-quarters of the people
exposed to deng ue are in the Asia-Pacific region,
but many other regions are also affected.

Women and young children can be particularly
v ulnerable to climate variabilit y and extremes, as
can the elderly and socially isolated.182 There is
valuable, though limited, evidence reporting
health impacts for these groups in different
countries.

Extreme climate variabilit y-related disasters
impact on mental health in both the short and
long term, with rises in anxiet y, depression,
post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic distress
and incidence of suicide reported.180 Repeated
f loods and droughts can also force population
displacement – which, in turn, is associated with
heightened risks of a wide range of negative
health effects. These can include anything from
depression to communicable diseases to negative
health outcomes caused by civil conf lict.181

In Viet Nam, the elderly, widows, disabled
people, single mothers, and households headed
by women with small children were least resilient
to f loods and storms and slow-onset events such
as recurrent droughts.183 In Bangladesh,
according to estimates, women and children
represent up to 90 percent of the victims in
cyclone-stricken areas.184 In the aftermath of the
2004 tsunami in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and
Thailand, a study found that sur viving men
outnumbered women by almost three to one.185

IMPACTS OF CLIMATE ON
THE VULNERABILITY,
RESOURCE AND
CONTROL FACTORS THAT
SHAPE FOOD SECURITY
AND NUTRITION?

The health impacts that women and children
experience through nutrition are even less
studied but the relationship exists. Climate
variabilit y can undermine maternal and child
care and breastfeeding practices, amplif ying food
shortages in which women consume less food186
and suffer from reproductive tract infections and
water-borne diseases after f loods.187

2.3

The role of women as primar y caregivers and
providers of food and fuel for households makes
them more v ulnerable when f looding and
droughts occur. In Central Africa, where up to
90 percent of Lake Chad has disappeared,
nomadic indigenous groups are especially at
risk.188 As the lake’s shoreline recedes, women
have to walk much further to collect water. And
with dr y seasons now becoming longer in many
countries in Africa, women are working even
harder to feed and care for their families without
support.

KEY MESSAGES
è Climate variability and extremes have impacts on
livelihoods and livelihood assets – especially of the
poor – contributing to greater risk of food insecurity
and malnutrition.
è Climate shocks and environmental degradation
reduce goods and services available to people and
local communities, not only limiting their economic
opportunities and livelihood options but also
modifying their resilience, coping and adaptive
capacity.

There is some evidence that climate shocks can
increase the workload of women farmers and
raise farming-related health risks.189 This in turn
can limit women’s abilit y to follow recommended
breastfeeding and complementar y feeding
practices and offer nutritious food with
recommended frequency and responsiveness to
their young children.190

è Prolonged or recurrent climate extremes lead to
diminished coping capacity, loss of livelihoods, distress
migration and destitution.

Breastfeeding protects infants against food- and
water-borne illnesses that can be more common
after extreme climate events, and also protects
against non-communicable disease (NCDs) in
later life. When a woman’s abilit y to exclusively
breastfeed her infant for six months is reduced,
this poses an increased health risk to infants and
young children.191 There is evidence that the
effects of climate shocks on child undernutrition
may be exacerbated through diminished child
feeding and caregiving practices. Furthermore,
these effects will be greater in settings where
they are combined with pre-existing
v ulnerabilities related to poor health and
malnutrition.192 n

è Climate-related disasters create and sustain
poverty, contributing to increased food insecurity and
malnutrition as well as current and future vulnerability
to climate extremes.
è Extreme climate events have short-, medium- and
long-term impacts on food security and nutrition.
Climate variabilit y and climate extremes can
affect the viabilit y of livelihoods and result in
adjustments to livelihood strategies. Repeated
climate shocks can undermine households’ abilit y
to maintain their livelihood asset base or to
reinvest in agriculture, leading some to chronic
food insecurit y, malnutrition, poor health, and
lack of economic productivit y. There is evidence
that the livelihoods of the poor are particularly
affected.193

| 79 |

PART 2 THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

Against this backdrop, a focus on peoples’ assets
or different t ypes of capital is central not only to
understanding the impacts of climate shocks on
livelihoods and coping and adaptation strategies,
but also to identif ying key factors to be
considered for policy design and the
implementation of programmes aimed at
improving food securit y and nutrition. A focus on
assets or capital also helps to establish what
resources are available and accessible in order to
aid in adaptation.

Unfortunately, the impact of climate extremes on
natural resources and the environment remains a
largely neglected area in terms of direct and
indirect economic losses. Although there is a
wide range of studies that look at the climate
effects on soils, most of these overlook links to
agriculture, food securit y and nutrition, partly
because of the lack of reliable data. This gap is
being addressed with new developments in
global soils data197 as well as a comprehensive
review of the impacts on ecosystem ser vices for
food production.

Impacts on livelihood assets

Impacts on physical capital

The analysis on the impact of climate variabilit y
and extremes on household and individual
assets or different t ypes of capital focuses on
five t ypes (natural, physical, human, financial
and social), which are defined according to the
Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (see Annex
4 Glossar y). Understanding how these t ypes of
capital are affected in the event of climate
shocks sheds further light on expected changes
in exposure and v ulnerabilit y to climate
variabilit y and extremes.

The physical damage caused by climate-related
disasters has direct impacts on agriculture and
the food value chain. These can come in the form
of disruption to the f low of agricultural inputs
such as seeds and fertilizers or in challenges to
processing and distribution, markets, retailers,
and final consumption.
Floods and other climate-related disasters can
potentially undermine fishing and damage
aquaculture infrastructure and facilities such as
fish farms, fish ponds, oyster banks, fish feed
storage, fish reproduction facilities, boats and
gear. This will result in major losses in fish and
aquaculture production and livelihoods.

Impacts on natural capital
Climate shocks contribute to environmental
degradation. It is well known that climate-related
disasters are a significant factor in ecosystem
degradation and loss, including increased soil
erosion, declining rangeland qualit y, salinization
of soils, deforestation, reduction of quantit y and
qualit y of ecosystem ser vices, and biodiversit y
loss.194 Consequently, economic opportunities and
livelihood options of households who are heavily
dependent on natural resources to meet their
food securit y and nutrition needs are also
affected by climate shocks.195

In Pakistan, heav y monsoons caused f loods in
2010 that destroyed propert y, assets and
infrastructure, affecting millions of people.198
Small to medium-sized agribusinesses were hurt
in cotton ginning, rice processing, f lour and
sugar milling, silk and horticulture. There was
also damage to agriculture infrastructure,
including machiner y, warehouses, irrigation
systems, animal health clinics, agriculture and
livestock research and extension offices, and
government buildings and facilities.199 Cyclone
Nargis, which struck Myanmar in 2008, caused
havoc to forestr y, fisher y and agriculture. Over
half of small rice mills and two-thirds of larger
rice mills in the affected areas were damaged,
and losses in terms of farm machiner y and land
affected the wider 2008/09 rice crop.

Higher temperatures and humidit y are raising the
risk of fungal growth and thus the contamination
of stored cereals and pulses with mycotoxins
(fungal metabolites). Climate variabilit y and
more frequent climate extremes (e.g. dr y spells,
intense short-lived widespread rainfall, and
cyclones), in addition to causing severe
disruption in their own right, can lead to more
frequent and intense plant pest and disease
outbreaks. This was the case during the desert
locust outbreaks both in north-western Africa
and in Yemen in late 2015 and early 2016.196

Such damage and destruction of physical capital
undoubtedly affect the qualit y of diets and food
stabilit y. For example, disruption of transport
infrastructure due to extreme climate often

achievement of universal health coverage,
economic growth and social development for
generations, with negative impacts on food
securit y and nutrition.
Alarmingly, more than 185 000 health and
education facilities were either damaged or
destroyed worldwide by climate-related disasters
between 1994 and 2013. Floods were the leading
cause of damage, followed by storms (Figure 38). 201
In the overwhelming majorit y of cases –
85 percent – this damage occurred in low- and
lower-middle-income countries. These countries
already face significant challenges in the
provision of universal coverage for adequate
health and education ser vices and have limited
capacit y to rebuild in the aftermath of climaterelated disasters.

Impacts on human capital
When extreme climate events damage other
infrastructure not necessarily associated with
food value chains, such as health and
education facilities, there can also be
considerable impacts on human capital,
including health and nutrition. In the long
term, the loss of education and health
infrastructure can be detrimental to the
| 81 |

PART 2 THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

income on food. This has the potential to affect
the qualit y of household diets and magnif y the
risk of malnutrition, while also leading to a loss
in household financial capital.

The damage to health facilities disrupts the
provision of health ser vices that are especially
critical during and after disasters. Many studies
have shown that the health and nutritional status
of children in particular is especially v ulnerable
to disaster, both during the emergency phase and
– due to malnutrition and undernutrition – in the
aftermath. 202

When climate variability and extremes disrupt
livelihoods, the most affected people are unable to
raise formal bank loans due to lack of collateral
(often lost during the event) and often do not have
insurance. 205 Diseases and other stressors on
health resulting from climate shocks often restrict
people’s ability to work and therefore impede the
accumulation of financial capital. Poor health and
difficulties in accessing health services limit
households’ ability to seek appropriate health
care, also affecting ability to work.

Climate-related events also have consequences
for the provision and operation of health ser vices.
Indeed, a food securit y assessment conducted in
southern Africa found that in early 2016 (during
the El Niño), water shortages limited access to
health treatments and disrupted HI V and
tuberculosis (TB) ser vices. 203 This has serious
consequences, as this particular region accounts
for one-third of all people living with HI V
(PLHI V ) worldwide. PLHI V are highly dependent
on nutritious food, and any reductions in food
intake may decrease the effectiveness of
antiretroviral therapy (A RT) drugs and also
treatment adherence. Further, poor nutrition may
reduce immunit y and increase risk for HI V
infected children lacking A RT and can also result
in malnutrition and infections for TB patients.

As noted when analysing the effects on food
availabilit y, more than 80 percent of the damage
and losses caused by droughts affect the
agriculture sector, not only in crop production
but also livestock. This includes potential animal
losses due to climate shocks.
For many rural people in developing countries
livestock can be part of a financial strateg y or a
coping mechanism, representing an important
asset to generate financial capital. In rural areas of
many low- and middle-income countries, financial
services such as credit, banking and insurance are
virtually non-existent. In these areas, livestock
plays an important role as a means of saving and
capital investment, often providing a substantially
higher return than alternative investments. 206
Investments in livestock are also used to hedge
against rapid inflation, as well as against
unexpected climate-related disasters such as
droughts and floods. 207

The damage or destruction of any t ype of capital,
whether it be natural resources, physical capital
or human capital, is important in its own right.
Nonetheless, climate shocks can be such that
damage or destruction can befall various t ypes of
capital at the same time. When this is the case –
e.g. for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) –
there can be serious long-term implications for
increasing malnutrition in all its forms and for
non-communicable disease (NCD) (Box 10).

Impacts on financial capital

In Somalia, for example, livestock acts as a “bank
on four legs” used to access cash, and herds ser ve
as valuable trade items exchanged for food and
other essentials. However, three years of drought
have taken a heav y toll on livestock. Losses of
goats, camels, sheep and cattle in 2017 alone
ranged from 20 to 40 percent – reaching
60 percent in the hardest-hit drought locations.
These large-scale livestock deaths undermine the
viabilit y of livelihoods and push families over the
edge, leading to high levels of food insecurit y
and malnutrition and forced economic
displacement as families search for relief. 208

Financial assets play a key role in enhancing the
resilience of v ulnerable groups. A reduction in
financial capital weakens adaptive capacities of
households and increases their v ulnerabilit y. This
is quite relevant for climate resilience when
considering the negative impacts of climate
variabilit y and extremes on agricultural
production, yields and income (identified earlier).
Low crop yields stand out as a potential stressor
on people’s financial capital. 204 Seasonal crop
failures also lead to high food prices and push
households to spend a larger proportion of their

SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES: DESTRUCTION OF NATURAL, PHYSICAL AND HUMAN CAPITAL
AND LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS FOR NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASE AND MALNUTRITION
non-communicable disease (NCDs). The enabling
processes that underpin nutrition status and
development outcomes (e.g. political commitment,
policy environment for action and implementation) are
also undermined by climate shocks in SIDS, where
already-limited government capacity is further
stretched, long-term vision is impaired and focus is
directed to the immediate needs following a shock.
While climate shocks can rapidly increase acute
malnutrition (wasting), micronutrient deficiencies and
prevalence of infectious diseases in the short term, the
longer-term impacts on nutrition and health status
should not be overlooked. Expected to increase in
frequency and intensity in the Pacific, climate shocks
affect the immediate, underlying and enabling
processes that determine nutrition and can thus
reinforce all forms of malnutrition, including overweight
and obesity and diet-related NCD. A teacher on Emae
Island described the impact of Cyclone Pam on food
availability, water security and education as follows:
“After cyclone Pam, the water that belongs to you
and me was not very good. I had to stop class
sometimes, half days, and then we’d eat all together,
sometimes we tell the children not to come to school
tomorrow because we don’t have enough food.”4

Geography and socio-economic characteristics in the
Pacific render Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones, droughts
and floods. Worldwide, 5 of the 15 countries
considered the most vulnerable to natural hazards are
Pacific SIDS, with Vanuatu ranked as the most
vulnerable globally.
In 2015 a category 5 tropical storm, Cyclone Pam,
caused widespread devastation in Vanuatu, affecting
approximately 200 000 people (73 percent of the
population) and causing an estimated USD 590 million
in damages (65 percent of GDP).1 Reefs were
damaged and fishing infrastructure destroyed.
Additionally, 70 percent of food crops were destroyed,
putting more pressure on already-declining fisheries for
local consumption.2 Cyclone Pam was followed only
months later by a severe El Niño-induced drought that
exacerbated the impacts of the cyclone, impeded
recovery and resulted in further crop losses and water
scarcity.3
These effects reinforce the already ongoing dietary
transition away from a healthy traditional local diet to
a greater dependency on imported foods and
beverages, often high in fat, sugar and salt, leading to
an increase in overweight, obesity and diet-related

Fisheries assets used to generate financial
capital are also highly v ulnerable, particularly
in the face of storms and hurricanes. Hurricane
Gilbert in 1998 was particularly damaging, with
Jamaican fishers losing 90 percent of their
traps. This meant a loss in revenue, and costly
repairs and delays in resuming fishing
activities. 210 In Peru, at the time of the

In Zimbabwe, relatively wealthier households sell
livestock to smooth consumption in the face of
drought-induced agricultural income losses,
whereas poorer households cope with income
losses by smoothing assets through decreased
consumption. 209 The latter raises issues of food
securit y and nutrition threats for the poor: the
erosion of assets (e.g. livestock) makes them more
exposed to future risks.

Drought can threaten local food security and nutrition
and aggravate humanitarian conditions, which can
trigger large-scale human displacement and create a
breeding ground for conflict. Some studies indicate
that, as drought intensifies and lingers, the likelihood
of conflict rises significantly.1
In agriculture-dependent communities in low-income
contexts, droughts have been found to increase the
likelihood of violence and prolonged conflict at the
local level, which can eventually pose a threat to
societal stability and peace.2

improved information exchange, lower
transaction costs and the likelihood of collective

Last year, this report presented evidence that
climate-related events, especially drought (see
Box 11), can become a trigger for social instabilit y
and violence, as they tend to jeopardize food
securit y, which in turn has been found to
increase the risk of conf lict. 213 This is particularly
the case where deep divisions exist between
population groups, in contexts of per vasive

Impacts on social capital

disasters also diminish social capital, thereby
reducing people’s adaptive capacities. Social
capital builds upon institutions embedded in

coping mechanisms are lacking.

consequences for food securit y and nutrition, as
previous editions of this report show. 216 There are
three capacit y t y pes that determine the ways and
extent to which individuals, households and
communities are able to cope with and adapt to
climate shocks and their impact:
 adaptive capacit y (coping strategies, risk
management, and savings);
 absorptive capacit y (use of assets, attitudes/
motivation, livelihood diversification and
human capital); and
 transformative capacit y (governance
mechanisms, policies/reg ulations,
infrastructure, communit y networks and
formal safet y nets).

Some studies find that deviations from moderate
temperatures and precipitation patterns
systematically raise conf lict risk. Temperature
has the largest average impact, with each 1 °C
rise in temperature increasing conf licts between
individuals by 2.4 percent and conf licts between
groups of individuals – e.g. organized violence,
civil conf licts and riots – by 11.3 percent. 214
Climate shocks also contribute to environmental
degradation and loss; this too can trigger
increased competition and become a f lash point
for unrest, insecurit y and conf lict. In the Greater
Horn of Africa, for example, water, forests and
rangelands are becoming more degraded due to a
combination of overuse, recurrent droughts and
increased temperatures. 215 As a result,
competition over scarce pasture and water among
pastoral communities often becomes fierce,
particularly during drought years when
pastoralists are forced to use non-traditional
migration routes. During the recent strong
2015 –2016 El Niño-related drought, pastoralists
were forced to move their herds far beyond their
normal grazing areas to nature reser ves and
farmland in Kenya, where they clashed with local
populations there.

Ex post coping strategies
The adoption of coping strategies depends on
the nature of the climate shock and the degree
of impact on household access to food and
income. Strategies can take the form of
consumption coping strategies (e.g. skipping
meals, switching to cheaper foods, borrowing
food, begging) or livelihood coping strategies
(selling assets, sending household members to
work off-farm, etc.).
Households t y pically engage first in reversible
coping strateg ies w ith short-term effects, such as
making modest dietar y adjustments and
skipping meals. However, as coping options are
exhausted and food securit y worsens,
households are more likely to employ more
extreme and damag strateg ies that are less
reversible, such as selling productive assets. In
the most severe form, a climate shock can lead to
the collapse of coping mechanisms entirely and
the loss of livelihoods, prompting mig ration and
destitution, and, in the most severe form,
star vation and death. In other cases, adopting
negative coping strateg ies results in increased
acute malnutrition and stunting among
preschool children as a consequence of reduced
food access, limited adequate child care and
increased exposure to contaminants. 217

Coping strategies adopted by households
The analysis until now shows that climate
shocks can undermine a household’s abilit y to
maintain its livelihood asset base or to reinvest
in agriculture. This interaction between
climate events and v ulnerabilities determines
the basic outcome with regard to food securit y
and nutrition.
The impacts on food securit y and nutrition can be
significant, and people may react in a variet y of
ways. The analysis that follows focuses on how
people cope with a shortfall in food or income
following a climate shock (ex post), as well as how
they adapt their livelihood strategies (ex ante) in
the context of climate variabilit y.

There are many examples where adopting ex post
coping strategies are detrimental to food securit y
and nutrition (see Box 12). In some contexts,
climate shocks can force v ulnerable groups to
adopt other t y pes of negative coping strategies,
such as illegal activities, which are detrimental »

consumption is highly sensitive to external
shocks, such as climate shocks. This could result
in micronutrient deficiencies, thereby
jeopardizing the nutrition status of vulnerable
household members. Moreover, evidence
indicates that rural households are more at risk
of food insecurity. 2
 In Timor-Leste, drought-affected households have
been adopting negative coping strategies such
as limiting portion sizes, reducing the number of
meals a day, using food stocks necessary for the
lean season, and selling household assets.
Considering the already low resilience levels of
many households in areas worst hit by the El
Niño drought, these negative coping mechanisms
have further exacerbated fragile livelihoods. 3

 The Karamoja region in Uganda is characterized
by chronic food insecurity due to high levels of
poverty, low development and unfavourable
climate conditions. The most frequent coping
strategies adopted by households after a climate
shock include begging, borrowing, sale of local
brew and charcoal/fuelwood production. The
selling of assets – particularly livestock – is a
commonly employed coping strategy among
households in response to droughts/prolonged
dry spells.1

the coping strategy most frequently employed by
households to mitigate the impact of food
security-related climate shocks (see figure

conditions. 227

example in the north-eastern zone of Nigeria, 218
and in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras in
Central America. 219

Ex ante adaptation strategies

Nevertheless, with farmers already more
consciously noticing changes in rainfall and
seasonalit y, 228 some of them are now using a
variet y of strategies to adjust or adapt to
changes in their environment, despite the
aforementioned constraints.

Not all households take action or even
precautionar y responses in the face of climate
variabilit y and extremes. They could perceive that
the stressor is not critical (i.e. feel the
opportunit y cost of acting is high) or simply lack
the means to adapt. 220

Ex ante diversification strategies help farmers to
smooth income streams over time. 229 Climate
variabilit y and frequent climate shocks increase
incentives to adopt climate-smart agricultural
practices such as: the use of drought-tolerant
crop varieties; soil and water conser vation
techniques that restore degraded lands and store
water in the soil; and agroforestr y technologies
that restore soil fertilit y and control soil erosion
and desertification. 230 The t y pe of strategies
currently being adopted by households and the
conditions that facilitate their implementation
are discussed next.

Evidence suggests that the opportunit y cost
associated with climatic uncertaint y is
substantial – perhaps greater than the direct, ex
post cost of shocks. 221 Climate risks affect the
behaviour of people, who may reduce their
investments and assets because of the possibilit y
of further losses. As a consequence, individuals
hit by shocks may opt for lower-risk but
lower-return activities. 222
One of the primar y sources of agricultural
income risk is production uncertaint y caused by
climate-related events. Households deplete their
productive assets to subsist during transitor y
shocks, 223 opting for low-risk, low-return
investments to mitigate risk over time. 224
Farmers’ precautionar y strategies include
selection of less risky but less profitable crops
and cultivars, shifting household labour to less
profitable off-farm activities, and avoiding
investment in production assets and improved
technolog y. 225

In response to changing rainfall patterns and
shorter growing seasons, some farmers are
shifting to drought-tolerant crops and
fast-maturing varieties in order to adapt. 231 As
seen above, these shifts are sometimes aided by
social capital – such as government programmes
and extension, or communication and support
among farmers 232 – demonstrating the important
role of higher-level structures and processes.
Farmers are also changing planting dates
(adjustment of cropping calendars) in response to
erratic rainfall or false starts to the rainy season
and implementing mixed cropping and crop
switching to reduce the risk of total crop
failure. 233

Problems of access to social and financial
ser vices are among the factors that limit
households in adopting more long-term
sustainable strategies to face climate variabilit y.
A lack of formal institutions to reduce household
v ulnerabilit y to agricultural income risk restricts
many countries’ abilit y to cope and adapt both in
the short and long term.

Other changes in farming practices due to
changes in rainfall patterns include increasing
planting distances in response to soil moisture
deficits, introducing short-maturing varieties of
maize in response to reduced rainfall at the end
of the growing season and the construction of
stone bunds to curb soil erosion caused by more
intense rainfall. 234 Farmers also draw upon
their social capital to build their adaptation
strategies. They form cooperatives to reduce

Examples of barriers to adaptation cited by
farmers include lack of access to credit in South
Africa and lack of access to land, information and
credit in Ethiopia. 226 Many regions in
sub-Saharan Africa are heavily constrained by
their limited social, political and technical
resources, which already affect their abilit y to

PART 2 THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

dr y spells is to shift from cropping to livestock
management. 243 While this strateg y is effective in
reducing reliance on crops that may fail due to
lack of rain, farmers are noting a reduction in
grazing resources as a result of this shift.

production and transportation costs, thus
enhancing social capital.
In the Philippines, for example, more intense
t y phoons have important consequences for food
securit y. They have significant negative effects
on households that depend on farming
livelihoods. 235 And there is also evidence that
El Niño has been equally destructive by
lowering rainfall in some Philippine regions
with severe impacts on incomes, affordabilit y of
food, livelihoods, nutrition and dietar y
diversit y. 236

Internal migration, whether seasonal or more
lasting, has also been identified as one of the key
coping strategies used by households to diversif y
income in response to climate shocks and as a
risk mitigation strateg y. 244 Many scholars
consider this a traditional strateg y that gives
individuals the chance to diversif y their income,
diversif y risk for their household and send money
back to family members, thereby boosting
resilience back home. 245 Migration pools or avoids
risks across space and is especially successful
when combined with clear information about
potential precipitation failures. 246

In response to these climate shocks, households
of landless agricultural workers in a number of
agricultural activities have employed various
coping mechanisms or sur vival strategies,
including the participation in different kinds of
work groups as well as cooperation (whether
within or between families) as a form of “shared
povert y” (i.e. pooling together of labour and
other resources to maximize income). 237 Some of
these farmers have also engaged in diversified
income strategies and sought alternative
livelihood sources, such as carpentr y, gardening,
raising livestock, vending, construction work or
domestic help (both at home and abroad).

When financing the relocation of a household
member within a countr y is more affordable than
other alternatives, migration offers poor
households a potential risk management
strateg y. Moreover, households target
destinations where income risk is least correlated
with risk at home. 247
In northern Nigeria, households facing greater
ex ante risk have a greater probabilit y of having
at least one migrant. 248 In the United Republic
of Tanzania, for an average rural household, a
1 percent reduction in agricultural income
induced by climate shocks increases the
probabilit y of migration by 13 percent on
average within the following year. However, this
effect is significant only for households in the
middle tier of wealth distribution, suggesting
that the choice of migration as an adaptation
strateg y depends on initial endowment. This is
not necessarily the case when income is highly
dependent on agriculture. 249

Of course, farmers in cooperatives alone cannot
go ver y far. In some cases, their success may also
depend on help from government extension
agencies to gain access to drought-resistant crop
varieties and indigenous livestock breeds. 238
There are also other measures that some farmers
are implementing to a lesser extent, such as
reforesting along the banks of water bodies (to
prevent soil erosion, reduce water temperature or
provide windbreaks for crops), using irrigation
and investing in water har vesting schemes, as
well as soil and water conser vation
measurements. 239 Tree planting is also reportedly
being implemented, mostly by livestock farmers
to protect livestock against heat stress. 240

In conclusion, some farmers are already taking
measures to deal with climate variabilit y and
extremes. The adoption of ex post adjustments
following climate extreme episodes depends on
the nature of the event and the degree of impact
on the household’s access to food and income. It
also depends to a significant extent on people’s
access to extension ser vices, information, credit,
savings and livelihood options. Without clear

In Malawi, the Niger and Zambia, climate
variabilit y and extremes can act as push factors
for crop and income diversification. 241 In northeastern Ghana, prolonged dr y seasons lead
farmers to seek more off-farm employment. 242 In

people have no other viable option to sustain

In fact, extreme climate shocks can be a

level of the system. In many cases, climate shocks
and risks can be amplified by:

approximately 22 percent of rural households
affected by tidal-surge floods and 16 percent of
those affected by riverbank erosion migrated to
urban areas. 252

 Environmental, social, economic and
political stressors, which together impinge on
livelihoods and reinforce each other in the
process, often negatively. 255 Vulnerabilities are
in some cases also exacerbated by a lack of
education and healthcare facilities, leading to
economic impediments with long-term
effects. 256
 The repetition of such stressors and shocks
over time, which erodes households’ assets
and their capacit y to cope. For example, a
drought can increase v ulnerabilit y to
subsequent droughts by: (i) weakening
livestock, making them more v ulnerable to
diseases; or (ii) hampering food production,
forcing households to adopt negative coping
strategies such as selling or reducing assets.
 Limited ability to cope and adapt if
households lack the right means, so that
climate shocks may contribute to even greater
v ulnerabilit y. Maladaptive actions, or actions
that undermine the long-term sustainabilit y of
livelihoods, result in downward trajectories,

 Poverty and persistent inequality, among the
most salient conditions that shape
climate-related v ulnerabilit y. 258 They reinforce
the conditions in which people have few assets
to liquidate in times of hardship or crisis. 259
The poor are the first to experience asset
erosion, povert y traps and barriers and limits
to adaptation. 260 Climate-related disasters also
keep people in or move them back into povert y
and are one reason that eradicating povert y is
so difficult. For example, between 2006 and
2011, 45 percent of poor households in Senegal
escaped povert y, but 40 percent of non-poor
households became poor, leaving the povert y
rate almost unchanged. 261
 Marginalization, a critical determinant
because v ulnerabilit y and adaptation to climate
shocks depend on opportunities governed by
the complex interplay of social relationships,
institutions, organizations and policies. 262 The
socially and economically disadvantaged and
the marginalized are disproportionately
affected by the impacts of climate variabilit y
and extreme events. 263

The 2011 East Africa Drought and the Somalia
Famine 2011–2012 are examples of extreme
climate events that, combined with other
v ulnerabilit y factors – conf lict, rising global food
prices and other longstanding structural factors –
led to the collapse of coping mechanisms and
livelihoods, causing destitution and catastrophic
levels of food insecurit y and malnutrition. These
events resulted in a severe food crisis across
Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia,
threatening the livelihoods of 9.5 million people.
Many refugees from southern Somalia fled to
neighbouring countries such as Kenya and
Ethiopia, where crowded, unsanitary conditions
and severe malnutrition led to a large number of
deaths. Other countries in Eastern Africa,
including the Sudan, South Sudan and parts
of Uganda, were also affected. A famine was
declared in two regions in the southern part of
Somalia in July 2012, the first time a famine had
been declared in the region by the United Nations
in nearly 30 years. Tragically, tens of thousands of
people are believed to have died in southern
Somalia before famine was even declared. 253

Exposure and vulnerability of livelihoods
and population groups
The analysis presented so far suggests that climate
variability and extremes undermine food security
and nutrition. The precise impacts depend on
people’s exposure to climate shocks and their
vulnerability to these shocks. Vulnerability here
refers to an inability to cope with external changes
including avoiding harm when exposed to a
hazard. This includes inability to avoid the hazard
or shock; anticipate it; take measures to avoid it or
limit its impact; cope with it; and recover from
it. 254 The evidence shows that low- and middleincome countries are increasingly exposed to
climate extremes and their vulnerability to these
events is becoming a more important risk factor
for food security and nutrition.
Generally, a stress or shock can be amplified or
reduced depending on the v ulnerabilities at each

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

Therefore, the impact or risk of impact from a
climate shock is context-specific – not only will it
depend on the nature and intensity of the shock,
but also on the fragility of a system or livelihood
in relation to this hazard. 264 Moreover, livelihoods
are also affected differently by various climate
shocks and stressors, depending on the types of
livelihoods (if based on crop, livestock, fish, tree,
other renewable natural resources, or any
combination of these) and their ability to
withstand impacts of drought, floods or storms.

food may get better in urban areas for those
who can afford it, reliance on highly
processed, energ y-dense foods and street
foods tends to increase. The most affordable
and available diets for poor urban populations
are often unhealthy and adopting them could
thus raise the risk of malnutrition and dietrelated NCDs.
 Populations groups that suffer greater
inequality and marginalization: There is
mounting evidence of and broad consensus 266
on the inequalit y-driven impacts and risks
related to climate shocks. Vulnerabilit y
emerges from the intersection of different
inequalities and uneven power structures and
is therefore socially differentiated. 267 For
instance, the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report
identified poor and marginalized indigenous
peoples in North America 268 and in Africa 269 as
highly v ulnerable to climate shocks.
 Women, children, the elderly and the
socially isolated: As highlighted before,
v ulnerabilit y is often high for this group,
which also includes indigenous and disabled
people. These population groups experience
multiple deprivations that inhibit them from
managing daily risks and shocks 270 and present
significant barriers to adaptation.
 Men and women are impacted differently by
climate shocks. This difference arises from the
distinct roles they have in societ y and from the
way these roles are enhanced or constrained by
other dimensions of inequalit y, risk
perceptions and the nature of their response to
hazards. As a result of extreme climate events
and climate-related disasters, women often
experience additional duties as labourers and
caregivers due to, for instance, male
out-migration. They face more psychological
and emotional distress, reduced food intake,
adverse mental health outcomes due to
displacement and in some cases increasing
incidences of domestic violence (Box 13).
 Infants, young children and adolescent
girls: These young persons are often at higher
risk and more v ulnerable to climate variability
and extremes due to more limited mobility,
susceptibility to infectious diseases, reduced
adequate care (including feeding and food
intake) and social isolation. Adverse effects on
the nutritional status in early life can
irreversibly impair growth and development, »

For these reasons – nature and intensit y of the
shock, fragilit y of a system/livelihood and
livelihood t ype – some livelihoods and
population groups are more v ulnerable and at
greater risk of increased food insecurit y and
malnutrition. Effects on specific groups include:
 Small family farms and agriculture
labourers: The majorit y of the world’s poor
and food-insecure people are rural, either
farmers, fisherfolk, or labourers with direct or
indirect dependence on agriculture for their
income. They are thus directly exposed to any
risk that would impact agricultural
production. Small family farms are
particularly v ulnerable. For example, a small
family farm that t ypically relies on a single
crop, rather than on a more diversified system,
will be more v ulnerable to a pest affecting
that crop. An area prone to water scarcit y or a
rainfed system will be more impacted by
drought than an irrigated system. Therefore,
small family farms entirely dependent on
rainfed agriculture are more v ulnerable from
an economic point of view to drought than
larger farms with other sources of water.
 Poorer population groups: Evidence suggests
that, faced with a shock, poorer households
are more likely to reduce consumption, while
wealthier households have the capacit y to
access credit and savings and liquidate assets
to cover current deficits. 265 This means
choosing between limiting consumption and
asset smoothing, with no other safer
alternatives. Unsurprisingly, people from
low-income groups are those most likely to
migrate, but neither their capacit y to cope and
adapt to climate shocks nor their food securit y
and nutrition necessarily improve when they
move to urban environments. While

THE GENDER DIMENSIONS OF VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE SHOCKS

and with few – mostly female – working-age adults.
In addition, as women act as primary caregivers
and providers of food, water and fuel, they are more
vulnerable when droughts and floods occur. For
instance, with dry seasons now becoming longer,
women are working harder to feed and care for their
families without support. In central Africa, where up to
90 percent of Lake Chad has disappeared, women
have to walk much further to collect water.
As an indirect social consequence of climate-related
disasters, as well as slow-onset climate events, in
Viet Nam4 and Bangladesh5 increased gender-based
violence within households has been reported owing to
greater stress and tension, loss and grief, and
disrupted safety nets.
Finally, data from India indicate that exposure to a
disaster (generally in the form of floods, droughts and
extreme temperatures) had much worse effects on
undernutrition among girls than boys, possibly because
of differential parental behavioural responses and
other disinvestments in girls’ human capital.6 In fact,
persistent gender inequalities in nutrition may dictate
that male children are prioritized over female children
in intrafamily caregiving practices, food distribution
and health care access and therefore have decreased
risk of acute malnutrition. In Rwanda, girls born during
crop failure showed stunted growth compared to those
born when there was no crop failure (i.e. had
0.86 standard deviations lower height-for-age z-scores,
with no adverse impacts noted among boys). The
authors attributed the gender differences observed to
preferential feeding of boys.7

Women are particularly vulnerable to climate variability
and extremes, and their vulnerability derives from
restricted access to the social and environmental
resources required for adaptation.
In many rural economies and resource-based
livelihood systems, women have poorer access than men
to financial resources, land, education, health, and
other basic rights. Further drivers of gender inequality
include social exclusion from decision-making processes
and labour markets, making women less able to cope
with and adapt to climate change impacts.1
In the Bongo district of north-eastern Ghana,
households headed by men were found to be more
resilient to climate shocks than those headed by
women in terms of income and food access, assets and
adaptive capacities. The reason for this inequality was
women’s limited rights in livelihood decision-making
processes and access to land and other productive
resources. Households headed by men were also found
to adopt 0.8 times more adaptation measures than
those headed by women.2
In most countries access to credit for female family
farmers was found to be 5–10 percent lower than that
of their male equivalents.3 Moreover, social norms or
time constraints may prevent women from seizing
off-farm opportunities, which influences their level of
vulnerability, incomes and ability to adjust their
agricultural production. In some communities, only men
have the right to cultivate certain crops or to access
markets. In addition, many adaptation practices
require investments in cash, time or labour and are
thus costly for households with limited access to credit

and health have already been discussed, but it
is important to add further considerations.
First, while adults and older children are more
severely affected by some climate-sensitive
vector-borne diseases such as deng ue, young
children are more likely to die from or be
severely compromised by diarrhoeal diseases
(caused by, for example, floods) and slide into
the vicious cycle of infection and malnutrition.
Second, as a consequence of climate extremes
and climate-related disasters children may lose
access to schooling and health care facilities
and be compelled to work to support their
families. This may put children and adolescent
girls at increased risk of emotional, physical,
and sexual violence. 271 Overall, climate shocks
can thus exacerbate existing inequalities that
disproportionality affect disadvantaged
children and limit their opportunities for the
future.

KEY MESSAGES
è Scaled-up actions across sectors are needed to
strengthen the resilience of livelihoods and food
systems to climate variability and extremes. Such
actions should take place through integrated disaster
risk reduction and management and climate change
adaptation policies, programmes and practices with
short-, medium- and long-term vision.
è When designing policies and programmes it is
important to consider that adaptation has limits in
some contexts. This may necessitate the transformation
of systems themselves in a manner that leads to
increased resilience.

Policy and programme coherence is urgently
needed to address the increased exposure and
v ulnerabilit y of livelihoods, particularly of
disadvantaged population groups. Without
proper planning, climate variabilit y and
extremes will also affect v ulnerabilit y to future
extreme events. Any rise in climate extremes
can exacerbate the v ulnerabilit y of
disadvantaged population groups with adverse
long-term developmental effects if no action is
taken to increase resilience at all levels
(productive, social, climatic and
environmental). n

è Climate resilience is key and requires
context-specific interventions aimed at anticipating,
limiting, and adapting to the effects of climate
variability and extremes and building the resilience
of livelihoods, food systems and nutrition to climate
shocks and stresses.
è To be successful across livelihoods and food
systems and to address food insecurity and all
forms of malnutrition, climate resilience policies
and programmes should be built around climate
risk assessments, science and interdisciplinary
cross-sectoral knowledge, and participatory
and inclusive blended humanitarian and
development approaches driven by the needs
of climate-vulnerable groups.
è Solutions require increased partnerships,
enhanced risk management capacities and multi-year,
predictable large-scale funding of disaster risk
reduction and management and climate change
adaption policies, programmes and practices.

PART 2 THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

è Implementation of climate resilience policies
and programmes means adopting and refitting
tools and interventions such as: risk monitoring
and early warning systems; emergency
preparedness and response; vulnerability reduction
measures; shock-responsive social protection,
risk transfers and forecast-based financing; and
strong risk governance structures in the
environment–food–health system nexus.

lead to successful policies and practices that
address climate risks.

Global policy frameworks, processes and
concepts for addressing the threats and
impacts of climate variability and extremes
on food security and nutrition
It is important to understand a number of global
policy dimensions and a wide range of different
actors when examining the possible solutions for
addressing the threats and impact of climate
variabilit y and extremes on food securit y and
nutrition. Four United Nations frameworks and a
multi-stakeholder global process are particularly
important (Figure 40). 273 Each provides key
concepts, though in rather siloed policy areas,
with different platforms and processes, involving
government and other stakeholders and technical
experts:

The analysis and evidence presented up until now
shows how climate variabilit y and extremes are
undermining food availabilit y, access, utilization
and stabilit y. They are also challenging health
and caregiving practices and are thus among the
underlying causes of food insecurit y and
malnutrition in several parts of the world. The
critical aspect going forward is to build lasting
climate resilience, which will require scaled-up
policies, programmes and practices and better
ways of working to ensure their success.

 The United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) – through
which the 2015 Paris Agreement was
negotiated – offers the policy architecture to
support climate change adaptation and
mitigation goals. Climate change adaptation
(CCA) comprises actions to manage and
reduce the risks and impacts of climate-related
hazards, climate variabilit y and gradual
climate change at large. Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs), 274 National Adaptation

 The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk
Reduction (SFDRR) (2015 –2030), adopted in
2015, provides a worldwide framing for disaster
risk reduction (DRR) and disaster risk
management (DRM) work, which includes
humanitarian disaster management or
emergency response. Disaster risk management
is considered to be the application of DRR
policies and strategies in the cycle before,
during and after disasters. 277 DRR and DRM
are rooted in the humanitarian and
development fields and are supported globally
by the United Nations Office for Disaster
Risk Reduction (UNISDR). Focusing on
extreme events and combining both immediate

Resilience is generally understood as the capacit y
of individuals, groups, communities and
institutions to anticipate, absorb (i.e. cope), adapt
and transform in the face of shocks. 272
Inter ventions aimed at reducing v ulnerabilities
and enhancing resilience should therefore look to
strengthen these capacities in anticipation of and
in reaction to climate variabilit y and extremes
that undermine food securit y and nutrition.
The concept of resilience, and more specifically
climate resilience, plays an important role in
global policy processes. This section describes
the existing global policy frameworks and
concepts that can provide the basis for efforts in
building climate resilience, as well as the need to
reduce the fragmentation of the inter ventions
among global entities and partners. This section
also notes that while national and local
governments can be g uided by better integrated
global policy processes, they also need to
overcome a number of context-specific challenges
when tr ying to determine measures to prevent
risk and address the effects of increased climate
variabilit y and extremes. In view of the
challenges at all levels (global, national and
local) and the complexit y involved in building
climate resilience, the section also provides
recommendations on the cross-cutting factors

 At the Second International Conference on
Nutrition (ICN2) in 2014, countries
committed and adopted the global policy
framework to end all forms of malnutrition – in
the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the
Framework for Action, fostered by the
proclamation by the UN General Assembly of
the United Nations Decade of Action on
Nutrition, 2016-2025. The ICN2 outcomes
recognize the need to address the impacts of
climate change and to enhance the resilience
of the food supply in crisis prone areas. The
United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition
provides an operational framework for
strengthening efforts to end hunger and
eradicate all forms of malnutrition worldwide,
including through nutrition sensitive disaster
risk reduction and climate adaptation policies
and programmes to strengthen the resilience
of people’s livelihoods and food systems for
healthy diets.
 The World Humanitarian Summit and the
Grand Bargain, 280 held in 2016 in Istanbul and
known as the Agenda for Humanity, is a
multi-stakeholder global policy process that

prevention, DRR outlines policy objectives and
the strategic and instrumental measures
employed to anticipate and prevent future
disaster risk in order to reduce existing
v ulnerability and exposure in the face of
hazards, including climate extremes.
 The global ambition of “Transforming Our
World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development” was adopted by world leaders
during the 2015 United Nations Summit. This
global policy framework commits the
international communit y to end povert y,
hunger and malnutrition, tackle climate
change and achieve equitable and sustainable
development in its three dimensions (social,
economic and environmental) by 2030. 278
Achieving the 17 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) of the agenda calls for
comprehensive, coherent, convergent and
participator y approaches from all stakeholders,
including humanitarian, development, peace
and climate actors. Many SDGs – in particular
SDG1 on ending povert y, SDG2 on ending
hunger and SDG13 on combating climate
change – have specific targets on resilience. 279

measures to prevent risk and address the effects
of increased climate variabilit y and extremes.

pursues three goals: to reinspire and
reinvigorate a commitment to humanity and the
universality of humanitarian principles; to
initiate a set of concrete actions and
commitments aimed at enabling countries and
communities to better prepare for and respond
to crises, and be resilient to shocks; and to share
best practices that can help save lives around
the world, put affected people at the centre of
humanitarian action and alleviate suffering. The
resulting multi-stakholder commitments for
action revolve around five core themes including
leaving no one behind and working differently
to end needs. These themes include a work
stream on risk and vulnerability reduction with
a focus on natural hazards and climate change
where resilience is key. 281

To begin with, each of the global policy platforms
compartmentalizes different concepts and
expertise into silos of action across and within
sectors. This introduces potential inefficiencies in
overlapping inter ventions and missed
opportunities for integrating responses, while
also diluting available funds and human
resources. Integration and convergence of efforts
are critical for addressing climate risks in
general, but even more so for bringing together
food systems, agricultural livelihoods, and food
securit y and nutrition and for promoting
sustainable, healthy diets as part of climate
resilience action plans. 282
For adaptation action, National Adaptation Plans
(NAPs) and Nationally Determined Contributions
(NDCs) could be a prime instrument for
implementation. Almost 90 percent of developing
countries have designated the agricultural sector
as a priorit y for adaptation actions in their
NDC 283 and a similar prioritization is found in
DRR plans. However, poorly defined institutional
roles between different ministries and capacit y
gaps – as well as compartmentalized approaches
and actions on agriculture (including crop,
livestock, fisheries, aquaculture, and forestr y
sub-sectors), food securit y, nutrition and health –
are hindering integrated DRR/DRM and CCA
policies, programmes and practices for resilience.
Furthermore, less than 1.5 percent of
international financing for climate change
adaptation is currently allocated to health
projects. 284

Though these global policy frameworks and
processes lack alignment they all include the
objectives of eradicating hunger and
malnutrition, reducing povert y and addressing
the underlying root causes of v ulnerabilit y for
building resilience against multiple risks,
including those associated with the climate. In
addition, they call for a transformative shift to
put the world onto a more resilient and
sustainable pathway.
Today, the much needed convergence and
coherence of climate resilience actions by
humanitarian and development actors is being
promoted through another important dialog ue
called the humanitarian–development nexus.
This considers how to bridge the needs of
people across the current artificial divide
between humanitarian and development
responses, incorporating the concept of
resilience along the continuum. While lacking
the more formal policy architecture of CCA and
DRR, the nexus debate was re-energized during
the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016. More
recently the humanitarian–development nexus
has also incorporated peace considerations –
otherwise known as the triple nexus – aligning
it even closer to the 2030 Agenda.

Another challenge is that adaptation has limits, a
critical aspect to keep in mind when designing
measures to prevent risk and address the effects
of increased climate variabilit y and extremes.
Agricultural crops, fish and seafood species, coral
reef and forest ecosystems, and even human
beings are all constrained by climate
thresholds. 285 Adaptation is no longer feasible
once these thresholds are reached, and the
implications of this are significant. For example,
lack of possibilities for adaptation is the ver y
reason why the likelihood of a person being
displaced by a disaster is 60 percent higher today
than it was four decades ago. 286

Existing challenges for countries in responding
to climate variability and extreme events
National and local governments are facing a
number of challenges in tr ying to determine
| 96 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

climate resilience, including: the UNFCCC’s
Subsidiar y Body of Scientific and Technological
Advice (SBSTA); the Global Platform for Disaster
Risk Reduction; and initiatives such as the UN
Climate Resilience Initiative (A2R) 291 and the
Capacit y for Disaster Reduction Initiative
(CADRI) global partnership. These efforts
towards integration and coherence with greater
focus on resilience will hopefully lead to
enhanced, coordinated and coherent sectoral
policies, investments and programmes, as well as
more effective and holistic actions for climate
resilience of the agriculture, food securit y and
nutrition sectors.

In some cases policy design also needs to
recognize the possibilit y that the limits to
adaptation may force people to transform or
change their system of reference. 287 For example,
small family farms that are faced with unreliable
agriculture productivit y (due to climate
variabilit y and extremes) may only find solutions
to this problem by rethinking their entire
livelihood system. Policies must also ensure that
such changes ultimately help increase resilience.
Migration is an example of a transformational
adaptation strateg y that may not necessarily
increase resilience.
Evaluating the suitabilit y of scaling up tested
DRR/DR M and CCA options in some locations
can be seriously hampered by a lack of technical
capacit y and data. Inadequately understanding
and measuring how climate variabilit y and
extremes affect livelihoods and food systems in
different contexts often leads to the design and
development of policies and plans that do not
contribute to resilience building. 288 This is further
complicated by the comprehensiveness of food
systems and the interrelated nature of climate,
food systems, livelihood systems, nutrition and
health issues. 289

To meet the needs of the most v ulnerable groups,
cross-institutional partnerships, responsibilit y
sharing and information f low need to be at the
centre of an inclusive climate resilience strateg y
within and across sectors. While the 2030 Agenda
recognizes this need, more efforts are required at
national and local level. Resilience building must
be realized through nutrition-sensitive measures
blending short-, medium- and long-term
inter ventions that link humanitarian disaster
response and risk-informed development actions
addressing root causes of climate v ulnerabilities
and CCA. Longer-term strategies designed to
increase general food system resilience will
improve food securit y and nutrition for present
and future generations. 292

There are still challenges related to data
collection and management to assess and better
understand losses and damages linked to climate
variabilit y and extremes. The absence of
well-defined or well-established indicators and
monitoring and evaluation systems remains
problematic due to the range of conceptual
frameworks and institutions involved across this
spectrum of work. Addressing these gaps is
fundamental not only for ensuring well-tailored
policies and investments but also for tracking
progress toward global targets related to the
SFDRR, the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. 290

Cross-cutting factors that lead to successful
policies and practices addressing climate risks
Designers of policies, programmes and practices
need to be mindful of the key elements that
determine their success or failure. Climate risk
assessments are fundamental for understanding
risks and impacts across agriculture, food
securit y and nutrition sectors in order to
adequately evaluate options and inform
decision-making. Science is critical for
identif ying appropriate solutions, including
technological ones. Participator y, inclusive and
equitable gender-based approaches must g uide
the entire policy/programme cycle, putting
v ulnerable groups at the centre of responses. The
comprehensiveness of the food system needs to
be understood, including how it can be
transformed to address climate-risk,
environmental, nutrition and health-sensitive

On a more positive note, the growing focus on
building resilience – and specifically climate
resilience – which incorporates the concept of
climate risk management, is helping to create a
bridge between DRR/DRM and CCA and is
providing important g uidance to stakeholders for
integrating these concepts into policies,
programmes and actions. In 2017 a number of
high-level international meetings began to
promote integrated approaches with a focus on
| 97 |

PART 2 THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

considerations. Transformational change will not
happen without dependable, multi-year and
large-scale financing as well as shared climate
resilience good practices and knowledge
management.

Integrating climate information in
socio-economic and environmental analysis is
critical for understanding current trends and for
targeting risk reduction and adaptation measures
towards the most v ulnerable groups in the most
v ulnerable areas. Studies for Malawi and Zambia
highlight that different t y pes of exposure to
climate risk call for different t y pes of adaptation
strategies. 296 Not ever y farmer will benefit from
the same adaptation strateg y in a risk-prone area.
In Zambia poor households can reap significant
benefits from adopting crop diversification
strategies, whereas diversification may not be
particularly beneficial for wealthier households
whose returns to specialization are high. 297

Climate risk assessment at the core of policy,
programme and practice design
Policies, programmes and practices are ineffective
if they do not help individuals anticipate, absorb
and adapt to climate variabilit y and extremes.
Their design and monitoring thus requires
comprehensive risk assessments and an
understanding of the potential impacts of climate
variabilit y and extremes on human, natural and
food systems. Assessments should be quantitative
to a large extent, because policy-makers need to
have a sense of the magnitude of impacts and the
measures to offset them; but they also need
qualitative insight. A number of methodological
tools are available so that these assessments are
implemented with climatic, biophysical and
economic orientations and stakeholder
engagement, as well as a focus on the impacts on
agriculture, livelihoods, nutrition, health,
resilience, povert y and inequalit y. 293

Cost–benefit analysis (CBA) can help
policy-makers explore alternative options and
expected net benefits in order to determine the
best allocation of resources. 298 For example, CBA
has been used to evaluate investment options in
National Adaptation Plans. 299 In Kenya, Zambia
and Urug uay, ongoing CBA studies containing
climate scenarios have been used within the
Integrating Agriculture in National Adaptation
Plans (NAP-Ag) Programme. 300 One lesson
learned from these experiences is that CBA
analysis should be complemented with qualitative
assessments of both barriers to adoption as well
as environmental and social impacts of
adaptation strategies.

Assessments also need to be based on
risk-specific and local contexts, with an
understanding of how livelihoods, food securit y,
nutrition and food systems are affected and
interconnected. This is essential to better
differentiate between affected groups, identif y
their specific needs, including gender and target
them with shock-specific and context-relevant
programme options and measures to enhance
resilience. The critical aspect is that assessments
produce people-centred results that inform
decision-making.

Science and interdisciplinary knowledge to inform
technological solutions
Technological solutions that farmers may adopt
will also have to be informed by climate-related
science and evidence. Scientific climate
information is key to enhancing the accuracy and
the role of preparedness and adaption
mechanisms, such as forecast-based financing
mechanisms, weather-based index insurance and
shock-responsive social protection, among
others. It is important to develop accurate climate
and weather forecasts to design triggers for the
quick dispersal of finances or the provision of
safet y nets to those affected – or likely to be
affected – by a climate event.

In Sri Lanka – a countr y with high exposure to
climate extremes (see Annex 2) – W FP and FAO
have been working with the government, farmers
and other v ulnerable groups to identif y the best
strategies to improve climate resilience,
sustainabilit y and self-sufficiency. 294 Climate risk
analyses show that any inter vention should
consider longer-term projections for sea-level rise
and salt intrusion, as current inter ventions – in
areas where levels of food insecurit y and
undernutrition are high – do not necessarily align
with future climate risks. 295

New sources of knowledge beyond formal
research systems that include local indigenous
knowledge are also critical for agricultural
innovation systems. 301 For example, research

ENHANCING THE CONTRIBUTION OF NEGLECTED AND UNDERUTILIZED SPECIES (NUS)
TO FOOD SECURITY AND INCOME
by IFAD, worked with three types of NUS crops,
namely: Andean grains (such as quinoa and
amaranth); minor millets (such as finger millet, little
millet and barnyard millet); and medicinal and
aromatic plants (such as argel, caper, oregano and
mint). These were used to test innovative approaches
to sustainable conservation and cultivation by
incorporating local indigenous knowledge, and to
inform related research work on climate change and
its impact on local food production systems.
Using local indigenous knowledge and merging it
with novel cultivation practices, small family farm households
who cultivate NUS crops could benefit from stronger food
production systems, which can improve food security,
increase income-generating opportunities, and enhance
coping mechanisms against climate change.

Neglected and underutilized species (NUS) constitute a
large portfolio of plant genetic resources that include
cultivated, semi-domesticated or wild species not treated
as commodities. They are cultivated by rural
communities according to traditional knowledge and
practices, using low-cost inputs. Because NUS occupy
important niches and are adapted to local conditions,
they serve as a safety net for indigenous farmers
whenever staple crops fail during periods of stress or
following disasters. As they are often bred by breeders,
researched by agricultural scientists and promoted by
policy-makers, they could make substantial contributions
to income generation, resilience and adaption to climate
change among small-scale family farmers.

approach, which requires site-specific

climate-related shocks and stresses in a given
location. This approach allows for weaving
together risk mitigation and climate change

(ii) strengthening resilience and adaptation; and
(iii) reducing and/or eliminating GHG emissions.
CSA focuses on developing the technical, policy
and investment conditions to achieve resilient
and sustainable agricultural development for

change. 303 It also assesses the interactions

demonstrated that neglected and underutilized
species (NUS) can help contribute to increasing
food securit y, income and resilience to climate

The successful inclusion of local indigenous
knowledge into research for agricultural
innovation systems requires an interdisciplinar y
effort under the wider banner of climate ser vices,
involving meteorologists, agronomists,
nutritionists, communications specialists,
development practitioners and communities
themselves in the co-production of climate
information tailored to meet stakeholders’
needs. 302 It is important to identif y the right
communication channels so that people can
easily access this information and make
appropriate decisions.

There are certain well-known, site-specific
climate-smart technological solutions that have
been tested and are already supporting climate
resilience building. These include new crop

risks and shocks are not only stress-specific,
but also sector-specific and essentially
site-specific, meaning that replicating
inter ventions in different contexts requires a
careful examination of how better to
contextualize the practices to respond to the
specificities of each context.

varieties and livestock breeds; efficient water
management (including new water sources,
irrigation, drainage, water har vesting and saving
technologies, desalinization and storm- and
wastewater management); conser vation
agriculture; climate-proof food storage and
preser vation facilities; f lood and cyclone shelters;
and climate risksensitive infrastructures.
Deploying these solutions requires analysing and
identif ying climate risks and impacts as well as
costs, benefits, incentives and barriers to their
adoption. Many of these climate-smart
technological solutions also help reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 305

More efforts are needed in making information
and good practices on climate resilience
accessible to most v ulnerable households and
communities. This includes establishing
knowledge-sharing mechanisms that enable
people to participate in the design of
context-relevant inter ventions to enhance climate
resilience. Novel ways of sharing information
with communities include participator y videos,
which have proven effective in spreading
knowledge of successful climate adaptation
practices with others. 306

Adapting and reducing GHG emissions
through a climate-resilient food systems
approach broadens the range of opportunities
and facilitates consideration of systems-level
effects and interactions. It is critical to go
beyond a focus on agriculture and production
to consider the interlinked nature of
livelihoods and food systems and the
implications for building climate resilience as
part of a wide-ranging transformation of food
systems for improved nutrition and sustainable
healthy diets. In Malawi, for example, crop
diversification is an important adaptation
strateg y that – when implemented with a food
systems approach – can benefit food securit y,
health and nutrition while helping reduce the
v ulnerabilit y of small-scale family farmers to
income volatilit y resulting from climate
variabilit y and extremes (see Box 15).

Participatory approaches for local solutions
Supporting climate resilience-building efforts
requires site-specific solutions that are owned by
the communities that they intend to help.
A participator y, inclusive, equitable and
gender-based approach is critical to bringing
local stakeholders together to identif y needs
through a better understanding of the climate
v ulnerabilities and risks faced by communities
and individuals. Likewise, it is important to take
advantage of autonomous (i.e. local) knowledge
and practices when addressing climate variabilit y
and extremes. Engaging local people and
encouraging open communit y consultation when
designing and implementing inter ventions helps
to build communit y ownership and ensure
long-term sustainabilit y, while also taking into
account cultural and gender issues.

Knowledge generation and sharing with regard to
resilience good practices
Systematic documentation of good practices
for climate resilience should be planned at the
outset of the design of any inter vention.
Indicators should be defined not only to
monitor and evaluate impact but also to
capture the process of implementation in order
to understand why some solutions work over
others. Knowledge management platforms are
a valuable vehicle for countries and
communities within countries to share
lessons, experiences and good practices and to
support each other in accelerating
implementation of relevant, context-specific
climate resilience actions. It is worth noting
that solutions that specifically address climate

A range of locally appropriate climate-resilient
options should be designed and implemented
through inclusive and gender-sensitive
participator y processes. These should be present
throughout, beginning with the initial
v ulnerabilit y and risk analysis, continuing
through the prioritization of choices and moving
forward to the implementation of measures,
taking into account the availabilit y of local
resources and the anticipated costs and benefits
in the short and long term. 307 It is important to
maintain communit y engagement throughout »

CLIMATE-SMART AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES AND FOOD SYSTEMS:
THE CASE OF SMALL FAMILY FARM CROP DIVERSIFICATION IN MALAWI
improving food access. In Malawi, more diversified
cropping systems – particularly those that incorporate
legumes – have been shown to significantly reduce
crop income variability compared with maize
monocropping (see figure below).
Through crop diversification, farming households
can spread production and income risk over a wider
range of crops. Moreover, diversification can produce
agronomic benefits in terms of pest management and
soil quality and nutritional benefits by promoting
dietary diversity depending on the crop combination.
Though crop diversification can be an
important adaptation and risk reduction strategy,
to achieve climate resilience it needs to be
implemented with a food systems approach that
ensures functional and competitive private input
and output markets, and addresses other key
interlinked factors in the food systems.

In sub-Saharan Africa, many countries’ national food
security relies on a few staple crops, particularly
maize. This crop is produced mostly by small-scale
family farmers under rainfed conditions, which makes
households and national food security vulnerable to
climate variability and extremes.
As seen in this report, climate variability and
extremes can negatively impact on small family farm
incomes as agricultural production falls. For some
Malawian households food consumption declines not
only because of decreases in income but also
because households have less of their own food
production to consume.
Crop diversification is an important adaptation
and vulnerability reduction strategy that can, in the
context of increased climate variability and extremes,
help distribute risk, increase productivity and
stabilize incomes of small-scale family farmers, thus

PARTICIPATORY PLANT BREEDING TO INCREASE CROP YIELDS AND RESILIENCE IN IRAN
(ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF)
Losing agricultural biodiversity reduces the
opportunities to cope with future challenges, including
a changing climate. Biodiversity is also an important
driver for enhancing the resilience of small-scale family
farmers to climate change, drought, and pest and
disease outbreaks, among other things. In the Islamic
Republic of Iran, planting only a small number of
improved crop varieties in place of a mix of several
traditional varieties has resulted in the loss of genetic
diversity in agricultural systems. Thus, farmers need
seeds that are better-adapted to increased climate
variability and other climate shocks.
Traditional crop varieties represent a valuable
source of increased agricultural diversity as they have
evolved through a combination of adaptation to local
environments and generations of genetic selection. It
is widely recognized that traditional varieties often
have much greater resilience to drought and other
stresses, although they yield lower outputs in
favourable conditions. Furthermore, they often do not

need chemical pesticides and fertilizers and require
less water.
The Centre for Sustainable Development (CENESTA),
the International Center for Agricultural Research in the
Dry Areas (ICARDA), the Rice Research Institute of Iran,
the departments of agriculture in project provinces,
farmers and farm associations, along with IFAD,
introduced the concept of evolutionary participatory
plant breeding with the aim of increasing crop yields
and resiliency using site-specific approaches. In this
approach, farmers used the best seeds from field trial
plots combined with traditional varieties for the next
planting season to create a mix of varieties that were
highly regulated. After only one cultivation season, this
approach yielded greater results than cultivating only a
single crop variety. By growing this mixture of crop
varieties, the crops became more climate-resilient: the
increased diversity of their genes allowed them to evolve
and adapt to climate variability and unpredictable
weather patterns.

succeeded due to the committed participation
of different stakeholders from the outset. The

alerts for two extreme weather events in the

interact with stakeholders such as
decision-makers and farmers in exploring and
designing alternative sets of plausible future
scenarios and climate change adaptation schemes

In the Islamic Republic of Iran, an evolutionar y
participator y plant breeding approach
specifically designed to fit the local
environment has been successful in reducing
v ulnerabilities of small-scale farmers by
improving crop yields as well as increasing crop

Empowerment of women and vulnerable groups

the poor nutritional status of pregnant women or
adolescent girls who are more exposed to climate
impacts increases the risk that their children will
suffer from poor health outcomes. 314

Building resilience to climate variabilit y and
extremes requires gender-sensitive policies,
planning, budgets, technologies, practices and
processes accessible to both men and women
farmers. Although women comprise, on average,
43 percent of the agricultural labour force in
developing countries and are key for food
securit y and nutrition, they generally have less
access than men to productive resources and
opportunities. 310 Building resilience thus requires
a solid understanding of gender-based
differences and inter ventions that are risk- and
gender-responsive. The R4 Rural Resilience
Initiative (R4), launched by W FP and Oxfam
America in 2011, 311 shows the benefits of
gender-responsive programming in Ethiopia,
Malawi, Senegal and Zambia, where women are
becoming less v ulnerable to climate risks and
more empowered to support themselves and the
food securit y and nutrition of their families. This
is due to an integrated package of financial
ser vices and communit y assets used to address
climate variabilit y and extremes. An impact
evaluation found that households headed by
women in Ethiopia had the largest gains in
productivit y and farm investments and faced
fewer climate-related food shortages. 312

Acknowledging these risks to nutrition from
changing climate variabilit y and extremes is
critical in creating more effective safet y nets or
social protection schemes that are responsive to
climate risk. 315 Inter ventions should also consider
advocacy across all agencies and actors in the
public, private and civil societ y sectors to protect
and build coping and adaptation strategies for
women and other v ulnerable groups.

Integration of interventions to enhance climate
resilience of the entire food system
The more integrated sets of inter ventions are
within and across sectors, the better they are in
meeting household, communit y and institutional
needs in the face of climate variabilit y and
extremes. Coordination is a prerequisite in
ensuring people and institutions work across all
agriculture sectors as well as other sector such as
health, eduction, water and energ y. This is
particularly the case for enhancing the climate
resilience of the food system as a whole, thus
contributing to healthy diets for all.
Nevertheless, while there is immense potential
for synergies, the potential trade-offs also need
to be considered.

In capture fisheries, particularly in sub-Saharan
Africa, women are predominantly engaged in
processing, trading and selling. The estimated 56
million women in this sector are constrained by
deplorable working conditions, poor market and
transportation infrastructure, limited financial
and business ser vices, competition for limited
catches, and variable supply. Investments that
strengthen women’s empowerment in this sector
have been proven to lead to improvements in
nutrition and health of women and their
families. 313

Much of the work on DRR and CCA relies on
strengthening climate risk assessment
capacities within and across sectors. The ICN2
Framework for Action is meant for use by
governments and other stakeholders to g uide
cross-sectoral implementation. The Work
Programme of the UN Decade of Action on
Nutrition emphasizes priorit y actions in areas
that are entr y points to integrating climate
change and food securit y questions into
health risk assessments. These include
sustainable, resilient food systems for healthy
diets and safe and supportive environments
for nutrition at all ages. This points to a
unique opportunit y to address the challenge
of existing fragmented global policy processes
and the need to forge synergies for better
dialog ue among climate, humanitarian,
development, nutrition and health actors in
the spirit of the universal SDGs.

The needs of other v ulnerable groups should also
be at the forefront of policy responses. Infants
and young children are particularly v ulnerable to
climate shocks, which can diminish their food
securit y and nutrition, thus limiting their future
opportunities. Children are notably affected if,
for example, such shocks undermine their school
performance, decrease their earning potential, or
expose them to a higher risk of diet-related
non-communicable diseases later in life. Further,

PART 2 THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

The interconnected nature of DRR/DRM, CCA
and the environment–food–health nexus means
that there is potential for scaling up solutions
that generate co-benefits for the environment,
climate, nutrition and health. This nexus requires
political dialog ue and advocacy to enhance social
participation and engagement of a wide range of
actors, including environmental groups,
consumer and health advocates, health care
providers, farmers and farm workers, large and
small private sector entities and citizens.

livelihood practices avoid jeopardizing people’s
basic nutritional food basket. 319
However, safeg uarding nutrition before or
when climate variabilit y and extremes strike
will have to go hand in hand with a variet y of
risk reduction and adaptation options that
governments and communities can implement
to protect public health. As part of efforts to
ensure universal health coverage, measures to
strengthen the resilience of health systems in
order to manage climate risks include:
considering partnerships between DRR actors,
NGOs, the private sector (while avoiding
conf lict of interest) and national health
systems within DRR plans; enhancing early
warning systems and emergency preparedness
for rapid response and recover y from extreme
climate events; and protecting critical health
infrastructure from extreme climate events. 320
It is important to have stronger sur veillance
systems in place that can identif y food safet y
issues and infectious diseases, so that control
systems can rapidly and accurately notif y
populations at local, national and
international levels.

Given that climate variabilit y and extremes
are affecting the quantit y, diversit y and
qualit y of food available and consumed – thus
potentially undermining nutrition – healthy
diets need urgent protection. Climate-smart
technologies can support food diversification,
incentivize the production of more
nutrient-dense foods, reduce the impact of
climate-related stresses on crop and livestock
qualit y, and, more broadly, help improve the
efficiency and resilience of the food system.
Integrating climate and food securit y questions
into health risk assessments is also important in
providing early signals for potential outbreaks of
disease, thus triggering early action. There are
significant benefits to coordinating needs
assessments in livelihoods, nutrition, health and
other sectors to save more lives and protect and
restore more livelihoods. 316 Such assessments are
already identified in key humanitarian indicators
for countr y teams to create a composite, ongoing
picture of emergencies. 317

Furthermore, investment in universal health
coverage that both ensures primar y health care
inter ventions and builds communit y resilience is
key. Funding needs to address the determinants
of environmental and social health (such as
housing safet y and air, water and food qualit y)
under various climate conditions; improve social
welfare in emergency situations; and provide
essential nutrition actions, 321 including screening
for and managing cases of child and adult
malnutrition. It is equally important to take into
account the diverse composition of modern
communities (including migrants and different
ethnicities) as well as differences in
health-seeking behaviours.

Nutrition-sensitive and risk-responsive social
protection programmes can also safeg uard
nutrition before and during climate shocks,
especially if they allow households or
nutritionally v ulnerable groups – such as young
children and pregnant and lactating mothers – to
be able to afford nutrient-rich locally produced
foods and maintain dietar y diversit y before,
during and after a shock. Climate risk strategies
need to include local diet qualit y goals, which
can be achieved when there is a better
understanding of: how longer-term climate
change will affect the suitabilit y of local crops in
a specific site; whether access to fresh fruit and
vegetables, meat and dair y products will be
disrupted; 318 and what new agricultural and

Dependable, multi-year and large-scale funding
streams and mechanisms
Integration of short-, medium- and long-term
inter ventions and actors to achieve climate
resilience also requires dependable, multi-year
and large-scale funding. Evidence shows that lack
of funding has resulted in a decline in
development gains following the impact of
climate extremes and variabilit y. Humanitarian

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

responses present many examples where
slow-onset climate shocks have been identified
well ahead of time, but a lack of early-action
funding resulted in devastating impacts on
people. The most salient recent example is the
famine in Somalia following a drought across the
Horn of Africa and the negative impacts for many
food-insecure populations during and after the El
Niño event in 2015 –2016.

Overcoming these financial constraints is
important for successful programmes to achieve
scale, as v ulnerabilit y reduction measures across
and within sectors are priorities that particularly
require largescale financing (Box 17). Climate
resilience programmes generally need dependable
multi-year funding to succeed and show evidence
of results in order to obtain further investment.

Specific tools and interventions that address
climate risks

Responses to humanitarian crises – those arising
from a combination of climate variabilit y and
extremes and political and social fracturing,
among other factors – have cost a multiple of
what they would have if investments had been
made at an early stage when the crises were
known to be developing. 322 This makes a clear
economic arg ument for investment in multi-year
resilience programming. The net cost of late
response is estimated to be five to seven times
higher than multi-year resilience building. 323
A study of W FP’s response to the 2004–2005 food
crisis in the Niger found that the cost of
assistance to a person ten months after the initial
appeal was three times the cost at just four
months – a threefold increase in costs within a
six-month period. 324

The following set of tools and inter ventions
is based on approaches promoted by the
Sendai Framework for DRR (SFDRR) that
have been adopted and adapted to address
climate risks that pose challenges to people’s
livelihoods, food securit y and nutrition. They
t y pically encompass the cross-cutting
features outlined above but deser ve
particular attention here to highlight how
they can significantly contribute to building
climate resilience.

Climate risk monitoring and early warning systems
Climate risk monitoring and early warning
systems are among the most well-known tools
available to governments and international
agencies. They can prove to be essential in
monitoring multiple hazards – and climate
hazards more specifically – and in predicting the
likelihood of climate risks to livelihoods, food
securit y and nutrition. They are particularly
useful when timely alerts help trigger accurate
decision-making and early actions at all
institutional levels, including in communities.

Financial constraints have limited much Early
Warning/Early Action (EW EA) to date, with
dire implications for food securit y and
nutrition. An ODI study highlights the
weakness of DRR financing to drought-affected
countries across two decades in Eritrea, Kenya,
Malawi, the Niger and Zimbabwe, where over
100 million people were affected by drought,
but their combined DRR financing was only
USD 116 million. 325 Evidence from the 1998
f loods in Bangladesh demonstrated nutritional
impacts resulting from worsening food access
and caregiving practices, thus increasing
children’s exposure to contaminants and
malnutrition. 326 During the same crisis,
government programme responses before the
f loods were shown to be more effective in
protecting the well-being of children than
responses after the f loods. 327 Gaps in climate
funding have also been outlined by the
UNFCCC, which estimates the need for
adaptation finance in developing countries at
between USD 28 billion and 67 billion by 2030
– far outweighing current available funds. 328

Early Warning Early Action (EW EA) systems
focus on consolidating available forecasting
information and triggers that put in place
preparative and early actions to reduce the impact
of a range of different hazards, including climate
extremes. 329 Knowledge-sharing mechanisms for
v ulnerabilit y reduction are also important in
preparing both decision-makers and communities
to implement early actions for projected shocks
and changes. 330
In anticipation of 2015–2016 El Niño impacts, WFP
used seasonal climate forecasts to trigger early
action in vulnerable communities in Zimbabwe. It
promoted the cultivation of drought-tolerant small

INFRASTRUCTURE AND NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS
drought, floods and storms and sea level rises; and
(ii) provide essential ecosystem services such as fresh
water, clean air, fertile soil, pollination and
biodiversity, which contribute to fighting hunger and
building resilient livelihoods, and are also crucial to
sustaining the food system and life as a whole.
Working with nature involves implementing actions
to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or
modified agromarine ecosystems. These systems
simultaneously provide defence and life support
benefits, including water and food for the poor and for
the rich across borders, thus reducing food insecurity
and poverty and enhancing climate-resilient livelihoods
and food systems at large.
Climate-resilient and sustainable agricultural
livelihoods are possible and can yield mitigation,
adaptation and resilience co-benefits.
Around the world, it is essential to support countries
in sustainably increasing their agricultural productivity
while at the same time reducing climate risks. For
example, the Rome-Based Agencies (RBA) work in the
Corredor Seco in Central America region to increase
the resilience of small-scale producers through
ecosystems management and risk-informed,
agro-ecological good practices.
Building climate resilience by working with nature
implies reshaping investments at scale in healthy and
diverse terrestrial and marine ecosystems that
perform disaster risk reduction and climate change
adaptation functions and are central for securing
productive food systems and fighting hunger.

Investments in vulnerability reduction measures (in line
with DRR prevention and impact reduction actions, as
per the Sendai Framework for DRR) need to be stepped
up dramatically across and within sectors. These
measures – also known as climate change adaptation
and resilience measures (in line with Paris Agreement
language) or simply CSA – include climate-resilient
good practices at farm levels as well as climate-proof
infrastructure and nature-based solutions.
Examples of vulnerability reduction measures
against climate variability and extremes have already
been presented in Box 14, 15 and 16 and others are
found in Box 18. These shock-, sector- and context- or
site-specific measures include: the use of adapted
quality seed varieties and conservation agriculture for
the crop sector; the improvement of resilient livestock
breeds; the building of water points and cisterns for
improved water management and conservation; and
agroforestry and coastal mangrove protection and
management. There is a wealth of documented
climate-resilient good practices for agriculture, food
security and nutrition; some of these are available on
the Knowledge Sharing Platform on Resilience (KORE)1
or other places.
Vulnerability reduction measures also include the
implementation of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) as
reflected in the outcome document of the COP23
high-level event on resilience2 where it was stressed
that healthy and diverse agro-marine ecosystems play
a double role for a climate-resilient planet, as they:
(i) buffer the impact of climate hazards such as

grains before the peak of the El Niño event, thus
reducing crop losses and staving off hunger. 331
Likewise, in 2017 FAO used early warning
information to prompt early action in Ethiopia,
Kenya and Somalia, lessening the impact of
drought on pastoralists by providing thousands of
vulnerable families with livestock feed, water and
veterinary treatment ahead of the crisis peak. 332

When integrated into other food securit y,
nutritional or wider povert y-reduction
inter ventions, these systems also represent an
opportunit y to protect lives and livelihood assets
by helping to g uarantee food access and stabilit y
of food prices. This can include import–export
reg ulations that reduce speculative behaviour
through the release of stored food stocks, subsidy

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

programmes for rural incomes, or cash
distribution and/or social protection systems,
each targeting v ulnerable groups at risk of
exposure to climate variabilit y and extremes.

In its work with emergency preparedness and
response, W FP integrates climate information
into early warning systems, using
groundbreaking technolog y to help forecast
emergencies and respond quickly with qualit y
programmes to deliver life-saving food
assistance. In 2017, W FP provided in-kind food,
vouchers, cash and nutrition support to 9 million
people affected by climate-related disasters in the
Caribbean, the Horn of Africa and in South Asia.
In an effort to deliver on the Core Commitments
for Children in the context of climate shocks and
other emergency settings, UNICEF has developed
specific g uidance on the preparedness planning
process focusing on children. 336 Emergency
preparedness is an important approach because
v ulnerabilit y reduction measures themselves
cannot always avert a crisis.

Integrating climate risk monitoring into food
securit y and nutrition monitoring is also ver y
important. An example is the multi-stakeholder
Integrated Food Securit y Phase Classification
(IPC), which is a set of analytical tools and
processes to analyse and classif y the severit y of
acute and chronic food insecurit y, specifically
designed to provide actionable information to
decision-makers in both emergency and
development contexts. The IPC analytical
framework shown earlier (see Figure 28) has at its
core the monitoring and analysis of acute and
ongoing events or hazards – including climate
variabilit y and extreme climate events – and the
analysis of their impact on the food securit y and
nutrition status of the population. Not only does
the IPC provide actionable information on
current conditions but it also identifies the risk
factors to monitor – including seasonal rainfall
patterns and the progression of climate events
such as droughts – and generates food securit y
projections to inform early warning and action.
More than 40 countries worldwide are now
implementing the IPC, including countries in
Africa, Asia, Central America and the Caribbean,
and the Near East. 333

On the other side of the coin, emergency
response to climate-related disasters not only
saves lives and livelihoods but is also crucial in
ensuring that people do not become irreversibly
destitute and dependent on international
assistance. Emergency responses should aim to
enable people to quickly become self-reliant and
resume livelihood activities including local food
production and income generation. 337 Disasters
can even offer new opportunities to “build back
better”, whereby people can be assisted to
transition from unsustainable practices towards
more risk-sensitive and viable management of
resources that enhance resilient and sustainable
livelihoods.

Emergency preparedness and response
Another important set of tools falls into the
categor y of emergency preparedness and
response, which are t ypical humanitarian
actions. Emergency preparedness is an essential
element of DRR, helping to reduce the impact of a
disaster by building the knowledge and capacities
of governments, organizations, communities and
individuals to effectively anticipate, respond to
and recover from the impacts of disasters
(whether they be likely, imminent or current). 334
Measures can include early warning; contingency
planning; establishment of multisectoral and
sectoral emergency humanitarian coordination
mechanisms; exercise management; health
ser vice and facilit y preparedness; allocation of
food, seeds and grazing strategic reser ves;
establishment of safe storage facilities for seeds
and har vest; livestock shelters; and safe and
hygienic food preparation facilities. 335

In the aftermath of Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu in
2015, FAO assisted in the design and building of
stronger and safer fishing boats and the
introduction of more sustainable and safer
fishing practices. 338 Current policies and public
and private sector investments in capture fisheries
and aquaculture are typically framed around their
potential poverty and food insecurity reduction
but are rarely viewed through a nutritionsensitive lens. 339 Supporting households in the
aftermath of a climate shock through timely and
context-relevant inter ventions can save
livelihoods, which is essential for building
climate resilience. For example, households in
Kyrg yzstan who were able to restock their herds
after a harsh winter in 2012 that killed many
livestock were able to increase their food »

HOUSEHOLDS AFFECTED BY CLIMATE SHOCKS WHO ARE ABLE TO RESTOCK OR ACCESS

an option for similar cases. Moreover, facilitating
access to veterinary services and vaccines could
mitigate the short-term adverse effects of shocks.
Beside immediate livelihood protection
interventions, public and private interventions to
reduce vulnerabilities in the livestock sector are
important for longer-term resilience and sustainability.
These measures may include preventing animal losses
through the improvement of storage capacities that
increase the availability of winter forage in lean
winters. Actions should also be combined with efforts
to improve the genetic pool of livestock species
through breeding programmes that select for resiliency
traits. These more resilient animals can be
incorporated into local herds and distributed to
households living in areas prone to climate shocks and
harsh conditions, thereby preparing them for climate
variability and extremes.

In 2012, a harsh winter in Kyrgyzstan caused many
livestock to die, contributing to a significant decline in
herding families’ food consumption expenditure.
Households who were able to replenish their herds
after the shock experienced a 10 percent increase in
food consumption expenditure in the medium term
(four years after the shock) compared to households hit
by the shock who were not able to restock (see figure
below). Households who had greater access to public
veterinary services also reported higher food
consumption expenditures compared to households
with insufficient access to these services.
This evidence highlights the importance of
supporting households in the aftermath of a climate
shock through timely and context-relevant interventions
to save livelihoods and build resilience. Interventions
using cash transfer programmes or ad hoc insurance
schemes that facilitate restocking investments could be

did not (Box 18).

Vulnerability reduction measures
Vulnerability reduction measures combine disaster
risk reduction and climate change adaptation
practices aiming to prevent and mitigate the
impact of climate events and variability at
community, farm and agro-ecosystem levels.
These include the application of climate-resilient
and climate-smart agricultural good practices as
well as climate-proofed infrastructures and
nature-based solutions and thus need investments
at scale. Several examples of vulnerability
reduction interventions are given in Boxes 14, 15, 16,
17 and 18.

A joint W FP–Bangladesh Government
programme – called Enhancing Resilience (ER)
of rural poor communities exposed to climate
shocks – has used safet y nets to allow
participants over the course of two years to build
communit y assets and take part in exchange for
cash and food. According to an impact
evaluation, participants now are less likely
to engage in negative coping strategies than
non-participants. 344 In 2017, FAO provided a
package in Somalia consisting of cash transfers,
qualit y local seeds, land preparation and
irrigation support, training and safe storage
equipment. This helped families buy food and
meet immediate needs while growing food over
the medium to longer term. 345

Shock-responsive social protection, risk transfers
and forecast-based financing
Social protection mechanisms can help to reduce
disaster risk v ulnerabilit y and strengthen
livelihoods against the impact of a range of
shocks, enabling more people to anticipate risks,
bounce back better and faster 340 and become
more resilient.

Risk transfers can also help significantly reduce
(though not fully eliminate) the negative impacts
of climate variabilit y and extremes. Vulnerable
people including small-scale family farmers are
often faced with significant uncertaint y, which
prompts them to invest in low-risk production
assets and technolog y at the expense of
profitabilit y or to allocate labour into less
profitable off-farm activities. These risk-adverse
activities maintain and can even worsen farmer
families’ v ulnerable conditions with regard to
food securit y and nutrition.

To specifically help individuals and households
prepare for and recover from climate variability
and extremes, it is necessary to build in the
element of “shock-responsiveness” or
“adaptiveness” in existing instruments such as
cash transfers, pensions and employment
guarantee schemes. Importantly, all types of social
protection should also be nutrition-sensitive,
protect against all forms of malnutrition, explicitly
incorporate nutrition objectives and target the
nutritionally vulnerable. 341

Recent innovative solutions of risk transfer, such
as climate risk insurance and forecast-based
financing, are helping to formally or informally
shift the financial consequences of particular
risks from one part y to another, at the level of the
household, communit y, enterprise or state. 346

Safet y nets are a subset of social protection and
can be used as direct social assistance
instruments for the poor with the aim of
responding to and managing climate-related
disasters. They include distributing food
assistance; subsidizing prices for foodstuffs;
providing vouchers, coupons or school meals; and
providing support through cash transfers or
public works activities. The choice of an
instrument or combination of instruments
depends on the context and goal. 342 USAID has
obser ved that a package of early humanitarian
response and safet y nets is about 30 percent more
efficient than t y pical humanitarian aid in Africa,

Climate risk insurance protects people,
businesses and states from the adverse effects
of climate variabilit y and extremes and reduces
the burden of the individual, as risks are borne
by defined communities, even before potential
damage occurs. 347 An example is the
W FP-Oxfam’s Rural Resilience Initiative (R4),
which since 2016 has provided approximately
37 000 farmers in Ethiopia, Malawi, Senegal
and Zambia with index-based insurance
| 109 |

PART 2 THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

climate events. R4 includes international
reinsurers, local-level micro-insurance
companies and government policies, and
implements a climate and weather insurance
social protection programme. In Ethiopia,
farmers can buy insurance by working
additional days in the countr y’s largest public
works programme, the Productive Safet y Net
Programme (PSNP). Between 2015 and 2016,
over USD 450 000 in insurance payouts were
distributed to small-scale family farmers
participating in R4 in Ethiopia, Malawi and
Senegal, in response to the dr y conditions
caused by El Niño.

policies and strategies are compartmentalized
into several dialog ues as noted above must be
addressed, particularly to support efforts at
countr y and communit y level. At countr y level,
well-established legislation, institutional
structures, policies and plans can create an
enabling environment to limit the impact of
climate-related disasters and climate
variabilit y and build climate resilience. A mix
of different tools – including reg ulation, fiscal
instruments, investments in research and
knowledge dissemination, support for market
accessibilit y, improvements in infrastructure,
and social protection – is seen as being more
effective and sustainable in creating a pathway
for climate resilience than a single
inter vention. 349

Forecast-based financing programmes are also
available to support preemptive, rapid
responses to climate disasters by releasing
humanitarian funding, using forecast
information for pre-agreed activities, or using
Early Action Protocols (EAPs) to define
associated roles and responsibilities to reduce
risks and enhance preparedness and
response. 348 During the 2015 –2016 El Niño, for
example, W FP’s Food Securit y Climate
Resilience Facilit y (FoodSECuRE) used seasonal
climate forecasts to trigger contingency funding
for communit y-level resilience activities before
the anticipated shock (drought) occurred,
thereby helping preser ve food securit y. In
Zimbabwe, W FP and FAO, with the Ministr y of
Agriculture’s extension ser vice (Agritex), field
tested the FoodSECuRE Early Action modalit y
in five wards of the Mwenezi district to bolster
the resilience capacit y of affected small family
farmer households by promoting the cultivation
of drought-tolerant small grains.

Collaboration between the public sector, the
private sector and communities is key to ensuring
comprehensive, coherent and complementar y
actions. The Pacific SIDS, which are particularly
v ulnerable to tropical cyclones, droughts and
f loods (Box 10), provide a good example of climate
risk and disaster governance at the national and
regional level within the context of sustainable
development (Box 19).
In Vanuatu, for example, there is some
integration between sectors on managing climate
shocks and climate change, such as national
clusters – including the food securit y cluster, the
health cluster and the gender and social
protection cluster – that have representatives
from different government ministries and NGO
and CSO partners. Negotiations are currently
underway between the Ministr y of Agriculture
and the Ministr y of Health to develop a
Memorandum of Understanding to jointly work
on climate issues. However, several important
barriers to operationalizing these governance
structures exist and need to be addressed.

Climate risk and disaster governance
Improving agriculture livelihoods, food securit y,
nutrition and health in the face of climate
variabilit y and extremes will only be possible by
strengthening governance structures in the
environment–food–health nexus. This implies the
inclusion of immediate and long-term
agriculture, food securit y, nutrition and health
considerations into climate resilience policies,
legislation and the larger enabling environment
for governance. In this way only will the
cross-cutting factors discussed above lead to
successful policies and practices addressing
climate risks across and within sectors.

One of the most significant challenges is
limited local capacit y. Vanuatu has a small
human resource base that is already widely
stretched without the added burden of
addressing climate risks, both short- and
long-term. Long-term strategic climate shock
and climate change management planning is
difficult in a countr y overwhelmed by a high

In addition, the Pacific Resilience Partnership (PRP)
was established to provide the governance structure for
FRDP implementation support and monitoring.2 Through
the crisis and disaster governance structures and
frameworks, different members are applying high-quality
scientific and technical knowledge and innovation on
DRR/DRM and CCA at the community and country level
to increase the resilience of livelihoods.
Work also includes assisting gender mainstreaming
activities, developing policies and legislation, and
improving the capacity of governments and civil
society for advocacy and for monitoring the
implementation of human rights standards. The Pacific
region also possesses an intricate network of national
institutions and regional initiatives that complement
each other. For example, the Online Climate Outlook
Forum (OCOF) offers a forum for Pacific Island
Meteorological Services; and the Pacific Catastrophe
Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI)
facility was established in June 2016 by the Pacific
Islands’ Ministers of Finance to put the Pacific countries
at the forefront of efforts to further expand disaster risk
finance.3 The Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pilot
was introduced to provide parametric catastrophe
insurance against tropical cyclones and earthquakes,
demonstrating that risk insurance is a viable
vulnerability reduction measure for the region. Thanks
to risk diversification and economies of scale derived
from risk pooling across multiple Pacific SIDS, this
initiative has been shown to reduce the cost of
reinsurance by up to 50 percent compared to
individual purchases of comparable coverage.4

The Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) has
been helping to support climate change adaptation
and disaster risk governance in the Pacific SIDS.
SPC is the largest scientific and technical international
organization in the Pacific, working at both the
regional and national level. It brings together the
leadership and guidance of member countries and
territories for the design and implementation of
multisectoral responses aligned to national priorities,
including application of high-quality scientific and
technical knowledge and innovation on DRR and CCA
at the community and country level.
Their work includes providing assistance for gender
mainstreaming activities, developing policies and
legislation, and improving the capacity of governments
and civil society for advocacy and for monitoring the
implementation of human rights standards.1
At the regional level, the Framework for Resilient
Development in the Pacific (FRDP) 2017–2030
supports the overall objective of strengthening the
resilience of Pacific Island Communities to the impacts
of slow- and sudden-onset natural hazards. The FRDP
identifies three goals linking humanitarian and
development interventions:
1. strengthened integrated risk management to
enhance climate and disaster resilience;
2. low carbon development; and
3. strengthened disaster preparedness, response
and recovery.

PART 2 THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

2.5

OVERALL CONCLUSION

increased climate variabilit y and extremes. They
can be g uided by existing global policy platforms
whereby climate resilience is an important
element: climate change (governed by the
UNFCCC and the 2015 Paris Agreement), disaster
risk reduction (the Sendai Framework on Disaster
Risk Reduction), humanitarian emergency
response (The 2016 World Humanitarian Summit
and the Grand Bargain), improved nutrition and
healthy diets (the Second International
Conference on Nutrition [ICN2] and the UN
Decade of Action on Nutrition 2016 –2025) and
development as part of the overarching 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development.

This second and final part of the report sends
a clear message that climate variabilit y and
exposure to more complex, frequent and
intense climate extremes are threatening to
erode and reverse gains made in ending
hunger and malnutrition. Evidence shows
that, for many countries, recent increases in
hunger are associated with extreme climate
events, especially where there is both high
exposure to climate extremes and high
v ulnerabilit y related to agriculture and
livelihood systems.

However, it is important to ensure better
integration of these global policy platforms to
ensure actions across and within sectors such
as environment, food, agriculture and health,
pursue coherent objectives and actions.
Challenges include poorly defined
institutional roles between different
ministries, capacit y gaps, compartmentalized
approaches and actions, adaptation and risk
management constraints, and a lack of
technical capacit y and data. These challenges
are magnified by the comprehensiveness of
livelihoods and food systems and the
interrelated nature of climate, food securit y,
nutrition and health issues.

Climate variabilit y and extremes — in addition
to conf lict and violence in some parts of the
world — are a key driver behind the recent rises
in global hunger identified in Part 1 of the
report and one of the leading causes of severe
food crises. They are negatively impacting
livelihoods and all dimensions of food securit y
(availabilit y, access, utilization and stabilit y), as
well as contributing to the other underlying
causes of malnutrition related to child care and
feeding, health ser vices and environmental
health. The risk of food insecurit y and
malnutrition is greater nowadays because
livelihoods and livelihood assets – especially of
the poor – are more exposed and v ulnerable to
climate variabilit y and extremes. What can be
done to prevent this threat from eroding and
reversing gains made in ending hunger and
malnutrition over recent years?

The success of climate resilience policies,
programmes and practices requires renewed
efforts and new approaches that help people
anticipate, absorb and adapt to climate variabilit y
and extremes. There are a number of
cross-cutting factors that are critical, as well as
tools and inter ventions that are adaptable to
specific contexts:
 Cross-cutting factors that inf luence the whole
livelihoods and food system including climate
risk assessments, science and interdisciplinar y
knowledge, participator y and inclusive
approaches, a user-focused approach centred
on climate-v ulnerable groups, as well as
dependable, multi-year and large-scale funding
for stepping up climate-resilient investments
for agriculture (including crop, livestock,
fisheries, aquaculture, and forestr y subsectors),
food securit y and nutrition.
 A set of tools and interventions that makes it
possible to implement climate resilience

This second part of the report sends an urgent
call out to accelerate and scale up actions to
strengthen resilience and adaptive capacit y to
climate variabilit y and extremes. There is a
pressing need to increase resilience in a broad
sense – i.e. resilience of people’s agricultural
livelihoods, food systems and nutrition
through climate resilience strategies,
programmes and investments that address not
only the direct impacts but also the underlying
v ulnerabilities, which in most cases are
aggravated by the changing nature of climate
variabilit y and extremes.
National and local governments are facing
challenges in tr ying to identif y measures to

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

These policy directions are essential to respond
to this report’s urgent call to accelerate and scale
up actions to strengthen resilience and adaptive
capacit y to climate variabilit y and extremes.
Otherwise the goals of ending hunger and
malnutrition in all forms by 2030 (SDG Targets
2.1 and 2.2) along with other goals – such as
taking action to combat climate change and its
impacts (SDG13) – will remain elusive. n

food-deficit countries (LIFDCs) (from 4.9 to

levels of consumption, although the gap is
narrowing. A sizeable and growing share of fish
consumed in developed countries consists of
imports, owing to steady demand and declining
domestic fisher y production. In developing
countries, fish consumption tends to be based on
locally and seasonally available products, with
supply driving the fish chain. However, fuelled

China has been responsible for most of the
growth in fish availabilit y, owing to the dramatic
expansion in its fish production, particularly from
aquaculture. Its per capita apparent fish
consumption also increased an average annual
rate of 6.0 percent in the period 1990 –2010 to
about 35.1 kg in 2010. Annual per capita fish
supply in the rest of the world was about 15.4 kg
in 2010 (11.4 kg in the 1960s and 13.5 kg in the
1990s).

A portion of 150 g of fish can provide about
50 – 60 percent of an adult’s daily protein
requirements. In 2010, fish accounted for
16.7 percent of the global population’s intake of
animal protein and 6.5 percent of all protein
consumed. Moreover, fish provided more than
2.9 billion people with almost 20 percent of their
intake of animal protein, and 4.3 billion people
with about 15 percent of such protein. Fish
proteins can represent a crucial nutritional
component in some densely populated countries
where total protein intake levels may be low.

Regional and subregional estimates were included when more than 50 percent of population was covered. To reduce the margin of error, estimates are presented as three-year averages.
FAO estimate of the percentage of people in the total population living in households where at least one adult has been found to be food insecure. To reduce the impact of year-to-year sampling variability, estimates are presented as three-year averages. Country-level
results are presented only for those countries for which estimates are based on official national data (Ecuador, Ghana, Malawi, Republic of Korea, Saint Lucia, Seychelles and the United States of America) or as provisional estimates, based on FAO Voices of the Hungry data
collected through the Gallup World Poll, for countries whose national statistical authorities (NSAs) provided permission to publish them. Note that consent to publication does not necessarily imply validation of the estimate by the NSAs and that the estimate is subject to
revision as soon as suitable data from official national sources are available. Global, regional and subregional aggregates reflect data collected in approximately 150 countries.
3
For regional estimates, values correspond to the model predicted estimate for the year 2017. For countries, the latest data available from 2013 to 2017 are used.
4
For regional estimates, values correspond to the model predicted estimate for the year 2012. For countries, the latest data available from 2005 to 2012 are used.
5
Anaemia data for 2016 for countries in the WHO European region are undergoing validation and thus are subject to change. The WHO European region includes: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,
Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of
Moldova, Romania, Russian Federation, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tajikistan, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and Uzbekistan.
6
Regional estimates are included when more than 50 percent of population is covered. For countries, the latest data available from 2005 to 2012 are used.
7
Regional estimates are included when more than 50 percent of population is covered. For countries, the latest data available from 2013 to 2018 are used.
* Wasting, stunting and overweight under 5 years of age, and exclusive breastfeeding regional aggregates exclude Japan.
a
The Central Agency for Public Mobilization & Statistics (CAPMAS) reports an estimate of severe food insecurity of 1.3 percent for 2015, based on HIECS data, using the WFP consolidated approach for reporting indicators of food security. Note that the two estimates are not directly
comparable due to different definitions of “severe food insecurity“.
b
Consecutive low population coverage; interpret with caution.
c
Based on a combination of official national data and FAO data.
d
The Government of Ireland reports estimates of the “Proportion of the population at risk of food poverty” produced by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) as part of the Survey on Income and Social Conditions (SILC) 2015, as a
proxy for SDG indicator 2.1.2. See http://irelandsdg.geohive.ie/datasets/sdg-2.1.2-prevalence-of-moderate-or-severe-food-insecurity-in-the-population-based-on-the-food-insecurity-experience-scale-nuts-3-2015-ireland-cso-amp-osi

Global fisher y production in marine waters was
82.6 million tonnes in 2011 and 79.7 million
tonnes in 2012 FIGURE 3 In these years,
18 countries (11 in Asia) caught more than an
average of one million tonnes per year,
accounting for more than 76 percent of global
marine catches. The Northwest and Western
Central Pacific are the areas with highest and
still-growing catches. Production in the
Southeast Pacific is always strongly inf luenced by
climatic variations. In the Northeast Pacific, the
total catch in 2012 was the same as in 2003. The
long-standing growth in catch in the Indian
Ocean continued in 2012. After three years
(2007– 09) when piracy negatively affected fishing
in the Western Indian Ocean, tuna catches have

Global capture fisher y production of 93.7 million
tonnes in 2011 was the second-highest ever
(93.8 million tonnes in 1996). Moreover,
excluding anchoveta catches, 2012 showed a new
maximum production (86.6 million tonnes).
Nevertheless, such fig ures represent a
continuation of the generally stable situation
reported previously.

A portion of 150 g of fish can provide about
50 – 60 percent of an adult’s daily protein
requirements. In 2010, fish accounted for
16.7 percent of the global population’s intake of
animal protein and 6.5 percent of all protein
consumed. Moreover, fish provided more than
2.9 billion people with almost 20 percent of their
intake of animal protein, and 4.3 billion people
with about 15 percent of such protein. Fish
proteins can represent a crucial nutritional
component in some densely populated countries
where total protein intake levels may be low.

Despite the surge in annual per capita apparent
fish consumption in developing regions (from
5.2 kg in 1961 to 17.8 kg in 2010) and low-income
food-deficit countries (LIFDCs) (from 4.9 to
10.9 kg), developed regions still have higher
levels of consumption, although the gap is
narrowing. A sizeable and growing share of fish
consumed in developed countries consists of
imports, owing to steady demand and declining
domestic fisher y production. In developing
countries, fish consumption tends to be based on
locally and seasonally available products, with
supply driving the fish chain. However, fuelled
by rising domestic income and wealth, consumers

in emerging economies are experiencing a
diversification of the t y pes of fish available
owing to an increase in fisher y imports.

China has been responsible for most of the
growth in fish availabilit y, owing to the dramatic
expansion in its fish production, particularly from
aquaculture. Its per capita apparent fish
consumption also increased an average annual
rate of 6.0 percent in the period 1990 –2010 to
about 35.1 kg in 2010. Annual per capita fish
supply in the rest of the world was about 15.4 kg
in 2010 (11.4 kg in the 1960s and 13.5 kg in the
1990s).

Global fish production has grown steadily in the
last five decades FIGURE 1 with food fish supply
increasing at an average annual rate of
3.2 percent, outpacing world population growth
at 1.6 percent. World per capita apparent fish
consumption increased from an average of 9.9 kg
in the 1960s to 19.2 kg in 2012 (preliminar y
estimate) TABLE 1 AND FIGURE 2 all data
presented are subject to rounding). This
impressive development has been driven by a
combination of population growth, rising
incomes and urbanization, and facilitated by the
strong expansion of fish production and more
efficient distribution channels.

METHODOLOGICAL
NOTES

Minimum dietary energy requirements (MDER): Human
energ y requirements for individuals in a given
sex/age class are determined on the basis of
normative requirements for basic metabolic rate
(BMR) per kilogram of body mass, multiplied by
the ideal weight that a healthy person of that
class will have, given his or her height. 352 The
resulting values are multiplied by a coefficient of
physical activit y level (PAL) to take into account
physical activit y. Given that both healthy BMIs
and PALs var y within groups of active and
healthy individuals of the same sex and age, only
a range of energ y requirements can be computed
for each sex and age group of the population. The
MDER for the total population is the weighted
average of the lower bounds of the energ y
requirement ranges for each sex and age group,
with the shares of the population in each group
as weights.

UNDERNOURISHMENT
Definition: Undernourishment is defined as the
condition in which an individual’s habitual food
consumption is insufficient to provide the
amount of dietar y energ y required to maintain a
normal, active, healthy life.
How it is reported: The indicator is reported as the
prevalence of undernourishment (PoU), which is
an estimate of the percentage of individuals in
the total population that are in a condition of
undernourishment. To reduce the inf luence of
possible estimation errors in some of the
underlying parameters, national estimates are
reported as a three-year moving average.
Regional and global aggregates are reported as
annual estimates.

Information on the annual evolution in the
population structure by sex and age is available
for most countries in the world from the UN
Department of Economic and Social Affairs
(DESA) Population Prospects, produced ever y
two years. This report uses the 2017 revision of
the World Population Prospects. 353

Methodology: To compute an estimate of the
prevalence of undernourishment in a population,
the probabilit y distribution of habitual dietar y
energ y intake levels (expressed in Kcal per person
per day) for an average individual is modelled as
a parametric probabilit y densit y function (pdf ),
f(x). The indicator is obtained as the cumulative
probabilit y that daily habitual dietar y energ y
intakes (x) are below minimum dietar y energ y
requirements (MDER) (i.e. the lower bound of the
acceptable range of energ y requirements) for a
representative average individual, as in the
formula below:

Information on the median height in each sex and
age group is derived from a recent demographic
and health sur vey (DHS) or other sur veys that
collect anthropometr y data on children and
adults. Even if such sur veys do not refer to the
same year for which the PoU is estimated,
inter vening changes in median heights are
arg uably quite small, and their impact on PoU
estimates expected to be ver y limited.

consumption are available from nationally
representative household sur veys that collect
information on food consumption (for example,
Living Standard Measurement Sur veys or
Household Incomes and Expenditure Sur veys),
the DEC, C V and Skew parameters can be
estimated directly. However, ver y few countries
conduct such sur veys on an annual basis, leading
to the need to estimate them directly or impute
them for the years when no suitable sur vey data

are available. In such cases, DEC values are
estimated from the dietar y energ y supply (DES)
reported in the Food Balance Sheets (FBS),
compiled by FAO for most countries in the world
(see w w w.fao.org/economic/ess/f bs) and available
for the years up to 2016.

Projection of the DEC. The latest available data from
national food balance sheets for most countries
refer to a year between 2013 and 2016. To
estimate a value of DEC for up to 2017, data on
the per capita availabilit y of cereals and meats,
available from the Trade and Market Division
(EST) of FAO, 355 are used to estimate the likely
rates of change in per capita dietar y energ y
availabilit y from 2013, 2014, 2015 or 2016
(depending on the countr y) to 2017. Such rates of
change are then applied to the latest available
DEC values to project them up to 2017.

To impute the C V, FBS are of no use as they
provide no information on the distribution of food
consumption within a population. In the past
FAO had made attempts at estimating the C V as a
function of macroeconomic variables, such as per
capita GDP, inequalit y in income (captured by the
Gini index) and an index of the relative price of
food. 354 The model works reasonably well to
interpolate the values of the C V of habitual food
consumption in a population for years between
those when there is a sur vey, as the sur vey-based
estimates can be used as anchoring points for the
series of predicted C Vs. However, the abilit y to
correctly project the C V beyond the year of last
available sur vey, with such a model, is
questionable, as it would imply a high risk of
meaningless out-of-sample predictions.
Moreover, due to the sparsit y of data on Gini
indexes and to reser vations about the way in
which the index of the relative price of food is
compiled, the benefit of using such a procedure
appeared quite limited. We therefore revert to the
simpler method to linearly interpolate values of
the C Vs in the years between sur veys. The main
drawback of this modelling choice is that, when
the last available sur vey dates several years back,
the value of the C V is kept constant. In such
cases, changes over time in the abilit y to access
food by different strata of the population that are
not fully ref lected in changes in the average
national food consumption, are not ref lected in
PoU estimates.

Projection of the CV. As no household sur vey data are
available for 2017, in most countries the C V
estimated from last available food consumption
sur vey data had to be projected ahead, with no
change, up to 2017. However, for the countries
that agreed to disseminate national estimates of
their prevalence of food insecurit y based on the
FIES, the information could be used as auxiliar y
information in projecting the C V. Since 2014,
FIES data provide evidence on changes in the
extent of severe food insecurit y that might closely
ref lect changes in the PoU. Such changes can be
used to infer the likely changes in the C V that
might have occurred in the most recent year.
Recent analysis shows that, on average, C Vs
explain about one-third of the differences in PoU
after accounting for differences in DEC and
MDER. Projected changes in the C V from 2016 to
2017 for those countries are thus estimated as
follows: the C V was revised by the amount that
would generate a change of 1 percent in the PoU
ever y time we obser ve a change of 3 percent in
the prevalence of severe food insecurit y (FI sev ).

above, PoU estimates are produced for all
countries for which reliable FBS data are
available up to 2016. To generate national-level
three-year averages for 2015 –17 and annual
values at regional and global level in 2017,
projections are needed.

Challenges and limitations: While the state of being
undernourished applies to individuals, due to
conceptual and data-related considerations, the
indicator can only refer to a population or group

How it is reported: In this report, FAO provides

undernourishment is thus an estimate of the
percentage of individuals in a group that are in
that condition – it is not based on identification
of which individuals in the population are
undernourished.

estimates of severe food insecurit y (FI sev ). Two
estimates are reported:
 the prevalence (percent) of individuals in
the population living in households where at
least one adult was found to be food insecure;
 the estimated number of individuals in the
population living in households where at least
one adult was found to be food insecure.

Due to the probabilistic nature of the inference
and the margins of uncertaint y associated with
estimates of each of the parameters in the
model, the precision of the PoU estimates is
generally low. While it is not possible to
calculate margins of error around PoU
estimates, these would likely exceed 5 percent in
most cases. For this reason, FAO does not
consider national-level PoU estimates lower
than 2.5 percent as sufficiently reliable to be
reported.

Data source: Since 2014, the eight-question FIES
sur vey module has been applied in nationally
representative samples of the adult population
(defined as aged 15 or older) in more than
140 countries included in the Gallup® World Poll
(GWP), covering 90 percent of the world
population. In most countries, samples include
about 1 000 individuals, with larger samples of
3 000 individuals in India and 5 000 in mainland
China.

Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Saint Lucia,
Seychelles, the United States of America, (2015,
2016 and 2017) and the Republic of Korea (2014
and 2015) national government sur vey data were
used to calculate the prevalence estimates of food
insecurit y by applying FAO statistical methods to
adjust national results to the same global
reference standard.

Methodology: The data were validated and used to
construct a scale of food-insecurit y severit y using
the Rasch model, which postulates that the
probabilit y of obser ving an affirmative answer by
respondent i to question j is a logistic function of
the distance, on an underlying scale of severit y,
between the position of the respondent, a i , and
that of the item, b j .

FOOD INSECURITY AS MEASURED BY
THE FOOD INSECURITY EXPERIENCE
SCALE (FIES)
Definition: Food insecurit y as measured by this
indicator refers to limited access to food, at the
level of individuals or households, due to lack of
money or other resources. The severit y of food
insecurit y is measured through the application of
the Food Insecurit y Experience Scale sur vey
module (FIES-SM), a set of eight questions about
experiences related to lack of access to food. The
FIES methodolog y established by FAO provides a
global measurement standard of food insecurit y.

Prob(X i,j = Yes) =

exp(a i – b j)
1 + exp(a i – b j)

By applying the Rasch model to the FIES data, it
is possible to estimate the probabilit y of being
food insecure (p i,L) at any given level of severit y
of food insecurit y L, for each respondent i, with
0 < p i,L < 1.

equating, and permits the production of
internationally comparable measures of food
insecurit y severit y for individual respondents, as
well as comparable national prevalence rates.

The prevalence of food insecurity at a given
level of severit y (FI L) in the population is
computed as the weighted sum of the probabilit y
of being severely food insecure for all
respondents (i) in a sample:

Challenges and limitations: When food-insecurit y
prevalence estimates are based on FIES data
collected in the GWP, with national sample
sizes of about 1 000 in most countries,
confidence inter vals rarely exceed 20 percent of
the measured prevalence (that is, prevalence
rates of about 50 percent have margins of error
of plus or minus 5 percent). However,
confidence inter vals are likely to be much
smaller when national prevalence rates are
estimated using larger samples and for
estimates referring to subregional and regional
aggregates of countries. To reduce the impact of
year-to-year sampling variabilit y, countr y-level
estimates are presented as three-year averages.

FI L = ∑p i,L w i
where w i are post-stratification weights that
indicate the proportion of individuals or
households in the national population
represented by each record in the sample.
As only individuals aged 15 or more are sampled
in the GWP, the prevalence estimates directly
produced from these data refer to the population
15 years and older. In order to arrive at the
prevalence and number of individuals (of all
ages) in the population, an estimate is required
of the number of people living in the households
where at least one adult is estimated to be food
insecure. This involves a multistep procedure
detailed in Annex II of the Voices of the Hungr y
Technical Report (http://w w w.fao.org/3/c-i4830e.
pdf ).

where r indicates the region, FI L,c is the value of FI

Nc is the corresponding population size. When no
estimate of FI L is available for a country, it is
assumed to be equal to the population-weighted
average of the estimated values of the remaining
countries in the same region. A regional aggregate
is produced only if the countries for which an
estimate is available cover at least 80 percent of
the region’s population.

METHODOLOGICAL NOTES

November 2013 to April 2014, the mean year in
which most of the fieldwork was completed (in
this case 2014) was used as the year from which
to choose the respective population estimate.
Weights of countries with single data points were
derived by dividing the under-five population at
the time of the survey by the sum of the
countries’ mean population in the whole region.
For countries with multiple data points the
weights were calculated by dividing the mean of
the country’s under-five population (over the
observed years) by the sum of those mean
populations of countries within the whole region.

length is an indicator of acute weight loss or a
failure to gain weight and can be a consequence
of insufficient food intake and/or an incidence
of infectious diseases, especially diarrhoea.

How wasting is reported: The percentage of children
aged 0 –59 months who are below -2 SD from the
median weight-for-height/length of the 2006
W HO Child Growth Standards.
Definition of childhood overweight: Weight (kg) for height/
length (cm) > +2 SD of the 2006 W HO Child
Growth Standards median. This indicator ref lects
excessive weight gain for height/length generally
due to energ y intake exceeding children’s energ y
requirements.

A linear mixed-effect model was applied for each
region or income group, using logistic
transformation of prevalence and results
back-transformed to original scale. The final
models were then used to project the trend of
malnutrition in children from 1990 to 2017. Using
the resulting prevalence estimates (after
back-transformation), the total numbers affected
were calculated by multiplying the prevalence
and lower and upper limits of the confidence
inter vals by the subregional population derived
from the UN population estimates.

How childhood overweight is reported: The percentage of
children aged 0 –59 months who are over +2 SD
from the median weight-for-height/length of the
W HO Child Growth Standards.

Variables: region, subregion, countr y, sur vey year,
sample size, minimum and maximum age
sur veyed, prevalence of stunting, prevalence of
wasting, prevalence of severe wasting, prevalence
of overweight, countr y population under five
years of age.

Methodology: National nutrition sur veys (MICS,
DHS, national nutrition sur veys, etc.) and
national nutrition sur veillance systems are the
preferred primar y data sources for child nutrition
indicators. For entr y in the database, they must
be nationally representative, population-based
sur veys that present results based on the W HO
Child Growth standards or provide access to the
raw data enabling reanalysis.

Challenges and limitations: The recommended
periodicit y for countries to report on stunting,
overweight and wasting is ever y three to five
years; however, for some countries data are
available less frequently. While ever y effort has
been made to maximize the comparabilit y of
statistics across countries and over time, countr y
data may differ in terms of data collection
methods, population coverage and estimation
methods used. Sur vey estimates come with
levels of uncertaint y due to both sampling errors
and non-sampling errors (technical measurement
errors, recording errors, etc.). Neither of the two
sources of error has been fully taken into
account for deriving estimates at countr y or
regional and global levels.

A weighted analysis was carried out to account
for the different country populations and ensure
that the influence in the regional trend analysis
of a country’s survey estimate was proportional
to the country’s population. The population
weights were derived from the UN Population
Prospects, 2017 revision. For each data point, the
respective under-five population estimate for the
specific survey year was obtained. If a survey was
performed over an extended period, for example

Data source: UNICEF. 2018. Infant and Young Child

For the prevalence of wasting, given that sur veys
are generally carried out during a specific period
of the year, estimates can be affected by
seasonalit y. Seasonal factors related to wasting
include food availabilit y (e.g. prehar vest periods)
and disease (rainy season and diarrhoea, malaria,
etc.), while natural disasters and conf licts can
also show real shifts in trends that would need to
be treated differently than a seasonal variation.
Hence, countr y years’ estimates for wasting
might not necessarily be comparable over time.
Consequently, only the most recent (2017)
estimates are provided.

The indicator is based on a recall of the previous
day’s feeding to a cross-section of infants
0 –5 months of age.
In 2012, the regional and global exclusive
breastfeeding estimates were generated using the
most recent estimate available for each countr y
between 2005 and 2012. Similarly, 2017 estimates
were developed using the most recent estimate
available for each countr y between 2013 and
2018. Global and regional estimates were
calculated as weighted averages of the prevalence
of exclusive breastfeeding in each countr y, using
the total number of births from the World
Population Prospects, 2017 revision (2012 for the
baseline and 2017 for the current) as weights.
Estimates are presented only where the available
data are representative of at least 50 percent of
corresponding regions’ total number of births,
unless otherwise noted.

EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING
Definition: Exclusive breastfeeding for infants
<6 months of age is defined as receiv only
breast milk and no additional food or drink, not
even water. Exclusive breastfeeding is a
cornerstone of child sur v ival and is the best
food for newborns, as breast milk shapes the
baby ’s microbiome, streng thens the immune
system, and reduces the risk of developing
chronic diseases.

Challenges and limitations: While a high proportion of
countries collect data for exclusive breastfeeding,
data are lacking in high-income countries in
particular. The recommended periodicit y of
reporting on exclusive breastfeeding is ever y
three to five years. However, for some countries,
data are reported less frequently, meaning
changes in feeding patterns are often not
detected for several years after the change occurs.

Breastfeeding also benefits mothers by preventing
post-partum haemorrhage, promoting uterine
involution, decreasing risk of iron-deficiency
anaemia and various t ypes of cancer, and
providing psychological benefits.

How exclusive breastfeeding is reported: Percentage of infants
aged 0–5 months who are fed exclusively on breast
milk with no additional food or drink – not even
water – in the 24 hours preceding the survey.

Regional and global averages may be affected
depending on which countries had data available
for the periods considered in this report.

or older measured in 186 countries were included.
The model incorporated nonlinear time trends
and age patterns; national versus subnational and
community representativeness; and whether data
covered both rural and urban areas versus only
one of them. The model also included covariates
that help predict BMI, including national income,
proportion of population living in urban areas,
mean number of years of education, and summar y
measures of availability of different food types
for human consumption.

Using the previous day’s feeding as a basis may
cause the proportion of exclusively breastfed infants
to be overestimated, as some infants who may have
been given other liquids irregularly may not have
received these in the day before the survey.

ADULT OBESITY
Definition: BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m 2 . The body mass index
(BMI) is the ratio of weight-to-height commonly
used to classif y the nutritional status of adults. It
is calculated as the body weight in kilograms
divided by the square of the body height in
meters (kg/m 2). Obesit y includes individuals with
BMI equal to or higher than 30 kg/m 2 .

ANAEMIA IN WOMEN OF
REPRODUCTIVE AGE
Definition: [Haemoglobin] <110g/L for pregnant
women; [Haemoglobin] <120g/L for non-pregnant
women. Anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin
concentration below a specified cutoff point, which
can change according to age, sex, physiological
status, smoking habits and the altitude at which the
population being assessed lives.

and thalassaemia, which were assumed as
constant over time during the analysis period for
each countr y.

Methodology: National representative sur veys,
summar y statistics from W HO’s Vitamin and
Mineral Nutrition Information Systems, and
summar y statistics reported by other national
and international agencies.

Challenges and limitations: Despite a high proportion of
countries having nationally representative sur vey
data available for anaemia, there is still a lack of
reporting on this indicator, especially in
high-income countries. As a result, the estimates
may not capture the full variation across
countries and regions, trending to “shrink”
towards global means when data are sparse.

Data for non-pregnant women and pregnant
women were summed and weighted by the
prevalence of pregnancy to generate one value for
all women of reproductive age. Data were
adjusted by altitude and, when available, smoking
status.

Trends were modelled over time as a linear trend
plus a smooth nonlinear trend, at national,
regional and global levels. The model used a
weighted average of various bell-shaped densities
to estimate full haemoglobin distributions, which
might themselves be skewed.
The estimates are also informed by covariates
that help predict haemoglobin concentrations,
including maternal education, proportion of
population in urban areas, mean latitude,
prevalence of sickle cell disorders and
thalassaemia, and mean BMI. Nearly all
covariates were available for ever y countr y and

ANNEX 2
COUNTRY GROUP
DEFINITIONS AND
LISTS IN PART 2

Climate extremes analysed in Part 2 of this report
– including heat spells, droughts, f loods, and
storms – are measured as the occurrence of any
of these extremes in a countr y for each year of
the time frame considered (1996 –2016). Climate
extremes are measured as the occurrence of any
of these four extreme climate events, and are
reported yearly for each countr y. Four subperiods
are used: 1996 –2000; 2001–2005; 2006 –2010; and
2011–2016. Note that, due to data limitations, it is
not possible to count the total number of climate
extreme events in any given year.

A. Weather, climate and climate change
Weather describes conditions in the atmosphere
over a short period of time (minutes to days),
whereas climate describes the slowly var ying
aspects of the atmosphere–hydrosphere–land
surface system and is t ypically characterized in
terms of suitable averages of the climate system
over periods of a month or more. 356 Part 2 does
not analyse individual or specific weather events
but instead focuses on climate variabilit y and
extremes (see below definitions) and their impact
on food securit y and nutrition.

Part 2 also analyses inter-seasonal variability,
in terms of late/early start of season and the
growing season length. Although such variations
generally do not register as extreme weather
events, they are aspects of climate variabilit y on
shorter time scales that affect the growth of crops
and availabilit y of pasture for livestock, thereby
impacting on food securit y and nutrition.
Between-season variations are defined using
phenological variables derived from the
vegetation index NDV I: i) a dominant reduction
in the length of the seasons is defined as when a
significant trend of decreased length during the
period 2003 –2016 involves at least 10 percent of
cropland and rangeland areas of a countr y; ii)
delay in or early onset of the seasons denotes
countries where at least 10 percent of cropland
and/or rangeland areas are characterized by a
delayed or early onset of the season during the
period 2003 –2016.

B. Definitions of climate variability and
extremes
Climate variability refers to variations in the
mean state and other statistics (standard
deviations, the occurrence of extremes, etc.) of
the climate on all spatial and temporal scales
beyond that of individual weather events.
Variabilit y may be due to natural internal
processes within the climate system (internal
variabilit y), or to variations in natural or
anthropogenic external forcing (external
variabilit y).

C. Exposure and vulnerability to climate
extremes

Climate extremes refer to the occurrence of a
value of a weather or climate variable above (or
below) a threshold value near the upper (or
lower) ends of the range of obser ved values of the
variable. For simplicit y, both extreme weather
events and extreme climate events are referred to
collectively as “climate extremes” as well as being
referred to as climate shocks. 357

Whether climate variabilit y and extremes
negatively affect people’s food securit y and
nutrition depends on the frequency and
intensity of climate shocks, the degree of
exposure to climate shocks and their
vulnerability to these shocks.
| 148 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

This analysis is undertaken on low- and
middle-income countries, where there are
generally – though not exclusively – higher levels
of undernourishment. Out of the 140 countries
classified by the World Bank as low- and
middle-income, the present analysis focuses on
129 countries. Eleven countries have been
omitted from the analysis since climate
information is not available for them: Grenada,
Maldives, Marshall Islands, Mauritius,
Micronesia (Federated States of ), Nauru, Saint
Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sao
Tome and Principe, Tonga and Tuvalu. In
addition, analysis shown in Figure 26 and 27 is
based on 128 countries, since PoU data for
Kosovo is not available.

country/year over agriculture cropping areas is
lower than 1 standard deviation (SD) with respect
to the long-term rainfall average, or when ii) the
ASAP system indicates drought conditions
occuring for more than 15 percent of the growing
season of croplands or rangelands in a given
country/year. Although ASAP is considered to
provide a more accurate measure of drought, it has
only been available since 2006. Several robustness
checks were performed and confirm the validity of
using both ASAP and precipitation for the earlier
period to identify exposure to drought.
Exposure to floods is defined as when the
rainfall in a given countr y/year over agriculture
cropping areas is greater than 2 standard
deviations (SD) with respect to the long-term
rainfall average in the countr y.

C.1 Country exposure to climate extremes
Exposure is defined as the presence of people;
livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental
functions, ser vices, and resources; infrastructure;
or economic, social, or cultural assets in places
and settings that could be adversely affected
(see Annex 4 Glossar y). For the purposes of the
analysis in Part 2, countr y exposure to climate
extremes is conceived as a combined measure of
both the frequency and intensit y of climate
extremes over the areas that could be most
adversely affected, as it relates most directly to
impacts on food securit y and agricultural areas.

Exposure to storms is defined based on the
EM-DAT datasets of medium- and large-scale
disasters. Exposure to storms is defined as when
in a given countr y/year storms have produced at
least one of the following effects: i) deaths of ten
or more people; ii) 100 or more people affected/
injured/homeless; iii) declaration by the countr y
of a state of emergency or an appeal for
international assistance.

Countries with high exposure to climate extremes
Defined as low- and middle-income countries
and territories exposed to climate extremes for at
least 66 percent of the time, or more than three
out of six years during the most recent subperiod
of six consecutive years (2011–2016). There are 51
low- and middle-income countries that meet
these criteria. For a complete list, see Table A2.2.

Exposure to heat spells is defined when the
percentage of ver y hot days (temperature above
the 90 th percentile) over agriculture cropping
areas is greater than 1 standard deviation (SD) in
a given year/countr y compared to the long-term
temperature average.

Countries with low exposure to climate extremes

Exposure to drought is defined in two different
ways: based on precipitation for years 1996–2005
and based on ASAP frequency of drought
conditions for years 2006–2016. Exposure to
drought is defined as when i) rainfall in a given

Defined as low- and middle-income countries

consecutive years (2011–2016). There are 78
low- and middle-income countries that meet
these criteria.

C.2 Countries with high vulnerability to
climate extremes
Vulnerabilit y refers to the conditions that
increase the probabilit y that climate extremes
will negatively affect food securit y (see Annex 4
Glossar y). Although there are many other
v ulnerabilit y factors, those below have been
selected for analysis due to their relative
importance for food availabilit y and access as
identified in Part 2 of the report.

Vulnerability related to high dependence on
agriculture: Countries with a high dependence
on agriculture, with 60 percent or more people
employed in the agriculture sector in 2017 – as
measured by World Bank (2017) – so it is
expected they are deriving their livelihood and
income from the sector (see Table A2.1 column D for
list of countries).

Vulnerability related to climate-sensitive
production and/or yields: Defined as low- and
middle-income countries with at least part of
their national cereal production or yield
variance explained by climate factors – i.e. there
is a high and statistically significant association
between temperature, rainfall and vegetation
growth (see Annex 3 for methodolog y and
Table A2.1 column A for list of countries).

METHODOLOGY
PART 2

denote the sign of the correlation (green =
positive, red = negative).

B. PoU change point analysis data and
methodology

A. Climate variability influence on production
and imports

Change points in the PoU time series were
identified by applying the multiple structural
changes model proposed by Bai and Perron
(1998). 359 This involves finding the “best”
combination of n possible breaks subject to the
constraint that distance between break
inter vals should be above a minimum length.
Here “best” means minimum sum of squared
residuals from an OLS regression of PoU on a
set of dummies indicating the timing of the
breaks. A minimum break inter val of three
years was imposed in the identification of the
optimal segmentation. PoU in years 2005 –2016
was used to identif y change points between
2006 –2015. An additional constraint has been
used to identif y the relevant change points, i.e.
only those characterized by a subsequent
increasing tendency (estimated by an ordinar y
least squares method) have been retained.

Data analysis was carried out to compare total
cereal production and import data from FAO
GIEWS Cereal Balance Sheets for the period
2001–2017 and for low- and middle-income
countries, with selected weather and biophysical
indicators including: annual cumulative
precipitation; mean annual temperature;
cumulative Normalized Difference Vegetation
Index (NDVI) during active crop seasons; and
drought indicators from the Anomaly Hotspots
of Agriculture Production (ASAP) and
Agriculture Stress Index System (ASIS). Climate
data are aggregated over cropping areas
smoothed for small geographical scale events,
especially in large countries. NDVI is cumulative
for the average crop season, while the other
indicators are aggregated over the whole year.
The analysis of the climate variabilit y inf luence
on production and imports was performed by
applying a classic correlation analysis requesting
a significance of at least 90 percent. The
production and import data time series have been
detrended by applying a LOESS approach. 358
Detrending refers to removing a trend from a
time series, where a trend usually refers to a
change in the mean over time.

Out of the identified PoU change points for all the
low- and middle-income countries, we select those
that temporally corresponded to a year ranked
among the first four with the most severe
frequencies of drought conditions for each country.
The frequency of drought conditions for a countr y
is defined according to the Anomaly Hotspots of
Agriculture Production (ASAP) early warning
system, developed by the European Commission
Joint Research Centre. ASAP drought frequency
is based on the percentage of total time of the
year for which a relevant share of crop or
rangeland areas (> 25 percent) is affected by
drought warnings according to anomalies of
rainfall and NDV I.

Countries are mapped according to their
Pearson’s coefficient of correlation. Figures 29
and 31 show in white the countries where part of
the production (or imports) variabilit y is
explained by climate indicators (and the
correlation is statistically significant). The colours

ANNEX 4
GLOSSARY

Adaptive capacity:
The abilit y of systems, institutions, humans and
other organisms to adjust to potential damage, to
take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to
consequences. 364 The abilit y of a system to adjust
to climate change (including climate variabilit y
and extremes) in order to moderate potential
damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or
to cope with the consequences. 365 The capacit y to
adapt to new options in the face of crisis by
making proactive and informed choices about
alternative livelihood strategies based on an
understanding of changing conditions. 366

Acute food insecurity:
Food insecurit y found in a specified area at a
specific point in time and of a severit y that
threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless
of the causes, context or duration. Has relevance
in providing strategic g uidance to actions that
focus on short-term objectives to prevent,
mitigate or decrease severe food insecurit y that
threatens lives or livelihoods. 360

Acute malnutrition:

Anomaly:

Acute malnutrition in this report refers to
extreme thinness (low weight-for-height) of
individuals ref lecting a reduction or loss of body
weight. Child wasting, defined as weight-forheight below minus two standard deviations from
the median weight-for-height in the reference
population, is considered a relevant indicator of
acute malnutrition, as well as small mid-upper
arm circumference and bilateral pitting oedema.

The difference between a climate variable
averaged over a particular period (e.g. for a
particular year or group of years), and the same
climate variable averaged over a longer (baseline/
reference) period (e.g. averaged over the 35 years
between 1981 and 2016).

Anthropogenic:
Resulting from or produced by human
activities. 367

Absorptive capacity:
The capacit y to withstand threats and minimize
exposure to shocks and stressors through
preventative measures and appropriate coping
strategies to avoid permanent, negative
impacts. 361 The capacit y to absorb shocks and
stresses by increasing access to climate risk
insurance and social protection systems. 362

Anthropometry:
Use of human body measurements to obtain
information about nutritional status.

Capacity:
The combination of all the strengths, attributes
and resources available within an organization,
communit y or societ y to manage and reduce
disaster risks and strengthen resilience. Capacit y
may include infrastructure, institutions, human
knowledge and skills, and collective attributes
such as social relationships, leadership and
management. 368

Adaptation:
The process of adjustment to actual or expected
climate and its effects. In human systems,
adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or
exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural
systems, human inter vention may facilitate
adjustment to expected climate and its effects. 363

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

Chronic food insecurity:

Climate resilience:

Food insecurit y that persists over time mainly
due to structural causes. Can include seasonal
food insecurit y found in periods with
non-exceptional conditions. Has relevance in
providing strategic g uidance to actions that focus
on the medium- and long-term improvement of
the qualit y and quantit y of food consumption for
an active and healthy life. 369

An approach to building and/or strengthening
resilience (see resilience definition below) that
addresses current or expected climate variabilit y
and changing average climate conditions.

Climate-resilient pathways:
Iterative processes for managing change within
complex systems in order to reduce disruptions
and enhance opportunities associated with
climate change. 373

Climate:
Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as
the average weather, or more rigorously, as the
statistical description in terms of the mean and
variabilit y of relevant quantities over a period of
time ranging from months to thousands or
millions of years. 370

Climate services:
Climate ser vices involve the production,
translation, transfer and use of climate
knowledge and information to support decisionmaking by individuals and organizations.
Information needs to be easily accessible, timely,
easy to understand and relevant to users so they
can use it to take action.

Climate change:
Climate change refers to a change in the state of
the climate that can be identified (e.g. by using
statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the
variability of its properties, and that persists for an
extended period, typically decades or longer. 371

Climate variability:
Refers to variations in the mean state and other
statistics (standard deviations, the occurrence of
extremes, etc.) of the climate on all spatial and
temporal scales beyond that of individual weather
events. Variabilit y may be due to natural internal
processes within the climate system (internal
variabilit y), or to variations in natural or
anthropogenic external forcing (external
variabilit y). 374

Climate change adaptation (CCA):
An approach to adaptation (see adaptation
definition above) that addresses current or
expected climate variabilit y and changing
average climate conditions.

Climate extreme (extreme weather or climate event):

Climate shocks:

The occurrence of a value of a weather or climate
variable above (or below) a threshold value near
the upper (or lower) ends of the range of
obser ved values of the variable. For simplicit y,
both extreme weather events and extreme climate
events are referred to collectively as “climate
extremes”. 372

Climate shocks include not only those
disturbances in the usual pattern of rainfall and
temperatures but also complex events like
droughts and f loods. Equivalent to the concept of
a natural hazard or stress, an exogenous event
that can have a negative impact on food and
nutrition securit y, depending on the v ulnerabilit y
of an individual, a household, a communit y, or
systems to the shock. 375
| 157 |

ANNEX 4

Climatology:

period with an abnormal precipitation deficit is
defined as a meteorological drought. 379

The average of a climate-related variable over a
long period of time, e.g. averaged over 30 years
between 1981 and 2010.

Early warning system (EWS):
The set of capacities needed to generate and
disseminate timely and meaningful warning
information so that individuals, communities and
organizations threatened by a hazard can prepare
prompt and appropriate action to reduce the
possibilit y of harm or loss. 380

Coping capacity:
The abilit y of people, institutions, organizations
and systems, using available skills, values,
beliefs, resources and opportunities, to address,
manage and overcome adverse conditions in the
short to medium term. 376

El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO):

Dietary energy intake:

The term El Niño is used to describe a basin-wide
warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean east of the
International Date Line. This oceanic event is
associated with a f luctuation of a global-scale
tropical and subtropical surface pressure pattern
called the Southern Oscillation. This combined
atmospheric–oceanic phenomenon, usually
occurring around ever y two to seven years, is
known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO). The cold phase of ENSO is called La
Niña. 381

The energ y content of food consumed.

Dietary energy supply (DES):
Food available for human consumption,
expressed in kilocalories per person per day
(kcal/person/day). At the countr y level, it is
calculated as the food remaining for human use
after deduction of all non-food utilizations (i.e.
food = production + imports + stock withdrawals
− exports − industrial use − animal feed – seed –
wastage − additions to stock). Wastage includes
loss of usable products occurring along
distribution chains from farm gate (or port of
import) up to retail level.

Exposure:
The presence of people, livelihoods, species or
ecosystems, environmental functions, ser vices
and resources, infrastructure, or economic, social
or cultural assets in places and settings that
could be adversely affected. 382

Disaster risk management (DRM):
Disaster risk management is the application of
disaster risk reduction policies and strategies to
prevent new disaster risk, reduce existing disaster
risk and manage residual risk, contributing to the
strengthening of resilience and reduction of
disaster losses. 377

Extreme weather or climate event:
The occurrence of a value of a weather or climate
variable above (or below) a threshold value near
the upper (or lower) ends of the range of
obser ved values of the variable. Many weather
and climate extremes are the result of natural
climate variability (including phenomena such
as ENSO), and natural decadal or multi-decadal
variations in the climate provide the backdrop for
anthropogenic climate changes. Even if there
were no anthropogenic changes in climate, a
wide variet y of natural weather and climate
extremes would still occur.

Disaster risk reduction (DRR):
Disaster risk reduction is aimed at preventing
new and reducing existing disaster risk and
managing residual risk, all of which contribute to
strengthening resilience and therefore to the
achievement of sustainable development. Disaster
risk reduction is the policy objective of disaster
risk management, and its goals and objectives are
defined in disaster risk reduction strategies and
plans. 378

Flood:

T he overf lowing of the normal confines of a
stream or other body of water, or the
accumulation of water over areas not normally
submerged. Floods include river (f luvial) f loods,

Drought:
A period of abnormally dr y weather long enough
to cause a serious hydrological imbalance. A

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

 Stability – If the dimensions of availabilit y,
access and utilization are sufficiently met,
stabilit y is the condition in which the whole
system is stable, thus ensuring that households
are food secure at all times. Stabilit y issues can
refer to short-term instabilit y (which can lead
to acute food insecurity) or medium- to longterm instabilit y (which can lead to chronic food
insecurity). Climatic, economic, social and
political factors can all be a source of
instabilit y.

f lash f loods, urban f loods, pluvial f loods, sewer
f loods, coastal f loods, and glacial lake outburst
f loods. 383

Food insecurity:
A situation that exists when people lack secure
access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious
food for normal growth and development and an
active and healthy life. It may be caused by
unavailability of food, insufficient purchasing
power, inappropriate distribution or inadequate use
of food at the household level. Food insecurity,
poor conditions of health and sanitation and
inappropriate care and feeding practices are the
major causes of poor nutritional status. Food
insecurity may be chronic, seasonal or transitory.

Hazard:
A process, phenomenon or human activit y
that may cause loss of life, injur y or other
health impacts, propert y damage, social and
economic disruption or environmental
degradation. 384 Natural hazard is synonymous
with “climate shock” in this report.

Food security:
A situation that exists when all people, at all
times, have physical, social and economic access
to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets
their dietar y needs and food preferences for an
active and healthy life. Based on this definition,
four food securit y dimensions can be identified:
food availabilit y, economic and physical access to
food, food utilization and stabilit y over time.

Heatwave:
A period of abnormally and uncomfortably hot
weather. 385

Hunger:
Hunger is an uncomfortable or painful physical
sensation caused by insufficient consumption of
dietar y energ y. In this report, the term hunger is
synonymous with chronic undernourishment.

Food security dimensions:
Refers to the four dimensions of food securit y:
 Availability – This dimension addresses
whether or not food is actually or potentially
physically present, including aspects of
production, food reser ves, markets and
transportation, and wild foods.
 Access – If food is actually or potentially
physically present, the next question is
whether or not households and individuals
have sufficient access to that food.
 Utilization – If food is available and
households have adequate access to it, the next
question is whether or not households are
maximizing the consumption of adequate
nutrition and energ y. Sufficient energ y and
nutrient intake by individuals is the result of
good care and feeding practices, food
preparation, dietar y diversit y and
intra-household distribution of food.
Combined with good biological utilization of
food consumed, this determines the nutritional
status of individuals.

Kilocalorie (kcal):
A unit of measurement of energ y. One kilocalorie
equals 1 000 calories. In the International System
of Units (SI), the universal unit of energ y is the
joule ( J). One kilocalorie = 4.184 kilojoules (kJ).

Livelihood assets or capital:
The resources used and the activities undertaken
in order to live. These assets are referred to as
livelihood assets and in the Sustainable
Livelihoods Framework are defined under the
following five categories of “capital”:
 Economic or financial capital: capital base
(reg ular inf lows of money, credit/debt, savings
and other economic assets)
 Human capital: skills, knowledge, labour
(includes good health and physical capabilit y)
 Physical capital: productive assets,
infrastructure (buildings, roads, production
equipment and technologies)
| 159 |

ANNEX 4

 Natural capital: Natural resource stocks (land,
soil, water, air, genetic resources, forests, etc.)
and environmental ser vices (hydrological
cycle, pollution sinks, etc.)
 Social capital: resources (networks, social
claims, social relations, affiliations,
associations)

Nutrition-sensitive intervention:

The ways in which people utilize and combine
their livelihood assets to obtain food, income and
other goods and ser vices are defined as their
livelihood strategies.

Nutritional status:

An action designed to address the underlying
determinants of nutrition (which include
household food securit y, care for mothers and
children and primar y health care and sanitation)
but not necessarily having nutrition as the
predominant goal.

The physiological state of an individual that
results from the relationship between nutrient
intake and requirements and the body’s abilit y to
digest, absorb and use these nutrients.

Macronutrients:

Overnutrition:

These are the proteins, carbohydrates and fats
available to be used for energy; measured in grams.

A result of excessive food intake relative to
dietar y nutrient requirements.

Malnutrition:

Overweight and obesity:

An abnormal physiological condition caused by
inadequate, unbalanced or excessive consumption
of macronutrients and/or micronutrients.
Malnutrition includes undernutrition and
overnutrition as well as micronutrient deficiencies.

Body weight that is above normal for height as a
result of an excessive accumulation of fat. It is
usually a manifestation of expending fewer calories
than are consumed. In adults, overweight is defined
as a BMI of more than 25 kg/m 2 but less than 30 kg/
m 2 , and obesity as a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 or more. In
children under five years of age, overweight is
defined as weight-for-height greater than 2
standard deviations above the WHO Child Growth
Standards median, and obesity as weight-for-height
greater than 3 standard deviations above the WHO
Child Growth Standards median.

Micronutrients:
Vitamins, minerals and other substances that are
required by the body in small amounts; measured
in milligrams or micrograms.

Mitigation (of climate change):
A human inter vention to reduce the sources or
enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases that lead
to climate change. 386

Preparedness:
The knowledge and capacities developed by
governments, response and recovery organizations,
communities and individuals to effectively
anticipate, respond to and recover from the impacts
of likely, imminent or current disasters. 388

Mitigation (of disaster risk and disaster):
The lessening of the potential adverse impacts of
physical hazards (including those that are
human-induced) through actions that reduce
hazard, exposure and v ulnerabilit y. 387

Prevention:

Nutrition security:

Activities and measures to avoid existing and
new disaster risks. Prevention (i.e. disaster
prevention) expresses the concept and intention
to completely avoid potential adverse impacts of
hazardous events. 389

A situation that exists when secure access to an
appropriately nutritious diet is coupled with a
sanitar y environment and adequate health
ser vices and care, in order to ensure a healthy
and active life for all household members.
Nutrition securit y differs from food securit y in
that it also considers the aspects of adequate
caregiving practices, health and hygiene in
addition to dietar y adequacy.

Resilience:
Resi l ience is the abi l it y of ind iv idua ls,
households, communit ies, cit ies, inst it ut ions,
systems and societ ies to prevent, resist, absorb,
| 160 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2018

Undernutrition:

adapt, respond and recover posit ively,
ef f iciently and ef fect ively when faced w ith a
w ide range of r isks, whi le ma inta ining an
acceptable level of f unct ioning and w ithout
comprom ising long-ter m prospects for
susta inable development, peace and secur it y,
human r ights and wel l-being for a l l. 390

The outcome of poor nutritional intake in terms of
quantity and/or quality, and/or poor absorption
and/or poor biological use of nutrients consumed as
a result of repeated instances of disease. It includes
being underweight for one’s age, too short for one’s
age (stunted), dangerously thin for one’s height
(suffering from wasting) and deficient in vitamins
and minerals (micronutrient deficiency).

Risk:
The probabilit y or likelihood of occurrence of
hazardous events or trends multiplied by the
impacts if these events or trends occur. Risk to
food insecurit y is the probabilit y of food
insecurit y resulting from interactions between a
natural or human-induced hazard/shock/stress
and v ulnerable conditions.

Vulnerability:
The conditions determined by physical, social,
economic and environmental factors or processes
that increase the susceptibilit y of an individual,
a communit y, assets or systems to the impacts of
hazards. 392

Severe food insecurity:

Vulnerabilit y to food insecurit y is the range of
conditions that increases the susceptibilit y of a
household to the impact on food securit y in case
of a shock or hazard.

Based on the Food Insecurit y Experience Scale
(FIES), someone experiencing severe food
insecurit y is likely to have gone entire days
without eating due to lack of money or other
resources (see Methodological notes, Annex 1).

Wasting:
Low weight-for-height, generally the result of
weight loss associated with a recent period of
inadequate calorie intake and/or disease.
In children under five years of age, wasting is
defined as weight-for-height less than –2
standard deviations below the W HO Child
Growth Standards median.

Stunting:
Low height-for-age, ref lecting a past episode or
episodes of sustained undernutrition. In children
under five years of age, stunting is defined as
height-for-age less than –2 standard deviations
below the W HO Child Growth Standards
median.

Weather:

Transformative capacity:

Weather describes conditions of the atmosphere
over a short period of time (minutes to days),
whereas climate is how the atmosphere behaves
over relatively longer periods of time (the
long-term average of weather over time). The
difference between weather and climate is a
measure of time (see above definitions for
climate, climate change, climate variabilit y, and
climate extremes). 393

The capacit y to transform the set of livelihood
choices available through empowerment and
growth, including governance mechanisms,
policies/reg ulations, infrastructure,
communit y networks, and formal and
informal social protection mechanisms that
constitute an enabling environment for
systemic change. 391

Undernourishment:
Undernourishment is defined as the condition in
which an individual’s habitual food consumption
is insufficient to provide the amount of dietar y
energ y required to maintain a normal, active,
healthy life. For the purposes of this report,
hunger is defined as being synonymous with
chronic undernourishment.

NOTES
1 Each edition of The State of Food Security and Nutrition in
the World presents a complete revised series of the PoU
indicators, as the result of the updating of all supporting
evidence (see Box 1 for details). For this reason, readers are
advised to always consider the PoU estimates in the most
recent report and avoid comparisons with those presented in
past editions.

11 For China, the estimate of the PoU is based on official but
old data on the distribution of food access in the population
and thus may not reflect the considerable increase in access
to food by the poor that has occurred over the last two
decades. Efforts are currently in progress with the country to
have access to updated food consumption data.

32 The FIES, FAO´s global food security measure, was first
introduced in 2014 and was not used in any of the studies
cited. The studies cited used other experience-based food
security metrics that have been used for national monitoring
and research for many years. These include the US Household
Food Security Survey Module, the Latin American and
Caribbean Food Security Scale (Escala Latinoamericana y
Caribeña de Seguridad Alimentaria – ELCSA), the Brazilian
Food Insecurity Scale (Escala Brasileira de Insegurança
Alimentar – EBIA) and the Household Food Insecurity Access
Scale (HFIAS). These survey modules all share the same origins,
are based on the same underlying concept of food insecurity
and are composed of nearly identical sets of questions.

83 Precisely because undernourishment is estimated at the
national scale, it requires significant changes in food
availability or access to affect national-level estimates, and
changes usually occur over time.

77 The indicator for drought conditions frequency is extracted
from Anomaly Hotspots of Agriculture Production (ASAP), an
early warning system developed by the European
Commission Joint Research Centre.

84 The PoU estimates the proportion of the population
habitually meeting the (average) minimum daily dietary intake
requirements. It uses the DEC (mean dietary energy
consumption), which is computed as a three-year average.
This means that the PoU is a highly smoothed data time
series, which can be expected to reflect to some extent major
variations in production, in those cases where a country is
not able to compensate large production drops with stocks
and imports. Although the way the PoU is computed and
smoothed over a three-year period makes direct regression
with climate indicators inappropriate, it is possible to examine

90 PoU is a complex, aggregate measure of
undernourishment at country level and is analysed from
different perspectives in order to detect associations between
climate variability/extremes and PoU. Based on the analysis
presented, climate variability and extremes, including the
2015–2016 El Nino event, appear to be contributing factors
for some countries, as seen both through the lens of
climatology, as well as the PoU analysis of change points in
correspondence of severe drought stress conditions. Figures
26 and 27 descriptively complement this analysis showing
trends in PoU by different vulnerability categories related to
climate-sensitive production and yield, severe drought food
security sensitivity and dependence on agriculture. In
addition to climate, however, there may be other factors at
play, synthesized in the PoU, that affect undernourishment
during this period.

152 Seasonality and seasonal income insecurity is a feature
of poverty in many parts of the world. In agricultural regions
of developing countries, it is known as the lean season – that
dangerous period between planting and harvesting when job
opportunities are scarce and incomes plummet. The lean
season is associated with low income and hunger.

THE STATE OF

FOOD SECURITY
AND NUTRITION
IN THE WORLD
BUILDING CLIMATE RESILIENCE
FOR FOOD SECURITY
AND NUTRITION

New evidence this year corroborates the rise in world hunger observed in this report last year,
sending a warning that more action is needed if we aspire to end world hunger and malnutrition in
all its forms by 2030. Updated estimates show the number of people who suffer from hunger has
been growing over the past three years, returning to prevailing levels from almost a decade ago.
Although progress continues to be made in reducing child stunting, over 22 percent of children
under five years of age are still affected. Other forms of malnutrition are also growing: adult obesity
continues to increase in countries irrespective of their income levels, and many countries are coping
with multiple forms of malnutrition at the same time – overweight and obesity, as well as anaemia in
women, and child stunting and wasting.
Last year’s report showed that the failure to reduce world hunger is closely associated with the
increase in conflict and violence in several parts of the world. In some countries, initial evidence
showed climate-related events were also undermining food security and nutrition. This year’s report
goes further to show that climate variability and extremes – even without conflict – are key drivers
behind the recent rise in global hunger and one of the leading causes of severe food crises and
their impact on people’s nutrition and health. Climate variability and exposure to more complex,
frequent and intense climate extremes are threatening to erode and reverse gains in ending hunger
and malnutrition. Furthermore, hunger is significantly worse in countries where agriculture systems
are highly sensitive to rainfall, temperature and severe drought, and where the livelihood of a high
proportion of the population depends on agriculture.
The findings of this report reveal new challenges to ending hunger, food insecurity and all forms of
malnutrition. There is an urgent need to accelerate and scale up actions that strengthen resilience and
adaptive capacity of people and their livelihoods to climate variability and extremes. These and other
findings are detailed in the 2018 edition of The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World.
