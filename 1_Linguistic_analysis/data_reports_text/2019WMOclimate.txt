Since 2016, the following United Nations agencies have significantly contributed to the
WMO Statement on the State of the Global Climate in support of climate policy and action:
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (IOC/UNESCO),
International Monetary Fund (IMF),
International Organization for Migration (IOM),
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR),
World Health Organisation (WHO).

Foreword
Besides these powerful phenomena, there
has been weather-related damage, such
as the effects of multi-annual droughts on
the internal and cross-border migration of
populations, greater exposure of the world
population to health hazards due to heat and
pollution, and the reduction of economic
growth, especially in developing economies,
due to rising temperatures and weather
extremes.
The results of this report demonstrate that
climate change is already very visible in various
ways. More ambitious climate mitigation
efforts are needed to keep the warming below
2 °C by the end of the century.
Concentrations of greenhouse gases,
particularly CO2, continue to rise. The year 2019
ended with a global average temperature of
1.1 °C above estimated pre-industrial averages,
second only to the record set in 2016. Without
the role of El Niño in the warming increase
observed in 2016, 2019 would have been a
record year.
Temperature is one indicator of the ongoing
climate change. Also, sea levels are rising at
an increasing pace, through greater warming
of the oceans, on the surface and in the
depths, and through the enhanced melting
of Greenland’s ice and of glaciers, exposing
coastal areas and islands to a greater risk of
flooding and the submersion of low-lying
areas.
Furthermore, in 2019, heatwaves, combined
with long periods of drought, were linked to
wildfires of unprecedented size. This was the
case in Australia, where millions of hectares
were set ablaze, and in Siberia and other Arctic
regions hit by wildfires of record intensity.

The World Meteorological Organization will
continue to follow closely climate variability
and change and their impact. An information
portal is being set up to allow indicators of
the state of the climate to be tracked.
I would like to thank the many expert teams
in climatology and other disciplines, National
Meteorological and Hydrological Services, the
global and regional centres for climate data
collection and analysis and the United Nations
sister agencies. Thanks to their unfailing
collaboration, the WMO Statement on the
State of the Global Climate has become a
flagship publication providing policymakers
all over the world with essential climate
information.

Statement by the United Nations
Secretary-General
We are currently way off track to meeting
either the 1.5 °C or 2 °C targets that the Paris
Agreement calls for. We need to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by 45% from 2010
levels by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by
2050. And for that, we need political will and
urgent action to set a different path.
This report outlines the latest science and
illustrates the urgency for far-reaching climate
action. It brings together data from across
the fields of climate science and lists the
potential future impacts of climate change
– from health and economic consequences
to decreased food security and increased
displacement.
Climate change is the defining challenge of
our time. Time is fast running out for us to
avert the worst impacts of climate disruption
and protect our societies from the inevitable
impacts to come.
Science tells us that, even if we are successful
in limiting warming to 1.5 °C, we will face
significantly increased risks to natural and
human systems. Yet, the data in this report
show that 2019 was already 1.1 °C warmer
than the pre-industrial era. The consequences
are already apparent. More severe and
frequent floods, droughts and tropical storms,
dangerous heatwaves and rising sea levels
are already severely threatening lives and
livelihoods across the planet.

4

I call on everyone – from government, civil
society and business leaders to individual
citizens – to heed these facts and take urgent
action to halt the worst effects of climate
change. We need more ambition on mitigation,
adaptation and finance in time for the climate
conference (COP26) to be held in Glasgow in
November. That is the only way to ensure a
safer, more prosperous and sustainable future
for all people on a healthy planet.

Key messages

Global atmospheric mole fractions
of greenhouse gases reached record
levels in 2018 with carbon dioxide (CO2)
at 407.8±0.1 parts per million (ppm),
methane (CH4) at 1869±2 parts per billion
(ppb) and nitrous oxide (N2O) at 331.1±0.1
ppb. These values constitute, respectively,
147%, 259% and 123% of pre-industrial
levels. Early indications show that the
rise in all three – CO2, CH4 and N2O –
continued in 2019.

The ocean absorbs around 90% of
the heat that is trapped in the Earth
system by rising concentrations
of greenhouse gases. Ocean heat
content, which is a measure of this
heat accumulation, reached recordhigh levels again in 2019.

The global mean temperature
for 2019 was 1.1±0.1 °C above
pre-industrial levels. The year 2019 is
likely to have been the second warmest
in instrumental records. The past five
years are the five warmest on record,
and the past decade, 2010–2019, is
also the warmest on record. Since the
1980s, each successive decade has been
warmer than any preceding one
since 1850.

The year 2019 saw low sea-ice
extent in both the Arctic and
the Antarctic. The daily Arctic sea-ice
extent minimum in September 2019
was the second lowest in the satellite
record. In Antarctica, variability in
recent years has been high with the
long-term increase offset by a large
drop in extent in late 2016. Extents
have since remained low, and 2019
saw record-low extents in some
months.

As the ocean warms it expands and
sea levels rise. This rise is further
increased by the melting of ice on
land, which then flows into the sea.
Sea level has increased throughout the
altimeter record, but recently sea level
has risen at a higher rate due partly
to increased melting of ice sheets in
Greenland and Antarctica. In 2019,
the global mean sea level reached its
highest value since the beginning of
the high-precision altimetry record
(January 1993).

Over the decade 2009–2018,
the ocean absorbed around 23% of
the annual CO2 emissions, lessening
the increase in atmospheric
concentrations. However, CO2
absorbed in sea water decreases
its pH, a process called ocean
acidification. Observations from openocean sources over the last 20 to 30
years show a clear decrease in average
pH at a rate of 0.017–0.027 pH units
per decade since the late 1980s.

Global Climate Indicators describe the
changing climate, providing a broad picture
of climate change at a global level that goes
beyond temperature. They provide important
information for the domains most relevant to
climate change, including the composition of
the atmosphere, the energy changes that arise
from the accumulation of greenhouse gases and
other factors, and the responses of land, oceans
and ice. Key Global Climate Indicators include
global mean surface temperature, atmospheric
greenhouse gas concentrations, ocean heat
content, global sea level, ocean acidification,
sea-ice extent and the mass balance of glaciers
and ice sheets.

TEMPERATURE
The global mean temperature for 2019 was
around 1.1 ± 0.1 °C above the 1850–1900
baseline, used as an approximation of preindustrial levels. The year 2019 is likely
to be the second warmest on record. The
WMO assessment is based on five global
temperature datasets1 (Figure 1), with four of
the five putting 2019 in second place and one
dataset placing it third warmest. The spread
of the five estimates is between 1.05 °C and
1.18 °C.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) Special Report: Global Warming
of 1.5 °C (IPCC SR15) concluded that “Humaninduced warming2 reached approximately
1 °C (likely between 0.8 °C and 1.2 °C) above
pre-industrial levels in 2017, increasing at
0.2 °C (likely between 0.1 °C and 0.3 °C) per
decade (high confidence)”. An update of the
figures for 2019 is consistent with continued
warming in the range of 0.1–0.3 °C per decade.
The year 2016, which began with an
exceptionally strong El Niño, remains the
warmest on record. Weak El Niño conditions
in the first half of 2019 may have made a small
contribution to the high global temperatures

in 2019, but there was no clear increase in
temperature at the start of the year as was
seen in early 2016.
The past five years, 2015–2019, are the five
warmest on record. The last five-year (2015–
2019) and ten-year (2010–2019) averages are
also the warmest on record.3 Since the 1980s,
each successive decade has been warmer
than any preceding one since 1850.
Although the overall warmth of the year is
clear, there were variations in temperature
anomalies across the globe. Most land areas
were warmer than the recent average (1981–
2010, Figure 2). The year 2019 was among
the top three warmest on record since at
least 1950 over Africa. Other continental
averages were among the three warmest,
except the average for North America, which
was nominally 14th warmest. The US State
of Alaska was exceptionally warm. Areas of
notable warmth for the year include large
areas of the Arctic, central and eastern
Europe, southern Africa, mainland southeast Asia, parts of Australia (where it was
the warmest and the driest year on record),
north-east Asia and parts of Brazil. Outside
of North America, there were limited areas
of below-average temperature over land.

GREENHOUSE GASES AND OZONE
Global averaged mole fractions of greenhouse
gases are calculated from in situ observations
at multiple sites, obtained through the Global
Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Programme of
WMO. These data are available from the World
Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases operated
by the Japan Meteorological Agency.4 The
year 1750 is used as a representative baseline
for pre-industrial conditions.
Increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere are a major driver of climate change.
Atmospheric concentrations reflect a balance
between sources (including emissions) and
sinks. Global CO2 concentrations reflect the
balance between emissions due to human
activities and uptake by the biosphere and ocean.
In 2018, greenhouse gas mole fractions reached
new highs, with globally averaged mole
fractions of CO2 at 407.8±0.1 ppm, CH4 at 1869±2
ppb and N2O at 331.1±0.1 ppb (Figure 3). The
annual increases in the three main greenhouse
gases were larger than the increases in the
previous year and the 10-year averaged growth
rates. The global averaged mole fractions in
2018 constitute, respectively, 147%, 259% and
123% of pre-industrial (1750) levels.

Global average figures for 2019 will not be
available until late 2020, but real-time data
from specific locations, including Mauna Loa
(Hawaii) and Cape Grim (Tasmania) indicate
that levels of CO2, CH4 and N2O continued to
increase in 2019.

were on average 34.7 ± 1.8 GtCO2 (billions of
tonnes) per year, growing at an average rate
of 0.9% per year to reach a record 36.6 GtCO2
in 2018. Carbon dioxide emissions from land
use change were 5.5 ± 2.6 GtCO2 for the same
period with no clear trend (Figure 4).

The IPCC SR15 report found that limiting
warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels
implies reaching net zero CO 2 emissions
globally around 2050 and concurrent deep
reductions in emissions of non-CO2 forcers,
particularly methane.

In the 2009–2018 decade, both atmospheric
CO 2 concentration and its grow th rate
increased, and land and ocean CO 2 sinks
continued to grow in response to the rise in
atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The land
and ocean CO2 sinks remove about 45% of all
anthropogenic CO2 emissions. A preliminary
projection of global fossil CO2 emissions, using
data from the first three quarters of 2019,
suggested that emissions would grow 0.6%
in 2019, with a range of -0.2% to +1.5% that
includes the possibility of no growth or even
slight decline in emissions relative to 2018.
Fire emissions in deforestation zones indicate
that emissions from land use change for 2019
were above the 2009–2018 average. In 2019,
the growth rate in atmospheric CO2 was 19.1 ±
3.3 GtCO2, above the 2009–2018 average, with
the increase driven by rising CO2 emissions.
The preliminary estimates for the ocean and
land CO2 sink in 2019 were 9.5 GtCO2 and 14.3
GtCO2 respectively, both above their decadal
average.

CARBON BUDGET
Accurate assessment of anthropogenic CO2
emissions and their redistribution among the
atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere
– the “global carbon budget”5 – is important
to better understand the global carbon cycle,
support the development of climate policies,
and project future climate change.
Fossil CO2 emissions have increased steadily
over the past two centuries, with brief
interruptions due to minor falls associated
with major economic downturns such as
recessions or oil price shocks. Over the
2009–2018 decade, for which complete data
are available, global fossil CO 2 emissions

Ozone hole area – Southern hemisphere

30

Following the success of the Montreal Protocol,
the use of halons and chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs) has been reported as discontinued.
Their levels in the atmosphere are monitored
to understand the continued effect they have
on the ozone layer and to detect unexpected
changes. Recent studies reported a slowdown
in the decline of the atmospheric concentration
of CFC-11 after 2012,6 connecting it to an increase
in global emissions to which emissions from
eastern Asia contributed. Because of their long
atmospheric lifetime, these compounds will
remain in the atmosphere for many decades.
Even if there were no new emissions, there
is more than enough chlorine and bromine
present in the atmosphere to cause complete
destruction of ozone at certain altitudes
in Antarctica from August to December.
Consequently, the formation of the ozone
hole continues to be an annual spring event
with year to year variation in its size and depth
largely governed by meteorological conditions.

25

The 2019 ozone hole developed relatively
early and continued growing until a sudden
stratospheric warming in September disturbed
the progression of the ozone destruction and
led to the ozone hole being smaller and weaker
than the long-term mean. The area of ozone
depletion was below the long-term mean and
the minimum ozone remained above the longterm mean until the beginning of November,
several weeks earlier than usual. The ozone
hole area reached its maximum for 2019 on
8 September, with 16.4 million km2. By way
of comparison, it reached 29.9 million km2 on
9 September 2000 and 29.6 million km2 on
24 September 2006, according to an analysis
from the US National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) (Figure 5).

content is a measure of global warming, as
it represents a large proportion of the heat
accumulating in the climate system. Thermal
expansion from ocean warming, combined
with melting of ice on land, leads to sea level
rise, which affects coastal areas. Changes in
ocean chemistry associated with rising CO2
concentrations in the atmosphere are altering
the pH of the oceans.

OCEAN HEAT CONTENT
Ocean heat content (OHC) is a fundamental
metric for climate change as it is a measure
of heat accumulation in the Earth system.
Human-induced atmospheric composition
changes cause a radiative imbalance at the top
of the atmosphere – Earth’s energy imbalance
– which is driving global warming.7 Due to
the ocean’s large heat capacity, the majority
(~90%) of this accumulated heat is stored in
the global ocean.
Consequently, the ocean is warming,
with wide-reaching impacts on the Earth
climate system. For example, OHC increase
contributes more than 30% of observed global
mean sea-level rise through thermal expansion
of sea water. 8 Ocean warming is altering
ocean currents9,10 and indirectly altering storm

tracks.11,12 The implications of ocean warming
are widespread across Earth’s cryosphere
too, as floating ice shelves become thinner
and ice sheets retreat.13,14,15,16 Ocean warming
increases ocean stratification and, together
with ocean acidification and deoxygenation,
can lead to dramatic changes in ecosystem
assemblages and biodiversity, to population
extinction, coral bleaching, infectious diseases,

changes in behaviour (including reproduction)
and redistribution of habitats.17,18,19
Historical measurements back to the 1940s
mostly relied on shipboard techniques, which
constrained the availability of subsurface
temperature observations at global scale
and at depth. 20 Global-scale estimates of
OHC are thus often limited to the period from
1960 onwards, and to a vertical integration
from the surface down to a depth of 700 m.
With the deployment of the Argo network of
autonomous profiling floats, which reached
target coverage in 2006, it is now possible
to routinely measure OHC changes down to
a depth of 2000 m21 (Figure 6).
In 2019, OHC in the upper 700 m (a series of
measurements starting in the 1950s) and in
the upper 2000 m (a series of measurements
starting in 2006) continued to rise reaching
record or near-record levels, with the average
for the year exceeding the previous record
highs set in 2018. In the last quarter of the
decade and compared to the historical heat
uptake since 1960, global ocean heat gain
has increased in the upper (0–700 m) layer,
and heat has been sequestered in the deeper
ocean layers (0–2000 m).

MHW categories of 2019
NOAA OISST; Climatology period: 1982–2011
(a)

For 2019 (Figure 7), the number of MHW
days averaged over the entire ocean was
approximately 55 days per pixel, nearly
2 months of unusually warm temperatures.
More of the ocean had an MHW classified as
strong (41%) rather than moderate (29%), and
84% of the ocean experienced at least one
MHW. In large areas of the north-east Pacific,
MHWs reached the “severe” category. From
2014 to 2016, sea-surface temperatures in the
area were also unusually high and the mass
of warmer than average waters was dubbed
the “blob”. 24,25 Another notable area is the
Tasman Sea, where there has been a series
of MHWs in the summers of 2015/2016, 26
2017/201827 and again in 2018/2019. In late
2019, an extreme MHW also affected the
area to the east of New Zealand. Climate

As with heatwaves on land, extreme heat can
affect the near-surface layer of the oceans
with a range of consequences for marine
life and dependent communities. Satellite
retrievals of sea-surface temperature can be
used to monitor marine heatwaves (MHWs).
In this case, MHWs are categorized as follows:
moderate, when the sea-surface temperature is
above the 90th percentile of the climatological
distribution for five days or longer;23 strong,
if the difference from the long-term average
is more than twice that between the 90th
percentile and the long-term mean; severe, if
the difference from the long-term average is
more than three times as large, and extreme, if
that difference is more than four times as large.

SEA LEVEL
In 2019, the sea level continued to rise
(Figure 8, left), with the global mean sea
level reaching its highest value since the
beginning of the high-precision altimetry
record (January 1993). The average rate of
rise is estimated at 3.24 ± 0.3 mm yr –1 over
the 27 year period, but the rate has increased
over that time. A greater loss of ice mass
from the ice sheets is the main cause of the
accelerated rise in the global mean sea level8
on top of steady increases from the expansion
of ocean waters driven by warming.

These values are based on when in the year a pixel first experiences its highest MHW category, so no pixel is counted more
than once.

30

This is taken by finding the cumulative MHW days per pixel for the entire ocean and dividing that by the overall number of
ocean pixels (~690 000).

Interannual variability (Figure 8, right) in sea-level
rise is mainly driven by the El Niño-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO, see also the section Drivers
of short-term climate variability). During El
Niño, water from tropical river basins on land is
transferred to the ocean by shifts in precipitation
and run-off (as was the case in 1997, 2012 and
2015). During La Niña, the opposite occurs, with
a transfer of water from the ocean to land (for
example, in 2011).31

Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, east of New
Zealand in the Pacific Ocean, and east of Rio de

In the northern hemisphere, an eastward,
elongated pattern is also seen in the North
Pacific. A previously strong pattern seen in
the western tropical Pacific over the first two
decades of the altimetry record is now fading,
suggesting that it was not a long-term signal.
Non-uniform sea-level trends are dominated
by geographical variations in OHC32,33 but also
depend on processes involving the atmosphere,
geosphere and cryosphere.

are more difficult to distinguish, due to the
complexity of the environment and the variety
of influences on it. These changes affect
ocean services that are centred on the coast,
which are important for human well-being,
such as fisheries and aquaculture, tourism
and recreation. Strong seasonal patterns
and variability in pH are evident in recent
monitoring efforts in the Southern Ocean
around New Zealand (Figure 10), highlighting
the need for sustained long-term observations
with high temporal and spatial resolution.

OCEAN ACIDIFICATION
In the decade 2009–2018, the ocean absorbed
around 23% of annual CO2 emissions,34 which
helps to alleviate the impact of climate
change. However, increasing atmospheric
CO2 concentrations alter the chemistry of the
ocean as CO2 reacts with seawater decreasing
its pH and increasing the acidity of the ocean.
This process is called ocean acidification.
The change in pH is linked to other shifts
in carbonate chemistry that decrease the
ability of some marine organisms – such as
mussels, crustacean and corals – to calcify. The
combined changes affect marine life, lessening
the potential for growth and reproduction.
Observations from open-ocean sources over
the last 20 to 30 years show a clear decrease
in average pH, with a decline of the average
global surface ocean pH of 0.017–0.027 pH
units per decade since the late 1980s.

DEOXYGENATION
Both observations and numerical models
indicate that oxygen is declining in the
modern open and coastal oceans, including
estuaries and semi-enclosed seas. Since the
middle of the last century, there has been an
estimated 1%–2% decrease (that is, 2.4–4.8
Pmol or 77 billion–145 billion tons) in the
global ocean oxygen inventory.35,36 However,
ocean observations at 200-m depths show

SEA ICE

CRYOSPHERE

Arctic (as well as sub-Arctic) sea ice has seen
a long-term decline in all months during the
satellite era (1979–present, Figure 12), with
the largest relative losses in late summer,
around the time of the annual minimum in
September, with regional variations.

The cryosphere includes solid precipitation,
snow cover, sea ice, lake and river ice,
glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, permafrost and
seasonally-frozen ground. The cryosphere
provides key indicators of a changing climate,
yet it is one of the most under-sampled
domains of the Earth system. Many of the
components are measured at the surface,
but spatial coverage is generally poor. Some,

The 2019 Arctic winter maximum daily seaice extent (14.78 million km2), reached around
13 March, was the 7th lowest maximum on
record, 38 and the March monthly average
was also the 7 th lowest (Figure 12). The
Arctic summer minimum daily sea-ice extent
(4.15 million km2), which occurred around
18 September, was tied with 2007 and 2016 as
the second lowest on record.39 The September

monthly average extent was nominally the
3rd lowest on record.40
Extents remained very low till November,
with the ice edge advancing more slowly than
normal in the Beaufort, Chukchi, Kara and
Barents Seas. Around Svalbard, however, the
sea ice returned to near average conditions.41
From April to November 2019, monthly extents
were among the three lowest on record for
those months, with the monthly extent for
October being the lowest on record.
Ice conditions varied considerably during the
2018/2019 winter in the Arctic regional seas.
Although ice extent was extremely low in
the Bering Sea, it was close to normal in the
adjacent Sea of Okhotsk. Northerly winds
in the Barents Sea region, from January to
August 2019, meant that ice extent was close

to normal in the northern part of this area,
unlike the past decade when it was lower
than average. Winter 2018/2019 brought early
ice formation on the Great Lakes of North
America and above-average ice coverage. The
maximum ice coverage on the Great Lakes
was 145% of the long-term average and the
7th highest since 1972/1973.42
Until 2016, Antarctic sea-ice extent had
shown a small long-term increase (Figure 13).
In late 2016, this was interrupted by a sudden
drop in extent to extremely low values. Since
then, Antarctic sea-ice extent has remained at
relatively low levels. The year 2019 saw three
months with record-low monthly extents
(May, June and July). Late austral winter and
spring saw extents that were closer to the
long-term average, but November had its 2nd
lowest extent on record, and December its

4th or 5th lowest. The minimum daily sea-ice
extent (2.47 million km2), reached around
28 February, was the 7th lowest on record.
The maximum daily sea-ice extent (18.40
million km2) was reached around 30 September.

GLACIERS
Glaciers are formed from snow that has
compacted to form ice, which can deform
and flow downhill to lower, warmer altitudes,
where it melts or, if the glacier terminates in the
ocean, breaks up forming icebergs. Glaciers
are sensitive to changes in temperature,
precipitation and incoming solar radiation
as well as other factors such as changes in
basal lubrication or the loss of buttressing
ice shelves.
According to the World Glacier Monitoring
Service, in the hydrological year 2017/2018,
observed glaciers experienced an ice loss of
0.89 metre water equivalent (m w.e.) (Figure 14).
Preliminary results for 2019, based on a subset
of glaciers, indicate that the hydrological year
2018/2019 was the thirty-second consecutive
year of negative mass balance, with an ice
loss in excess of 1 m w.e. Eight out of the ten
most negative mass-balance years have been
recorded since 2010. The cumulative loss of
ice since 1970 amounts to over 23 m w.e.
The year 2019 saw major losses in ice
volume from Swiss glaciers, as reported by
the Cryospheric Commission of the Swiss
Academy of Sciences,43 though overall losses

were lower than in the previous two years.
In late spring, snow cover on the glaciers
was around 20% to 40% above normal and,
although the onset of melt was relatively late,
the rate of loss reached record levels in late
June and early July during a two-week period
of intense heat. Melting continued until the
beginning of September. In the 12 months
to October 2019, around 2% of Switzerland’s
total glacier volume was lost. Over the past
five years, the loss has exceeded 10%, the
highest rate of decline in more than a century
of records.

GREENLAND ICE SHEET
Changes in the mass of the Greenland ice
sheet reflect the combined effects of surface
mass balance (SMB) – defined as the difference
between snowfall and run-off from the
Greenland ice sheet, which is always positive
at the end of the year – and mass losses at
the periphery from the calving of icebergs
and the melting of glacier tongues that meet
the ocean.44
The total ac cumulated SMB bet ween
September 2018 and August 2019 (Figure
15, left) was 169 Gt, which is the 7th lowest on
record. Nine of the 10 lowest SMB years since
1981 have been observed in the last 13 years.
By way of comparison, the average SMB for
1981–2010 is 368 Gt, and the lowest SMB
was 38 Gt in 2012. The surface mass balance
was below normal almost everywhere in
Greenland except the southeast (Figure 15,

right). This was due to a dry winter, a very
early start of the melting season and a long,
dry, warm summer.
As noted earlier, SMB is always positive at the
end of the year, but the ice sheet also loses
ice through calving of icebergs and melting
where the glacier tongues meet warm sea
water. With satellites we can measure the
ice velocity of the outlet glaciers around the
edges of the ice sheet, and from that we can
estimate how much ice is lost through calving
and ocean melting. The analysis for 2018/2019
gives a loss of about 498 Gt. In comparison,
the ice sheet lost an average of about 462
Gt per year as icebergs and through ocean
melting over the period 1986–2018.
Combining a gain in SMB of 169 Gt with ice loss
from calving and ocean melting of 498 Gt gives
a net ice loss for 2018/2019 of 329 Gt. To put
this in context, data from the Gravity Recovery
and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites
tell us that Greenland lost about 260 Gt of ice
per year over the period 2002–2016, with a
maximum of 458 Gt in 2011/2012. So, the 329
Gt of this season is well above the average,
but not a record loss.

DRIVERS OF SHORT-TERM CLIMATE
VARIABILITY
The ocean plays several important roles in
the climate. Surface temperatures change
relatively slowly over the ocean so recurring
patterns in sea-surface temperature can be
used to understand and, in some cases, predict
the more rapidly changing patterns of weather
over land on seasonal time scales. Two factors,
in particular, that can help to understand the
climate of 2019, are the El Niño-Southern
Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole.

EL NIÑO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION
The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is
one of the most important drivers of year-toyear variability in global weather patterns.
El Niño events, characterized by warmer
than average sea-surface temperatures in
the eastern Pacific and a weakening of the
trade winds, are associated with higher global
temperatures. Cooler global temperatures
often accompany La Niña events, which are
characterized by cooler than average seasurface temperatures in the eastern Pacific
and a strengthening of the trade winds.

Record global temperatures in 2016 followed
an unusually strong El Niño event in late 2015
and early 2016. In contrast, 2019 started with
neutral or weak El Niño conditions.45 Seasurface temperatures reached or exceeded
typical El Niño thresholds from October
2018 through the first half of 2019, but an
atmospheric response was absent in the
early stages of the event. Atmospheric
indicators such as weakened trade winds
and increased cloudiness at the dateline
did not show consistently until February.
Thereafter, coupling between the ocean
and the atmosphere maintained sea-surface
temperatures at borderline El Niño levels
until the middle of the year.

INDIAN OCEAN DIPOLE
The positive phase of the Indian Ocean
Dipole (IOD) is characterized by cooler
than average sea-surface temperatures in
the eastern Indian Ocean and warmer than
average sea-surface temperatures in the
west. The negative phase has the opposite
pattern. The resulting change in the gradient
of sea-surface temperature across the ocean
basin affects the weather of the surrounding
continents.
In 2019, the IOD started weakly positive and
became progressively more positive from
May to October, ultimately becoming one
of the strongest positive IOD events since
reliable records began around 1960. The IOD
index declined somewhat before the end
of the year. The positive phase of the IOD
during austral winter and spring has been
associated with drier and warmer conditions
over Indonesia and surrounding countries, as
well as parts of Australia. Indeed, Australia
has seen unusually dry conditions during
winter and spring exacerbating long-term
rainfall deficits. The positive IOD is also
linked to late withdrawal of the south-west
Indian monsoon, as was observed this year,
and to high rainfall in the later part of the
year in east Africa. For more details on
regional impacts, see the following sections:
Heavy rainfall and floods, Drought and
Case study: Severe climatic shocks lead to
a deterioration of the food security situation
and to population displacement in the Greater
Horn of Africa in 2019.

HIGH-IMPACT EVENTS IN 2019
The following sections describe some of
the high-impact events that occurred in
2019. Information on such events is largely
based on contributions from WMO Members
with additional information from the Global
Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC),
Regional Climate Centres and tropical storm
monitoring centres.

HEAT AND COLD WAVES
The year 2019 also saw numerous major
heatwaves. Amongst the most significant
were two heatwaves that occurred in Europe
in late June and late July (Figure 16). The
first one reached its maximum intensity in
southern France, where a national record of
46.0 °C (1.9 °C above the previous record) was
set on 28 June at Vérargues (Hérault). It also
affected much of western Europe. The second
one was more extensive, with national records
set in Germany (42.6 °C), the Netherlands
(40.7 °C), Belgium (41.8 °C), Luxembourg
(40.8 °C) and the United Kingdom (38.7 °C).
The heat also extended to the Nordic countries,
where Helsinki had its highest temperature
on record (33.2 °C) on 28 July. At some longterm stations, records were broken by 2 °C or
more, including Paris, where a temperature of
42.6 °C, at the main Montsouris observatory
on 25 July, was 2.2 °C above the previous
record set in 1947, and Uccle (near Brussels),
whose 39.7 °C was 3.1 °C above the previous
record (for impacts, see the section Extreme
heat and health).
Japan experienced two heatwaves that were
notable in different ways. The first occurred in
late May, with unusually high temperatures,
including 39.5 °C (the equal highest on record
for any time of year on the island of Hokkaido),
but limited impacts. The second, in July, was
less unusual in a meteorological sense but had
much greater health impacts as it occurred
during the peak of summer and was focused
in the more heavily populated area of Honshu.
Australia had an exceptionally hot summer in
2018–2019. The mean summer temperature
was the highest on record by almost 1 °C,
and January was Australia’s hottest month
on record. Most of the country was affected,

http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/wcasp/documents/WMO_ENSO_May19_Eng.pdf

with the most extreme anomalies occurring
in inland New South Wales. The heat was
most notable for its persistence but there
were also significant individual extremes,
including 46.6 °C at Adelaide on 24 January,
the city’s highest temperature on record. The
heat extended to New Zealand at the end of
January, with record highs on 29 January at
Hamilton (32.9 °C) and Wellington (30.3 °C),
and significant wildfires in the north of South
Island. There was further extreme heat in
December, which was the hottest on record
for Australia and included Australia’s hottest
area-averaged day on record (41.9 °C) on
18 December, whilst Nullarbor Roadhouse
reached 49.9 °C on 19 December, the highest
temperature in Australia since 1998. In total,
Australia’s seven hottest days on record, and
nine of the ten hottest, occurred in 2019.
Another major heatwave of the southern
hemisphere summer occurred in southern
South America in late January and early
February. The initial stage of the heatwave
peaked in central Chile, with records set in
a number of locations, including Santiago
(38.3 °C on 27 January). The following week,
exceptionally high temperatures reached the
far south of the continent: 30.8 °C at Rio Grande
(Argentina, 53.8° S), on 4 February, is believed
to be the southernmost recorded instance of
a temperature of 30 °C.
Whilst the absolute highest temperatures in the
Middle East were not as high as some observed
in recent years, some were noteworthy: 49.9 °C
at Sedom, on 17 July, was Israel’s highest
temperature since at least 1942. Extreme heat
also affected India in the pre-monsoon period
in May and early June. A number of recordhigh temperatures were set, including 48.0 °C
at New Delhi Airport on 10 June.
Consistent with a warm year globally and
an overall warming trend, extreme cold was
less common than extreme heat. One area of
below-average temperature for 2019 was North
America (Figure 2). The year’s most significant
cold spell was in late winter in central North
America. This started with an intense cold wave
in the United States Midwest in late January,
including an Illinois state record of −38.9 °C at
Mount Carroll on 31 January, followed by very
persistent cold through February and early
March in inland western areas on both sides
of the United States-Canada border. February
mean temperatures were more than 15 °C

below normal in places, including Great Falls
(Montana), whose monthly mean of −17.9 °C
was 15.3 °C below normal and more than
5 °C below the previous record. It was also
the coldest February on record for several
regions in western Canada, including the city
of Vancouver, and the first half of the year in
parts of eastern Canada was rather cold.
There were further outbreaks of unseasonable
cold and early-season snowfall in the western
and central interior of North America in late
September and late October. Record-low
temperatures for October were set for eight
states in the northern and western United
States late in the month, in marked contrast
to the record-high temperatures for the month
set in ten southern and eastern states early in
the month. Heavy snow in mid-October, with
falls of up to 74 cm, caused major disruption
and power outages in Manitoba (Canada). The
first half of November was also unusually
cold in many parts of the northern United
States and southern Canada.

While temperatures were near or above
average, very heavy winter and early spring
precipitation led to an unusually heavy
snowpack in many parts of the European
Alps. More than 300 cm of snow fell in
parts of the Austrian Alps between 4 and
15 January, whilst spring snowfalls led to

a record-high snow depth for 1 June of 270
cm at Weissfluhjoch (Switzerland, 2540 m
elevation), although very hot weather in
June led to that snow melting by early July,
close to the normal start of the snow-free
period. Numerous avalanches were reported
throughout the region during the heaviest
snowfall periods.

PRECIPITATION
Unusually dr y conditions in relation to
long-term means for 2019 (Figure 17) were
observed in Australia and western Indonesia
and surrounding countries. Also, southern
Africa, Central America and parts of South
America received abnormally low precipitation
amounts. Large areas with unusually high
precipitation amounts were observed in the
Central United States, Northern Canada,
northern Russia, South-west Asia, northern
China and eastern Africa.
There was a large precipitation deficit in
India in June as the onset of the monsoon
was delayed. However, associated with the
positive IOD phase, the withdrawal of the
Indian monsoon was also delayed and there
was an excess of precipitation in the following

months for all regions except north-east India.
In addition, positive precipitation anomalies
in eastern Africa and negative anomalies
in the Malay Archipelago and Australia are
associated with the positive IOD phase, which
prevailed through most of the second half
of 2019.
The longest period of consecutive wet days
(CWD) in 2019 was longer than average 46
in tropical South America, tropical western
Africa, tropical South-east Asia and the
Maritime Continent. In 2019, the longest period
of consecutive dry days (CDD) was longer than
normal in Australia, southern and western
Africa, central and southern South America
and northern North America. The period of
CDD was shorter than normal in South-west
Asia and the Arabian Peninsula, south-west
North America and the northern Andes region.
The number of heavy precipitation days (days
with more than 20 mm precipitation, PD20)
was above the long-term means in India, parts
of eastern Africa, parts of South America,
central North America and parts of eastern
Asia. Fewer than normal heavy precipitation
days were observed in the Maritime Continent,
central Africa and Madagascar as well as in
parts of tropical South and Central America.

Long-term means of the mentioned extreme indices are referenced to the period 1982–2016 and were calculated as follows:
The extreme index was first calculated for each year in this 35-year period, then the mean of these 35 values was referenced
as long-term mean. This non-standard definition of a long-term mean is due to the availability of reliable gridded data.

HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODS
Regular flooding occurred during the Indian
summer monsoon season, particularly in
western and northern India and neighbouring
countries. Overall, all-India rainfall for the
summer monsoon season (June–September)
was 10% above the 1961–2010 average, the
first above-average year since 2013 and the
wettest since 1994, despite below-average
June rainfall. The retreat of the monsoon
was also exceptionally late, the withdrawal
date of 9 October being the latest on record.
Over 2 200 lives were reported to have been
lost in various flooding episodes in India,
Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar during the
season. Monsoonal flooding also affected
par ts of southern China in June, with
83 deaths and over US$2.5 billion in economic
losses reported.47
The Islamic Republic of Iran was badly
affected by flooding in late March and early
April, with the Shiraz region being the worst
affected. During the event, 24-hour rainfall
totals were as high as 188 mm. At least 76
deaths were reported as well as severe
economic losses.
A tropical low brought extreme rainfall and
associated flooding in northern Queensland
(Australia) in late January and early February.
Rainfall totals over a 10-day period exceeded
2000 mm in some coastal areas around
Townsville, with Townsville itself receiving
1 259.8 mm, 48 whilst a second episode of
heavy rain in inland north-west Queensland
brought 7-day totals exceeding 600 mm. There
was major urban flooding in the Townsville
area, whilst in north-west Queensland some
rivers expanded to tens of kilometres in width.
The flooding and associated unusually cool
weather led to heavy livestock losses. Total
economic losses were estimated to be in the
order of US$2 billion.49
In March, flash flooding and associated
landslides occurred around Jayapura, in the
Indonesian province of Papua, after rainfall of
235 mm in 8 hours, with at least 112 deaths
reported. Later, an influx of tropical moisture

brought extreme rainfall to the west coast of
New Zealand’s South Island in late March,
with a national 48-hour record of 1086 mm at
Cropp River and associated major flooding.
A bridge on the region’s main highway was
washed away.
Persistent heavy rainfall affected a large
part of the central United States in late 2018
and the first half of 2019. The 12-month
rainfall averaged over the contiguous United
States for the period July 2018 to June 2019
(962 mm) was the highest on record. This
led to long-lived flooding in the Mississippi
basin, with the river remaining above flood
stage at Baton Rouge (Louisiana) for nearly
seven months, from 6 January to 4 August.
There was also significant flooding in parts
of eastern Canada in April and early May,
due to a combination of heavy rain and rapid
melting of an above-average snowpack,
particularly in the Ottawa and Montreal areas
and in New Brunswick, with 6 000 dwellings
flooded in the Ottawa region. Total economic
losses from flooding in the United States, in
2019, were estimated at US$20 billion,50 with
especially acute episodes on the Missouri
River in March, and the Arkansas River in
late May and early June.
Very wet conditions affected parts of South
America in January. There was major flooding
in northern Argentina, Uruguay and southern
Brazil, with losses in Argentina and Uruguay
estimated at US$2.5 billion. January monthly
totals exceeded 600 mm at a number of sites
in north-east Argentina.
In October and November, major flooding
affected many hitherto drought-affected
parts of east Africa (see Case study: Severe
climatic shocks lead to a deterioration of the
food security situation and to population
displacement in the Greater Horn of Africa in
2019). Earlier in the year, flooding during the
rainy season affected a number of countries,
including Sudan, Nigeria, Cameroon and
Côte d’Ivoire, although overall Sahel
seasonal rainfall was mostly fairly close
to average.

TROPICAL CYCLONES
Global tropical cyclone activity in 2019 was
above average. The northern hemisphere
had 72 tropical cyclones, compared with
the average of 59, although accumulated
cyclone energy (ACE) was only 4% above
average. The 2018–2019 southern hemisphere
season was also above average, with 27
cyclones, the highest number in a season
since 2008–2009.
It was a particularly extreme cyclone season
in the North Indian Ocean. Three cyclones
reached maximum sustained winds of 100 kn
or more, the first known instance in a single
season, and the seasonal ACE was the highest
on record by a large margin. Fani was the most
significant cyclone to affect India since 2013,
making landfall in the east, on the Odisha
coast, on 3 May, with sustained winds of
100 kn, having earlier peaked at 135 kn in the
Bay of Bengal. There was significant damage
in coastal areas and loss of life, although
extensive evacuations in affected coastal
areas greatly reduced the human impact.
Kyarr, in October, was one of the strongest
cyclones on record in the Arabian Sea, but
did not make landfall, although associated
high seas and storm surges affected some
coastal areas.
The South Indian Ocean basin also had
an active season; there were 18 cyclones
of which 13 reached hurricane intensity,

22

equalling the largest number on record.
Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall near Beira
(Mozambique) on 15 March (Figure 18), after
maximum sustained winds of 105 kn. It was
one of the strongest known cyclones to make
landfall on the east coast of Africa. There was
widespread destruction from wind and storm
surge in coastal Mozambique, especially
in the city of Beira, whilst severe flooding
extended to inland regions of Mozambique
and parts of Zimbabwe, particularly the
north-east. Over 900 deaths were associated
with the storm, the greatest known loss
of life in a southern hemisphere tropical
cyclone in at least the last 100 years. The
following month, severe Cyclone Kenneth
made landfall in a more sparsely populated
region of nor thern Mozambique where
damage was less severe.
One of the year’s most intense Tropical
Cyclones was Dorian, which reached category 5
intensity in the western Atlantic at the end of
August, making landfall in the Bahamas on
1 September, with maximum sustained winds
of 165 kn, equalling the highest on record
for a North Atlantic landfall. Dorian was also
exceptionally slow-moving and remained nearstationary over the Bahamas as a category
5 system for about 24 hours. The prolonged
extreme winds and storm surge led to neartotal destruction on a number of islands of the
Bahamas, with at least 60 deaths reported51
and economic losses estimated at more than
US$ 3 billion.52 Dorian then moved north-east,
with significant damage recorded on parts
of the United States east coast and in the
Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Tropical
Storm Imelda brought extreme rainfall to the
eastern border of Texas, also hit by Hurricane
Harvey in 2017, with rainfall totals of over
1000 mm in places. Estimated losses stand
at US$ 5 billion.50 The number of cyclones in
the North Atlantic was well above average,
but the number reaching hurricane intensity
was close to normal.
Typhoon Hagibis made landfall west of Tokyo
on 12 October, with a central pressure of
955 hPa. The major impact of Hagibis was
flooding, as a result of extreme rainfall.
Hakone, in the foothills of Mount Fuji, had
a daily total of 922.5 mm, the highest on

record for a calendar day in Japan. Many
other sites in the region west of Tokyo had
daily totals in excess of 400 mm. At least 96
deaths were reported. In September, Typhoon
Faxai contributed to major disruption in Chiba
prefecture. Earlier in the season, Typhoon
Lekima had made landfall in Zhejiang province
(China) with major flooding and heav y
economic losses reported. With maximum
wind speed at landfall of 185 km/h, Lekima
was the 5th strongest typhoon to make landfall
in China since 1949. Overall, activity in both
the North-east and North-west Pacific basins
was close to average.

SEVERE STORMS
Repeated extratropical systems affected the
Mediterranean region in the autumn, with
extreme rainfall and high winds associated
with significant damage. The most severe
events affected parts of Spain, especially
around the Alicante and Murcia regions, in midSeptember; southern France in mid-October;
and the northern Adriatic in mid-November.
Events in Spain and France both brought
24-hour rainfall totals exceeding 200 mm in
places, whilst a storm surge associated with
the November storm raised water levels in
Venice to 1.85 m, the highest since 1966 and
the 2nd highest in the instrumental record.
Italy saw regular flooding in November, which
was the wettest on record for the EmiliaRomagna region, whilst significant flooding
and wind damage was also reported in
southern Austria. There were also a number
of severe thunderstorms in the Mediterranean
region during the summer, including near
Thessaloniki (Greece) on 10–11 July, with seven
deaths reported, and in Corsica (France) on
15 July, when 30 mm of rain was reported in
six minutes.
Widespread severe thunderstorms and
associated dust storms affected Pakistan
and northern and western India in mid-April.
At least 50 deaths were reported in India
on 16–17 April with a further 39 in Pakistan;
60 deaths were reported from further severe
thunderstorms in northern India in the first
half of June.
The United States experienced its most active
tornado season since 2011. May was especially
active, with 556 tornadoes reported, the 2nd
highest number on record for any single
month. However, only one tornado reached

EF-4 intensity during the year, and casualties
were well below the long-term average.

DROUGHT
Drought affected many parts of south-east Asia
and the south-west Pacific in 2019, associated
in many cases with the strong positive IOD
phase. Exceptionally dry conditions prevailed
from mid-year onwards in Indonesia and
neighbouring countries; Singapore had its
driest July to September on record.
Further north, it was a severe drought year
in many parts of the Mekong basin. The
worst affected areas were near the ChinaLaos border, where April–September rainfall
was more than 50% below normal in places,
although heavy rain in central and southern
Laos in September eased drought conditions
there. April–July rainfall in Yunnan province
of China was the lowest since 1961. It was also
abnormally dry in parts of northern Thailand,
with January–September rainfall at Chiang
Rai 42% below normal. The Mekong River
was at or near the lowest levels observed for
the time of year in the last 30 years at various
locations in the second half of 2019.
Long-term drought conditions, which had
affected many parts of inland eastern Australia
in 2017 and 2018, expanded and intensified
in 2019, particularly in the second half of
the year, which saw Australia’s driest spring
(November and December) on record. The
worst affected areas were in the northern
half of New South Wales and adjacent border
areas of Queensland, where annual rainfall was
widely the lowest on record and up to 70%–80%
below average. Some areas had only about
half their previous record-low rainfall. Most
of the country had well below-average rainfall
(Figure 19), with the only above-average areas
being in northern Queensland, affected by the
early 2019 floods, and in western Tasmania.
The 2018/2019 wet season (October–April)
was also widely the driest since 1991–1992
in tropical areas of Western Australia and the
Northern Territory, and was marked by an
almost total lack of precipitation in the central
continent. It was the driest year on record for
Australia as a whole, for the Murray-Darling
Basin and for the states of South Australia
(where the annual total at the Marree station
was only 12 mm) and New South Wales. The
drought led to severe water shortages on the
rivers of the northern Murray-Darling Basin,

DROUGHT MONITORING IN AUSTRALIA UTILIZING PRODUCTS FROM
THE WMO SPACE-BASED WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES
MONITORING DEMONSTRATION PROJECT
Yuriy Kuleshov, Lynette Bettio, Takuji Kubota,
Tomoko Tashima, Pingping Xie, Toshiyuki
Kurino and Peer Hechler
Recognizing the need to better utilize and
improve monitoring of weather and climate
extremes from space, WMO initiated the
Space-based Weather and Climate Extremes
Monitoring Demonstration Project (SEMDP). This
project ran a demonstration phase in 2018–2019
and was focused on monitoring drought and
heavy precipitation. It was implemented in WMO
Regional Association II and Regional Association
V and its geographical domain covers SouthEast Asia and the Western Pacific Ocean area,
from 40° N to 45° S; 50° E to 160° W. The Japan
Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the
Climate Prediction Center, National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (CPC/NOAA)
provide tailored satellite data and products for
the SEMDP region.
Monthly average precipitation in the SEMDP
region for June 2019 shows very low rainfall

24

(less than 1 mm/day) over most of Australia.
Most areas received only 25% to 50% of
normal rainfall in the month of June. This
rainfall deficit, accumulated over a number
of consecutive months, resulted in drought
conditions classified as severely dry and
extremely dry (Standardized Precipitation
Index (SPI) values below –1.5 and –2.0,
respectively).
Routine examination of space-based and in
situ observations showed good agreement
over the Murray-Darling Basin, in southeastern Australia, where the density of
surface-based observations is high. However,
there are noticeable discrepancies between
the satellite and in situ observations over
the central parts of the continent where the
density of surface-based observations is very
low. This project has clearly demonstrated
the value of space-based rainfall estimates for
drought detection and monitoring, especially
for regions where rain gauge observations
are limited or unavailable.

with heavy agricultural losses and some towns
requiring water to be trucked in after their
usual water sources dried up.
The 2018/2019 rainy season was poor in many
parts of southern Africa, including central and
western South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana and
Zimbabwe. However, there were major floods in
north-east Zimbabwe in March (associated with
Cyclone Idai), and in eastern South Africa in April,
where 70 deaths were reported in KwaZulu-Natal
province after daily rainfall exceeded 200 mm in
places. Much of southern Africa also experienced
below-average rainfall in the early part of the
2019/2020 rainy season. Rainfall during the rainy
season in the western and central African Sahel
was generally close to average.
Dry conditions affected many parts of Central
America in 2019. Lake levels fell significantly
following below-average rainfall in Panama in
the first half of the year, leading to shipping
restrictions in the Panama Canal.
While conditions improved in Panama from
mid-year, it remained substantially drier than
normal in areas further north-west, including
Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and El
Salvador, until heavy rains in October. Central
Chile also had an exceptionally dry year, with
an annual total of only 82 mm in Santiago, less
than 25% of the long-term average.
It was a second successive summer with
extended dry periods in many parts of western
and central Europe, from France to the Ukraine.
Paris had 34 consecutive days without rain,
from 19 August to 21 September, equalling
the 2nd longest dry spell on record, following
an earlier 27-day dry spell, from 21 June to
17 July (ranking 6th). Low levels in the Danube
disrupted river transport in Serbia in early
autumn, whilst the Wisla River in Poland
reached its equal-lowest level on record in late
September. It was also a dry winter in many
parts of the western Mediterranean: rainfall in
Spain from January to August was 23% below
average, including the driest February of the
21st century, whilst winter rainfall over most
of Morocco was less than half the long-term
mean. In Iceland, late spring and early summer
were especially dry in the south and west. No
precipitation was recorded in Stykkishólmur
for 37 consecutive days, from 21 May to 26
June, the longest drought on record in the
station series beginning in 1856.

WILDFIRES
Wildfires, typically in response to abnormally
dry and/or warm conditions, again affected
many parts of the world in 2019. Activity
was lower than in recent years in some
known wildfire areas, such as western North
America, but major fires in California, in
October, still caused significant losses. On
the other hand, it was an above-average
fire year in several higher-latitude regions,
including Siberia (Russian Federation) and
Alaska (United States), with fire activity
occurring in some parts of the Arctic where
it was previously extremely rare. In 2019, CO2
emissions from summer wildfires in the Arctic
were the highest in the 17-year record of the
Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service
(CAMS)/ECMWF Global Fire Assimilation
System (GFASv1.2) dataset.
Australia experienced an exceptionally
prolonged and severe fire season in the
later part of 2019, with repeated major
outbreaks. Major fires began in north-east
New South Wales and southern Queensland
in early September, with further outbreaks
extending progressively southwards during
the following months, supported by very dry
conditions and several episodes of strong
westerly winds and extreme heat. The
monthly accumulated Forest Fire Danger
Index, an indicator of severe fire weather, for
December was the highest on record for any
month in Queensland, New South Wales,
South Australia and the Australian Capital
Territory. Many individual fires burned for
two months or more. The fires reached their
peak at the end of December and in the
first few days of January, with widespread
destruction in south-eastern New South
Wales, especially near the coast, and eastern
Victoria, as well as near Adelaide and on
Kangaroo Island in South Australia. As of
early 2020, 33 deaths had been reported
and over 2 000 properties had been lost,
while a total of about 7 million hectares
had been burnt in New South Wales and
Victoria. Earlier in 2019, a dry summer
in Tasmania contributed to numerous
long-lived fires in January and February,
in the normally we t ter we s tern and
central par ts of the island. This is the
second time in four years that fires have
affected regions where historically fire was
extremely rare.

The severe drought in Indonesia and
neighbouring countries led to the most
significant fire season since 2015, although
the fires and associated smoke pollution
were not as severe as in 2015.53 Fire activity
in the Amazon basin was also higher than in
recent years, particularly in August, although
it fell well short of previous severe drought
years such as 2010. The number of reported
fires in Brazil’s Amazonia region was only
slightly above the 10-year average, but total
fire activity in South America was the highest
since 2010, with Bolivia and Venezuela among
the countries with particularly active fire
years.54
While 2019 witnessed significant regional
wildfire activity around the world, the overall
global daily and annual total estimated
emissions were close to the average calculated
for the previous 17 years of the CAMS/ECMWF

dataset. GFASv1.2 combines active fire

a dataset of daily average fire radiative power
and estimated emissions of pyrogenic species,
including particulate matter, reactive gases
and greenhouse gases, as of 1 January 2003
until the time of writing.
Daily total wildfire CO2 emissions throughout
the year (Figure 20, left) generally followed
the 2003–2018 mean with increased activity,
greater than 20 Mt CO 2 per day, between
June and October, and reduced activity,
less than 20 Mt CO2 per day, throughout the
rest of the year. The largest increases above
the 17-year mean occurred in July, August,
September and at the end of December,
corresponding to the peak ac tivit y of
wildfires in the Arctic, Siberia, Indonesia
and Australia respectively.
The global annual total CO2 emissions from
wildfires for 2019 (Figure 20, right) were higher
than the previous two years but remained
lower than most other years in the dataset,
consistent with the general decline in global
wildfire activity since 2003.

Climate-related risks and impacts
The risk of climate-related impacts depends
on complex interactions between climaterelated hazards and the vulnerabilit y,
exposure and adaptive capacity of human
and natural systems. 55 At current levels
of global greenhouse gas emissions, the
world remains on course to exceed the
agreed temperature thresholds of either
1.5 °C or 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, 56
which would increase the risk of pervasive
effects of climate change beyond what is
already seen.57,58

HEALTH AT INCREASING RISK

Climate-related events already pose risks to
society through impacts on health, food and
water security as well as human security,
livelihoods, economies, infrastructure
and biodiversity. Climate change also has
severe implications for ecosystem services.
It can affect patterns of natural resource
use, as well as the distribution of resources
across regions and within countries.

Highly-populated areas of the planet are
increasingly exposed to warmer conditions,
experiencing a mean summer temperature
change that is higher than the global average
(Figure 21).

Health effects include heat-related illness
and death; injury and loss of life associated
with severe storms and flooding; occurrences
of vector-borne and water-borne diseases;
exacerbation of cardiovascular and respiratory
diseases through air pollution; and stress and
mental trauma from displacement as well as
loss of livelihoods and property.

EXTREME HEAT AND HEALTH

Ex treme heat conditions are taking an
increasing toll on human health and health
systems. Even greater consequences are

inequalities.60 In 2018, vulnerable people over
the age of 65 experienced a record 220 million
more heatwave exposure,61 than the average
for the baseline of 1986–2005 — breaking the
previous record set in 2015 by 11 million.

In 2019, record-setting high temperatures in
Australia, India, Japan and Europe adversely
affected health and well-being. A major
heatwave affected Japan in late July and early
August 2019, resulting in over 100 deaths and
placing a great burden on the health system
with an additional 18 000 hospital admissions.
Europe experienced two significant heatwaves
in the summer of 2019. In June, a heatwave
affecting south-western and central Europe
resulted in a number of deaths in Spain
and France. The more significant heatwave
occurred in late July, affecting much of central
and western Europe. In the Netherlands, this

In me tropolit an Franc e, b e t ween the
beginning of June and mid-September, over
20 000 emergency room visits and 5 700 home

heatwaves, a total of 1 462 excess deaths
(a 9.2 % increase in average mortality, with
an uncertainty range of 548 to 2 221 excess
deaths) were observed in the affected regions.
Older people over 75, but also age groups
15–44 and 65–74 were those mostly affected.
In regions of France that experienced extreme
heat (red alerts), 572 observed excess deaths
represent a 50% increase in the mortality that
would have been expected if no heatwave
had occurred.

VECTOR-BORNE DISEASES
Changes in climatic conditions since 1950
are making it easier for the Aedes mosquito
species to transmit the dengue virus,
increasing the risk of the disease (Figure 22).
In parallel, the global incidence of dengue
has grown dramatically in recent decades,
and about half of the world’s population is
now at risk of infection.65 In 2019, the world
experienced a large increase in dengue
cases, compared with the same period in
2018. The Americas identified more than
2 800 000 suspected and confirmed dengue
cases, including around 1 250 deaths.66 In the
three months from August to October, 85%
of nearly 1 050 000 cases were reported by
Brazil, the Philippines, Mexico, Nicaragua,
Thailand, Malaysia and Colombia.67

FOOD SECURITY AND POPULATION
DISPLACEMENT CONTINUE TO BE
ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CLIMATE
VARIABILITY AND EXTREME
WEATHER
Rising global temperature and changing
rainfall patterns have already af fected
terrestrial ecosystems such as forests and
grasslands, as well as agricultural lands
and crop yields.68 Between 2006 and 2016,
agriculture (crops, livestock, forestr y,
fisheries and aquaculture) in developing
countries accounted for an estimated 26%
of total loss and damage incurred during
medium- and large-scale climate-related
disasters. While about two-thirds of loss of
and damage to crops was associated with
floods, almost 90% of loss and damage
in the livestock sector was attributable to
drought 69 (Figure 23).
In addition to conflicts, insecurity, and
economic slowdowns and downturns, climate
variability and extreme weather events are
among the key drivers of the recent rise in
global hunger and one of the leading causes

of severe crises. After a decade of steady
decline, hunger is on the rise again – over
820 million, or one in every nine people in
the world, suffered from hunger in 2018, the
latest global data available (Figure 24). The
situation is most acute in sub-Saharan Africa,
where the number of undernourished people
increased by more than 23 million between
2015 and 2018, particularly in countries
affected by conflict. Among 33 countries
with food crises in 2018, climate variability
and weather extremes were a compounding
factor together with economic shocks and
conflict in 26 countries, and the leading driver
in 12 of the 26.70 In light of this, the global
community faces an enormous challenge
to meet the Zero Hunger target of the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Number of undernourished (millions)

to reach close to 22 million in 2019,72 while
it reached 17.2 million across 148 countries
and territories in 2018. Of all natural hazards,
floods and storms have contributed the most
to displacement recorded in 2019, followed
by droughts. The Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
was actively involved in protecting and
supporting people displaced in this context,
notably in Mozambique after Cyclone Idai.
The effects of climate-related events and
disasters on the displacement of people
are not the same everywhere. Asia and
the Pacific remain the regions most prone
to sudden- and slow-onset disasters. For
instance, more than 2 million people were
evacuated in Bangladesh, the second most
disaster-prone country in the region, due
to Cyclone Bulbul in November 2019, and
more than 2 million in China, due to Typhoon
Lekima in August 2019. Latin America and
the Caribbean were also particularly affected
by climate-related events and other hazards
such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes,
which resulted in further displacement. For
instance, around 70 000 people became
homeless in the Bahamas, in September
2019, following Hurricane Dorian, and more

72

Existing refugee populations often reside in
climate “hotspots”, where they are exposed
to and affected by slow- and sudden-onset
hazards, which can also result in secondary
displacement. For instance, hundreds of
thousands of Rohingya refugees who have
fled into Bangladesh and are now residing in
Kutupalong are routinely affected by storms
and heavy rainfall and landslides. Between
January and November 2019, the camps
in the area were hit by floods, landslides
and strong winds. The Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
and partners, therefore, made preparedness
for the monsoon season a priority, including
building retaining structures on hillsides,
drainage, roads and bridges. Poor building
quality and settlement in exposed areas
have resulted in over 84 000 people being
affected out of a total population of nearly
945 000.73
Although most disaster- and climate-related
displacement is internal, displacement
across borders, which may be interrelated
with conflict or violence, also occurs.74 The
worsening drought and violence in Somalia
drove thousands of people to flee to Ethiopia,
a country that also faces adverse impacts of
climate-related events. The Lake Chad region
has seen desertification and deforestation
associated with the shrinking of Lake Chad,
extreme climate events, population growth
and unregulated irrigation. All of this, added
to violence, which has driven millions of
people from their homes in Chad, Cameroon,
Nigeria and Niger, exacerbates forced
displacement, including refugee movements,
across borders.75
In southern Africa, the start of the seasonal
rains was delayed, and there were extensive
dry periods. In May 2019, Namibia declared

a state of emergency in response to the
drought it was facing.76 Regional cereal
output is forecast to be about 8% below the
five-year average, with 12.5 million people
in the region expected to experience severe
food insecurity up to March 2020, an increase
of more than 10% on the previous year.
Food security has been deteriorating in
several areas of Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya
and Uganda due to a poor, long Gu rainy
season, which followed a below-average
2018 short Deyr season. In addition, between
October 2019 and January 2020, the region
faced widespread flooding that affected
3.4 million people.77
In March 2019, Tropical C yclone Idai
contributed to complete destruction of
close to 780 000 ha of crops in Malawi,
Mozambique and Zimbabwe, f ur ther
undermining a precarious food security
situation in the region.78 The cyclone also led
to the displacement of at least 50 905 people
in Zimbabwe,79 53 237 in southern Malawi80
and 77 019 in Mozambique.81 Furthermore,
Mozambique was hit by Cyclone Kenneth
a few weeks later, contributing to a current
total of 88 381 internally displaced persons,
mostly concentrated in the Beira and
Quelimane areas.82
Food insecurity remained severe in South
Sudan throughout 2019, with 4.54 million
people estimated to be severely food
insecure between September and December.
However, the actual number of food-insecure
people is likely to be substantially higher

than the estimate produced in August, as
widespread floods in September and October
affected about 900 000 people and resulted
in significant crop and livestock losses.83
Flash floods in Afghanistan, in March 2019,
following an intense drought from April to
October 2018, resulted in the worst flooding
in a decade in some parts of the country:
13.5 million people are food insecure, with
22 out of 34 provinces still rallying from the
severe drought faced in 2018, which had
already led to 32 515 people being displaced
in Herat alone.84 The situation is particularly
severe because an estimated 80% of soils in
the country are degraded due to cumulative
years of dry conditions.85
Dry weather persisted throughout the first half
of 2019 in the Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea after two consecutive years of dry
conditions and irregular weather patterns.
On average, only 56.3 mm of rain fell in the
country from January to March 2019, which
is the lowest on record since 1917. About
10 million people urgently require food
assistance.86
In 2019, drier than normal conditions in
the Dry Corridor of Central America and
the Caribbean led to forest fires across
northern Guatemala and Honduras, with
adverse effects on crop development, and
contributed to the drying up of some rivers in
Honduras. After below-normal rainfall from
May to August 2019, about 50 000 families
lost close to 80% of their maize production in
Guatemala. Significant crop losses (up to 70%

MARINE LIFE AND BIODIVERSITY
THREATENED BY THE CHANGING
CLIMATE AND EXTREME EVENTS
The primary pressures on living marine
resources are overexploitation, pollution from
land-based activities and climate change.88
Coral reefs are the marine ecosystem most
threatened by climate-related ocean change,
especially ocean warming and acidification.89,90
Coral reefs are projected to decline to 10%–
30% of former cover at 1.5 °C warming, and
to less than 1% at 2 °C warming. 91 Ocean
acidification may also have adverse effects
on other marine systems, including mussel
beds and some macroalgal habitats. Fisheries
are being affected by climate change in many
ways.92 As temperature and salinity profiles
change with global warming, the distribution
and productivity of important target species
are already being reflected in changes in the
distribution of fishery catches.
Long-term monitoring of the Great Barrier
Reef (GBR) showed that the hard coral cover
increased slightly from 11% in 2017 to 14% in
2019 in the northern GBR (Figure 25). However,
these values remain close to the lowest

32

levels recorded by the Australian Institute
of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring
Program (AIMS-LTMP) since 1985, associated
with the cumulative impact of cyclones and
two episodes of severe coral bleaching over
the period 2014 to 2019.93 To date, recovery
has been limited. Severe Tropical Cyclone
Debbie in 2017, and the continued southward
spread of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks,
contributed to a continuing decrease of coral
cover in the Central GBR. Average hard coral
cover declined slightly, from 14% in 2018 to
12% in 2019. Overall, mean coral cover on
reefs in the Southern GBR region continued
to decline, albeit only slightly, from 25% in
2018 to 24% in 2019.

CASE STUDY:

Severe climatic shocks lead to a deterioration
of the food security situation and to population
displacement in the Greater Horn of Africa in 2019
Alessandro Costantino, Sarah Graf and
Oscar Rojas, FAO
The food security situation deteriorated
markedly in 2019 in some countries of the
Greater Horn of Africa due to climate extremes,
displacement, conflict and violence. For
instance, in Somalia and Kenya, the number
of people affected by food insecurity increased
between late 2018 and late 2019, from 1.6
to 2.1 million and from 0.7 to 3.1 million,
respectively. By late 2019, about 22.2 million
people (6.7 million in Ethiopia, 3.1 million in
Kenya, 2.1 million in Somalia, 4.5 million in
South Sudan95 and 5.8 million in the Sudan)
were estimated to be severely food insecure,96
only a slightly lower number than during the
severe and prolonged drought of 2016–2017.97
Exceptional dryness prevailed in March and
the first twenty days of April, with cumulative
precipitation estimated to be about 80% below
average across most of the Horn of Africa.98
The unfavourable weather conditions, among
the driest on record in some parts, affected
several cropping areas, with reduced planted
zones and yields (see Figure 26). In such dry
conditions, fall armyworm infestations further
constrained yields.
Above-average precipitation in late April and
May reduced moisture deficits and improved
vegetation conditions. Heavy showers also
reduced fall armyworm infestation levels, but
damage to crops was largely irreversible in
several areas. The sharpest output contractions
were recorded in Somalia and in south-eastern
Kenya, where rainfall deficits were more severe,
and the rainy season is normally shorter than
in other countries in the region. In Somalia, the
output of the 2019 Gu harvest was the lowest
since 1995 and about 60% below the average of

the previous five years. Maize production was
estimated at about 50%–60% below the average
in agro-pastoral and marginal agricultural areas
of central, south-eastern and coastal Kenya. In
pastoral areas, the exceptionally dry conditions
in March and April, especially in central and
northern Somalia, south-eastern Ethiopia and
most of Kenya, resulted in severe weight loss
and increased mortality rates in livestock as
well as a sharp decline in milk production.99
In late 2019, cereal prices were very high in
most markets of Kenya, Uganda, Somalia and
Ethiopia, up to twice what they had been a year
earlier, thus restricting food access for large
segments of the population.100

Figure 26. Agriculture
Stress Index (ASI) for
the Greater Horn of
Africa in May 2019

The 2019 October–December short Deyr rains
were characterized by exceptionally heavy
precipitation throughout the region, which
received the highest or the 2nd highest rainfall

95

In South Sudan, the food insecurity projection for the October–December period, being conducted in August, does not take
into account the impact of flooding, so the number of people affected by food insecurity in late 2019 is likely to be significantly
higher than the estimate reported.

totals on record since 1981, between 200%
and 400% of the long-term average. Atypical
warming of the sea surface off the coast of
East Africa, part of one of the strongest Indian
Ocean Dipole (IOD) events on record, was
associated with heavy rainfall inland. While
abundant rains had a positive impact on crops
and rangelands, they also triggered widespread
floods and associated loss of life, displacement,
damage to crops and livestock deaths, mainly
in central and southern Somalia, south-eastern
Ethiopia, northern and eastern Kenya and in
South Sudan.
Climate extremes caused severe additional
threats to already precarious livelihoods in
East Africa and the Horn of Africa,101 home to
highly vulnerable communities with at least
75 million people living on incomes below
US$ 1.9 per day.102 An estimated 8.1 million
people in the region are internally displaced,
of whom at least 1.8 million are displaced by
drought and 3.5 million are asylum seekers
and refugees.103 Climate and weather extremes
further force people to move in search of
safety: in Somalia, between January and
May 2019, droughts displaced at least 60 000
people,104 while widespread floods in October
and November resulted in 370 000 additional
displacements.105 Thousands have been fleeing
to Ethiopia, a country that also faces the
adverse impacts of climate events, including
displacement. Moreover, climate-related events
are exacerbating tensions between displaced
people and their host communities, further
fuelling intra-communal conflict.
The country worst hit by the floods was South
Sudan, where about 900 000 individuals were
affected, of whom about 420 000 were displaced.

34

Large flood-induced crop losses, especially
in former Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Jonglei,
Upper Nile and Warrap states, have somewhat
offset the increased production and security
improvements due to high yields in areas
unaffected by floods. As a result, aggregate
cereal production in 2019 is estimated to be
higher than the poor 2018 output but below
the five-year average production.106 Significant
livestock losses were reported in flood-affected
areas. The flood-induced livelihood damages
have further exacerbated an already dire food
security situation: 4.54 million people (almost
40% of the total population) were projected
to be food insecure between September
and December, but the current number is
likely to be substantially higher because of the
floods.107
Uncontrolled locust reproduction in the Arabian
Peninsula, coupled with unusual weather and
climate conditions in East Africa, resulted in
the worst desert locust outbreak in 25 years
in the Horn of Africa and the most serious
in 70 years for Kenya. In late 2019, the locust
outbreak affected eastern Ethiopia and central/
southern Somalia; by January 2020, it had
spread to northern Kenya, and by June 2020
is expected to spread to southern Ethiopia,
north-eastern Uganda and eastern South Sudan.
Large swarms such as the ones that appeared
over Kenya can eat the same amount of food as
80 million people in a single day, and affected
areas can experience the total loss of crops
and fodder. Sustained locust reproduction is
expected until June 2020 and “represents an
unprecedented threat to food security and
livelihoods in the region, and could lead to
further suffering, displacement and potential
conflict”.108,109
