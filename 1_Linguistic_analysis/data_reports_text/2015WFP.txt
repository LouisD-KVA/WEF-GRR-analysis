Level 3, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s highest category of emergency, requires
mobilisation of a WFP global, corporate response. Level 2 emergency response operations
require regional augmentation of country level response capabilities.

SOUTH SUDAN
South Sudan faced persistent conflict and economic
crisis. Food and fuel prices rose sharply in the second
half of 2015, limiting food availability in a country
highly dependent on importing basic goods.
Amid serious access challenges, WFP and its partners
created and deployed Rapid Response Teams when
security conditions allowed.
WFP assisted 2.9 million vulnerable people over the
year.

SYRIA
The continuing Syria crisis has caused the largest
displacement in the world. Millions have been forced
to leave their homes; there are 6.5 million IDPs and
4.3 million refugees in neighbouring countries.
WFP provided food assistance to 4.9 million people
and supported almost 2 million refugees in
neighbouring countries in 2015. Food assistance for
more than half a million people was delivered
through cross-border convoys from Turkey and
Jordan, delivering family food rations to oppositionheld, hard-to-reach areas.
