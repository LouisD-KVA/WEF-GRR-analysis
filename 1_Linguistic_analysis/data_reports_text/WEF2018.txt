World Economic Forum

The World Economic Forum presents
the latest Global Risks Report at a
transformational time for the world.
Encouraging signs suggest that we
have put the worst financial crisis of
the post–World War II period behind
us. Globally, people are enjoying the
highest standards of living in human
history. And yet acceleration and
interconnectedness in every field
of human activity are pushing the
absorptive capacities of institutions,
communities and individuals to their
limits. This is putting future human
development at risk. In addition to
dealing with a multitude of discrete
local problems, at a global level
humanity faces a growing number
of systemic challenges, including
fractures and failures affecting
the environmental, economic,
technological and institutional systems
on which our future rests.
This generation enjoys unprecedented
technological, scientific and financial
resources, which we should use
to chart a course towards a more
sustainable, equitable and inclusive
future. And yet this is perhaps the first
generation to take the world to the
brink of a systems breakdown. There
are many signs of progress and many
reasons for hope—but we still lack the
momentum and the necessary depth
of collaboration to deliver change
on the scale required. By providing
a global platform for public-private
collaboration, the World Economic
Forum seeks to advance this goal by
working with governments, businesses
and civil society organizations to find
new ways of tackling the systemic
risks that affect us all.
We have to work together—that is the
key to preventing crises and making
the world more resilient for current
and future generations. Humanity
cannot successfully deal with the
multiplicity of challenges we face
either sequentially or in isolation.
Just as global risks are increasingly
complex, systemic and cascading, so
our responses must be increasingly
interconnected across the numerous
global systems that make up our
world. Multistakeholder dialogue
remains the keystone of the strategies
that will enable us to build a better
world.

Our hope is that this edition of the
Global Risks Report and the debates
it fosters at the World Economic
Forum’s Annual Meeting 2018 will
focus minds on the need for systems
thinking and new ways of collaborating
globally and involving all stakeholders.
This year’s report grapples with some
of the most pressing challenges
that we face, including biodiversity
loss, cybersecurity threats, rising
geopolitical tensions, and the risk of
another financial crisis erupting. A new
“Future Shocks” section highlights
the importance of being prepared not
just for familiar slow-burn risks, but for
dramatic disruptions that can cause
rapid and irreversible deterioration in
the systems we rely on.
The Global Risks Report occupies
a unique position in the World
Economic Forum, at the heart of
our deepening partnerships with the
world’s governments and international
organizations. It operates across
the network of thematic, industry
and regional teams that shape our
systems-based approach to the
challenges facing the world. This
allows it to leverage the full extent of
the Forum’s internal expertise as well
its global expert networks in order to
analyse the evolution of global risks.
As in previous years, this year’s report
also draws on our annual Global
Risks Perceptions Survey, which is
completed by around 1,000 members
of our multistakeholder communities.
As one of our flagship reports, the
Global Risks Report is a collaborative
effort and we would like to thank
all those across the Forum and its
communities who have contributed
to this year’s edition. We are
particularly grateful for the energy and
commitment of the report’s Advisory
Board. We would also like to thank
our long-standing strategic partners,
Marsh & McLennan Companies and
Zurich Insurance Group, as well as
our academic advisers at the National
University of Singapore, Oxford Martin
School at the University of Oxford
and the Wharton Risk Management
and Decision Processes Center at the
University of Pennsylvania.

Executive
Summary

Last year’s Global Risks Report was
published at a time of heightened
global uncertainty and strengthening
popular discontent with the existing
political and economic order. The
report called for “fundamental reforms
to market capitalism” and a rebuilding
of solidarity within and between
countries. One year on, a global
economic recovery is under way,
offering new opportunities for progress
that should not be squandered: the
urgency of facing up to systemic
challenges has, if anything, intensified
amid proliferating indications of
uncertainty, instability and fragility.
Humanity has become remarkably
adept at understanding how to
mitigate conventional risks that
can be relatively easily isolated
and managed with standard riskmanagement approaches. But we
are much less competent when
it comes to dealing with complex
risks in the interconnected systems
that underpin our world, such as
organizations, economies, societies
and the environment. There are signs
of strain in many of these systems:
our accelerating pace of change is
testing the absorptive capacities
of institutions, communities and
individuals. When risk cascades
through a complex system, the danger
is not of incremental damage but
of “runaway collapse” or an abrupt
transition to a new, suboptimal status
quo.
In our annual Global Risks Perception
Survey, environmental risks have
grown in prominence in recent years.
This trend has continued this year,
with all five risks in the environmental
category being ranked higher than
average for both likelihood and impact
over a 10-year horizon. This follows
a year characterized by high-impact
hurricanes, extreme temperatures
and the first rise in CO2 emissions for
four years. We have been pushing
our planet to the brink and the
damage is becoming increasingly
clear. Biodiversity is being lost at
mass-extinction rates, agricultural
systems are under strain and pollution
of the air and sea has become an
increasingly pressing threat to human
health. A trend towards nation-state
unilateralism may make it more difficult

6

The Global Risks Report 2018

to sustain the long-term, multilateral
responses that are required to counter
global warming and the degradation of
the global environment.
Cybersecurity risks are also growing,
both in their prevalence and in their
disruptive potential. Attacks against
businesses have almost doubled
in five years, and incidents that
would once have been considered
extraordinary are becoming more and
more commonplace. The financial
impact of cybersecurity breaches
is rising, and some of the largest
costs in 2017 related to ransomware
attacks, which accounted for 64% of
all malicious emails. Notable examples
included the WannaCry attack—which
affected 300,000 computers across
150 countries—and NotPetya, which
caused quarterly losses of US$300
million for a number of affected
businesses. Another growing trend
is the use of cyberattacks to target
critical infrastructure and strategic
industrial sectors, raising fears that, in
a worst-case scenario, attackers could
trigger a breakdown in the systems
that keep societies functioning.
Headline economic indicators
suggest the world is finally getting
back on track after the global crisis
that erupted 10 years ago, but this
upbeat picture masks continuing
underlying concerns. The global
economy faces a mix of long-standing
vulnerabilities and newer threats that
have emerged or evolved in the years
since the crisis. The familiar risks
include potentially unsustainable asset
prices, with the world now eight years
into a bull run; elevated indebtedness,
particularly in China; and continuing
strains in the global financial system.
Among the newer challenges are
limited policy firepower in the event
of a new crisis; disruptions caused
by intensifying patterns of automation
and digitalization; and a build-up
of mercantilist and protectionist
pressures against a backdrop of rising
nationalist and populist politics.

The world has moved into a new
and unsettling geopolitical phase.
Multilateral rules-based approaches
have been fraying. Re-establishing
the state as the primary locus of
power and legitimacy has become
an increasingly attractive strategy for
many countries, but one that leaves
many smaller states squeezed as
the geopolitical sands shift. There
is currently no sign that norms and
institutions exist towards which
the world’s major powers might
converge. This creates new risks and
uncertainties: rising military tensions,
economic and commercial disruptions,
and destabilizing feedback loops
between changing global conditions
and countries’ domestic political
conditions. International relations now
play out in increasingly diverse ways.
Beyond conventional military buildups, these include new cyber sources
of hard and soft power, reconfigured
trade and investment links, proxy
conflicts, changing alliance dynamics,
and potential flashpoints related to
the global commons. Assessing
and mitigating risks across all these
theatres of potential conflict will require
careful horizon scanning and crisis
anticipation by both state and nonstate actors.

In Hindsight we look back at risks
we have analysed in previous editions
of the Global Risks Report, tracing
the evolution of the risks themselves
and the global responses to them.
Revisiting our past reports in this way
allows us to gauge risk-mitigation
efforts and highlight lingering risks that
might warrant increased attention.
This year we focus on antimicrobial
resistance, youth unemployment, and
“digital wildfires”, which is how we
referred in 2013 to phenomena that
bear a close resemblance to what is
now known as “fake news”.
In Risk Reassessment, selected
risk experts share their insights
about the implications for decisionmakers in businesses, governments
and civil society of developments
in our understanding of risk. In this
year’s report, Roland Kupers writes
about fostering resilience in complex
systems, while Michele Wucker
calls for organizations to pay more
attention to cognitive bias in their risk
management processes.

This year’s Global Risks Report
introduces three new series:
Future Shocks, Hindsight and Risk
Reassessment. Our aim is to broaden
the report’s analytical reach: each of
these elements provides a new lens
through which to view the increasingly
complex world of global risks.
Future Shocks is a warning against
complacency and a reminder that
risks can crystallize with disorientating
speed. In a world of complex and
interconnected systems, feedback
loops, threshold effects and cascading
disruptions can lead to sudden and
dramatic breakdowns. We present
10 such potential breakdowns—from
democratic collapses to spiralling
cyber conflicts—not as predictions,
but as food for thought: what are
the shocks that could fundamentally
upend your world?

Global Risks 2018:
Fractures, Fears
and Failures

Last year’s Global Risks Report was
published at a time of heightened
global uncertainty and rising popular
discontent with the existing political
and economic order. The report
called for “fundamental reforms to
market capitalism” and a rebuilding
of solidarity within and between
countries. One year on, the urgency
of facing up to these challenges has, if
anything, intensified. Economic growth
is picking up, but 2017 was a year of
widespread uncertainty, instability and
fragility—and the latest results of our
annual Global Risks Perception Survey
(GRPS) suggest respondents are
pessimistic about the year ahead: in
a new question gauging expectations
for 2018, only 7% of responses point
to a reduction of risk, compared with
59% pointing to an increase.1 In the
sections that follow, we highlight four
concerns: (1) persistent inequality
and unfairness, (2) domestic and
international political tensions, (3)
environmental dangers and (4) cyber
vulnerabilities. We conclude by
reflecting on the increased dangers of
systemic breakdown.

Inequality and
unfairness
One of the most striking findings
of this year’s GRPS is the reduced
prominence of economic risks (see
Figure I, The Global Risks Landscape
2018). This continues the trend
of recent years: as the financial
crisis has receded, economic risks
have faded sharply in prominence
in GRPS responses, replaced
increasingly by environmental risks.
The latest results come at a time of
improvement in the global economy,

albeit a relatively modest one—the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)
expects global GDP growth of 3.6%
for 2017, up from 3.2% in 2016.2
Recovery is underway in all of the
major economies, leading to a sharp
improvement in sentiment.
But it is important to ask whether
this swing to optimism suggests
the possibility of complacency and
a developing blind spot around
economic risks? There are certainly
reasons to be cautious: one does not
have to look far for signs of economic
and financial strain. In the chapter
Economic Storm Clouds (see page
18) we suggest that greater attention
should be paid to the risks of another
crisis erupting. Even without another
crisis, economic risks can be hugely
disruptive, and last year brought
fresh evidence of chronic economic
problems, particularly related to
earnings and inequality. In its latest
Global Wage Report, the International
Labour Organization highlighted that
worldwide earnings growth has been
decelerating since 2012. It called,
among other things, for the increased
use of collective bargaining to reverse
this trend.3 While global inequality is
down, within-country inequality is an
increasingly corrosive problem in many
places. According to the IMF, over the
past three decades 53% of countries
have seen an increase in income
inequality, with this trend particularly
pronounced in advanced economies.4
Furthermore, today’s economic strains
are likely to sow the seeds for longerterm problems. High levels of personal
debt, coupled with inadequate savings
and pension provisions, are one
reason to expect that frustrations may
deepen in the years ahead.

The importance of inequality is
reflected again in the GRPS this
year, with “rising income and wealth
disparity” ranking third as a driver of
global risks over the next 10 years.
Automation is another potential
driver of growing inequality, and
this year’s GRPS reflects increasing
concerns about its impacts on the
labour market. When respondents
were asked to highlight the most
closely interconnected risks, the most
frequently cited pairing was “adverse
consequences of technological
advances” and “high structural
unemployment or underemployment”.
Automation has already been a
disruptive labour-market force,5
and its effects are likely to be longlasting as new technologies diffuse
throughout the global economy.6 For
the foreseeable future, automation and
digitalization can be expected to push
down on levels of employment and
wages, and contribute to increases in
income and wealth at the top of the
distribution.
These are not just economic risks.
Norms relating to work are an
important part of the implicit contract
that holds societies together. If many
people’s hopes and expectations

The Global Risks Report 2018

9

relating to employment are fraying,
we should not be surprised if this has
wider political and societal effects.
The idea that “the system is rigged”
has gained electoral traction in recent
years, and research suggests that
concerns about inequality rest on
more fundamental worries about
societal fairness.7 One fault line
around fairness that came to particular
prominence in 2017 is gender. The
global gender parity gap across
health, education, politics and the
workplace widened for the first time
since we began tracking it in 2006,8
while a succession of high-profile
cases are highlighting continuing
endemic levels of sexual harassment,
both in the workplace and in society
generally.9

Risks of conflict
Debates about the populist surge of
recent years tend to pit economic
causes against cultural ones, but
there is a strong case for arguing
that the two are closely related—that
economic pain has been sufficiently
concentrated among groups and
geographic regions for those groups
and regions to begin to assert
themselves politically.10 Clashes
related to identity and community
continue to drive political dislocations
in many countries and are increasingly
fuelling cross-border tensions.
In the latest GRPS, societal
polarization slipped slightly in
respondents’ rankings of the main
underlying drivers of global risks—
replaced in the top three by rising
cyber dependency—but it remains
a politically destabilizing force. This
is perhaps still most evident in the
United Kingdom and the United

10

The Global Risks Report 2018

States, the two Western countries that
recorded dramatic anti-establishment
democratic results in 2016. The
United Kingdom’s political system is
struggling to cope with the strains
unleashed by the decision to leave
the European Union, while in the
United States deepening polarization
has, among other things, weakened
democratic debate and increased the
confidence of far right movements.11
In Europe, fears about the rise of the
far right were allayed by the victory
of Emmanuel Macron in the French
presidential election in May 2017—
but perhaps at the risk of fostering
complacency about the region’s
political stability. As highlighted by
elections in Germany and Austria in
late 2017, far right parties continue
to grow in strength and influence
in many European countries. More
generally, issues of culture and identity
are causing political tension within
and between a growing number
of EU countries, including Poland,
Hungary and, in different ways,
Spain. Polarization between groups
with different cultural heritages or
values looks set to remain a source
of political risk in Western countries in
2018 and beyond.
Identity politics could fuel geopolitical
as well as domestic risks. As
discussed in the chapter Geopolitical
Power Shifts (see page 36),
charismatic strongman politics is on
the rise across the world. In addition
to the “America First” platform of
President Trump, variations on this
theme can be seen in numerous
countries from China to Japan,
Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the
Philippines and elsewhere. The trend
towards increasingly personalized
power takes place amid rising
geopolitical volatility. The escalation

of geopolitical risks was one of the
most pronounced trends of 2017,
particularly in Asia, where the North
Korea crisis has arguably brought
the world closer than it has been for
decades to the possible use of nuclear
weapons. There are numerous other
potential flashpoints around the world,
not least in the Middle East, where
an increasing number of destabilizing
forces might lead to the eruption of
new military conflicts in addition to
those in Syria and Yemen.
Perhaps surprisingly given the febrile
backdrop, there was relatively little
movement of perception among the
core geopolitical risks in the latest
GRPS. However, when asked about
risk trajectories in 2018 the level of
concern is clear: 93% of respondents
expect a worsening of “political or
economic confrontations/frictions
between major powers” this year.
Perhaps more worryingly, nearly 80%
of respondents reckoned that risks
associated with “state-on-state military
conflict or incursion” and “regional
conflicts drawing in major power(s)”
would be higher in 2018 than in 2017
(see Figure 1.1).
Geopolitical risks are exacerbated by
the continuing decline in commitment
to rules-based multilateralism. In
2017, President Trump delivered on
some of his unilateralist campaign
pledges, withdrawing the United
States from both the Paris Agreement
on climate change and the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal.
Although the United States has not
withdrawn from the deal designed
to halt Iran’s nuclear weapons
programme, the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action (JCPA), in October
2017 President Trump signalled his

dissatisfaction by refusing to certify
that Iran is in compliance with it. It
is to important note that all of these
agreements remain in place and that
other states and non-state actors
have sought to compensate for the
waning multilateralism of the United
States. Nevertheless, the erosion of
institutions of multilateral dialogue
and decision-making damages the
prospects of reaching new global
agreements at a time when the need
for cooperation looks more urgent
than ever.
One institutional risk that is likely to
intensify in 2018 relates to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) and its
ability to resolve trade disputes. This
is particularly important at a time
when protectionist sentiment and
policies are on the rise. However,
the United States has been blocking

appointments to the WTO’s sevenmember appellate body; since
December 2017 only four seats have
been filled and in theory the body
could cease functioning in 2019.
A weakening of the global trading
system’s institutional architecture
creates risks beyond a renewed
slowdown in trade and growth:12 the
possibility of trade tensions spilling
over into increased geopolitical strains
should not be dismissed. In this year’s
GRPS, 73% of respondents said they
expect the risks associated with the
erosion of multilateral trade rules and
agreements to increase next year (see
Figure 1.1).

Our planet on the
brink
Environmental risks have grown in
prominence over the 13-year history
of the Global Risks Report, and this
trend continued in the latest GRPS.
All five risks in this category occupy
the top-right quadrant of The Global
Risks Landscape 2018 (see Figure
I), indicating higher-than-average
perceptions of both likelihood and
impact. Among the most pressing
environmental challenges facing us
are extreme weather events and
temperatures; accelerating biodiversity
loss; pollution of air, soil and water;
failures of climate-change mitigation
and adaptation; and transition
risks as we move to a low-carbon

future. However, the truly systemic
challenge here rests in the depth of
the interconnectedness that exists
both among these environmental
risks and between them and risks
in other categories—such as water
crises and involuntary migration. And
as the impact of Hurricane Maria on
Puerto Rico has starkly illustrated,
environmental risks can also lead
to serious disruption of critical
infrastructure.
Extreme weather events in 2017
included unusually frequent Atlantic
hurricanes, with three high-impact
storms—Harvey, Irma and Maria—
making landfall in rapid succession.
According to the Accumulated
Cyclone Energy (ACE) index, which
is used to measure the intensity and
duration of Atlantic storms, September
2017 was the most intense month on
record. It was also the most expensive
hurricane season ever.13 These
extreme incidents continue a trend
towards increasingly costly weather
events over recent decades (see
the US data in Figure 1.2), although
rising costs reflect factors such as the
location and concentration of assets
as well as changing weather patterns.
Extreme rainfall can be particularly
damaging—of the 10 natural disasters
that caused the most deaths in the
first half of 2017, eight involved floods
or landslides.14 Storms and other
weather-related hazards are also a
leading cause of displacement, with
the latest data showing that 76%
of the 31.1 million people displaced
during 2016 were forced from their
homes as a result of weather-related
events.15

Note: Data are inflation-adjusted and valid as of
October 2017.

Last year also saw numerous
instances of extreme temperatures.
When the data are finalized, 2017
is expected to be among the three
hottest years on record—the hottest
was 2016—and the hottest non–El
Niño year ever. In the first nine months
of the year, temperatures were 1.1°C
above pre-industrial levels and further
increases are inevitable—the most
ambitious target included in the Paris
Agreement envisages increases only
to 1.5°C. Average changes are giving
rise to localized extremes: during
2017, record high temperatures were
experienced from parts of southern
Europe to eastern and southern
Africa, South America, and parts of
Russia and China. California had its
hottest summer ever and by the end
of November, wildfire burn across
the United States was at least 46%
above the 10-year average, and was
continuing into December. Chile had

its most extensive wildfires ever—eight
times the long-run average—while
in Portugal more than 100 wildfirerelated deaths were recorded.16
Rising temperatures and more
frequent heatwaves will disrupt
agricultural systems that are
already strained. The prevalence of
monoculture production heightens
vulnerability to catastrophic
breakdowns in the food system—
more than 75% of the world’s food
comes from just 12 plants and five
animal species, according to the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations, and it is estimated that
there is now a one-in-twenty chance
per decade that heat, drought, and
flood events will cause a simultaneous
failure of maize production in the
world’s two main growers, China and
the United States.17 This would cause
widespread famine and hardship.
Fears of “ecological Armageddon”
are being raised by a collapse in
populations of insects that are
critical to food systems: researchers
in Germany found falls in such
populations of more than 75% over 27
years.18
More broadly, biodiversity loss is
now occurring at mass-extinction
rates.19 The populations of vertebrate
species declined by an estimated 58%
between 1970 and 2012.20 Globally,
the primary driver of biodiversity
loss is the human destruction of
habitats including forests—which are
home to approximately 80% of the
world’s land-based animals, plants,
and insects21—for farming, mining,
infrastructure development and oil
and gas production. A record 29.7
million hectares of tree cover was lost
in 2016—an area about the size of
New Zealand. This loss was about
50 percent higher than 2015.22 As

much as 80% of the deforestation
in Amazon countries is accounted
for by cattle ranching, suggesting
that pressures on environmental and
agricultural systems will intensify
as the global population increases,
pushing up demand for meat.
Pollution moved further to the fore
as a problem in 2017: indoor and
outdoor air pollution are together
responsible for more than one
tenth of all deaths globally each
year, according to the World Health
Organization (WHO). More than
90% of the world’s population live in
areas with levels of air pollution that
exceed WHO guidelines.23 Deaths
are overwhelmingly concentrated in
low- and middle-income countries,
where health problems caused
by pollution exacerbate strains on
already stretched health systems
and public finances. In November
2017, a public health emergency was
declared in Delhi when air pollution
reached more than 11 times the WHO
guideline levels.24 Urban air pollution
is likely to worsen, as migration and
demographic trends drive the creation
of more megacities.
Soil and water pollution cause about
half again as many deaths, according
to findings published in October
2017 by the Lancet Commission

on Pollution and Health.25 The
Commission estimates the overall
annual cost of pollution to the global
economy at US$4.6 trillion, equivalent
to around 6.2% of output. Many of the
associated risks to health are still not
well understood. Research suggests,
for example, that the huge volume of
plastic waste in the world’s water—
approximately 8 million more tons
every year26—is finding its way into
humans. People eating seafood could
be ingesting up to 11,000 pieces
of micro-plastic every year.27 Microplastic fibres are found in 83% of the
world’s tap water.28 One concern is
that these micro-fibres could bind
with compounds containing toxic
pesticides or metals, providing these
toxins with a route into the body.29

The risk that political factors might
disrupt efforts to mitigate climate
change was highlighted last year when
President Trump announced plans to
withdraw the United States from the
Paris Agreement. However, several
other major economies—notably
China—reaffirmed their support of
the Paris Agreement during 2017. In
addition, many US businesses, cities
and states have pledged to help
deliver on the country’s emissions
reduction targets. This kind of
network of subnational and publicprivate collaboration may become
an increasingly important means of
countering climate change and other
environmental risks, particularly at a
time when nation-state unilateralism
appears to be ascendant.

The growing urgency of acting to halt
climate change was demonstrated in
2017 with the news that emissions
of CO2 had risen for the first time
in four years, bringing atmospheric
concentrations of CO2 to 403 parts
per million, compared with a preindustrial baseline of 280 parts per
million. The increase in emissions
last year was partly a result of
developments in China, where the
heatwaves mentioned above led to a
6.3% increase in energy consumption,
and extreme drought in the north of
the country led to a switch from hydro
to coal-fired power generation. There
are reasons to expect further upward
pressure on CO2 concentrations in
the future. Having absorbed 93% of
the increase in global temperatures
between 1971 and 2010,30 the world’s
oceans continue to get warmer and
studies suggest that their capacity
to absorb CO2 may be declining.31
Research also suggests that tropical
forests are now releasing rather than
absorbing carbon dioxide.32

In addition to meeting the immediate
environmental challenges that we
face, we also need to focus more
acutely on the potential economic
and societal risks that may arise
as transition to a low-carbon and
environmentally secure world
accelerates. Moves towards financial
disclosures to quantify the transition
risks that businesses face have
been accelerating, as has the idea of
fossil-fuel divestment.33 For example,
in November 2017 the managers
of Norway’s sovereign wealth fund
recommended divesting from oil and
gas shares, and in December the
World Bank announced a moratorium
after 2019 on financing upstream oiland gas-related investments.34
The potential spillover effects of
climate-related transition will be
more far-reaching than its effect
on financial disclosure norms. For
example, dramatic changes in the
way energy is produced are likely
to trigger large-scale labour-market

disruptions.35 Structural economic
changes in affected countries and
regions could also stoke societal
and geopolitical risks. There is
no scope for complacency about
the sufficiency of global efforts to
deal with climate change and the
continued degradation of the global
environmental commons. Equally,
however, it is time to prepare for the
structural challenges and changes that
lie ahead as those efforts gather pace.

Cyber-defences are
being tested
Moving from the environmental
commons to the virtual commons,
cyber-risks intensified in 2017.
Although in previous years
respondents to the GRPS have tended
to be optimistic about technological
risks, this year concerns jumped, and
cyberattacks and massive data fraud
both appear in the list of the top five
global risks by perceived likelihood.

Attacks are increasing, both in
prevalence and disruptive potential.

Cyber breaches recorded by
businesses have almost doubled
in five years, from 68 per business
in 2012 to 130 per business in
2017.36 Having been choked off
by law enforcement successes in
2010–2012, “dark net” markets for
malware goods and services have
seen a resurgence:37 in 2016 alone,
357 million new malware variants
were released and “banking trojans”
designed to steal account login details
could be purchased for as little as
US$500.38 In addition, cybercriminals
have an exponentially increasing
number of potential targets, because
the use of cloud services continues

14

The Global Risks Report 2018

to accelerate and the Internet of
Things is expected to expand from
an estimated 8.4 billion devices in
2017 to a projected 20.4 billion in
2020.39 What would once have been
considered large-scale cyberattacks
are now becoming normal. For
example, in 2016, companies revealed
breaches of more than 4 billion data
records, more than the combined
total for the previous two years.40
Distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attacks using 100 gigabits per second
(Gbps) were once exceptional but
have now become commonplace,
jumping in frequency by 140% in 2016
alone.41 And attackers have become
more persistent—in 2017 the average
DDoS target was likely to be hit 32
times over a three-month period.42
The financial costs of cyberattacks are
rising. A 2017 study of 254 companies
across seven countries put the annual
cost of responding to cyberattacks at
£11.7 million per company, a yearon-year increase of 27.4%.43 The cost
of cybercrime to businesses over the
next five years is expected to be US$8
trillion.44 Some of the largest costs in
2017 related to ransomware, a rapidly

growing form of malware that locks
targets out of their data and demands
a ransom in return for restoring
access. Ransomware attacks
accounted for 64% of all malicious
emails sent between July and
September last year,45 affecting double
the number of businesses compared
with 2016.46 Notable examples
included the WannaCry attack,
which affected 300,000 computers
across 150 countries, and Petya
and NotPetya, which caused huge
corporate losses: for example, Merck,
FedEx and Maersk each reported
third-quarter losses of around US$300
million as a result of NotPetya.47
Beyond its financial cost, the
WannaCry attack disrupted critical
and strategic infrastructure across
the world, including government
ministries, railways, banks,
telecommunications providers, energy
companies, car manufacturers and
hospitals. It illustrated a growing trend
of using cyberattacks to target critical
infrastructure and strategic industrial
sectors, raising fears that, in a worstcase scenario, attackers could
trigger a breakdown in the systems
that keep societies functioning.
Many of these attacks are thought
to be state sponsored. WannaCry’s
ultimate impact was relatively low,
largely because a “kill switch” was
discovered, but it highlighted the
vulnerability of a wide range of
infrastructure organizations and
installations to disruption or damage.
Since the 2015 attack on Ukraine’s
power grid—which temporarily shut
down 30 substations, interrupting
power supply to 230,000 people48—
evidence has been mounting of
further attempts to target critical
infrastructure. In 2016, for example,

an attack on the SWIFT messaging
network led to the theft of US$81
million from the central bank of
Bangladesh. The European Aviation
Safety Agency has stated that aviation
systems are subject to an average
of 1,000 attacks each month.49 Last
year saw reports of attempts to use
spear-phishing attacks (stealing data
or installing malware using individually
targeted email scams) against
companies operating nuclear power
plants in the United States.50
Most attacks on critical and strategic
systems have not succeeded—but
the combination of isolated successes
with a growing list of attempted
attacks suggests that risks are
increasing. And the world’s increasing
interconnectedness and pace
heightens our vulnerability to attacks
that cause not only isolated and
temporary disruptions, but radical and
irreversible systemic shocks.

Our growing
vulnerability to
systemic risks
Humanity has become remarkably
adept at understanding how to
mitigate countless conventional risks
that can be relatively easily isolated
and managed with standard riskmanagement approaches. But we
are much less competent when it
comes to dealing with complex risks
in systems characterized by feedback
loops, tipping points and opaque
cause-and-effect relationships that
can make intervention problematic.51

The Global Risks Report 2018

15

Societies, ecosystems, economies
and the global financial system
are all examples of such complex
systems, and they have various
intersections. Think of how the world’s
infrastructure—from power generation
to transport networks—is increasingly
digitally networked. Think of the
tensions between our creaking global
institutional framework and the pace
of change in the 21st century. Think
even of the ethical value systems that
shape behaviour within and between
countries, and the unpredictability
that can result when there is a reevaluation of what is acceptable and
unacceptable.

16

The Global Risks Report 2018

When a risk cascades through a
complex system, the danger is not of
incremental damage but of “runaway
collapse”—or, alternatively, a transition
to a new, suboptimal status quo
that becomes difficult to escape. For
example, even though a runaway
collapse of the global financial system
was averted a decade ago, the global
financial crisis triggered numerous
economic, societal, political and
geopolitical disruptions. Many are
still only poorly understood, but they
shape a “new normal” that in turn will
create its own disruptions, spillovers
and feedback loops in the months and
years ahead.

As the pace of change accelerates,
signs of strain are evident in many of
the systems on which we rely. We
cannot discount the possibility that
one or more of these systems will
collapse. Just as a piece of elastic
can lose its capacity to snap back
to its original shape, repeated stress
can lead systems—organizations,
economies, societies, the
environment—to lose their capacity to
rebound. If we exhaust our capacities
to absorb disruption and allow our
systems to become brittle enough to
break, it is difficult to overstate the
damage that might result.

Headline economic indicators suggest
the world is finally getting back on
track after the global crisis that
erupted 10 years ago. A broad-based
pickup in GDP growth rates is under
way, stock markets have never been
higher and the world’s major central
banks are cautiously preparing to
unwind the exceptional policies of the
post-crisis period.

19%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong
SAR by 35%, the Nikkei in Japan by
19%, the DAX in Germany by 11%
and the CAC40 in France by 8%.
According to one commonly used
measure of cyclically adjusted prices
(see Figure 2.1), US stocks have only
twice in history been higher than they
are at the moment: just prior to the
crashes of 1929 and 2000.

However, this relatively upbeat picture
masks numerous concerns. This has
been the weakest post-recession
recovery on record. Productivity
growth remains puzzlingly weak.
Investment growth has been subdued,
and in developing economies it has
slowed sharply since 2010.1 And in
many countries the social and political
fabric has been badly frayed by many
years of stagnating real incomes.

Bond valuations are even more
dramatic. In mid-2017, around 9
trillion US dollars’ worth of bonds
were trading with a negative yield,
meaning that investors were, in
effect, paying bond issuers for the
privilege of holding their risky financial
instruments. This anomaly reflects the
impact of the huge asset-purchase
programmes launched by central
banks in the wake of the crisis, which
seem to have divorced asset prices
from assessments of their underlying
riskiness. In Europe, for example,
during 2017, yields on high-risk
corporate bonds converged with
yields on US government debt, the
global financial system’s
risk-free benchmark.3

The reassuring headline indicators
mean that economic and f﻿inancial
risks are becoming a blind spot:
business leaders and policy-makers
are less prepared than they might
be for serious economic or financial
turmoil. The risks can be divided
into two categories: (1) familiar
vulnerabilities that have grown,
mutated or relocated over time; and
(2) newer fragilities that have emerged
in recent years.

Figure 2.1: Equities on the Up
Cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio (CAPE)

Long-standing
vulnerabilities
Unsustainable asset prices?
The world is eight years into a bull
run, with global stock markets hitting
all-time high after all-time high. This
has raised fears that this is another
episode of “irrational exuberance”, that
the lessons of the crisis have gone
unlearned,2 and that a deep correction
may follow. In 2017, the Dow Jones
increased by 25%, the S&P500 by

If there were to be a sharp market
correction, the impact on the real
economy would arguably be greatest
in countries most heavily exposed to
sectors and markets in which bubbles
have formed—for example, a country
economically reliant on exports of
a commodity that plunges in value.
The impact of confidence and wealth
effects means that real-economy
impacts would also be felt strongly in
countries—notably the United States
and the United Kingdom—in which
the ownership of financial assets is
most widespread.
It is not just stocks and bonds that
have seen their prices rise. The
International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s
index of global house prices is close
to its pre-crisis peak again (see
Figure 2.2), and signs of stretched
valuations are evident in numerous
cities including Hong Kong, London,
Stockholm, and Toronto. Inflation in
all these traditional asset classes has
been dwarfed by more speculative
assets such as the cryptocurrency
Bitcoin, which increased in value by
around 1200% in 2017.
A further source of potential market
risk at present is that innovations
in financial assets and asset
management have yet to be tested in
crisis conditions. One example is the
rapidly expanding class of exchangetraded funds (ETFs), which have
grown in value by 500% since 2008
and now account for US$4 trillion
of assets and around 25% of all US
stock market trading.4 Some analysts
suggest that ETFs would cushion the
blow of a major market correction,
while others reckon they would
exacerbate it.

Indebtedness
High levels of indebtedness—
particularly among households and in
the financial sector—were a key driver
of the financial crisis and one reason
the recovery of the real economy
has been so slow. Recessions
accompanied by credit contractions
or housing slumps tend to be much
deeper and take longer to recover
from, because they leave a legacy of
expansive boom-era debts that act as
a drag on consumption
and investment.5
Prior to the 2008 crisis, the world
was awash with cheap loans.
Remarkably, there has been no
aggregate deleveraging since. In fact,
the total global debt-to-GDP ratio is
significantly higher now than it was
before the crisis. In its latest Global
Financial Stability Report, the IMF
highlighted the potential risks posed
by the build-up of non-financial sector
debt in the G20 (i.e. the debt held by
households, governments and nonfinancial companies). In 2016, this

20

The Global Risks Report 2018

debt totalled US$135 trillion, up from
US$80 trillion in 2007.6
Indebtedness has risen differently in
advanced and emerging economies.
Advanced economies built up huge
debts before the crisis erupted, but
their overall level of debt has remained
relatively constant in the subsequent
decade: as a proportion of GDP,
modest deleveraging by households
and financial institutions has been
offset by increases in government
debt resulting from stimulus spending.
Meanwhile, signs of strain are evident
in parts of the corporate debt market.
According to S&P Global, 162
corporate defaults worldwide occurred
in 2016, the most since 2009 and
up from 113 in 2015.7 The debt-toequity ratio of the median S&P 1500
company (excluding financials) has
almost doubled since 2010 and is now
well above its pre-crisis level.
In emerging markets, by contrast,
aggregate debt levels were relatively
low and stable prior to the crisis but
have increased sharply since. This is
especially true in China, where debt
issuance has surged to help deliver
the high levels of growth the country’s
plans require. The rapid expansion of
debt in the Chinese economy is now
one of the world’s clearest flashpoints
for potential economic turmoil:
according to some analysts, China’s
current credit trajectory is “dangerous
with increasing risks of a disruptive
adjustment.”8
China’s banking sector has ballooned
to hold assets valued at US$33
trillion, or 3.1 times the country’s
annual output. Arguably, these
figures understate the full extent
of the country’s potential fragilities,
because they do not capture the
rapid growth of the more lightly
regulated shadow banking sector.9

The regulatory separation of the
financial sector in China from that
of the rest of the world reduces
the risk of systemically significant
financial spillovers, but as early as
2015 the governors of the European
Central Bank were cautioning that
“financial developments in China
could have a larger than expected
adverse impact.”10 Given how deeply
embedded China now is in the world
economy, if the country’s authorities
were to step in decisively to secure
the stability of the financial system,
the resulting slowdown in domestic
growth could represent a damaging
blow to global demand.
China can deploy vast resources
to protect its economy, but most
emerging economies are much more
directly exposed to any worsening of
global conditions. If the major central
banks’ interest rates were to move
significantly higher, lower-income
emerging market economies would
take a direct hit from the combination
of higher rates and worse exchange
rates, increasing the cost of borrowing
US dollars or other hard foreign
currency. Already there are signs that
debt-servicing costs for many of these
countries are rising gradually from
the record lows of a few years ago.
These problems are most pronounced
in countries with high levels of
foreign-currency debt, particularly oilexporting countries where sustained
low oil prices have hit companies’
revenues and governments’ fiscal
positions. In October 2017, for
example, the governor of the Central
Bank of Kenya cautioned that
government debt in a number of
African countries has reached levels at
which an external shock “could push
us over”.11 Countries facing significant
strain include Angola, Gabon, Ghana,
Mozambique and Zambia.

The third long-standing risk is the
health of the financial system,
even though much has been done
to restore the banking system to
stability after its near-collapse in
2008. Regulators have overseen an
increase in the core capital ratios
of 30 globally systemic banks, from
10.3% at the end of 2011 to 12.6%

There are reasons to be cautious,
despite this progress. Measures of
banks’ capitalization continue to rest
on risk-weighting methodologies
that mask a lot of uncertainty about
underlying risks. Calls are becoming
louder for radical reform of the
fundamental principles of banking,15

but there appears to be no political
will to introduce major reforms.
In fact, deregulation may now be
more likely: for example, pressure is
already mounting for a loosening of
the Volcker Rule. The issue of banks
being “too big to fail” has not gone
away, however: the assets held by the
largest 30 banks have grown from less
than US$30 trillion in 2006 to almost
US$43 trillion, and concentration is
continuing to increase.16 Meanwhile
strains have spread to emerging
markets: banks that were relatively
unscathed at the height of the crisis
have since had to contend with
the resulting deterioration of global
financial conditions and the sharp
downward turn of many
commodity prices.17

at the end of 2016.12 Widespread
changes in the structure of the sector
include collapses, mergers, and a
politically sensitive supranational
“banking union” in the Eurozone.13
Restrictions—such as the Volcker
Rule, which since 2015 has prohibited
banks in the United States from
making market bets with their own
capital—have been put on the risks
that banks are allowed to take.14 And
there has been a winding down of the
sector’s reliance on wholesale interbank lending, a potentially volatile
source of funding that evaporated in
2008 as banks began to lose trust in
each other’s creditworthiness.

New and emerging
challenges
The familiar vulnerabilities outlined
above are now compounded by a
range of newer fragilities that have
emerged or strengthened materially
since the crisis.

Limited firepower
How much room for manoeuvre
policy-makers retain is open to
question. Put simply, is there enough
fiscal and monetary policy firepower
left to deal with another crisis? In
theory, the major Western economies
that were at the centre of the global
crisis could respond with another
wave of major policy interventions
reflecting the synergies that are
currently at play between monetary
and fiscal policies, with central bank
asset purchases helping to alleviate
governments’ fiscal pressures by
keeping down debt-servicing costs.18
However, this scenario places a
lot of faith in the effectiveness of
unconventional monetary policies
such as asset purchases, particularly
when deployed as the primary line
of defence rather than alongside a
sharp interest-rate stimulus. Facing
a recession—let alone a crisis—with
very limited scope to cut interest rates
would be unprecedented.
The Fed has responded to past US
recessions by cutting its benchmark
policy rate by an average of 5.5
percentage points. That benchmark
rate currently stands at just 1.25%,
and market expectations are that it
will plateau at around 3%. In other
words, even if the Fed were to cut
rates to zero in response to a new
recession, there would still be at least
a 2.5 percentage point shortfall relative
to the usual scale of response.19
Assuming they wanted to deliver a
22

The Global Risks Report 2018

similar level of stimulus, the European
Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and
the Bank of England would all face
even greater shortfalls given that their
interest rates are currently even lower
than the Fed’s.
Central banks were crucial to restoring
economic confidence among
households, businesses and markets
after the crisis. Repeating that feat
could be a struggle without interest
rates at their disposal. And without
a floor placed under confidence,
the risk of the next downturn being
much deeper and longer than might
otherwise be the case would increase.

Technological disruption
A second emergent source
of economic risk is the rapid
technological change that has taken
place even in the decade since the
global crisis. The history of previous
waves of innovation suggests
that the nascent Fourth Industrial
Revolution will ultimately deliver
broad-based economic benefits.
However, technological pessimists
query whether current innovation
has little of the transformative
power analogous to that of previous
discoveries and inventions, such as
electricity, household appliances
and the combustion engine.20 Even
optimists caution that major disruption
may be inevitable as societies adapt:
the original Industrial Revolution
delivered huge increases in human
welfare, but it also caused prolonged
social and economic turmoil and
set the scene for new revolutionary
modes of politics.21 Worries about
the economic impact of new
technologies were prominent in this
year’s Global Risks Perception Survey
(GRPS)—the most frequently cited
risk interconnection was the pairing
between unemployment and adverse
impacts of technological advance.

Although technological advances have
provided many benefits in emerging
economies, the associated risks are
arguably most pronounced in these
countries too. The World Bank,
among others, has cautioned that
current patterns of innovation threaten
the viability of long-established
paths to development.22 Historically
economies have developed by moving
workers from agricultural jobs into
export-oriented manufacturing jobs
that require similarly low skill levels
but deliver much higher productivity.
This “escalator to higher income
levels” breaks down when the
manufacturing sector becomes
sufficiently automated to require
workers who are more highly skilled.23
In these circumstances, developingcountry productivity can stagnate or
decline if workers move back from
manufacturing into agriculture, or
from agriculture into low-end service
sectors where productivity can be
even lower.24 Latin America is the
clearest example of a region where
“premature deindustrialization” has
held back countries’ productivity
growth.25 The associated risks are not
purely economic—recent research
suggests that weak industrialization
can hamper the development of liberal
democratic institutions by affecting
the political divisions that become
dominant in a country.26

Politics and protectionism
Last year’s Global Risks Report
discussed the spillover of economic
risks into various recent episodes of
political disruption across the world.27
The directionality can run both ways,
as discussed in the chapter on
Geopolitical Power Shifts: populist
and identity politics can amplify risks
of economic and financial disorder
by upending previously stable
economic principles and practices,
particularly those relating to trade.

to cross-border business and
constraints on labour mobility.

The two countries that experienced
the most disruptive political results in
2016—the United Kingdom and the
United States—have both entered a
period of uncertainty and volatility in
their external economic relations. The
United Kingdom is in the process of
leaving the European Union, while the
United States has withdrawn from
the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
and is seeking a renegotiation of the
North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA).
Mercantilist and protectionist
pressures have been building in
many countries for years: according
to Global Trade Alert, protectionist
interventions have increased
markedly since 2012. A new high
was recorded 2016, when 571 of the
771 trade interventions tracked by
Global Trade Alert were characterized
as discriminatory and just 200 as
liberalizing. Early data for 2017 point to
a continuation of this trend, particularly
in the United States, where the first six
months of the year saw a 26% jump in
trade actions against G20 partners.28
The risk of economic damage is not
restricted to trade protectionism—
mercantilism and unilateralism could
trigger a wider deterioration of global
interconnectedness, including reduced
investment flows, increased obstacles

The backdrop of pronounced
geopolitical uncertainty and
increasingly transactional approaches
to interstate relations increases
the risk that economic disputes
will flare up. We can distinguish
between (1) disputes stemming
from tensions between countries’
economic agendas and policies,
and (2) geopolitical tensions—up to
and including military conflict—that
cause disruption to economies and
markets. The results of the GRPS
are pessimistic in this regard: the
overwhelming majority of respondents
expect the risks of interstate military
conflict or incursion to increase in
2018. New technologies add a layer of
economic vulnerability to geopolitical
disruptions, with emerging risks
of asymmetric economic warfare
including potential cyberattacks
designed to disrupt critical financial
infrastructure.
It is striking how sanguine financial
markets have remained while political
and geopolitical risk has jumped in
recent years. Given current market
dynamics, it may not be rational for
any single market participant to price
in rising political and geopolitical
tensions. The risk is that we will hit a
tipping point at which point everyone
prices in these tensions, with a rush to
the exits that hits asset prices, strains
the resilience of the global financial
system and tests whether policymakers retain the firepower to prevent
deep and long-lasting impacts on the
real economy.

As the world becomes more complex and interconnected, easily managed
incremental change is giving way to the instability of feedback loops, threshold
effects and cascading disruptions. Sudden and dramatic breakdowns—
future shocks—become more likely. In the pages that follow, we present 10
such potential future shocks. Some are more speculative than others; some
extrapolate from risks that have already begun to crystallize. These are not
predictions. They are food for thought and action—what are the possible future
shocks that could fundamentally disrupt or destabilize your world, and what can
you do to prevent them?

Grim Reaping
Simultaneous breadbasket failures threaten sufficiency of global
food supply
In a world of growing
environmental strains our
increasingly complex food
system is becoming more
vulnerable to sudden supply
shocks. The interaction of
disruptors such as extreme
weather, political instability
or crop diseases could
result in a simultaneous
blow to output in key
food-producing regions,
triggering global shortages
and price spikes. The risk of
a systemic breakdown
could be further elevated by
wider fragilities, including
reduced crop diversity,
competition for water from
other sectors and
geopolitical tensions.

26

The Global Risks Report 2018

Widespread fear—let alone
death on a large scale—
could lead to devastating
spillover effects. Social
fractures would intensify in
affected and at-risk
countries. Political and
economic crises would be
likely. So too would a surge
in smuggling, both of food
and people. Against such a
volatile backdrop, crossborder tensions could
worsen sharply, hampering
existing humanitarian
response networks,
frustrating efforts to develop
regional and global
mitigation strategies and
increasing the possibility of
interstate conflict.

Even on optimistic climatechange trajectories foodsupply risks will remain
elevated. Steps are needed
to improve sustainability and
resilience throughout the
food system. Among the
changes that could help are
increasing crop diversity,
establishing stress tests of
“choke points” and other
national and regional
vulnerabilities, reducing
waste along supply chains,
reaffirming humanitarian
principles and commitments
and establishing early
warning indicators.

A Tangled Web
Artificial intelligence “weeds” proliferate, choking off the
performance of the internet

What if the adverse impact of
artificial intelligence (AI)
involves not a superintelligence that takes control
from humans but “AI
weeds”—low-level algorithms
that slowly choke off the
internet? Algorithms are
already proliferating. As they
increase in sophistication—as
we become more reliant on
code that writes code, for
example—explosive growth

becomes more likely. A
divergence could open
between the code we have
created and our capacity to
track and control it.
The tragedy of the commons
means we often let chronic
problems with dispersed
responsibilities fester. Think
of plastic in the ocean. A
trend towards reduced
internet efficiency would
undermine service delivery in

countless
businesses. It could
hobble the Internet
of Things. It would
frustrate users. If the
problem became
significant enough, it
could prompt some
governments to wall
off parts of the
internet. If malicious
actors found ways
to proliferate or
weaponize the AI
weeds, they could
do extensive
damage.
As the global
demands placed on
the internet increase
in scale and
sophistication,
digital hygiene is
likely to become a
more pressing
concern for endusers. The
development of
overarching norms,
regulations and
governance
structures for AI will
be crucial: without a
robust and
enforceable
regulatory
framework, there is
a risk that humans
will in effect be
crowded out from
the internet by the
proliferation of AI.

The Death of Trade
Bilateral trade wars cascade and multilateral dispute
resolution institutions are too weak to respond
Political commitment to globalization
has weakened in the wake of the global
financial crisis and even minor disputes
could trigger an unravelling. Against a
backdrop of deepening protectionist
sentiment, trade disputes could spread
rapidly by triggering adverse impacts
and retaliatory moves along global
value chains. The same pressures
fomenting trade disputes would also
undermine the already-weakened
institutions designed to resolve them,
potentially leading to multilateral rules
being openly breached.
A breakdown of the global trade
system would roil supply chains and
reduce overall economic activity.
Adverse impacts such as lower output
and employment would be unevenly
distributed within and between
countries, creating new inequalities and
frustrations. If this in turn fuelled more
28

The Global Risks Report 2018

aggressive mercantilism, the risk would
increase of proliferating trade-related
disputes triggering deeper geopolitical
tensions and policies of gunboat
diplomacy on trade.
Whatever the settled position on global
trade is to be, more deliberation and
consensus-building would bolster its
legitimacy. A period of de-globalization
may be seen by many as a welcome
corrective, but rejecting current
frameworks in favour of binary
nationalistic approaches would cause
significant disruption. Securing durable
and worldwide support for globalization
would be made easier by an increased
domestic policy focus on cushioning
the impact on individuals and regions
affected by transitions in economic
activity.

Democracy Buckles
A new wave of populism threatens the social order in
one or more mature liberal democracies
Democracy is already showing signs of
strain in the face of economic, cultural
and technological disruption. Much
deeper damage is possible: social and
political orders can break down. If an
evenly divided country sees polarized
positions harden into a winner-takes-all
contest, the risk increases of political
debate giving way to forms of
secession or physical confrontation.
In these circumstances, a tipping point
could be reached. A spiral of violence
could begin, particularly if public
authorities lost control and then
intervened on one side with
disproportionate force. In some
countries—with widespread ready
access to weapons or a history of
political violence—armed civil conflict
could erupt. In others, the state might

impose its will by force, risking longreverberating consequences: a state of
emergency, the curtailment of civil
liberties, even the cancellation of
elections to protect public order.
The more that can be done to boost
the resilience and responsiveness of
democratic institutions, the less likely
they will be to buckle under pressure.
This might require processes of political
and constitutional experimentation. It
could even mean incorporating ideas
from post-conflict politics into everyday
democracy. We also need to better
understand the democratic fissures
currently being caused by the
economy, by social media and by
changing patterns of national identity.

Precision Extinction
AI-piloted drone ships wipe out a large proportion of
global fish stocks
A third of all fish consumed in the
world are already caught illegally. AI
and drone technologies are
increasingly commonplace. Add to
these facts the automation of illegal
fishing, and the impact on fish stocks
could be devastating—particularly in
international waters where oversight is
weaker. Countless other areas exist
where the same logic might unfold:
huge short-term incentives might lead
to the use of emerging technologies in
ways that trigger irreversible long-term
damage.

30

The Global Risks Report 2018

A rapid collapse of fish stocks could
engender cascading failures across
marine ecosystems. Communities reliant
on fishing for their incomes might struggle
to survive, leading to fiscal pressures
and/or displacement. A sufficiently large
surge in the supply of illegal fish might
distort global food markets, leading to
disruption in the agriculture and foodproduction sectors. If illegal drone fishing
crossed national maritime boundaries
and was perceived to be statesanctioned, retaliatory measures might
lead to diplomatic or military tensions.

Targeted schemes such as genetic
markers to track fish throughout the
supply chain might limit demand for
illegally caught fish. So might better
vessel observation. But key to progress
in this and similar areas of hybrid
technological disruption will be new
global governance norms and
institutions, particularly those designed
to protect the global commons and
prevent the destructive deployment of
emerging technologies.

Into the Abyss
A cascading series of economic/financial crises overwhelm
political and policy responses
Against a backdrop of domestic and
international political strife—and with
economic policy-makers already
operating in uncharted territory—the
eruption of another global financial
crisis could overwhelm political and
policy responses. A systemic collapse
of the sort that was averted in 2007–
2008 could push countries, regions or
even the whole world over the edge
and into a period of chaos.
If financial systems go down,
contemporary economies and
societies cannot function. Money
would stop circulating. Wages would
not be paid. Supply chains would break
down. Scarcity would begin to become
pervasive, and this would threaten to
upend the political and social order.
Policy-makers would pull every
available lever to restore stability. But
what if the prospect of another

financial-sector bailout further enflamed
societies rather than calming them? Or
what if the financial system’s collapse
stemmed from a hostile cyberattack,
raising fears that more attacks and
disruption lie ahead?
More can be done to enhance the
resilience of the financial system.
Stress-testing methodologies could be
strengthened by assigning greater
weight to tail events and unexpected
consequences. Greater consideration
could be given to the growing number
of voices calling for radical change of
the way the banking system works. But
societies might also want to prepare
more actively for worst-case scenarios.

Inequality Ingested
Bioengineering and cognition-enhancing drugs widen
the gulf between haves and have-nots
Drugs for human enhancement are in
their early stages, but scientific
advances may well be exponential. In a
world of entrenched inequality, many
people might choose to disregard
potential health risks in order to
maintain or elevate their status.
Ingestion would be impossible to
monitor, and even if bans are put in
place black market channels would
inevitably emerge.
If the price tag is significant and the
benefits are strong, the result would be
ever-deeper and more entrenched
inequality. This could trigger social
instability and conflict between the
haves and have-nots. Divergent
regulatory responses could lead to
productivity disparities across countries
and the emergence of “enhancement
tourism” flows. If unforeseen
consequences—such as serious brain
32

The Global Risks Report 2018

deterioration—emerged in the future it
could create a massive public health
crisis.
Stronger measures to combat existing
inequality might reduce consumption
incentives, but that seems doubtful.
Early and appropriate regulation of
enhancement technologies may be
more successful than an outright ban.
For example, new workplace equality
legislation might require employers to
confirm that all staff are compliant with
enhancement rules. If these
technologies were ever proven to be an
unalloyed good—analogous to
vaccinations—then the regulatory
objective might shift to ensuring
universal access.

War without Rules
State-on-state cyberattacks escalate unpredictably
owing to a lack of agreed protocols
Offensive cyber capabilities are
developing more rapidly than our ability
to deal with hostile incidents. This
creates a fog of uncertainty in which
potential miscalculations could trigger a
spiral of retaliatory responses. Imagine
that a country’s critical infrastructure
systems are compromised by a
cyberattack, leading to disruption of
essential services and loss of life—the
pressure to retaliate would build rapidly,
potentially setting off an escalatory
chain reaction.
Questions of speed and attribution
heighten the risk of unpredictable
consequences. If an attack is
developing more quickly than the
targeted state’s efforts to identify the
attacker, retaliation might be
misdirected, drawing new actors into a
widening conflict. This would add to the
potential for further confusion and

escalation, including the resort to
conventional military force or the
unintended widening of conflict if an
active cyberweapon inadvertently
spreads through cross-border
networks into non-target countries.
In conventional warfare, agreed norms
and protocols provide predictability and
slow the emergence of crises. If
governments accelerated current
efforts to establish similar ground rules
for cyberwarfare, it would help to
prevent conflict erupting by mistake.
Familiar concepts such as
transparency, proportionality and
non-proliferation could be re-codified
for cyber purposes. And perhaps
classes of cyberweapons could be
collectively prohibited, in the same way
biological and chemical weapons have
been.

The Global Risks Report 2018

Identity Geopolitics
Self-determination around contested borders sparks
regional conflict
At a time of global geopolitical
uncertainty, the twin forces of national
identity and self-determination are
growing in disruptive capacity. Already
this is leading to violence and
constitutional instability, at times
spurred on by foreign powers.
Examples include states expelling
ethnic or religious minorities, national
minorities attempting to secede and
nation-states extricating themselves
from international constraints on their
sovereignty.
A deepening of disputes over cultural
and political borders would trigger
widening clashes, potentially causing
regional domino effects as states and
sub-state actors mobilize in defence of
or opposition to the status quo. This
instability would create new trigger-

34

The Global Risks Report 2018

points for interstate conflict, particularly
in regions where disputes over selfdetermination are long-standing and
are likely either to be resolved violently
rather than consensually or to draw in
regional hegemons and/or global
powers.
Stronger promotion and protection of
equal cultural and political rights within
states would help defuse tensions
about national identity. So would the
fostering of stronger economic and
other links between states sharing
contested borders. Drawing on
successful examples of constitutional
innovation—such as multilevel and
cross-community forms of
governance—might help guide the
administration of internally divided
polities.

Walled Off
Regulatory, cybersecurity and protectionist concerns
lead to the fragmentation of the internet
A proliferation of damaging crossborder cyberattacks might be the most
likely trigger for a government-led
breakup of the internet into national or
regional “walled gardens”, but there are
many other potential drivers that could
lead governments in this direction:
economic protectionism, regulatory
divergence, censorship and repression,
the fraying of national political
discourse and the loss of government
power relative to global online
companies.
Fragmentation of the internet could
involve, among other things,
interruption of technical internet
functions or barriers to the flow of
content and transactions. Some might
welcome a move towards a less
hyper-globalized online world, but

many would not: resistance would be
likely, as would the rapid growth of
illegal workarounds. The pace of
technological development would slow
and its trajectory would change.
Human rights abuses would likely
increase as advances in international
monitoring were rolled back.
Advances in cybersecurity governance
and technology ought to mitigate the
risk of worsening cyber disruption and
theft that would trigger the imposition
of firewalls. Ongoing dialogue between
governments and technology
companies would help to ensure that
internet-based technologies develop in
a politically sustainable context of
shared values and agreed
responsibilities.

Geopolitical Power
Shifts

The world has moved into a new and
unsettling geopolitical phase. It is not
just multipolar, but multiconceptual.
There is no longer any assumption—
as there had been in the post–Cold
War phase, framed by so-called
New World Order and Washington
Consensus thinking—that norms
and institutions exist towards which
the world’s major powers might
converge. This creates new risks and
uncertainties: rising military tensions,
economic and commercial disruptions,
and destabilizing feedback loops
between changing international
relations and countries’ domestic
political conditions.
International relations now play out
in increasingly diverse ways: beyond
conventional military build-ups, these
include new cyber sources of hard
and soft power, reconfigured trade
and investment linkages, proxy
conflicts, changing alliance dynamics
and potential flashpoints related to
the global commons. Assessing
and mitigating risks across all these
theatres of potential conflict will require
careful horizon scanning and crisis
anticipation by state and non-state
actors alike. Actors with a global
presence are likely to have to become
increasingly adept at calibrating their
responses across divergent political
and legal systems.
Four related developments stand out
as potential sources of disruption
over the short and medium term. The
intensification of strong-state politics is
affecting both large and small states,
while global norms are eroding and
tensions growing between major
powers. These two trends fuel two
others: increasingly aggressive geoeconomic agendas and the mounting
pressures faced by small states.

State-centred
politics
At a time of geopolitical flux, reestablishing the state as the primary
locus of power and legitimacy offers
governments—and citizens—an
increasingly attractive strategic anchor.
In particular, nationalist agendas and
the external projection of a strong
state can be an effective strategy
for governments seeking to redress
perceived international humiliations,
past or present. In China, for example,
President Xi Jinping calls for “the
great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation” to put the country’s “century
of humiliation” firmly behind it. In the
United States, President Trump seeks
to “make America great again” after
decades of being “taken advantage
of.”
Widely differing variations on the
state-centred theme can be seen
around the world: among these are
Emmanuel Macron’s effort to restore
France’s standing with his “Jupiterian”
presidency; the United Kingdom’s
desire to “take back control” by
leaving the European Union; stronger
nationalism in Japan under Shinzo
Abe; Vladimir Putin’s focus on
rebuilding Russia’s international status
from the rubble of the Soviet Union;
the erosion of pluralism in Turkey as
Recep Tayyip Erdogan bridles at his
domestic and international opponents.
The intensification of nationalist and
strong-state narratives creates risks
both domestically and internationally.
The profile of these risks will vary
in each case, depending, among
other things, on the way in which
power is obtained and asserted,
and on the ends towards which it is
used. One domestic danger is that
the interests of non-state actors will
suffer. If the protection and projection
of state power becomes more
central to policy, then the rights or

protections enjoyed by individuals,
businesses and civil society groups
become more contingent on leaders’
perceptions of the state interest and—
sometimes seen as the same thing—
consolidation of their own personal
power.1 There are numerous instances
to point to, along a spectrum of widely
varying severity. An extreme example
is the flight of Rohingya people from
Myanmar. Other recent examples
include the purge in Turkey following
the attempted coup in 2016 and
clashes over the separation of powers
in Poland.2
Internationally, two main risks arise.
First, the danger of miscommunication
and miscalculation between states is
heightened by the absence of a clear
rules-based international order or a
settled balance of power. Concern
about possible conflict involving North
Korea is a prominent example: the
volatile clash between the strong-state
instincts of Donald Trump and Kim
Jong Un during 2017 has created
uncertainty about the strength of the
norms created by decades of work to
prevent nuclear conflict.
A second international risk relates
to states interfering in the domestic
affairs of other states. There are a
growing number of incidences of
states projecting their power in ways
that directly encourage or exacerbate
problems inside other countries’
borders. This kind of interference may
foment instability within the “target”
state, including violent reprisals
or the eruption of civil conflict. By
undermining the non-intervention
principle set out in the UN Charter, it
also ratchets up the risk of retaliation
and a slide into interstate conflict.
Interference in the affairs of nonWestern states has been one reason
for the erosion of the US-led rulesbased order; however, the wheel has
turned and non-Western countries
now appear to be increasingly active
in this area.3

The Global Risks Report 2018

37

Major-power
tensions
The intensification of strong-state
politics has the greatest disruptive
potential among the world’s major
powers: relations between them
are changing, mostly for the worse.
As each of these states becomes
increasingly assertive of its own
interests, consensus is fraying on the
rules that govern their interactions
and the directions in which the world
might converge. As a result, there is
evidence of a general breakdown in
trust and an erosion of respect for
global norms designed to govern
peaceful international interactions.
The United States has become less
willing to act as enforcer of global
norms at the head of a dominant
coalition. This reflects, among other
things, divisions within the United
States over whether the benefits that
flow from this global enforcer role
are sufficient to justify its costs. As a
result, rising and resurgent powers
calculate that actions that may
breach international law (UN Charter),
the law of the sea (UNCLOS) or
international humanitarian law (Geneva
Conventions) can achieve objectives
without incurring unacceptable costs
in terms of opposition or punishment.
The emergence of cyberspace as
an unregulated battlefield has also
created new ways to advance state
interests, allowing interference in
domestic political or economic affairs
that might be considered acts of
aggression if pursued by other means.
Strong trade and investment
connections between the United
States and China mean that, whatever
their differences, a significant level of
economic interdependence remains
central to their relationship. However,
as China exercises increasing power
38

The Global Risks Report 2018

in the Western Pacific, confidence in
the capacity of the United States to
determine outcomes in the region is
being gradually undermined. As has
been seen in the North Korea crisis,
the danger that long-term strategic
rivalry could spill over and harm
economic relations is becoming more
real.
China’s determination to press
territorial and maritime claims,
and its extension of the Belt and
Road Initiative (BRI), have triggered
responses among neighbouring
powers. Japan and India, for example,
are exploring more structured
forms of strategic cooperation in
both economic and military affairs.
This initiative could become more
significant if additional partners—such
as Australia, the United States, or
even European states—were to take
part. However, most of these countries
are currently cautious and would be
wary of allowing such a hedging policy
to cause tensions with China.
Meanwhile, Russia has used its
policy in Syria to reposition itself as
a leading foreign policy actor, with
the ability to shape military outcomes
and geopolitical balances. Russia’s
relations with China have improved,
but those with Western powers
have deteriorated: Russia’s policies
towards Ukraine have been seen
as an unacceptable breach of the
post–World War II order and have
galvanized a Western coalition around
a policy of individual and sectoral
sanctions. Among other things, this
has led to renewed debate in the
European Union about the need for
increased military capacity so that
the bloc’s defensive stance is less
dependent on US policy.4

Smaller-state
disruptions

REUTERS/Lee Jae Won

Shifting relations between global
and regional powers is creating
increased uncertainty for smaller
states—an under-appreciated source
of geopolitical risk. Smaller states tend
to benefit from the predictability that
comes with rules-based order and
they are among the most affected
when rules erode and major powers
jostle for position. These countries
are particularly vulnerable to the
weakening of security alliances they
may previously have relied upon, as
well as to subtle or overt pressures to
adapt policy or strategy to conform
to the interests of a major power or
regional hegemon.
The dilemma faced by smaller
states, as they assess how best to
recalibrate relations with larger states,
was illustrated in Singapore last year.
Mindful of China’s growing power
and recent developments in Qatar,
some warned against overestimating
Singapore’s room for manoeuvre:
“small states must always act like
small states.”5 Others responded that
Singapore should “stand up for the
autonomy to define and pursue our
own national interests rather than
have them defined for us, even if this
displeases major powers.”6 This is not
an isolated example; an increasing
number of smaller states face similar
challenges. Last year, Bhutan found
itself at the centre of a stand-off
between India and China;7 Lebanon
is exposed to changing dynamics
between regional powers in the Middle
East; the annexation of Crimea has
left Ukraine perched between two
mistrustful power blocs; and a number
of smaller EU states are concerned
about whether the eventual departure
of the United Kingdom will affect
decision-making to their detriment.

Compounding their exposure
to changes in the geopolitical
environment, smaller states are
more vulnerable to potential secondorder effects such as refugee and
migration flows resulting from conflicts
or recessions in neighbouring
countries. For example, Syrians who
fled between 2011 and 2015 are
estimated to have increased Jordan’s
population by 25%. And smaller
states’ finances are vulnerable to
even the possibility of geopolitical
risks, because nervousness can lead
to lower inward investment and to
governments feeling compelled to
divert revenues into precautionary
increases in security-related spending.
Smaller states are not always passive
objects of geopolitical disruption: they
can also be its source or conduit in
various ways. A weak or collapsing
state can become a locus of instability
that radiates disorder or pulls in larger
neighbouring states: Libya and South
Sudan, for example, have caused
instability in neighbouring countries,
notably via flows of refugees and
weapons. Elsewhere, for some
years the near-collapse of the Greek
economy was an ongoing source
of existential risk for the Eurozone.
Smaller states can also amplify
geopolitical risk by actively asserting
themselves on their neighbours: this
can be seen in extreme form in the
North Korea crisis, where tensions
are particularly acute both because
the government fears annihilation and
because of the unique dynamics of
its position relative to China and the
United States.

The Global Risks Report 2018

39

Geo-economic
risks
Increasing geopolitical fluidity and
intensifying strong-state policies
increase the risks associated with
economic interactions between
states. States have always used tools
of economic policy and diplomacy
to pursue their geopolitical goals.
While globalization was ascendant,
many believed that economic
connectedness—Western companies
and consumers benefiting from
low-cost manufacturing, which
simultaneously pushed forward
emerging-economy development—
would contribute to a gradual
convergence of states’ outlooks
and goals, reducing the likelihood
of geopolitical tensions. However,
confidence in the mutuality of benefits
has weakened. This is particularly
true among Western countries, where
the strongest geo-economic trend of
recent years has been the erosion of
support for globalization and growing
support for protectionist policies. It
is notable that two of the states that
have traditionally been among the
firmest advocates of global economic
integration, the United Kingdom and
the United States, have seen the most
dramatic uncertainties emerge around
their trade-related policies.
In other parts of the world, plans
to extend and deepen networks of
economic corridors are spurring huge
investments in infrastructure. By far
the most ambitious is China’s Belt and
Road Initiative (BRI): launched in 2013,
it spans more than 60 countries and
involves investment plans totalling a
reported US$900 billion.8 However,
there are numerous other such
corridors, most of which connect Asia
and Europe. They include the China
Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC);
the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar
40

The Global Risks Report 2018

Economic Corridor (BCIM-EC); the
International North-South Transport
Corridor (INSTC), which links India,
Iran and Russia; and the Asia-Africa
Growth Corridor (AAGC),9 a joint
initiative by India and Japan.
Proponents of these infrastructure
plans argue that they will foster
peaceful relations by creating new
links and patterns of cooperation.
However, the ambitiousness of some
of these plans has raised concerns
that they might exacerbate rather than
prevent tension. The geostrategic
interdependence they create—both
through the physical presence of
assets and people on the ground
and through patterns of increased
indebtedness, which is a potential
source of vulnerability for lowerincome countries in particular—are
more durable and difficult to unwind
than mere trade agreements. This
raises questions about potential
implications if relationships between
corridor partners were to sour in the
future.
Some have argued that crisscrossing the Eurasian landmass with
a latticework of economic corridors
could undermine the stability of the
region’s state system: “connectivity
does not necessarily presage a more
peaceful world … Eurasia is cohering
into both a single trade and conflict
system.”10 One potential trigger
for disruption related to economic
corridors might be pushback from a
country that feels its sovereignty is
being undermined. In early 2017 there
were signs of this in Sri Lanka, where
violent protests erupted at a ceremony
to mark the start of construction of
a Chinese special economic zone.11
Another potential trigger might come
from economic corridors crossing
contested territory—CPEC, for
example, runs through Gilgit-Baltistan,

a part of Kashmir that is administered
by Pakistan but claimed by India.
There remain strong incentives on
all sides to avoid triggering trade
wars, just as there are for all forms
of conflict—but the risk of domestic
political factors spilling over into
disruption of the global trade system
has risen sharply in recent years.
Trade-related tensions could also
create distractions and divisions that
hamper the unity of regional or global
responses to other geopolitical risks
that might crystallize in the evolving
confluence of strong-state politics,
major power tensions and smallstate disruptions in an increasingly
disordered world.

Hindsight

Each year the Global Risks Report highlights numerous potential sources of
danger and disruption. In this new Hindsight section, we dip back into
previous editions of the report to consider three of the risks to which we have
previously drawn attention: antimicrobial resistance, youth unemployment
and the phenomenon of online misinformation that we termed “digital
wildfires” when we discussed it five years ago. The aim here is to trace the
progress that has been made in the intervening years. How have these risks
and the global responses to them evolved?

Antimicrobial Resistance

In the 2013 Global Risks Report,
a chapter entitled “The Dangers of
Hubris on Human Health” warned
about the growing risks associated
with complacency towards
antimicrobial resistance (AMR). It
highlighted two underlying drivers:
the overuse and misuse of antibiotics,
in both human health systems and
livestock management; and the fact
that no new classes of antibiotics
had been invented since the 1980s.
The chapter noted newly emerging
resistance to the strongest class of
antibiotics, carbapenems. It cited
estimates of 100,000 AMR-related
deaths in US hospitals and 80,000 in
China. The potential economic impact
was put at 0.4% to 1.6% of GDP.
The risks posed by AMR have
continued to intensify in the five years
since the 2013 report. Numerous
welcome initiatives have been
launched, but concrete successes in
addressing the two drivers identified
above remain elusive. We still face two
trends that spell potential disaster:
new classes of drugs are not being
invented and resistance to existing

drugs continues to spread inexorably.
The stakes are incredibly high—if
resistance overtakes all our available
antibiotics, it would spell the “the end
of modern medicine”.1

The costs are rising…
The latest economic impact
assessments should be cause for
alarm about the dangers of AMR
to human health and the global
economy. A study published by the
World Bank in March 2017 estimated
that AMR would exert a drag on
global GDP of between 1.1 and 3.8
percentage points between now
and 2050.2 According to estimates
from a report supported by the UK
government and the Wellcome Trust,
AMR could cost US$100 trillion
between now and 2050, with the
annual death toll reaching 10 million
over that period.3
As in 2013, the patchiness of
data continues to make a precise
assessment of the AMR problem
difficult. For example, a 2016 Reuters

investigation in the United States
determined that the accuracy of
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) estimates of
AMR effects—2 million infections
and 23,000 deaths per year—is
undermined by problems such as
AMR-related deaths being misrecorded on death certificates.4
One of the most exhaustive official
studies of AMR—a two-year
review commissioned by the UK
government—concluded in 2016 that,
globally, 700,000 deaths each year
can be attributed to AMR.5 The Center
for Disease Dynamics, Economics
& Policy (CDDEP) has been tracking
antimicrobial resistance globally—the
maps in Figure 4.1 illustrate their latest
data, which show impacts broadly
unchanged when compared with
the European data for MRSA and
Klebsiella pneumoniae we cited in
2013.6 In October 2017, a new fouryear global project that aims to track
the evolution of AMR in 195 countries
since 1990 was announced.7

The Global Risks Report 2018

…and resistance is
spreading
Resistance to the strongest antibiotics
continues to spread, even as their
use increases to cope with still
higher levels of resistance to weaker
antibiotics. In 2014, the World Health
Organization (WHO) reported that
“K. pneumoniae resistant also to
carbapenems has been identified in
most of the countries that provided
data, with proportions of resistance up
to 54% reported.”8 In 2017, research
demonstrated that bacteria resistant
to colistin, the “antibiotic of last
resort”, had spread around the world
within 18 months of the resistance first
emerging.9

Global plans are taking
shape…
There are some encouraging signs
of action to counter AMR, although
most of them are still at the planning
stage. In 2015 WHO’s five-point
Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial
Resistance was ratified, and it is
being supplemented with accelerating
completion of national action plans—
important because the causes and
consequences of AMR can differ
widely across countries. As of April
2017, 67 countries had completed
national action plans, according to
WHO, with another 62 in the process
of doing so.10

One key objective of these plans is to
reduce excessive use of antibiotics,
both in human health systems and in
livestock and agriculture. The latter,
in particular, is a growing problem.11
In the United States, 62% of the
antibiotics used in agriculture are
medically important for humans.12 And
agricultural usage is rising sharply: the
global use of antimicrobials in meat
production is expected to grow by
67% between 2010 and 2030.13
Efforts to reduce the excessive
use of antimicrobials need to also
ensure access to affordable lifesaving medications in the world’s
poorest countries, as underscored
in a declaration by the G20 leaders
in 2017, as well as by UNICEF.14
UNICEF’s Chief of Health has
recommended using an integrated
community case management (ICCM)
approach, which can help to achieve
an appropriate balance between
ensuring access and preventing
misuse of antibiotics.15

…but the drugs pipeline
is a cause for alarm
There is still a stark lack of new
drugs in the development pipeline.16
According to a 2016 study by The
Pew Charitable Trusts, every currently
available antibiotic is derived from a
class discovered by 1984.17 Efforts
are, however, intensifying to steer

research in the right direction, such as
the first-ever priority list of antibioticresistant bacteria published by WHO
in 2016.18 New incentives are helping
to catalyse new work. For example,
CARB-X is an international non-profit
partnership launched in July 2016
to accelerate research that focuses
on the AMR bacteria prioritized as
the most urgent by WHO and the
CDC.19 It has already funded 18
projects from six countries.20 In the
United Kingdom, the innovation
foundation Nesta has offered a £10
million prize for the invention of a
fast, accurate and affordable test
for bacterial infections to help health
professionals worldwide administer
the appropriate antibiotics.21 As
of October 2017, 250 entries had
been submitted. Scientific advances
are allowing researchers to study
a greater number of potential new
sources of antibiotics; one company
undertaking this kind of research is
NovoBiotic Pharmaceutical, which
studies soil microbes that until
recently could not be cultivated in a
laboratory.22 More radical alternatives
to traditional antibiotics are also being
studied, including the potential use of
CRISPR to trick harmful bacteria into
destroying their own DNA.23

Youth Unemployment

The 2014 Global Risks Report
highlighted the risk that the global
financial crisis would create a “lost
generation”. We pointed to youth
unemployment as a corrosive legacy,
with the capacity to hinder young
people’s integration into traditional
patterns of economic life, such as
earning, saving and building careers.
Among the specific issues raised were
long-term unemployment; low-quality,
part-time and temporary employment;
weak links between education and
work; the impact of demographic
change and migration; and increasing
pressures on social protection
systems.
Globally, youth unemployment
has been broadly static since the
publication of the report in 2014, and it
remains moderately higher than before
the global financial crisis. Joblessness
remains alarmingly high in some
countries and regions. Even where job
creation has picked up since the crisis,
concerns are rising about the growing
prevalence of low-quality employment
and the rise of the “gig economy”.24
Youth unemployment is set to remain
an important global challenge—
particularly as demographic shifts in
developing countries gather pace—
and will continue to amplify numerous
domestic and global risks, including
social exclusion, mass migration and
generational clashes over fiscal and
labour-market policies.

Note: Data valid as of 9 October 2017.

Global average
masks big underlying
differences…
Regional trends differ markedly,
particularly in North America and the
European Union, where the crisis hit
hardest, leading to rapid increases in
average youth unemployment followed
by sharp reversals (see Figure 4.2).
Two other regional outliers are North
Africa and Latin America, which have
seen youth unemployment jump for
reasons unrelated to the crisis. The
trigger in North Africa was the onset
of the Arab Spring in 2010, while
joblessness in Latin America has
been increasing since 2014 against
a backdrop of mounting political and
economic turmoil.
Despite the rapid improvements
recorded in Europe since 2013, the
region remains particularly exposed
to problems of youth unemployment:
on average, young people in Europe

46

The Global Risks Report 2018

Latin America and the Caribbean
Southern Asia

remain much more likely to be
unemployed than their counterparts
either in North America or in most
emerging regions (see Figure 4.2). In
some European countries, which had
high levels of youth unemployment
before the crisis, the situation remains
particularly dire—notably in Greece,
Spain and Italy. These countries have
seen sharp increases in poverty and
other adverse societal impacts.
Youth unemployment remains
stubbornly high across the Middle
East and North Africa (MENA), at
around 30%. The ongoing nature of
the region’s long-standing challenges
on this issue are emphasized by
the latest results of an annual World
Economic Forum survey of more
than 30,000 young people globally: in
2017, respondents from MENA cited
the “lack of economic opportunity
and employment” as the most serious
issue facing their country.25

…and positive headline
trends can mask
structural challenges

Youth employment
schemes have their
limits…

Youth unemployment rates are,
on average, significantly lower in
developing than advanced economies.
However, the structural factors
we highlighted in 2014—notably
bulging youth populations and the
prevalence of low-quality and informalsector work—continue to challenge
developing regions. Across Africa,
for example, youth unemployment
decreased slightly over the past
decade, but levels of working poverty
among the young remain high: 70%
of young people live on less than
US$3.10 per day.26 Since Africa is the
youngest region in the world,27 this is
likely to have lasting consequences
for the continent and beyond: the
extent to which a sufficient number of
good jobs can be created for rapidly
growing youth populations will be a
key driver of future migration flows.28
Accelerating technological advances
will complicate this challenge in
many countries, requiring major
improvements to education systems.29

In 2016, the UN launched the Global
Initiative for Decent Jobs for Youth
to coordinate policies on youth
employment and young people’s
labour rights.31 A similar umbrella
scheme exists at the EU level—the €6
billion Youth Guarantee programme,
under which member states pledge
to ensure that within four months
of becoming unemployed young
people are offered new employment,
education or a workplace
apprenticeship.32 However, in
countries where youth unemployment
appears most intractable, structural
drivers—such as relatively high rates
of early school-leaving—mean that
such short-term interventions will
struggle to have much effect. Deeper
structural reforms are needed.33

China faces a different challenge:
although youth unemployment in
the country has remained stable, a
10-fold increase in the number of
university graduates between 1997
and 2017 has created problems of
underemployment. Many graduates
are in low-skilled work, with 25%
earning less than the average migrant
worker.30

…unless accompanied
by education and
workplace reforms
The private sector is playing an
increasingly prominent role in tackling
youth unemployment by equipping
youth with marketable skills,
particularly in developing economies.
Google and IBM, for example, have
launched digital-skills programmes for
young people in Africa.34 There is a
growing recognition of the importance
of apprenticeships and vocational
training. In Switzerland, the Global
Apprenticeship Network (GAN) is a
platform of 14 global businesses—
including Adecco, IBM, Microsoft and
Nestle—that help companies around
the world to set up apprenticeship
programmes. The government
of Germany, a clear leader in this
area, is currently working with 18
other countries on apprenticeship
schemes.35

Labor Market Policies (ALMPs)

Development (OECD). https://stats.oecd.org/Index.

The increased use of “flexicurity”
policies is another potential way
of helping young people who are
currently unemployed or consigned to
low-quality work. Flexicurity combines
(1) increased flexibility for employers to
hire and fire workers with (2) generous
state unemployment payments and
(3) increased investment in active
labour market policies (ALMPs)—
measures that currently differ widely
between countries (see Figure 4.3).36
By encouraging increased movement
between jobs in the labour market,
flexicurity policies help to create
employment openings for young
people.

Digital Wildfires

Three years before the Brexit
referendum and US presidential
elections that brought the terms “fake
news” and “post-truth” into broad
circulation, a chapter in the 2013
Global Risks Report entitled “Digital
Wildfires in a Hyperconnected World”
warned of the increasing danger of
misinformation being spread by social
media. Among the key issues raised
were the intentional use of social
media to spread misinformation (for
example, through the use of fake
accounts to smear or impersonate
political opponents), the difficulty
of correcting misinformation when
it spreads within trusted networks,
global governance challenges and
the danger that some governments
might use well-intentioned constraints
on misinformation to limit freedom of
speech.
The prevalence and impact of digital
wildfires have surged in the five years
since we first discussed them. Even
as the potential social, political and
geopolitical risks are intensifying,
however, the ways in which widely
shared misinformation can influence
human behaviour are still far from
fully understood. While social media
becomes increasingly deeply ingrained
in daily life, mitigating adverse impacts
will require sustained efforts by both
policy-makers and technology leaders,
and there will need to be a careful
balance struck between regulation and
preventing infringements of individual
liberties.

The prevalence of online
misinformation has
surged…
Digital misinformation is not a new
phenomenon—Freedom House has
been tracking the use of paid progovernment commentators to mimic
grassroots supporters since 2009.
Nor is it confined to the United States:
Freedom House’s Freedom on the
Net report found 30% more countries
using fake online grassroots activity in
2017 than 2016.37
However, it was during the 2016
US presidential election that “fake
news” acquired global prominence,
and much of the wave of research
now underway has focused on this
example. According to one study, in
the three months immediately prior
to the election, the top 20 false news
stories outperformed—in terms of
shares, reactions and comments—
the top 20 stories from major news
sources.38 Engagement with fake
news stories increased by 53%
compared with the previous threemonth period.39 Another study noted
that social media platforms directed
40% of the web traffic that went to
fake news websites, compared with
only 10% for the top mainstream news
websites.40

…but its impact is
difficult to gauge
Studies have found that people have
a hard time distinguishing between
accurate and fake headlines. One
survey in late 2016 presented
respondents with a random selection
of six headlines—three accurate
and three false—and asked them to
rate the accuracy of the headlines
they could recall having seen
before.41 It found that 75% of the
time respondents judged the false

48

The Global Risks Report 2018

headlines to be “somewhat accurate”
or “very accurate”—only slightly lower
than 83% for the accurate news
headlines.42 However, another study
conducted in 2017 suggests a greater
level of user scepticism about news
consumed via social media—it found
that while 55% of respondents said
they consumed news from Facebook,
only 18% said they trusted news from
Facebook most or all of the time.43

Efforts are underway to
bolster safeguards
Numerous efforts are now underway
to limit the prevalence and potential
disruptiveness of online misinformation
by helping the public to critically
evaluate news sources. Since early
2016, Facebook has launched a
number of efforts to address false
news, clickbait, and sensationalism,
including a partnership with factchecking organizations and a network
of researchers called the News
Integrity Initiative.44 An early study
by Yale researchers suggests that
these types of warnings reduce the
likelihood of stories being shared,
but has only a limited effect on users’
perceptions of accuracy when stories
are shown repeatedly.45 And in 2017
the OECD announced plans to add
critical thinking about information
sources to its Global Competency
tests.46 Programmes to teach students
to evaluate online sources critically are
a growing trend around
the world.47

Amid increasing pressure from
governments and users, technology
companies have also been taking

steps to reduce the financial incentives
for the creators of fake news and to
enhance the transparency of material
on their platforms. For example,
Google announced in November 2016
that it would restrict its AdSense ads
on sites that “misrepresent, misstate,
or conceal information about the
publisher, the publisher’s content,
or the primary purpose of the web
property.”48 Facebook has taken
action against ads on its platform that
are “illegal, misleading or deceptive,
which includes fake news”;49 however,
these restrictions notably do not
prevent users from writing or sharing
inaccurate content.50
In September 2017, it was announced
that a Russia-based organization
spent US$100,000 on advertisements
promoting divisive political issues
during the US presidential campaign;
Facebook said it would provide the
ads to congressional investigators,51
and has launched tools to make all
ads it runs publicly accessible in the
future. In October, Twitter announced
it would ban RT (formerly Russia
Today) and Sputnik, two major media
organizations, from advertising on
the platform following an internal
investigation and the identification
by the US intelligence community
of these companies as vehicles of
Russian government interference in
the 2016 presidential election.52 Twitter
also announced that it is launching an
“Advertising Transparency Center” and
new policies that will (1) provide details
about all ads carried on its platform,
(2) place clear visual markers on
political advertisements, (3) disclose
how political ads are targeted and (4)
strengthen policies regarding political
advertising.53

Risk Reassessment

One of the aims of the Global Risks Report is to encourage individuals and
organizations to think critically and creatively about how they can respond to
a rapidly evolving risks landscape. With that in mind, in the Risk
Reassessment section we invite selected risk experts to share their insights
about developments in our understanding of risk. In this year’s report, Roland
Kupers writes about resilience in complex systems, while Michele Wucker
calls for organizations to pay more attention to cognitive bias in their risk
management processes.

Resilience in complex organizations

By Roland Kupers
In a deeply interconnected world,
stresses and shocks propagate
across systems in ways that evade
forecasting. Climate change is
linked to the Syrian civil war, which
is connected to heightened concern
over immigration, which precipitated
Brexit. Lehman Brothers was an
investable company, until suddenly
it wasn’t and it catalysed a global
financial crisis. None of these links are
causal in a strict sense, nor could they
reasonably be assigned a probability,
but they nevertheless clearly
form a web of cascading events.
Organizations increasingly recognize
how rapidly and often unexpectedly
such events unfold. Since the 2008
financial crisis, the terms “black
swans” and “fat tails” have become a
familiar part of the risk conversation.
Yet we don’t always fully spell out the
consequences.
Standard risk management tools
assume that the risks follow a
normalized distribution, mainly
because this provides easy-tounderstand narratives. But fat tail risks
are not normal distributions. The only
way to maintain the traditional tools
is to neglect and wish away the fat
tails. Simply denying the existence
of black swans is hardly a way to
deal with them. This approach may
be approximately right most times,
but in principle it is wrong. The
consequences of being so wrong
can impact an enterprise, perhaps
catastrophically. Fortunately there
is an alternative, which consists
of applying a resilience lens where
complexity prevails and traditional risk
management is insufficient.
Resilience is, in fact, a property of
complex systems. And complexity
is the science of interconnected
54

The Global Risks Report 2018

systems that has been driving a
slow-motion revolution in science
over the past 35 years or so. In
2013 the World Economic Forum
published a comprehensive overview
in Perspectives on a Hyperconnected
World, describing the impact of
complexity for policy and business.
The conclusion is not that policymakers and managers must become
complexity experts. But a level
of complexity literacy is crucial to
navigate the modern age.

Nine resilience lenses
At the World Economic Forum’s
annual meeting in 2012, prominent
companies began to take note of
resilience. Peter Voser, at the time
Shell’s CEO, asked nine of his
colleagues from across sectors what
the impact of considering resilience
would be on their business, on their
clients and on their risk management.
This led to the creation of the
Resilience Action Initiative (RAI), which
in turn resulted in a set of resilience
tools and approaches informed by
complexity theory but grounded in
practice. One critical application is
enterprise resilience: the capacity of
a company or other organization to
adapt and prosper in the face of highimpact, low-probability risks.
Working on the RAI project, we
broke resilience into a set of lenses
that could be applied across an
organization’s operations. We used
the resilience lenses to examine the
systemic risks and evaluate mitigation
strategies. These lenses were then
tested and tuned for applicability
with the risk managers of the RAI
companies. The new resilience tools
are intended to be used in addition
to traditional risk management tools,
not instead of them. Organizations
will continue to face normalized risks,
which require the traditional tools. It

is systemic risks that require the new
tools.
The RAI work led to nine resilience
lenses, grouped into the following
three categories to provide the agenda
for a fat-tail risk conversation:
–– “Structural resilience” considers
the systemic dynamics within the
organization itself.
–– “Integrative resilience” underlines
complex interconnections with the
external context.
–– “Transformative resilience”
responds to the fact that
mitigating some risks requires
transformation.

Structural resilience
This category encompasses
redundancy, modularity and requisite
diversity. The focus of structural
resilience is on bouncing back faster
from a disturbance. Redundancy is
possibly the most familiar resilience
strategy, but like the spare tyre on a
car, it is the most expensive approach,
because it requires non-performing
assets. System modularity builds
resilience only if the modules are
loosely coupled: separate them too
much and you no longer have a
system, couple them too tightly and
you lose the adaptive capacity. As
in nature, diversity is a key resilience
strategy. For organizations, however,
this requires addressing the hard
question of which diversity is fit for
purpose for this problem at this time.
That is what is meant by “requisite
diversity”.

Integrative resilience

Transformative resilience

This second category also consists of
three lenses: multi-scale interactions,
thresholds and social cohesion.
These elements mainly focus on
the context of the organization
and its interconnections. The idea
of systems operating at multiple
scales is perhaps the most abstract,
but also one of the most essential.
It is perhaps most obvious in the
geographic structure of individuals,
families, neighbourhoods, cities,
provinces and countries. The health
of the connections at and between
each scale is a potent contributor to
the resilience of a system. Thresholds
are familiar, but also neglected. The
past of every organization shows
discontinuities, but its future plans
are always smooth. The fact that
threshold effects generally cannot
be forecast does not mean they
should be ignored. Finally, social
cohesion—such as the social capital
an organization has to fall back on in
times of crisis— is a strong source of
resilience.

This category emphasizes that
resilience is not simply about being
able to return to the starting point
after a shock. In some cases the
organization needs to proactively
change or it will end up being changed
by external circumstances. The first
lens is distributed or polycentric
governance. Centralizing authority
may seem efficient, but it often
comes at the expense of resilience.
Elinor Ostrom, winner of the Nobel
Memorial Prize for Economics, has
described how the use of multiple
and overlapping levels of governance
builds essential adaptive capacity
in an organization. The second
transformative lens is foresight,
which is not the same as forecasting.
Systemic effects generally cannot
be extrapolated from past data, but
require different techniques to engage
with the uncertainty of multiple futures.
Shell’s scenario practice is an example
of a foresight system that has been
applied over the past 50 years for the
purpose of structuring conversations
about futures. The final lens is
experimentation and innovation.

This is obviously important for
coming up with new ideas, but the
purpose here is subtly different.
Building capacity for change in an
organization requires the capacity
to explore the edges of the system.
This implies having people with the
time and resources to go outside
the usual organizational boundaries,
into possibly uncomfortable territory.
Learning faster than competitors
confers long-term advantage—having
a purposeful system for such enquiry
builds resilience.
It is not the case that measures
to deal with systemic risk simply
add up to the sum of these nine
lenses. The interconnected nature
of the underlying system precludes
this. However, considering
these nine aspects will provide a
comprehensive—and, crucially, a
practical— method for mitigating
those risks. It is essential, however,
for this to be a separate and distinct
process from the standard processes
used for dealing with normalized risks.

Complexity, Resilience and Energy
Transition and a fellow at Oxford
University.

Cognitive bias and risk management

By Michele Wucker
Risk management starts with
identifying and estimating the
probability and impact of a given
threat. We can then decide whether
a risk falls within our tolerance limits
and how to react to reduce the risk
or at least our exposure to it. Time
and again, however, individuals and
organizations stumble during this
process—for example, failing to
respond to obvious but neglected
high-impact “grey rhino” risks while
scrambling to identify “black swan”
events that, by definition, are not
predictable.
New technologies and advances
in data science have improved our
ability to identify trends, assess risks
and generate early warnings. But if
business and policy decision-makers
are to take full advantage of these new
tools, we need a firmer handle on the
reasons why people are more likely to
react to some risks and ignore others.
This behavioural element is crucial to
managing risks effectively—to both
recognizing the risks that confront us
and then translating that knowledge
into effective action.

56

The Global Risks Report 2018

Adjusting for bias in our
risk assessments
Our brains play tricks that make some
risks appear to be more or less likely
than they are in reality. Being aware
of the blinders that make it harder to
recognize obvious risks allows leaders
to counteract them, helping to prevent
crises or at least mitigate the damage
caused.
In deliberative situations such as
a meeting of a corporate board or
a legislative body, anchoring and
confirmation biases can distort
perceptions by assigning more
weight to information and views
presented early on. Leaders can offset
these distortions by changing their
processes to ensure that there are
diverse voices around the table and
by encouraging structured debate and
constructive dissent. In other words,
they can make it easier to consider a
range of points of view that ultimately
strengthens the choices they make.
One of the most pervasive cognitive
blinders is the availability bias, which
leads decision-makers to rely on
examples and evidence that come
immediately to mind. This draws
people’s attention to emotionally
salient events ahead of objectively
more likely and impactful events.

Hyperbolic discounting leads some
decision-makers to prioritize shortterm goals that end up hurting longterm value. Examples include putting
off crucial investments or kicking
the can down the road on tough
but necessary budget decisions
in companies or governments.
Structures such as short-term
quarterly earnings cycles or relatively
short political terms create perverse
incentives that magnify the hyperbolic
discounting bias.
When members of a decision-making
group are too homogeneous it can
hamper their ability to recognize and
react appropriately to risk. Among
other things, too little diversity can
heighten confirmation bias and make
it more difficult for individuals to speak
out about risks for fear of disrupting
consensus. Cultural factors can also
play a role. One approach for any
organization that needs more robust
inputs is for leaders to solicit opinions
ahead of meetings, or to anonymize
key inputs required during meetings—
for example, by asking people to put
their ideas on slips of paper and then
considering them all in a group.

From box-ticking to
reflective action
Organizations often act decisively
to counter risk only once a major
breach, such as a safety catastrophe
or hacking event, forces them to. Part
of this is because humans discount
the likelihood of worst-case scenarios
happening, which can blind us to
obvious dangers.
Too often boards and C-suites
approach risk analysis as a standalone
activity to be ticked off a list, but then
fall short on mitigating the risks that
their analysis has identified. Think of
an employee derailing cybersecurity
plans by inadvertently clicking on a
phishing email because not enough
was done to spread risk awareness
from the C-suite to the wider
organization. To prevent this kind of
breach, risk management needs to
come out of its silo and become as
much an organic part of operations as
budgeting and project management.
Organizations must do better in
educating teams on risk awareness.
But they also need to make sure their
cultures encourage employees to feel
that they can speak out and be taken
seriously enough for problems to be
dealt with.

Global risks require action across
multiple organizations, which
means that often one of the riskmanagement challenges at this level
is the absence of the same kind of
levers and hierarchies that facilitate
decision-making and implementation
within single organizations. Steeper
obstacles to collective action
heighten the challenge of getting
varied stakeholders and networks to
coordinate in responding to global
risks.
There are encouraging developments
on this front. All kinds of actors are
already thinking in new ways about
who can do what to solve global
problems. After the US federal
government pulled out of the Paris
Agreement on climate change,
for example, more than 2,300
businesses, cities, states and other
non-federal actors pledged to honour
a commitment to cut emissions.
Organizations such as the World
Economic Forum bring together global
public- and private-sector actors to
share ideas and catalyse action. The
creation in some countries of new
types of corporations, which include
social and environmental impact
in their bottom-line calculations, is
re-shaping the role of businesses in
confronting global risks head-on.

From signals to action
Organizations across the private and
public sectors need to take a fresh
look at how and why individuals and
groups assess and act on risks in the
way they do. We cannot ignore the
cognitive and behavioural factors in
risk management if we are to avoid
both black swans and grey rhinos.
Individuals and organizations must
work to overcome biases, make better
decisions, create warning-signal
systems and act cohesively when red
flags are raised.
Increasingly rich data resources give
us better tools to anticipate problems
and to track our progress in dealing
with them. But decision-makers need
to work hard to help to ensure that all
of this information leads to effective
action. That means developing better
listening strategies, like those of CEOs
who actively canvass the views of
millennials as important intelligence
on market trends and the future policy
environment that businesses will face.
It also means developing ways of
encouraging and rewarding decisionmakers who take difficult, long-term
decisions. Finally, it means better
tracking of outcomes and metrics to
hold businesses and governments
accountable for their promises.

The Global Risks Report 2018

Appendix B: Global Risks Perception Survey and Methodology

The Global Risks Perception Survey
(GRPS), discussed in the chapter
“Fractures, Fears and Failures”, is the
World Economic Forum’s source of
original data harnessing the expertise
of the Forum’s extensive network of
business, government, civil society and
thought leaders. The survey was
conducted from 28 August to 1
November 2017 among the World
Economic Forum’s multistakeholder
communities, members of the Institute
of Risk Management and the
professional networks of our Advisory
Board Members. The results of the
GRPS are used to draw the Global
Risks Landscape, Interconnections
Map, and Trends Map presented, and
to provide additional evidence used in
the Global Risks Report.
Both the GRPS and the report adopt
the following definitions of global risk
and trend:
–– Global risk: A “global risk” is an
uncertain event or condition that, if
it occurs, can cause significant
negative impact for several
countries or industries within the
next 10 years.
–– Trend: A “trend” is defined as a
long-term pattern that is currently
evolving and that could contribute
to amplifying global risks and/or
altering the relationship between
them.

Changes from Previous
Editions
Building on the adjustments made to
the Global Risks Landscape for the
2017 edition of the report, this year we
also have adjusted the likelihood scale
to a 1–5 scale and used a more
meaningful scale to assess likelihood,
with a particular probability attached to
each:
–– Selecting “very unlikely” means
that you believe the event has a
probability of occurring within the
next 10 years of less than 20%.
–– Selecting “unlikely” means that you
believe the event has a probability
of occurring within the next 10
years of between 21% and 40%.
–– Selecting “somewhat likely” means
that you believe the event has a
probability of occurring within the
next 10 years of between 41% and
60%.
–– Selecting “likely” means that you
believe the event has a probability
of occurring within the next 10
years of between 61% and 80%.
–– Selecting “very likely” means that
you believe the event has a
probability of occurring within the
next 10 years of more than 81%.
In addition, the 2017–2018 edition of the
GRPS contained a new section about
the expected evolution in 2018 of
additional global risks that are more
specific and current than the broader
risks covered in the core module. The
survey asked the following: “Do you
think that in 2018 the risks presented by
the following issues will increase or
decrease compared to 2017?”

––
––
––
––
––
––

Political or economic
confrontations/frictions between
major powers
State-on-state military conflict or
incursion
Regional conflicts drawing in major
power(s)
Loss of confidence in collective
security alliances
Erosion of multilateral trading rules
and agreements
Erosion of global policy
coordination on climate change

Respondents could then choose
“significantly increase”, “somewhat
increase”, “no change”, “somewhat
decrease” or “significantly decrease”.

Methodology
Instead of applying an overall threshold
for the completion rate, we set specific
validity criteria for each question.
–– Section 1 “The World in 2018”:
Question 1.01: Only respondents
who assessed at least three of the
six risks listed in this question were
considered (999 respondents met
the criterion).
–– Section 2 “Assessment of Global
Risks”: The answers from the 871
respondents who assessed the
impact and likelihood of at least
one risk (the answer “no opinion” is
considered a valid answer) were
used to compute the results.
–– Section 3 “Global Risk
Interconnections”: The answers
from the 719 respondents who
selected at least one valid pair of
risks were used in the
computation.

Section 4 “Assessments of
Trends”: The answers from the 684
respondents who selected at least
one combination of an important
trend and at least one associated
risk were used in the computation.

Figure B1 presents some key
descriptive statistics and information
about the profiles of the respondents.

The World in 2018
For each considered risk, the share for
each answer (“significantly increase”,
“somewhat increase”, “no change”,
“somewhat decrease” or “significantly
decrease”) was obtained by dividing
the number of respondents having
selected that answer by the total
number of answers.

occurring globally within the next 10
years and about its negative impact for
several countries or industries within
the next 10 years. For the first question,
the possible answers ranged from
“very unlikely” to “very likely”. These five
choices were turned into a 1–5 scale (1
= very unlikely, 5 = very likely). For the
question on impact, respondents could
select one of five choices: “minimal”,
“minor”, “moderate”, “severe”, or
“catastrophic”. These five alternatives
were turned into a 1–5 scale (1 =
minimal, 5 = catastrophic).

The Global Risks
Landscape 2018 (Figure I)

Respondents could choose “no
opinion” if they felt unable to provide an
informed answer, and they could also
leave the question completely blank.
For each risk, partial responses—those
assessing only the likelihood of
occurrence or only its impact—were
dropped.1 A simple average for both
likelihood and impact for each of the 30
global risks was calculated on this
basis.

Respondents were asked to assess the
likelihood and global impact of each of
the 30 risks. For each risk, they were
asked about the likelihood of the risk

The Global Risks
Interconnections
Map 2018 (Figure III)
and the Risks-Trends
Interconnections Map
2018 (Figure II)
To draw the Global Risks
Interconnections Map 2018 (Figure III),
survey respondents were asked the
following question: “Global risks are not
isolated and it is important to assess
their interconnections. In your view,
which are the most strongly connected
global risks? Please select three to six
pairs of global risks.”
Similarly, for the Risks-Trends
Interconnections Map 2018 (Figure II),
respondents had to identify up to three
trends that they consider important in
shaping the global agenda in the next
10 years and the three risks that are
driven by each of those trends. The two
questions read: “Which are the three
most important trends that will shape
global development in the next 10
years?” and “For each of the three
trends identified in the previous
question, select up to three global risks
that are most strongly driven by these

trends.” The information thereby
obtained was used to construct the
Risks-Trend Interconnections Map
2018.
In both cases, a tally was made of the
number of times each pair was cited.
This value was then divided by the
count of the most frequently cited pair.
As a final step, the square root of this
N11i
ratio was taken to dampen

Variable pairij,n is 1 when respondent n
selected the pair of risks i and j as part
of his/her selection. Otherwise, it is 0.
The value of the interconnection
determines the thickness of each
connecting line in the graph, with the
most frequently cited pair having the
thickest line.
In the Global Risks Landscape and the
Risks-Trends Interconnections Map,
the size of each risk is scaled according
to the degree of weight of that node in
the system. Moreover, in the RisksTrends Interconnections Map, the size
of the trend represents the perception
of its importance in shaping global
development (answer to the first part of
the question on trend, as explained
above); the biggest trend is the one
considered to be the most important in
shaping global development.
The placement of the nodes in the
Risks-Trends Interconnections Map
was computed using ForceAtlas2, a
force-directed network layout algorithm
implemented in Gephi software, which
minimizes edge lengths and edge
crossings by running a physical particle
simulation.2
