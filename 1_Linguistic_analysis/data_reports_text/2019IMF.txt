ASSUMPTIONS AND CONVENTIONS
A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook (WEO).
It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during July 26 to
August 23, 2019, except for those for the currencies participating in the European exchange rate mechanism II
(ERM II), which are assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established
policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for
selected economies, see Box A1 in the Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $61.78 a barrel
in 2019 and $57.94 a barrel in 2020 and will remain unchanged in real terms over the medium term; that the
six-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on US dollar deposits will average 2.3 percent in 2019 and
2.0 percent in 2020; that the three-month euro deposit rate will average –0.4 percent in 2019 and –0.6 in 2020; and
that the six-month Japanese yen deposit rate will yield, on average, 0.0 percent in 2019 and –0.1 percent in 2020.
These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the
margin of error that would, in any event, be involved in the projections. The estimates and projections are based on
statistical information available through September 30, 2019.
The following conventions are used throughout the WEO:
. . . to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;
–
	between years or months (for example, 2018–19 or January–June) to indicate the years or months
covered, including the beginning and ending years or months; and
/
between years or months (for example, 2018/19) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.
“Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
“Basis points” refers to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of
1 percentage point).
Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F in
the Statistical Appendix, which lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and
government finance data for each country.
For some countries, the figures for 2018 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns. Please
refer to Table G in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the national
accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments indicators for each country.
What is new in this publication:
• Mauritania redenominated its currency in January 2018 by replacing 10 old Mauritanian ouguiya (MRO) with
1 new Mauritanian ouguiya (MRU). Local currency data for Mauritania are expressed in the new currency
beginning with the October 2019 WEO database.
• São Tomé and Príncipe redenominated its currency in January 2018 by replacing 1,000 old São Tomé and
Príncipe dobra (STD) with 1 new São Tomé and Príncipe dobra (STN). Local currency data for São Tomé and
Príncipe are expressed in the new currency beginning with the October 2019 WEO database.
• Beginning with the October 2019 WEO, the regional group Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is discontinued. Four of the CIS economies (Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine) are added to the regional group
Emerging and Developing Europe. The remaining eight economies—Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, which comprise the regional subgroup Caucasus and
Central Asia (CCA)—are combined with Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP)
to form the new regional group Middle East and Central Asia (MECA).
In the tables and figures, the following conventions apply:
• If no source is listed on tables and figures, data are drawn from the WEO database.
• When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size.
• Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding.

As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is
a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities
that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.
Composite data are provided for various groups of countries organized according to economic characteristics or

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TENSIONS FROM THE TWO-SPEED RECOVERY

DATA

This version of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) is available in full through the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.
imf.org) and the IMF website (www.imf.org). Accompanying the publication on the IMF website is a larger compilation of data from the WEO database than is included in the report itself, including files containing the series
most frequently requested by readers. These files may be downloaded for use in a variety of software packages.
The data appearing in the WEO are compiled by the IMF staff at the time of the WEO exercises. The historical data and projections are based on the information gathered by the IMF country desk officers in the context
of their missions to IMF member countries and through their ongoing analysis of the evolving situation in each
country. Historical data are updated on a continual basis as more information becomes available, and structural
breaks in data are often adjusted to produce smooth series with the use of splicing and other techniques. IMF
staff estimates continue to serve as proxies for historical series when complete information is unavailable. As a
result, WEO data can differ from those in other sources with official data, including the IMF’s International
Financial Statistics.
The WEO data and metadata provided are “as is” and “as available,” and every effort is made to ensure their
timeliness, accuracy, and completeness, but these cannot be guaranteed. When errors are discovered, there is a
concerted effort to correct them as appropriate and feasible. Corrections and revisions made after publication are
incorporated into the electronic editions available from the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.imf.org) and on the IMF
website (www.imf.org). All substantive changes are listed in detail in the online tables of contents.

PREFACE

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s
surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international
financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product of a
comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on information
the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are carried out in
particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific Department, European
Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere Department—together with the
Strategy, Policy, and Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets Department; and the Fiscal Affairs
Department.
The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of Gita
Gopinath, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti,
Deputy Director, Research Department, and Oya Celasun, Division Chief, Research Department.
The primary contributors to this report were John Bluedorn, Christian Bogmans, Gabriele Ciminelli,
Romain Duval, Davide Furceri, Guzman Gonzales-Torres Fernandez, Joao Jalles, Zsóka Kóczán, Toh Kuan,
Weicheng Lian, Akito Matsumoto, Giovanni Melina, Malhar Nabar, Natalija Novta, Andrea Pescatori, Cian Ruane,
and Yannick Timmer.

Joseph Procopio from the Communications Department led the editorial team for the report, with production
and editorial support from Christine Ebrahimzadeh, and editorial assistance from James Unwin, Lucy Scott Morales,
and Vector Talent Resources.
The analysis has benefited from comments and suggestions by staff members from other IMF departments, as well
as by Executive Directors following their discussion of the report on October 3, 2019. However, both projections
and policy considerations are those of the IMF staff and should not be attributed to Executive Directors or to their
national authorities.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TENSIONS FROM THE TWO-SPEED RECOVERY

FOREWORD

T

he global economy is in a synchronized
slowdown, with growth for 2019 downgraded again—to 3 percent—its slowest
pace since the global financial crisis. This
is a serious climbdown from 3.8 percent in 2017,
when the world was in a synchronized upswing. This
subdued growth is a consequence of rising trade
barriers; elevated uncertainty surrounding trade and
geopolitics; idiosyncratic factors causing macroeconomic strain in several emerging market economies;
and structural factors, such as low productivity growth
and aging demographics in advanced economies.
Global growth in 2020 is projected to improve
modestly to 3.4 percent, a downward revision of
0.2 percent from our April projections. However,
unlike the synchronized slowdown, this recovery
is not broad based and is precarious. Growth for
advanced economies is projected to slow to 1.7
percent in 2019 and 2020, while emerging market
and developing economies are projected to experience a growth pickup from 3.9 percent in 2019 to
4.6 percent in 2020. About half of this is driven by
recoveries or shallower recessions in stressed emerging
markets, such as Turkey, Argentina, and Iran, and the
rest by recoveries in countries where growth slowed
significantly in 2019 relative to 2018, such as Brazil,
Mexico, India, Russia, and Saudi Arabia.
A notable feature of the sluggish growth in 2019 is
the sharp and geographically broad-based slowdown
in manufacturing and global trade. A few factors are
driving this. Higher tariffs and prolonged uncertainty
surrounding trade policy have dented investment and
demand for capital goods, which are heavily traded.
The automobile industry is contracting owing also to
idiosyncratic shocks, such as disruptions from new
emission standards in the euro area and China that
have had durable effects. Consequently, trade volume
growth in the first half of 2019 is at 1 percent, the
weakest level since 2012.
In contrast to weak manufacturing and trade, the
services sector across much of the globe continues
to hold up; this has kept labor markets buoyant
and wage growth healthy in advanced economies.

xiv

The divergence between manufacturing and services
has persisted for an atypically long duration, which
raises concerns of whether and when weakness in
manufacturing may spill over into the services sector.
Some leading indicators, such as new services orders,
have softened in the United States, Germany, and
Japan, while remaining robust in China.
It is important to keep in mind that the subdued
world growth of 3 percent is occurring at a time when
monetary policy has significantly eased almost simultaneously across advanced and emerging markets. The
absence of inflationary pressures has led major central
banks to move preemptively to reduce downside risks
to growth and to prevent de-anchoring of inflation
expectations, in turn supporting buoyant financial
conditions. In our assessment, in the absence of such
monetary stimulus, global growth would be lower
by 0.5 percentage points in both 2019 and 2020.
This stimulus has therefore helped offset the negative
impact of US–China trade tensions, which is estimated to cumulatively reduce the level of global GDP
in 2020 by 0.8 percent. With central banks having to
spend limited ammunition to offset policy mistakes,
they may have little left when the economy is in a
tougher spot. Fiscal stimulus in China and the United
States have also helped counter the negative impact of
the tariffs.
Advanced economies continue to slow toward their
long-term potential. For the United States, traderelated uncertainty has had negative effects on investment, but employment and consumption continue
to be robust, buoyed also by policy stimulus. In the
euro area, growth has been downgraded due to weak
exports, while Brexit-related uncertainty continues
to weaken growth in the United Kingdom. Some of
the biggest downward revisions for growth are for
advanced economies in Asia, including Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, Korea, and Singapore,
a common factor being their exposure to slowing
growth in China and spillovers from US–China trade
tensions.
Growth in 2019 has been revised down across all
large emerging market and developing economies,

linked in part to trade and domestic policy uncertainties. In China, the growth downgrade reflects not only
escalating tariffs but also slowing domestic demand
following needed measures to rein in debt. In a few
major economies, including India, Brazil, Mexico,
Russia, and South Africa, growth in 2019 is sharply
lower than in 2018, also for idiosyncratic reasons, but
is expected to recover in 2020.
Growth in low-income developing countries
remains robust, though growth performance is more
heterogenous within this group. Robust growth
is expected for noncommodity exporters, such as
Vietnam and Bangladesh, while the performance of
commodity exporters, such as Nigeria, is projected to
remain lackluster.
Downside risks to the outlook are elevated. Trade
barriers and heightened geopolitical tensions, including Brexit-related risks, could further disrupt supply chains and hamper confidence, investment, and
growth. Such tensions, as well as other domestic
policy uncertainties, could negatively affect the projected growth pickup in emerging market economies
and the euro area. A realization of these risks could
lead to an abrupt shift in risk sentiment and expose
financial vulnerabilities built up over years of low
interest rates. Low inflation in advanced economies
could become entrenched and constrain monetary
policy space further into the future, limiting its effectiveness. The risks from climate change are playing out
now and will dramatically escalate in the future, if not
urgently addressed.
As policy priorities go, undoing the trade barriers
put in place with durable agreements and reining in
geopolitical tensions top the list. Such actions can
significantly boost confidence, rejuvenate investment,
halt the slide in trade and manufacturing, and raise
world growth. In its absence, and to fend off other
risks to growth and raise potential output, economic
activity should be supported in a more balanced
manner. Monetary policy cannot be the only game
in town and should be coupled with fiscal support
where fiscal space is available and where policy is not
already too expansionary. A country like Germany
should take advantage of negative borrowing rates
to invest in social and infrastructure capital, even
from a pure cost-benefit perspective. If growth were

to further deteriorate, an internationally coordinated
fiscal response, tailored to country circumstances, may
be required.
While monetary easing has supported growth, it is
important to ensure that financial risks do not build
up. As discussed in the October 2019 Global Financial
Stability Report, with interest rates expected to be “low
for long,” there is a significant risk of financial vulnerabilities growing, which makes effective macroprudential regulation imperative.
Countries should simultaneously undertake structural reforms to raise productivity, resilience, and
equity. As Chapter 2 of this World Economic Outlook
demonstrates, reforms that raise human capital and
improve labor and product market flexibility can
help reverse a trend of growing divergence across
regions within advanced economies that started in
the late 1980s. The evidence points to automation—
not trade shocks—as being behind the divergence
in labor market performance across regions for the
average advanced economy, which requires preparing the workforce for the future through appropriate
skills training.
Chapter 3 makes a strong case for a renewed structural reform push in emerging market and developing economies and low-income developing countries.
Structural reforms have slowed since the 2000s. The
chapter shows that the appropriate sequencing and
timing of reforms matters, as reforms deliver larger
results during good times and when good governance
is already in place.
With a synchronized slowdown and uncertain
recovery, the global outlook remains precarious. At 3
percent growth, there is no room for policy mistakes
and an urgent need for policymakers to cooperatively
deescalate trade and geopolitical tensions. Besides
supporting growth, such actions can also help catalyze
needed cooperative solutions to improve the global
trading system. Moreover, it is essential that countries
continue to work together to address major issues,
such as climate change (the October 2019 Fiscal
Monitor provides concrete solutions), international
taxation, corruption, and cybersecurity.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TENSIONS FROM THE TWO-SPEED RECOVERY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After slowing sharply in the last three quarters of
2018, the pace of global economic activity remains weak.
Momentum in manufacturing activity, in particular,
has weakened substantially, to levels not seen since the
global financial crisis. Rising trade and geopolitical tensions have increased uncertainty about the future of the
global trading system and international cooperation more
generally, taking a toll on business confidence, investment decisions, and global trade. A notable shift toward
increased monetary policy accommodation—through both
action and communication—has cushioned the impact of
these tensions on financial market sentiment and activity,
while a generally resilient service sector has supported
employment growth. That said, the outlook remains
precarious.
Global growth is forecast at 3.0 percent for 2019, its
lowest level since 2008–09 and a 0.3 percentage point
downgrade from the April 2019 World Economic
Outlook. Growth is projected to pick up to 3.4 percent
in 2020 (a 0.2 percentage point downward revision
compared with April), reflecting primarily a projected
improvement in economic performance in a number of
emerging markets in Latin America, the Middle East,
and emerging and developing Europe that are under
macroeconomic strain. Yet, with uncertainty about prospects for several of these countries, a projected slowdown
in China and the United States, and prominent downside risks, a much more subdued pace of global activity
could well materialize. To forestall such an outcome, policies should decisively aim at defusing trade tensions, reinvigorating multilateral cooperation, and providing timely
support to economic activity where needed. To strengthen
resilience, policymakers should address financial vulnerabilities that pose risks to growth in the medium term.
Making growth more inclusive, which is essential for
securing better economic prospects for all, should remain
an overarching goal.
After a sharp slowdown during the last three
quarters of 2018, global growth stabilized at a weak
pace in the first half of 2019. Trade tensions, which
had abated earlier in the year, have risen again
sharply, resulting in significant tariff increases between
the United States and China and hurting business

xvi

­sentiment and confidence globally. While financial
market sentiment has been undermined by these
developments, a shift toward increased monetary
policy accommodation in the United States and many
other advanced and emerging market economies has
been a counterbalancing force. As a result, financial
conditions remain generally accommodative and, in
the case of advanced economies, more so than in the
spring.
The world economy is projected to grow at
3.0 percent in 2019—a significant drop from
2017–18 for emerging market and developing economies as well as advanced economies—before recovering to 3.4 percent in 2020. A slightly higher growth
rate is projected for 2021–24. This global growth
pattern reflects a major downturn and projected
recovery in a group of emerging market economies.
By contrast, growth is expected to moderate into
2020 and beyond for a group of systemic economies
comprising the United States, euro area, China, and
Japan—which together account for close to half of
global GDP (Figure 1).
The groups of emerging market economies that
have driven part of the projected decline in growth
in 2019 and account for the bulk of the projected
recovery in 2020 include those that have either been
under severe strain or have underperformed relative to
past averages. In particular, Argentina, Iran, Turkey,
Venezuela, and smaller countries affected by conflict,
such as Libya and Yemen, have been or continue to
be experiencing very severe macroeconomic distress.
Other large emerging market economies—Brazil,
Mexico, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, among others—are
projected to grow in 2019 about 1 percent or less,
considerably below their historical averages. In India,
growth softened in 2019 as corporate and environmental regulatory uncertainty, together with concerns
about the health of the nonbank financial sector,
weighed on demand. The strengthening of growth
in 2020 and beyond in India as well as for these two
groups (which in some cases entails continued contraction, but at a less severe pace) is the driving factor
behind the forecast of an eventual global pickup.

Growth has also weakened in China, where the
regulatory efforts needed to rein in debt and the macroeconomic consequences of increased trade tensions
have taken a toll on aggregate demand. Growth is projected to continue to slow gradually in coming years,
reflecting a decline in the growth of the working-age
population and gradual convergence in per capita
incomes.
Among advanced economies, growth in 2019 is
forecast to be considerably weaker than in 2017–18 in
the euro area, North America, and smaller advanced
Asian economies. This lower growth reflects to an
important extent a broad-based slowdown in industrial
output resulting from weaker external demand (including from China); the widening global repercussions of
trade tensions and increased uncertainty on confidence
and investment; and a notable slowdown in global car
production, which has been particularly significant for
Germany. Growth is forecast to remain broadly stable
for the advanced economy group at 1¾ percent in
2020, with a modest pickup in the euro area offsetting
a gradual decline in US growth. Over the medium
term, growth in advanced economies is projected

to remain subdued, reflecting a moderate pace of
­productivity growth and slow labor force growth as
populations age.
The risks to this baseline outlook are significant. As
elaborated in the chapter, should stress fail to dissipate
in a few key emerging market and developing economies that are currently underperforming or experiencing severe strains, global growth in 2020 would
fall short of the baseline. Further escalation of trade
tensions and associated increases in policy uncertainty
could weaken growth relative to the baseline projection. Financial market sentiment could deteriorate,
giving rise to a generalized risk-off episode that would
imply tighter financial conditions, especially for vulnerable economies. Possible triggers for such an episode
include worsening trade and geopolitical tensions, a
no-deal Brexit withdrawal of the United Kingdom
from the European Union, and persistently weak
economic data pointing to a protracted slowdown in
global growth. Over the medium term, increased trade
barriers and higher trade and geopolitical tensions
could take a toll on productivity growth, including through the disruption of supply chains, and the
buildup in financial vulnerabilities could amplify the
next downturn. Finally, unmitigated climate change
could weaken prospects, especially in vulnerable
countries.
At the multilateral level, countries need to resolve
trade disagreements cooperatively and roll back the
recently imposed distortionary barriers. Curbing
greenhouse gas emissions and containing the associated consequences of rising global temperatures and
devastating climate events are urgent global imperatives. As Chapter 2 of the Fiscal Monitor argues,
higher carbon pricing should be the centerpiece of
that effort, complemented by efforts to foster the
supply of low-carbon energy and the development
and adoption of green technologies. At the national
level, macroeconomic policies should seek to stabilize
activity and strengthen the foundations for a recovery or continued growth. Accommodative monetary
policy remains appropriate to support demand and
employment and guard against a downshift in inflation expectations. As the resulting easier financial
conditions could also contribute to a further buildup
of financial vulnerabilities, stronger macroprudential
policies and a proactive supervisory approach will be
critical to secure the strength of balance sheets and
limit systemic risks.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: GLOBAL MANUFAC TURING DOWNTURN, RISING TR ADE BARRIERS

Considering the precarious outlook and large
downside risks, fiscal policy can play a more active role,
especially where the room to ease monetary policy is
limited. In countries where activity has weakened or
could decelerate sharply, fiscal stimulus can be provided
if fiscal space exists and fiscal policy is not already overly
expansionary. In countries where fiscal consolidation is
necessary, its pace could be adjusted if market conditions permit to avoid prolonged economic weakness
and disinflationary dynamics. Low policy rates in many
countries and the decline in long-term interest rates to
historically very low or negative levels reduce the cost of
debt service while these conditions persist. Where debt

xviii

sustainability is not a problem, the freed-up resources
could be used to support activity as needed and to adopt
measures to raise potential output, such as infrastructure
investment to address climate change.
Across all economies, the priority is to take actions
that boost potential output growth, improve inclusiveness, and strengthen resilience. As the analysis presented in Chapters 2 and 3 suggests, structural policies
for more open and flexible markets and improvements
in governance can ease adjustment to shocks and boost
output over the medium term, helping to narrow
within-country differences and encourage faster convergence across countries.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Subdued Momentum, Weak Trade and
Industrial Production
Over the past year, global growth has fallen sharply.
Among advanced economies, the weakening has been
broad based, affecting major economies (the United
States and especially the euro area) and smaller Asian
advanced economies. The slowdown in activity has
been even more pronounced across emerging market
and developing economies, including Brazil, China,
India, Mexico, and Russia, as well as a few economies
suffering macroeconomic and financial stress.
One common feature of the weakening in growth
momentum over the past 12 months has been a geographically broad-based, notable slowdown in industrial output driven by multiple and interrelated factors
(Figure 1.1, panel 1):
•• A sharp downturn in car production and sales, which
saw global vehicle purchases decline by 3 percent in
2018 (Box 1.1). The automobile industry slump
reflects both supply disruptions and demand
influences—a drop in demand after the expiration of
tax incentives in China; production lines adjusting to
comply with new emission standards in the euro area
(especially Germany) and China; and possible preference shifts as consumers adopt a wait-and-see attitude
with technology and emission standards changing
rapidly in many countries, as well as evolving car
transportation and sharing options.
•• Weak business confidence amid growing tensions between
the United States and China on trade and technology.
As the reach of US tariffs and retaliation by trading partners has steadily broadened since January
2018, the cost of some intermediate inputs has
risen, and uncertainty about future trade relationships has ratcheted up. Manufacturing firms have
become more cautious about long-range spending
and have held back on equipment and machinery
purchases. This trend is most evident in the tradeand global-value-chain-exposed economies of east
Asia. In Germany and Japan, industrial production
was recently lower than one year ago, while its
growth slowed considerably in China and the United
Kingdom and, to some extent, in the United States

(Figure 1.1, panel 2). The weakness appeared particularly pronounced in the production of capital goods.1
•• A slowdown in demand in China, driven by needed
regulatory efforts to rein in debt and exacerbated
by the macroeconomic consequences of increased
trade tensions.
With the slowdown in industrial production, trade
growth has come to a near standstill. In the first
half of 2019, the volume of global trade stood just
1 percent above its value one year ago—the slowest
pace of growth for any six-month period since 2012.
From a geographical standpoint, major contributors
to the weakening in global imports were China and
east Asia (both advanced and emerging) and emerging
market economies under stress (Figure 1.2). Downturns in global trade are related to reduced investment
spending—as was the case, for instance, in 2015–16.
Investment is intensive in intermediate and capital
goods that are heavily traded. Global investment did
indeed slow (Figure 1.3), in line with reduced import
growth, reflecting cyclical factors, the steep downturn
in investment in stressed economies, and the impact
of increased trade tensions on business sentiment in
the manufacturing sector. Another contributor to the
slowdown in global trade has been the downturn in car
production and sales, which is reflected in a slowdown
in purchases of consumer durables (Figure 1.4).
In China—the country with the highest investment
spending in the world—the slowdown in investment in 2019 has been much more limited than the
slowdown in imports, similar to what happened in
2015–16. Factors contributing to import weakness
(beyond domestic capital spending) include reduced
export growth, which is intensive in imports, and a
decline in demand for cars (Box 1.1) and technology
products, such as smartphones. The front-loading of
exports, before tariffs were imposed in late 2018, likely
also played a role by bringing forward demand for
import components.
1Global semiconductor sales declined in 2018, in part related to
seeming market saturation in smartphones and fewer launches of
new tech products more broadly (ECB 2019).

While manufacturing lost steam, services (a
larger share of the economy) broadly held firm
(Figure 1.5, panel 1). Resilient services activity has
meant steady aggregate employment creation, which
supported consumer confidence (Figure 1.5, panel
2) and, in turn, household spending on services.
This favorable feedback cycle between service
sector output, employment, and consumer confidence has supported domestic demand in several
advanced economies.

Weakening Growth

in the first half of 2019, after a sharp decline in the
second half of 2018. The US economy shifted to a

somewhat slower pace of expansion (about 2 percent on an annualized basis) in the past few quarters
as the boost from the tax cuts of early 2018 faded,
and the UK economy slowed, with investment held
back by Brexit-related uncertainty. The euro area
economy registered stronger growth in the first half
of this year than in the second half of 2018, but the
German economy contracted in the second quarter as industrial activity slumped. In general, weak
exports have been a drag on activity in the euro area
since early 2018, while domestic demand has, so far,
stayed firm. Japan posted strong growth in the first
half of this year, driven by robust private and public
consumption.
Preliminary data suggest a modest pickup in
growth in the first half of 2019 for the emerging
market and developing economy group, but well
below its pace in 2017 and early 2018. China’s

of the pace of financial regulatory strengthening
initiated in the second half of 2018. India’s economy decelerated further in the second quarter, held
back by sector-specific weaknesses in the automobile
sector and real estate as well as lingering uncertainty
about the health of nonbank financial companies.
In Mexico, growth slowed sharply during the first
half of the year owing to elevated policy uncertainty,

budget under-execution, and some transitory factors.
On the other hand, growth resumed in the second
quarter in Brazil after a first-quarter contraction
driven in part by a mining disaster. Likewise, growth
recovered modestly in the second quarter in South
Africa, helped by improved electricity supply. Growth
recovered in Turkey in the first half of the year
following a deep contraction in the second half of
2018, benefiting from more favorable global financial
conditions and fiscal and credit support. In contrast,
the contraction in Argentina continued through the
first half of the year, albeit at a slower pace, and risks
going forward are clearly to the downside due to the
sharp deterioration in market conditions.

generate sustained increases in core consumer price
inflation. Not surprisingly, as the global expansion
has weakened, core inflation has slid further below
target across advanced economies and below historical
averages in many emerging market and developing
economies (Figure 1.6). The few exceptions to this
broad pattern of softening are economies where large
currency depreciations have fed through to higher
domestic price pressure (such as in Argentina) or where
there are acute shortages of essential goods (Venezuela).
Despite higher import tariffs in some countries,
cost pressures have generally remained subdued. Wage
growth has inched up from modest levels as unemployment rates have dropped further (close to record
lows, for example, in the United States and the United
Kingdom) (Figure 1.7, panel 1). The labor share of

income has been on a gentle upward trend since
around 2014 in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the
United States, and has increased in the euro area since
early 2018 (Figure 1.7, panel 2). These developments
appear not to have passed through to core consumer
price inflation, suggesting some modest compression of
firms’ profit margins. In the emerging and developing
Europe region, labor shortages have contributed to
robust wage growth in many economies. Nonetheless,
as discussed in Chapter 2 of the Regional Economic
Outlook for Europe, wage growth has not transmitted
to rising final goods price inflation across the region
(Turkey’s relatively high inflation can be attributed to
other drivers, including past currency depreciation).
Energy prices declined by 13 percent between the
reference periods for the April 2019 and current World
Economic Outlook (WEO) as record-high US crude oil
production, together with soft demand, outweighed the
influence of supply shortfalls related to US sanctions on
Iran, producer cuts by the Organization for the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and strife in Venezuela and

Libya (Figure 1.8). The September 14 attack on key oil
refining facilities in Saudi Arabia threatened severe supply
disruptions, causing crude oil prices to spike by more
than 10 percent in the immediate aftermath. Prices subsequently retreated somewhat on reports of less damage
than initially feared. Coal and natural gas prices also
declined between the reference periods as a result of weak
demand prospects. Metal prices remained broadly flat,
with declines in copper and aluminum prices offsetting
increases in those for nickel and iron ore between the two
reference periods (see the Commodities Special Feature).
Overall, low core inflation readings and subdued impulses from commodity prices to headline
inflation have led to declines in market pricing of
expected inflation, especially in the United States and
the euro area.

Volatile Market Sentiment, Monetary
Policy Easing
Market sentiment has been volatile since April,
reflecting multiple influences that include additional
US tariffs on Chinese imports and retaliation by

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Global Manufacturing Downturn, Rising Tr ade Barriers

China, fears of disruptions to technology supply
chains, prolonged uncertainty on Brexit, geopolitical
strains, and policy rate cuts and dovish communication
by several central banks. The net effect of these forces
is that financial conditions across advanced economies are now generally easier than at the time of the
April 2019 WEO, but they are broadly unchanged
across most emerging market and developing economies (see the October 2019 Global Financial Stability
Report (GFSR)).
Among advanced economies, major central banks
have turned more accommodative, with a dovish
shift in communications earlier in the year followed
by easing actions during the summer. The US Federal Reserve cut the Federal Funds rate in July and
September and ended its balance sheet reduction. In
September, the European Central Bank reduced its
deposit rate and announced a resumption of quantitative easing. These policy shifts, together with
rising market concerns of slower growth momentum,
contributed to sizable declines in sovereign bond
yields—in some cases, deep into negative territory
(Figure 1.9). Yields on 10-year US Treasury notes,
UK gilts, German bunds, and French securities, for
example, dropped between 60 and 100 basis points
from March to late September, while yields on Italian
10-year bonds declined by 175 basis points on the
formation of a new government. Prices of riskier
securities have been volatile. Credit spreads on US and
euro area high-yield corporate securities have widened
marginally since April but remain below their levels
in late 2018. Equity markets in the United States
and Europe have lost some ground since April but
are still well above the lows during the sell-off at the
end of 2018.
Currency movements for advanced economies have
been notable in some cases. In real effective terms, the
yen appreciated by more than 5 percent and the Swiss
franc by 3 percent between March and late September as
market volatility spiked. In contrast, the British pound
has depreciated by 4 percent on increased concern about
a no-deal Brexit. The US dollar has strengthened by
about 2½ percent, whereas the euro has depreciated by
about 1½ percent. Financial flows to and from advanced
economies have remained generally subdued, especially
since early 2018. One factor explaining these developments is the notable decline in foreign direct investment
flows, which have been affected by financial operations
of multinational corporations following tax reform in
the United States (Box 1.2).

Global Growth Outlook: Modest Pickup amid
Difficult Headwinds
Projected growth for 2019, at 3.0 percent, is the
weakest since 2009. Except in sub-Saharan Africa,
more than half of countries are expected to register
per capita growth lower than their median rate during
the past 25 years. The marked deceleration reflects
carryover from broad-based weakness in the second
half of 2018, followed by a mild growth uptick in the
first half of 2019 and supported, in some cases, by
more accommodative policy stances (such as in China
and, to some extent, the United States). With growth
estimates for both the second half of 2018 and the

Change in EMBI spread
(basis points, Apr. 16, 2018–
Sep. 27, 2019)

Among emerging market and developing economies,
central banks in several countries (for example, Brazil,
Chile, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines,
Russia, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey) have cut
policy rates since April. Sovereign spreads have been
broadly stable over this period, with a few exceptions
(Figure 1.10). Spreads narrowed in Brazil on growing
optimism that the long-awaited pension reform would be
enacted. Mexico’s sovereign spreads widened temporarily
following a credit rating downgrade in June. Meanwhile,
in Argentina, the primary elections in August triggered a
sharp increase in government bond yields amid a wider
sell-off in Argentine assets. In Turkey, spreads decompressed significantly following municipal elections in
June and are still wider than in April. Emerging market
equity indices are broadly trading at April levels, which
reflects offsetting influences on earnings prospects from
increased domestic and external monetary policy support
and intensifying trade tensions (Figure 1.11).
Capital flows to emerging market economies
have reflected the broader shifts in risk sentiment
since April, with investors lowering their exposure
to equities and rotating toward hard currency bonds
(Figure 1.12). Portfolio flows into the emerging
market asset class remain stronger overall than during
the retrenchment of late 2018; investors continue to
differentiate across individual economies based on
economic and political fundamentals. Most currencies
appreciated between March and July, helped by the
US Federal Reserve’s dovish communications and move
toward a more accommodative stance. But several
currencies lost ground in August with the deterioration
in risk sentiment, particularly the Argentine peso. The
Chinese renminbi has depreciated by about 3½ percent
since March (Figure 1.13).

first half of this year marked down, the 2019 growth
projection is 0.3 percentage point weaker than in the
April 2019 WEO.
The forces behind the slowdown in global growth
during 2018–19—apart from the direct effect of very
weak growth or contractions in stressed economies—
include a return to a more normal pace of expansion in
the US economy; softer external demand and disruptions associated with the rollout of new car emission
standards in Europe, especially Germany; weaker macroeconomic conditions, largely because of idiosyncratic
factors, in a group of key emerging market economies
such as Brazil, Mexico, and Russia; a softening in

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

China’s growth because of necessary financial regulatory strengthening and drag from trade tensions with
the United States; slowing demand from China and
broader global trade policy uncertainty weighing on
east Asian economies; a slowdown in domestic demand
in India; and the shadow cast by the possibility of
a no-deal Brexit on the United Kingdom and the
European Union more broadly.
Continued macroeconomic policy support in major
economies and projected stabilization in some stressed
emerging market economies are expected to lift global
growth modestly over the remainder of 2019 and into
2020, bringing projected global growth to 3.4 percent
for 2020 (Table 1.1). The forecast markdown of
0.2 percentage point for 2020 relative to the April
2019 WEO largely reflects the fact that tariffs have
risen and are costing the global economy: following
tariff announcements in May and August 2019, the
average US tariff on imports from China will rise to
just over 24 percent by December 2019 (compared
with about 12¼ percent assumed in the April 2019
WEO), while the average China tariff on imports from
the United States will increase to about 26 percent
(compared with about 16½ percent assumed in the
April 2019 WEO). Scenario Box 1.2 provides simulations of the direct impact of the tariffs included in the
baseline on global economic activity as well as their
potential repercussions for financial market sentiment,
business confidence, and productivity. As Scenario
Box 1.2 illustrates, trade diversion spillovers for some
economies, while positive, are temporary and are
likely outweighed by business confidence and financial
market sentiment effects. Box 1.3 provides more details
on the key policy and commodity price assumptions
behind the global growth forecast.
Figure 1.14 illustrates the countries and regions
where growth fluctuations have affected changes in
world growth since its peak in 2017. The dramatic
worsening of macroeconomic conditions between 2017
and 2019 in a small number of economies under severe
distress (in particular Argentina, Iran, Turkey, and
Venezuela) accounts for about half of the decline in
world growth from 3.8 percent in 2017 to 3.0 percent
in 2019. These same economies—together with Brazil,
Mexico, and Russia, all three of which are expected
to grow by about 1 percent or less in 2019—account
for over 70 percent of the pickup in growth for 2020.
Argentina’s economy is projected to contract again in
2020, but by less than this year; and in Venezuela, the
multiyear collapse in output is projected to continue,

albeit at a less dramatic pace than in 2019. In Iran,
modest growth is expected to resume after recession.
Activity should pick up in Brazil, Mexico, Russia,
Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. The projected uptick in
global growth also relies importantly on financial market sentiment staying supportive and continued fading
of temporary drags, notably in the euro area, where
industrial output is expected to improve gradually after
protracted weakness. In turn, these factors rely on a
conducive global policy backdrop that ensures that the
dovish tilt of central banks and the buildup of policy
stimulus in China are not blunted by escalating trade
tensions or a disorderly Brexit.
The world economy faces difficult headwinds over
the forecast horizon. Despite the recent decline in
12

long-term interest rates creating more fiscal room, the
global environment is expected to be characterized
by relatively limited macroeconomic policy space to
combat downturns and weaker trade flows, in part
reflecting the increase in trade barriers and anticipated
protracted trade policy uncertainty (global export and
import volume projections have been cumulatively
marked down by about 3½ percent over the forecast
horizon relative to the April 2019 WEO). Weighed
down by aging populations and tepid productivity
growth, advanced economies are expected to return to
their modest potential rate of expansion. Moreover,
China is projected to slow gradually to a more sustainable rate of growth.
Against this backdrop, beyond 2020 global growth
is projected at about 3.6 percent. The forecast relies,
to a large extent, on durable normalization in emerging market and developing economies currently in
macroeconomic distress and on continued healthy
performance of relatively faster-growing emerging market and developing economies. The resultant shifting
weights in the global economy toward faster-growing
emerging market and developing economies help support the projected stable medium-term growth profile,
contributing ¼ percentage point to global growth
by the end of the forecast horizon, compared with a
global growth projection with country weights held
constant at their 2018 level.

Growth Forecast for Advanced Economies
For advanced economies, growth is projected to
soften to 1.7 percent in 2019 and 2020. The forecast is 0.1 percentage point lower for 2019 than in
the April 2019 WEO.
•• In the United States, the economy maintained
momentum in the first half of the year. Although
investment remained sluggish, employment and
consumption were buoyant. Growth in 2019 is
expected to be 2.4 percent, moderating to 2.1 percent in 2020. The projected moderation reflects an
assumed shift in the fiscal stance from expansionary
in 2019 to broadly neutral in 2020 as stimulus
from the recently adopted two-year budget deal
offsets the fading effects of the 2017 Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act. Overall, the growth forecast is revised up
from the April 2019 WEO (0.1 percentage point
higher for 2019 and 0.2 for 2020). Revisions to
past GDP data imply weaker carryover into 2019,
and trade-related policy uncertainty imparts further

CHAPTER 1

negative effects, but the two-year budget deal and
the Federal Reserve’s policy rate cuts yield net
upward revisions.
•• In the euro area, weaker growth in foreign demand
and a drawdown of inventories (reflecting weak
industrial production) have kept a lid on growth
since mid-2018. Activity is expected to pick up
only modestly over the remainder of this year,
and into 2020, as external demand is projected
to regain some momentum and temporary factors
(including new emission standards that hit German
car production) continue to fade. Growth is projected at 1.2 percent in 2019 (0.1 percentage point
lower than in April) and 1.4 percent in 2020.
The 2019 forecast is revised down slightly for
France and Germany (due to weaker-than-expected
external demand in the first half of the year). Both
the 2019 and 2020 forecasts were marked down
for Italy, owing to softening private consumption,
a smaller fiscal impulse, and a weaker external
environment. The outlook is also slightly weaker
for Spain, with growth projected to slow gradually
from 2.6 percent in 2018 to 2.2 percent in 2019
and 1.8 percent in 2020 (0.1 percentage point
lower than in April).
•• The United Kingdom is set to expand at 1.2 percent in 2019 and 1.4 percent in 2020. The
unchanged projection for both years (relative to
the April 2019 WEO) reflects the combination of
a negative impact from weaker global growth and
ongoing Brexit uncertainty and a positive impact
from higher public spending announced in the
recent Spending Review. The economy contracted
in the second quarter, and recent indicators point
to weak growth in the third quarter. The forecast
assumes an orderly exit from the European Union
followed by a gradual transition to the new regime.
However, as of early September, the ultimate form
of Brexit remains highly uncertain.
•• Japan’s economy is projected to grow by 0.9 percent in 2019 (0.1 percentage point lower than
anticipated in the April 2019 WEO). Strong private consumption and public spending in the first
half of 2019 outweighed continued weakness in the
external sector. Growth is projected at 0.5 percent
in 2020 (unchanged from the April 2019 WEO),
with temporary fiscal measures expected to cushion
part of the anticipated decline in private consumption following the October 2019 increase in the
consumption tax rate.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Beyond 2020, growth in the advanced economy
group is projected to stabilize at about 1.6 percent,
similar to the April 2019 WEO forecast. A modest
uptick expected in productivity is projected to counteract the drag on potential output growth from slower
labor force growth as populations continue to age.

Growth Forecast for Emerging Market and
Developing Economies
Growth in the emerging market and developing
economy group is expected to bottom out at 3.9 percent in 2019, rising to 4.6 percent in 2020. The forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are 0.5 percentage point and
0.2 percentage point lower, respectively, than in April,
reflecting downward revisions in all major regions
except emerging and developing Europe.2
•• Emerging and Developing Asia remains the main
engine of the world economy, but growth is softening
gradually with the structural slowdown in China.
Output in the region is expected to grow at 5.9 percent this year and at 6.0 percent in 2020 (0.4 and
0.3 percentage point lower, respectively, than in the
April 2019 WEO forecast). In China, the effects of
escalating tariffs and weakening external demand have
exacerbated the slowdown associated with needed
regulatory strengthening to rein in the accumulation
of debt. With policy stimulus expected to continue
supporting activity in the face of the adverse external shock, growth is forecast at 6.1 percent in 2019
and 5.8 percent in 2020—0.2 and 0.3 percentage
point lower than in the April 2019 WEO projection.
India’s economy is set to grow at 6.1 percent in 2019,
picking up to 7 percent in 2020. The downward
revision relative to the April 2019 WEO of 1.2 percentage points for 2019 and 0.5 percentage point
for 2020 reflects a weaker-than-expected outlook for
domestic demand. Growth will be supported by the
lagged effects of monetary policy easing, a reduction in corporate income tax rates, recent measures
to address corporate and environmental regulatory
2Beginning with the October 2019 WEO, the regional group
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is discontinued. Four
of the CIS economies (Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine) are
added to the regional group Emerging and Developing Europe.
The remaining eight economies—Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and
Uzbekistan, which comprise the regional subgroup Caucasus and
Central Asia (CCA)—are combined with Middle East, North Africa,
Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP) to form the new regional
group Middle East and Central Asia (MECA).

uncertainty, and government programs to support
rural consumption.
•• Subdued growth in emerging and developing Europe
in 2019 largely reflects a slowdown in Russia and flat
activity in Turkey. The region is expected to grow
at 1.8 percent in 2019 and 2.5 percent in 2020.
The upward revision to 2019 growth relative to the
April 2019 forecast reflects a shallower-than-expected
downturn in Turkey in the first half of the year as a
result of fiscal support. In Russia, by contrast, growth
has been weaker this year than forecast in April, but
is projected to recover next year, contributing to
the upward revision to projected 2020 growth for
the region. Several countries in central and eastern
Europe, including Hungary and Poland, are experiencing solid growth on the back of resilient domestic
demand and rising wages.
•• In Latin America, activity slowed notably at the
start of the year across the larger economies, mostly
reflecting idiosyncratic factors. Growth in the
region is now expected at 0.2 percent this year
(1.2 percentage point lower than in the April 2019
WEO). The sizable downward revision for 2019
reflects downgrades to Brazil (where mining supply
disruptions have hurt activity) and Mexico (where
investment remains weak and private consumption
has slowed, reflecting policy uncertainty, weakening
confidence, and higher borrowing costs). Argentina’s
economy is expected to contract further in 2019
on lower confidence and tighter external financing conditions. Chile’s growth projection is revised
down, following weaker-than-expected performance
at the start of the year. The deep humanitarian crisis
and economic implosion in Venezuela continue
to have a devastating impact, with the economy
expected to shrink by about one-third in 2019. For
the region as a whole, growth is expected to firm up
to 1.8 percent in 2020 (0.6 percentage point lower
than in the April forecast). The projected strengthening reflects expected recovery in Brazil (on the
back of accommodative monetary policy) and in
Mexico (as uncertainty gradually subsides), together
with less severe contractions for 2020 compared to
this year in Argentina and Venezuela.
•• Growth in the Middle East and Central Asia region
is expected to be 0.9 percent in 2019, rising to
2.9 percent in 2020. The forecast is 0.9 and 0.4 percentage point lower, respectively, than in the April
2019 WEO, largely due to the downward forecast

14

revision for Iran (owing to the effect of tighter US
sanctions) and Saudi Arabia. While non-oil growth is
expected to strengthen in 2019 on higher government
spending and confidence, oil GDP in Saudi Arabia
is projected to decline against the backdrop of the
extension of the OPEC+ agreement and a generally
weak global oil market. The impact on growth of the
recent attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities is difficult
to gauge at this stage but adds uncertainty to the
near-term outlook. Growth is projected to pick up
in 2020 as oil GDP stabilizes and solid momentum
in the non-oil sector continues. Civil strife in some
other economies, including Libya, Syria, and Yemen,
weigh on the region’s outlook.
•• In sub-Saharan Africa, growth is expected at 3.2 percent in 2019 and 3.6 percent in 2020, slightly
lower for both years than in the April 2019 WEO.
Higher, albeit volatile, oil prices earlier in the year
have supported the subdued outlook for Nigeria and
some other oil-exporting countries in the region,
but Angola’s economy—because of a decline in oil
production—is expected to contract this year and
recover only mildly next year. In South Africa, despite
a moderate rebound in the second quarter, growth is
expected to be weaker in 2019 than projected in the
April 2019 WEO following a very weak first quarter,
reflecting a larger-than-anticipated impact of labor
strikes and energy supply issues in mining, together
with weak agricultural production. While the three
largest economies of the region are projected to
continue their lackluster performance, many other
economies—typically more diversified ones—are
experiencing solid growth. About 20 economies in
the region, accounting for about 45 percent of the
sub-Saharan African population and 34 percent
of the region’s GDP (1 percent of global GDP),
are estimated to be growing faster than 5 percent
this year while growth in a somewhat larger set
of countries, in per capita terms, is faster than in
advanced economies.
Over the medium term, growth for the emerging
market and developing economies group is projected to stabilize at about 4.8 percent, but with
important differences across regions. In emerging
and developing Asia, it is expected to remain at
about 6 percent through the forecast horizon. This
smooth growth profile rests on a gradual slowdown
in China to 5.5 percent by 2024 and firming and

International Monetary Fund | October 2019

CHAPTER 1

stabilization of growth in India at about 7.3 percent
over the medium term, based on continued implementation of structural reforms. In Latin America,
growth is projected to increase from the 1.8 percent
projected for 2020, but remain below 3 percent over
the medium term as structural rigidities, subdued
terms of trade, and fiscal imbalances (particularly
for Brazil) weigh on the outlook. Activity in emerging and developing Europe is projected to pick up
from its current post-global-financial-crisis low,
with the region expected to grow at about 2½ percent over the medium term. Prospects vary across
sub-Saharan Africa, but growth for the region as a
whole is projected to increase from 3.6 percent in
2020 to 4.2 percent in 2024 (although for close to
two-fifths of economies, the average growth rate over
the medium term is projected to exceed 5 percent).
The medium-term outlook for the Middle East and
Central Asia region is largely shaped by the outlook

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

for fuel prices, needed adjustment to correct macroeconomic imbalances in certain economies, and geopolitical tensions.
Forty emerging market and developing economies
(about a quarter of the total) are projected to grow
in per capita terms above the 3.3 percent weighted
average of the group, which is more than 2 percentage points above the average for advanced economies
(Figure 1.15). For these economies—which include
China, India, and Indonesia—the challenge is to
ensure that these growth rates materialize and that
the benefits of growth are shared widely. Convergence
prospects are instead bleak for some emerging market and developing economies. Across sub-Saharan
Africa and in the Middle East and Central Asia region,
47 economies, accounting for about 10 percent of
global GDP in purchasing-power-parity terms and
close to 1 billion in population, are projected to grow
by less than advanced economies in per capita terms

further to 1.2 percent in the medium term. Headline
inflation is expected to rise gradually in the euro area,
from 1.2 percent in 2019 to 1.4 percent in 2020.
Inflation in emerging market and developing
economies excluding Venezuela is expected to inch

Argentina, where inflation has increased on the back of
the peso depreciation; Russia, where an increase in the
value-added tax rate early in the year boosted inflation;
and, to a lesser degree, China, in part due to rising pork
prices. As inflation expectations become better anchored
around targets in some economies and the pass-through
from previous depreciations wanes further, inflation in
the emerging market economy group is set to moderate
to about 4.4 percent over the medium term.

levels are set to fall further behind those economies.

capita growth rates in sub-Saharan Africa, where most
countries are projected to grow at rates well above the

Inflation Outlook
Consistent with the softening of energy prices and
the moderation in growth, consumer price inflation is
expected to average 1.5 percent this year in advanced
economies, down from 2.0 percent in 2018. With the US
economy operating above potential, core consumer price
inflation is projected at about 2.6 percent in 2020–21,
above its medium-term value of 2.2 percent (the level
consistent with the medium-term target of 2.0 percent
for personal consumption expenditure inflation). Japan’s
core inflation rate (excluding fresh food and energy) is
projected to rise to about 1 percent in 2019–20 due to
the October consumption tax rate increase, inching up
16

After peaking in 2017 global trade growth slowed
considerably in 2018 and the first half of 2019 and
is projected at 1¼ percent in 2019. The slowdown
reflects a confluence of factors, including a slowdown
in investment, the impact of increased trade tensions
on spending on capital goods (which are heavily
traded), a tech cycle, and a sizable decline in trade in
cars and car parts. Global trade growth is projected
to recover to 3.2 percent in 2020 and 3.75 percent in
subsequent years. The waning of some temporary factors, together with some recovery in global economic
activity in 2020, buttressed by a gradual pickup in
investment demand in emerging market and developing economies, should support the pickup in trade
growth, offsetting the slowdown in capital spending
in advanced economies that is projected for 2020 and
beyond. However, there is sizable uncertainty concerning the future structure of value chains and the
repercussions of tensions related to technology, and
these could weigh on trade growth.

Current Account Positions
After widening marginally in 2018, primarily
reflecting higher oil prices, global current account
deficits and surpluses are projected to gradually
narrow in 2019 and subsequent years (Figure 1.17).
Among surplus countries, current account balances
are projected to gradually decline in oil exporters,
advanced European creditors, and advanced Asian
economies in 2019 and into the medium term.

The modest widening of China’s current account
surplus in 2019 is projected to be reversed in subsequent years as the rebalancing process continues.
Current account deficits are projected to shrink in
central and eastern Europe in 2019, reflecting the
balancing of the current account in Turkey following
a sharp reduction in domestic demand. After widening in 2019–20, driven by expansionary fiscal policy
and a strengthening dollar, the US current account
deficit is projected to shrink over the medium term
as the growth rate of domestic demand declines.3
3Balance of payments data show a notable positive world current
account discrepancy in recent years. This discrepancy is assumed to
decline gradually during the forecast period, with projected global
current account surpluses compressing more than global current
account deficits.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

The recently imposed trade measures by the United
States and retaliatory actions by trading partners are
expected to have a limited impact on overall external imbalances (see the IMF’s 2018 External Sector
Report and Chapter 4 of the April 2019 WEO for a
discussion of the relationship between trade costs and
external imbalances).
As highlighted in the 2019 External Sector Report,
many countries’ current account imbalances in 2018
were too large in relation to country-specific norms
consistent with underlying fundamentals and desirable policies. As shown in panel 1 of Figure 1.18,
excess current account balances in 2019 are projected
to decline modestly, with medium-term projections
suggesting, on average, further movement in the same
direction (Figure 1.18, panel 2).4 At the same time,
given that changes in macroeconomic fundamentals relative to 2018 affect not only current account
balances but also their equilibrium values, the path of
future excess imbalances cannot be precisely inferred
from this exercise.5
International Investment Positions
Changes in international investment positions reflect
both net financial flows and valuation changes arising
from fluctuations in exchange rates and asset prices.
Given that WEO projections assume broadly stable
real effective exchange rates and limited variation
in asset prices, changes in international investment
positions are driven by projections for net external
borrowing and lending (in line with the current
account balance), with their ratios to domestic and
world GDP affected by projected growth rates for
individual countries and for the global economy as
a whole.6,7
4The change in the current account balance during 2019 is estimated to have offset, on average, about one-fifth of the 2018 current
account gap; the change between 2018 and 2024 would offset less
than half of the 2018 gap.
5For instance, an improvement in the terms of trade is typically
associated with a more appreciated equilibrium exchange rate.
6WEO forecasts include projections of 10-year government
bond yields, which would affect bond prices, but the impact of
those changes in bond prices on the valuation of external assets
and liabilities is typically not included in international investment
position forecasts.
7In addition to changes in exchange rates, the decline in global
equity prices in late 2018 (compared with levels at the end of 2017)
implies deterioration of international investment positions at the
end of 2018 in countries with significant net holdings of equity and
foreign direct investment abroad, and a corresponding improvement
in positions for countries with net equity liabilities.

As panel 1 of Figure 1.19 shows, creditor and debtor
positions as a share of world GDP are projected to
widen slightly this year, and then to stabilize as a
share of world GDP over the forecast horizon. On
the creditor side, the growing creditor positions of a
group of European advanced economies and—to a
lesser extent—of advanced economies in Asia is partly
offset by some reduction in the creditor position of
China and oil exporters. On the debtor side, the net
liability position of the United States increases initially
and then stabilizes with the forecast reduction in its
current account deficit as fiscal stimulus is withdrawn,
while the position of euro area debtor countries
improves further.

economies in Asia, while the net creditor position of
China would decline to about 12 percent. The debtor
position of the United States is projected to rise to
about 50 percent of GDP, some 5 percentage points
above the 2018 estimate, while the net international
investment position of a group of euro area debtor
countries, including Italy and Spain, is expected to
improve by more than 16 percentage points of their
collective GDP.
Implications of Imbalances
Sustained excess external imbalances in key economies and policy actions that threaten to widen such
imbalances pose risks to global stability. Expansionary fiscal policy in the United States is projected to
increase the current account deficit over 2019–20,
which could further aggravate trade tensions. Over
the medium term, widening debtor positions in
key economies could constrain global growth and
possibly result in sharp and disruptive currency and
asset price adjustments (see also the 2019 External
Sector Report).
As discussed in the “Policy Priorities” section,
the US economy—which is already operating
beyond full employment—should implement a
medium-term plan to reverse the rising ratio of
public debt, accompanied by fiscal measures to gradually boost domestic supply potential. This would
help ensure more sustainable growth dynamics and
contain external imbalances. Stronger reliance on
demand growth in some creditor countries, especially those such as Germany with the policy space
to support it and facing a weakening of demand,
would help facilitate domestic and global rebalancing while sustaining global growth over the
medium term.

Risks: Skewed to the Downside
Risks around the baseline forecasts remain skewed
to the downside. Though the recent easing of monetary policy in many countries could lift demand
more than projected, especially if trade tensions
between the United States and China ease and a
no-deal Brexit is averted, downside risks seem to
dominate the outlook. As discussed in the section
on the Global Growth Outlook, about 70 percent
of the projected 2020 pickup in global growth is
accounted for by a small group of emerging market and developing economies in severe distress or

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

currently underperforming relative to past averages.
Moreover, the global forecast is predicated on continued steady growth in a number of emerging market
economies that are expected to maintain relatively
healthy performance, even as growth is projected to
moderate in the United States and China. Global
growth will fall short of the projected baseline if
strains fail to dissipate in the stressed and underperforming economies, or if activity disappoints among
the group of economies expected to maintain healthy
rates of expansion.
Further disruptions to trade and supply chains:
Tensions in trade and technology linkages have continued to ratchet up in recent months. Since the spring,
financial markets have been buffeted by the broadening of US tariffs to all imports from China, restrictions placed by the United States on commerce with
Chinese technology companies, and a greater perceived
risk of a no-deal Brexit (see Scenario Box 1 of the April
2019 WEO for a discussion of the macroeconomic
implications of the United Kingdom withdrawing
from the European Union without a free trade deal).
These developments have followed a sequence of tariff
hikes and threats since early 2018 between the United
States and China that have contributed to the generalized retreat in business confidence and investment
and the marked slowdown in global trade, leading
fiscal and monetary policymakers, in some cases, to
deploy policy space to counter drags on confidence and
demand. If tensions in these areas were to intensify, the
harm to investment would deepen and could lead to
dislocation of global supply chains as well as reduced
technology spillovers, harming productivity and output
growth into the medium term (see Scenario Box 1.1
for an analysis of the impact of advanced economy
firms reshoring production in response to growing
uncertainty on trade policies). The latest data on
input-output linkages point to ever-more-interrelated
technology, including the US technology sector’s
increasing dependence on imports of value added
from Chinese producers (Figure 1.20). Trade policy
uncertainty and barriers have risen more broadly,
including with Japan and Korea imposing strengthened
procedures for exports to one another. While these
restrictions have had limited effects so far, an escalation
of tensions could affect both economies significantly,
with regional repercussions through technology sector
supply chains.
As discussed above, still-resilient service sector activity
is a relative bright spot in the global economy, particularly

among advanced economies. With protracted weakness
in global manufacturing, business-facing services, such as
logistics, finance, legal, and wholesale trading, are vulnerable to a softening in demand. Depending on the severity,
firms in these services categories could cut back on hiring
and weaken the feedback cycle between employment
growth, consumer confidence, and consumer spending.
Resultant lower demand for consumer-facing services,
such as retail and hospitality, would dampen business sentiment among these categories and amplify the feedback
to the labor market.
Abrupt declines in risk appetite: Amid easy monetary
policy and supportive financial conditions in many
economies, financial markets are susceptible to abrupt
drops in sentiment. In recent months, rising tensions
between the United States and China surrounding
20

trade and technology companies triggered rapid
declines in global risk appetite and flight to safe assets.
Scenario Box 1.2—which updates the scenarios first
presented in the October 2018 WEO to incorporate
recent tariff measures—highlights the large effects of
trade tensions on global growth via worsening financial market sentiment as well as productivity. Potential
triggers for risk-off episodes remain plentiful. These
include further increases in trade tensions; protracted
fiscal policy uncertainty and worsening debt dynamics in some high-debt countries; an intensification of
stress in large emerging markets currently undergoing difficult macroeconomic adjustment processes; a
no-deal Brexit; or a sharper-than-expected slowdown in
China, which is dealing with multiple drags on growth
from trade tensions and needed domestic regulatory
strengthening. An abrupt risk-off episode could expose
financial vulnerabilities accumulated during years of
low interest rates and depress global growth as highly
leveraged borrowers find it difficult to roll over debt
and as capital flows retrench from emerging market
and frontier economies (see the October 2019 GFSR
for further discussion on financial vulnerabilities).
Continued buildup of financial vulnerabilities: Muted
inflation pressures have allowed central banks to ease
policy in response to mounting downside risks to
growth. These actions, together with shifts in market
expectations regarding future policy moves, have helped
ease financial conditions (possibly more than warranted
by central bank communications, notably in the case
of the market-implied path of the federal funds rate,
which remains well below the Federal Open Market
Committee’s “dot plot” projection). While easier financial
conditions have supported demand and employment,
they could also lead to an underpricing of risk in some
financial market segments. Insufficient regulatory and
supervisory responses to risk underpricing in this context
could allow for a further buildup of financial vulnerabilities, potentially amplifying the next downturn.
Threat of cyberattacks: Cyberattacks on financial
infrastructure pose a threat to the outlook because they
can severely disrupt cross-border payment systems and
the flow of goods and services.
Disinflationary pressures: Concerns about disinflationary spirals eased during the cyclical upswing of
mid-2016 to mid-2018. Slower global growth and a
softening of core inflation across advanced and emerging
market economies have revived this risk. Lower inflation
and entrenched lower inflation expectations can increase
the real costs of debt service for borrowers and weigh

CHAPTER 1

on corporate investment spending. By keeping nominal
interest rates low, softer inflation would also constrain
the monetary policy space that central banks have to
counter downturns, meaning that growth could be
persistently lower for any given adverse shock.
Geopolitical tensions, domestic political uncertainty,
and conflict: Perceived changes in the direction of
policies in some countries and elevated uncertainty
regarding reforms have been weighing on investment
and growth. At the same time, some geopolitical risk
factors discussed in previous WEOs have become
more salient—notably rising tensions in the Persian
Gulf following attacks on major oil refining facilities in Saudi Arabia, which have added to broader
conflict in the Middle East—and tensions in east Asia
(Figures 1.21 and 1.22). These factors in isolation
may not have a strong impact on growth beyond
the countries directly affected, but an accumulation

of such events—combined with trade tensions and
tighter global financial conditions—could have outsized effects on sentiment that are felt on a broader
scale. At the same time, ongoing civil strife in many
countries raises the risks of horrific humanitarian
costs, migration strains in neighboring countries,
and—together with geopolitical tensions—higher
volatility in commodity markets.
Climate change: Mitigating the serious threats posed
by climate change to health and livelihoods in many
countries requires a rapid transition to a low-carbon
economy on an ambitious scale (Chapter 2 of the
Fiscal Monitor). However, domestic mitigation policy
strategies are failing to muster wide societal support
in some countries, while international cooperation is
diluted by large emitters declining to participate (see
Commodities Special Feature Box 1.SF.1 for more
discussion on emissions). The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change warned in October 2018 that,
at current rates of increase, global warming could
reach 1.5°C above preindustrial levels between 2030

and 2052, accompanied by extremes of temperature,
precipitation, and drought. Given the uncertainties,
the climate could warm faster, engendering more
catastrophic outcomes, which would have devastating humanitarian effects and inflict severe, persistent
output losses across many economies. Climate change
may also exacerbate inequality within countries, even
in advanced economies, which are expected to be more
adaptable (see Chapter 2, Box 2.2).
Globally consistent risk assessment of the WEO
forecast: Confidence bands for the WEO forecast are
obtained using the G20MOD module of the IMF’s
Flexible System of Global Models.8 The confidence
bands for the WEO forecast for most regions are
asymmetric, skewed toward lower growth than in the
baseline. This reflects both the preponderance of negative growth surprises in the past and limited monetary policy space available to offset negative growth
shocks as interest rates in most advanced economies
are at or close to their effective lower bounds.9 The
resulting risk assessment can also be used to calculate
the probability of a global economic downturn. The
estimated probability of one-year-ahead global growth
below 2.5 percent—the 10th percentile of global
growth outturns in the past 25 years—has increased
since the spring and now stands at close to 9 percent
(Figure 1.23).

Policy Priorities
The global economy remains at a delicate juncture.
Even if the threats discussed in the previous section are
thwarted, as assumed in the baseline, per capita growth
is projected to stay below past norms across most
groups, except in sub-Saharan Africa, over the medium
term. Moreover, conditions are very challenging for a
8G20MOD is a global, structural model of the world economy,
capturing international spillovers and key economic relationships
among the household, corporate, and government sectors, including
monetary policy.
9Using the model to provide a risk assessment of the forecast is
done in two steps. First, the model is used to solve for economic
shocks that drove the world economy in the past. Historically,
the key drivers of the cyclical dynamics of output, inflation,
and interest rates were domestic demand and oil price shocks.
Second, these estimated shocks are then used to generate a large
number of counter-factual scenarios for the world economy by
sampling five-year histories from their empirical joint distribution
function. The resulting joint predictive distribution for a rich
set of economic variables is internally and globally consistent
and is suitable for risk assessment both at the global and
individual-country level.

number of emerging market economies that need to
adjust their macroeconomic policies sharply.
As discussed in the section on the Global Growth
Outlook, the world economy is confronting a diverse
set of headwinds. These headwinds affect countries
differently, adding to idiosyncratic factors and varied
cyclical positions, meaning that policy objectives and
priorities vary widely across countries. A common
thread and the foremost priority, in many cases, is
to remove policy-induced uncertainty or threats to
growth. Policy missteps at this juncture, such as a
no-deal Brexit or a further deepening of trade disputes,
could severely undermine sentiment, growth, and
job creation and may exhaust policy space for avoidable reasons.

global growth. The most pressing needs for greater
cooperation are in the areas of trade and technology.
Likewise, closer multilateral cooperation on international taxation, global financial regulatory reform,
climate change, and corruption would help address
vulnerabilities and broaden the gains from economic
integration.
Trade and technology: Policymakers should work
together to reduce trade tensions, which have weakened global activity and hurt confidence. They should
also expeditiously resolve uncertainty around changes
to long-standing trade arrangements (including those
between the United Kingdom and the European
Union as well as between Canada, Mexico, and the
United States). Countries should not use tariffs to
target bilateral trade balances. More fundamentally,
trade conflicts signal deeper frustrations with gaps in
the rules-based multilateral trading system. Policymakers should cooperatively address the roots of dissatisfaction with the system and improve the governance
of trade. This requires resolving the deadlock over the
World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement system’s appellate body to ensure the continued
enforcement of existing WTO rules; modernizing
WTO rules to encompass areas such as e-commerce,
subsidies, and technology transfer; and advancing
negotiations in new areas, such as digital trade. The
idea that all countries need to participate in all negotiations could be reconsidered, potentially allowing
countries that wish to move further and faster to do so,
while keeping new agreements inside the WTO and
open to all its members. At the least, calling a truce on
further escalation of trade barriers would avoid injecting more destabilizing forces into a slowing global
economy. Policymakers should also cooperate more
closely to curb cross-border cyberattacks on national
security and commercial entities, as well as limit
distortionary practices, such as requiring companies
to hand over their intellectual property in return for
market access. Without definite progress in these areas,
technology tensions are likely to intensify, impeding
the free flow of ideas across countries and potentially
impairing long-term productivity growth.
International taxation: With the rise of multinational
enterprises, international tax competition has made
it increasingly difficult for governments to tackle tax
evasion and collect revenue needed to finance their
budgets. Efforts to minimize cross-border opportunities
for tax evasion and avoidance, such as the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development–G20

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative (see Box 1.3
of the April 2019 Fiscal Monitor), should be reinforced. As discussed in IMF (2019), this initiative
has made significant progress in international tax
cooperation, but vulnerabilities remain. Limitations of
the arm’s-length principle—under which transactions
between related parties are to be priced as if they were
between independent entities—and reliance on notions
of physical presence of the taxpayer to establish a legal
basis to impose income tax have allowed apparently
profitable firms to pay little tax. Some improvements
can be achieved unilaterally or regionally, but more
fundamental solutions require stronger institutions for
global cooperation.
Financial regulatory reforms and global financial safety
net: The reform agenda begun after the global financial
crisis is still unfinished. Some areas of progress—such
as greater supervisory intensity for globally important
financial institutions and more effective resolution
regimes—are under pressure or being reversed. Policymakers should ensure the reform agenda is completed,
including through enhanced international resolution
frameworks and further improvements to macroprudential policy frameworks (which may entail simplification of complex rules in some areas, as discussed
in Adrian and Obstfeld 2017). Emerging risks to
cybersecurity in the financial system, and combating
money laundering and the financing of terrorism, also
require coordinated and collective action. Complementing these moves, policymakers should ensure that
the global financial safety net is adequately resourced
to help counteract disruptive portfolio adjustments
in a world economy heavily laden with debt and
reduce the need for countries to self-insure against
external shocks.
Climate change and migration: Curbing greenhouse
gas emissions and containing the associated consequences of rising global temperatures and devastating
climate events are urgent global imperatives.10 In that
respect, the ongoing political polarization and discord
in many economies does not bode well for reaching
agreement on domestic and international strategies in
time to contain climate change to manageable levels.
A redoubling of efforts is urgently needed, which will
require a distribution of the costs and benefits in a

manner than can muster sufficient domestic and international political support. By adding to migrant flows,
climate-related events also compound an already-­
complex situation of refugee flight from conflict areas.
International migration will become increasingly
important, too, as many advanced economies confront issues related to aging populations. International cooperation would facilitate the integration of
migrants—and, so, help to maximize the labor supply
and productivity benefits they bring to destination
countries—and to support remittance flows that lessen
the burden on source countries.
Corruption and governance: A global effort is also
needed to curb corruption, which is undermining faith
in government and institutions in many countries
(see the April 2019 Fiscal Monitor). Left unchecked,
pervasive corruption can lead to distorted policies,
lower revenue, declining quality of public services, and
deteriorating infrastructure.

Country-Level Policies
In response to continued weakness and downside
risks, macroeconomic policies—particularly monetary
policy—have already turned more supportive in many
countries. Looking ahead, macroeconomic policies in
most economies should seek to stabilize activity and
strengthen the foundations for a recovery or continued
growth. Where fiscal space is available and growth
has decelerated sharply, more active fiscal policy
support—including through greater public investment
in workforce skills and infrastructure to raise growth
potential—may be warranted. Making growth more
inclusive and avoiding protracted downturns that
disproportionately affect the most vulnerable segments
of population are essential for securing better economic
prospects for all. Strengthening resilience to adverse
shifts in financial market sentiment and alleviating
structural constraints on potential output growth also
remain overarching needs.

Advanced Economies
For advanced economies, where growth in final
demand is generally subdued, inflation pressure is
muted, and market-pricing-implied measures of
inflation expectations have softened in recent months,
accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate
to guard against a further deceleration in activity and
a downshift in inflation expectations. This is especially
24

important in economies with inflation persistently
below target and output that already is, or may fall
below, potential. As discussed in Box 1.4, the sluggishness in inflation suggests that potential output could
be higher and output gaps could be more negative
than currently estimated. However, given that continued monetary accommodation can foster a buildup
of financial vulnerabilities, stronger macroprudential
policies and a proactive supervisory approach will
be critical. As discussed in the October 2019 GFSR,
financial sector policies should aim to secure the
strength of balance sheets and limit systemic risks by
deploying such tools as liquidity buffers, countercyclical capital buffers, or targeted sectoral capital buffers;
developing borrower-based tools to mitigate debt
vulnerabilities where needed; and enhancing macroprudential oversight of nonbank financial institutions. In
some countries, bank balance sheets need further repair
to mitigate the risk of sovereign-bank feedback loops.
Avoiding a rollback of postcrisis regulatory reforms is
of essence in the context of continued monetary policy
accommodation and high debt levels.
Considering the precarious outlook and large
downside risks, fiscal policy can play a more active
role, especially where room to ease monetary policy is
limited. The low level of policy rates in many countries and the decline in long-term interest rates to
historically very low or negative levels, while reducing
the likely impact of further monetary policy easing,
expands fiscal room as long as these conditions last. In
this context, in countries where activity has weakened or could decelerate sharply, fiscal stimulus can
be provided if fiscal space exists and fiscal policy is
not already overly expansionary. In countries where
demand is weak, yet fiscal consolidation is necessary, its pace could be slowed if market conditions
permit, to avoid prolonged economic weakness and
disinflationary dynamics. Policymakers would need
to prepare for a contingent fiscal policy response, in
advance, to be able to act quickly and plan ahead for
the appropriate composition of fiscal easing. Infrastructure spending or investment incentives (including for
clean energy sources) would be ideal as they would
boost output not only in the near term but also in the
medium term, helping to improve debt sustainability.
More generally, modest medium-term potential output
in most advanced economies calls for the composition
of fiscal spending and taxes to be calibrated carefully,
with a view to raising labor force participation rates
and productivity growth through public investment in

workforce skills, physical infrastructure, and research
and development.
National structural policies that encourage more
open and flexible markets in advanced economies
would not only boost economic resilience and potential output, but could also help reduce within-country
disparities in performance and improve the labor
market adjustment to shocks by lagging regions within
countries (see Chapter 2). There is also a pressing
need to reduce carbon emissions to avert the severe
economic and social risks associated with climate
change. Moving toward less-carbon-intensive production structures—including through carbon taxation,
boosting low-carbon infrastructure, and encouraging
innovation in green technologies (see Chapter 2 of the
October 2019 Fiscal Monitor)—are therefore necessary.
Beyond fiscal measures to boost potential output, protecting opportunities and dynamism—by ensuring that
competition policies facilitate new-firm entry and curb
incumbents’ abuse of market power—remains vital
when a minority of big firms are capturing increasingly
larger market shares in advanced economies (Chapter 2
of the April 2019 WEO).
In the United States, where the unemployment
rate is historically low and inflation is close to target, a combination of accommodative monetary
policy, vigilant financial regulation and supervision,
and a gradual fiscal consolidation path would help
maintain the expansion and limit downside risks.
The absence of strong wage and inflation pressures
(inflation has averaged just below target over the
past year, and expectations have recently softened)
has allowed the Federal Reserve to reduce the federal funds rate to guard against downside risks from
the global economy. The path of the policy interest
rate going forward should depend on the economic
outlook and risks, as informed by incoming data.
Supportive financial conditions require maintaining the current risk-based approach to regulation,
supervision, and resolution (and strengthening it in
the case of nonbank financial institutions) to limit
vulnerabilities from rising corporate leverage and
emerging cybersecurity threats. Public debt remains
on a clear upward trajectory, calling for consolidation.
There is a need to raise the revenue-to-GDP ratio by
putting in place a broad-based carbon tax, a federal
consumption tax, and a higher federal gas tax. Doing
so would create the fiscal space to provide support to
low- and middle-income families (including through
help with childcare expenses and smoothing out the

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

existing “cliffs” in social benefits) and to pursue policies
that raise potential growth—infrastructure investment
(including to facilitate the supply of green energy
alternatives), support for lifelong learning and workforce skills, and steps to raise labor force participation.
Counteracting the anticipated rise in aging-related
spending requires indexing social security benefits to
chained inflation and raising the retirement age.
In the United Kingdom, desired policy settings in
the near term will depend on the ultimate form of the
country’s departure from the European Union. The
extra public spending envisaged by the government
should mitigate the cost of Brexit for the economy, but
continued efforts to bring down the debt ratio remain
important to build buffers against future shocks. In
case of a disorderly Brexit accompanied by a sharp
rise in barriers to goods and services trade with the
European Union, the policy response will need to take
into account the extent of the adverse financial market
reaction and its likely impact on macroeconomic
stability. Structural reforms should focus on improving
infrastructure quality and boosting labor skills as well
as ensuring smooth reallocation of workers to expanding sectors from those adversely affected by Brexit.
In the euro area, monetary policy has become appropriately more accommodative in response to stubbornly
weak core inflation and a significant loss of momentum
since mid-2018. The fiscal stance, though ideally more
supportive than envisaged before the slowdown, needs
to vary across countries depending on the extent of
fiscal space. In Germany, where there is room to ease
fiscal policy and growth has been weak, raising public
investment in physical and human capital or reducing
the labor tax wedge would boost demand, help reduce
the excess current account surplus, and strengthen
potential output. In countries with high debt, including France, Italy, and Spain, fiscal buffers should be
rebuilt gradually while protecting investment. Credibly
committing to a downward-sloping debt path over the
medium term is particularly critical in Italy, where debt
and gross financing needs are large. If growth were to
weaken significantly, countries with fiscal space would
need to use it more actively to complement monetary
easing to guard against disinflationary dynamics and
a prolonged period of weak growth. In parallel, the
path of fiscal consolidation could be adjusted temporarily in countries where fiscal space is at risk, provided
their financing conditions remain amenable and debt
sustainability is not jeopardized. A synchronized fiscal response, albeit differentiated appropriately across

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Global Manufacturing Downturn, Rising Tr ade Barriers

member countries, can amplify the area-wide impact.
Completing the banking union and continuing the
cleanup of bank balance sheets remain vital for raising
resilience and strengthening credit intermediation in
some economies. Amid prolonged monetary accommodation and disparate cyclical positions, regulators need
to calibrate macroprudential instruments to address
any emergent financial stability risks. Reforms are
urgently needed in many economies to lift productivity and competitiveness. Further deepening the single
market for services would boost efficiency across the
European Union. EU-level instruments can be used to
foster reform efforts at the national level. Raising labor
market flexibility, removing barriers to entry in product
markets, upgrading the functioning of corporate insolvency regimes, and cutting administrative burdens are
cross-cutting needs.
In Japan, demand is expected to slow from its recent
strong pace following the October consumption tax
rate increase, while government mitigating measures
will moderate the decline. Inflation remains well
below the central bank’s target. Sustained monetary
accommodation will be necessary over a long period to
durably lift inflation expectations. Fiscal policy should
be geared toward long-term fiscal sustainability amid a
rapidly aging and shrinking population while protecting demand and the reflation effort. Averting fiscal
risks over the long term requires additional increases in
the consumption tax rate and reforms to curb pension,
health, and long-term-care spending. Some progress
has been made on structural reforms with the adoption of the Work Style Reform that aims at improving
working conditions, a new residency status for foreign
workers with professional and technical skills, and
further trade integration with the European Union
and the economies comprising the Comprehensive
and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. More effort is needed on labor market reform—
including to improve workers’ skills and career
opportunities for nonregular workers, reduce duality,
and raise mobility—and in product market and corporate reforms to lift productivity and investment.

Emerging Market and Developing Economies
The circumstances of emerging market and
developing economies are diverse. Some economies
are experiencing extremely challenging conditions
because of political discord or cross-border conflict;
others are experiencing tight external financing
26

conditions, given their macroeconomic imbalances
and needed policy adjustments. Among countries
facing more stable conditions, the recent softening of
inflation has given central banks the option of easing
monetary policy to support activity. Against a volatile
external backdrop and possible adverse turns in market sentiment, ensuring financial resilience is a key
objective for many emerging market and developing
economies. Regulation and supervision should ensure
adequate capital and liquidity buffers to guard against
disruptive shifts in global portfolios and a possible
deterioration in growth and credit quality. Efforts to
monitor and minimize currency and maturity mismatches on balance sheets are also vital to preserve
financial stability and will help exchange rates to
cushion against shocks. In the many economies with
high public debt, fiscal policy should generally aim
for consolidation to contain borrowing costs and
create space to counter future downturns as well as to
address development needs, while adjusting its pace
and timing to avoid prolonged weakness. Improving
the targeting of subsidies, rationalizing recurrent
expenditure, and broadening the revenue base can
help preserve investments needed to boost potential
growth and social spending—on education, health
care, and safety net policies. Revenue mobilization
is particularly important in low-income developing
countries that need to advance toward the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
Beyond getting the mix of macroeconomic and
financial policies right, many emerging market and
developing economies can strengthen their institutions, governance, and policy frameworks through
structural reforms to bolster their growth prospects
and resilience. Indeed, the key findings of Chapter 3
make a strong case for a renewed structural reform
push in emerging market and developing economies.
The chapter documents that much scope remains
for further reforms in domestic and external finance,
trade, labor and product market regulations, and governance in these countries, especially in low-income
developing countries. The chapter finds that, for a
typical economy, major simultaneous reforms across
these areas could add 1 percentage point to growth
over 5–10 years, roughly doubling the speed of
convergence.
In China, the overarching policy objective is to
raise the sustainability and quality of growth while
navigating headwinds from trade tensions and weaker
global demand. Meeting this goal calls for short-term

CHAPTER 1

action to support the economy while making progress
with shifting the underlying sources of growth from
credit-fueled investment toward private consumption,
and improving the allocation of resources and efficiency in the economy. In addition to some monetary
easing, fiscal support (financed mainly on-budget) has
prevented trade tensions from exerting a sharp drag on
confidence and activity. Any further stimulus should
emphasize targeted transfers to low-income households,
rather than large-scale infrastructure spending. In support of the transition to sustainable growth, regulatory
efforts to restrain shadow banking have helped lessen
reliance on debt, but corporate leverage remains high
and household debt is growing rapidly. Further progress with reining in debt requires continued scaling
back of widespread implicit guarantees and enhancing
the macroprudential toolkit. Meanwhile, continuing
with reducing the role of state-owned enterprises and
lowering barriers to entry in such sectors as telecommunications and banking would help raise productivity
while improving labor mobility. Moving toward a more
progressive tax code and higher spending on health
care, education, and social transfers would help lower
precautionary saving and support consumption.
In India, monetary policy and broad-based structural reforms should be used to address cyclical
weakness and strengthen confidence. A credible fiscal
consolidation path is needed to bring down India’s
elevated public debt over the medium term. This
should be supported by subsidy-spending rationalization and tax-base enhancing measures. Governance of
public sector banks and the efficiency of their credit
allocation needs strengthening, and the public sector’s role in the financial system needs to be reduced.
Reforms to hiring and dismissal regulations would
help incentivize job creation and absorb the country’s
large demographic dividend. Land reforms should also
be enhanced to encourage and expedite infrastructure
development.
In Brazil, pension reform is an essential step toward
ensuring the viability of the social security system
and the sustainability of public debt. Further gradual
fiscal consolidation will be needed to comply with the
constitutional expenditure ceiling over the next few
years. Monetary policy should remain accommodative
to support economic growth, provided that inflation
expectations remain anchored. To lift potential growth,
the government will need to pursue an ambitious
reform agenda, including tax reforms, trade openness,
and infrastructure investment.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

In Mexico, adherence to the government’s medium-­
term fiscal consolidation plan is essential to preserve
market confidence and stabilize public debt. More
ambitious medium-term fiscal targets would create
larger buffers to respond to negative shocks and better
deal with long-term spending pressure from demographic trends. If inflation remains on a downward
path toward the target and inflation expectations
are anchored, monetary policy could become more
accommodative in the coming months. The exchange
rate should remain flexible, with foreign-exchange
intervention being used only if market conditions are
disorderly.
In Russia, the authorities should move toward a
more growth-friendly composition of taxes and public
spending while refraining from using the National
Welfare Fund for quasi-fiscal activities. Monetary policy can be eased toward a neutral stance if inflationary
pressures continue to abate. To enhance the efficiency
of credit intermediation, the authorities should continue to consolidate the banking sector while reducing
the state’s footprint. Further structural reforms are
needed to boost potential growth, including measures
to enhance competition, improve public procurement,
and reform the labor market.
In Turkey, a comprehensive and clearly communicated policy plan is needed to repair private balance
sheets; increase public balance sheet transparency; and
ultimately restore the credibility, independence, and
rules-based functioning of economic institutions. To
achieve these goals, the policy agenda should include
(1) keeping monetary policy rates on hold until there
is a durable downturn in inflation and inflation expectations, which would also help underpin the lira and
rebuild reserves; (2) steps to bolster medium-term fiscal
strength; (3) restoring confidence in banks through
thorough assessment (third-party asset quality reviews,
rigorous stress tests), credible bank recapitalization
plans, and reining in state bank credit; (4) further
improving the insolvency regime and the out-of-court
restructuring framework to promote meaningful
restructuring solutions and free up lending capacity
to healthy and productive firms; and (5) focusing
structural reforms to support more sustainable,
total-factor-productivity-led growth.
In South Africa, gradual but meaningful and
growth-friendly fiscal consolidation is needed to stabilize
public debt. Measures should include reducing the
public wage bill, downsizing and eliminating wasteful
spending by public entities, expanding the tax base,

27

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Global Manufacturing Downturn, Rising Tr ade Barriers

and strengthening tax administration. Monetary policy
should continue to be data-dependent and carefully
monitor inflation risks. Structural reforms are needed to
regain investors’ trust, lift growth potential, and foster
job creation. Priorities include revamping the business
models of state-owned enterprises, improving competition in the product market by reducing entry barriers
and streamlining regulations, and increasing labor
market flexibility.
Low-income countries share many of the policy priorities of the emerging market economy group, especially
in enhancing resilience to volatile external conditions.
Several “frontier” low-income countries have seen external financing conditions fluctuate sharply in the past
year. Strengthening monetary and macroprudential policy frameworks while preserving exchange rate flexibility
will help them withstand this environment. During the
recent period of low interest rates, public debt stocks
in this group have increased rapidly. When financial
conditions turn less accommodative, rollover risks may
rise, and wider sovereign spreads may lead to higher
borrowing costs for firms and households. Fiscal policy
should be geared toward ensuring debt sustainability
while protecting measures that help the vulnerable and
support progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This requires broadening the

28

revenue base; improving tax administration; eliminating
wasteful subsidies; and prioritizing spending on infrastructure, health care, education, and poverty reduction.
Low-income countries also bear the brunt of natural
disasters and increasing climate change. Lowering the
fallout from these events will require adaptation strategies that invest in disaster readiness and climate-smart
infrastructure, incorporate appropriate technologies and
zoning regulations, and deploy well-targeted social safety
nets to help reduce vulnerability and improve countries’
ability to respond.
Commodity-exporting developing economies have
similar policy priorities, but face additional pressure
on their public finances from the subdued outlook
for commodity prices. Beyond placing public finances
on a sustainable footing, economies in this group also
need to diversify away from dependence on resource
extraction and refining. Although country circumstances
differ, policies to help achieve this broad goal include
sound macroeconomic management; lifting of education
quality and worker skills to encourage more broad-based
labor force participation; investment to reduce infrastructure shortfalls; boosting of financial development
and inclusion; strengthening of property rights, contract
enforcement; and reduction of trade barriers to incentivize the entry of firms and private investment.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Scenario Box 1.1. Implications of Advanced Economies Reshoring Some Production
Activity would suffer in advanced and emerging market economies if production were reshored
to advanced economies that could not match the
efficiency and lower labor costs of the abandoned
foreign value chains. If multinational firms absorb
some of the implications by allowing margins to be
squeezed, it could soften the implications. However,
a possibly more likely outcome is that a less open
global economy could constrain technology diffusion,
causing activity to fall further.
The IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal
Model is used here to examine the implications of
multinational firms reshoring production to advanced
economies. This reshoring could be motivated by a
desire to keep some production closer to final consumers to avoid potential supply chain disruptions
from developments in distant countries or by policy
actions closer to home. A very stylized experiment is
considered, designed to illustrate the implications and
highlight the possible channels through which they
could play out.
The assumption is that, over a three-year horizon,
multinational firms in the United States, the euro
area, and Japan reshore enough production that their
nominal imports decline by 10 percent (blue line in
Scenario Figure 1.1.1). Given the relative costs of
production, reshoring leads to higher-priced consumption and investment goods in advanced economies.
Domestic demand declines, as does output, despite the
decline in imports.1 In emerging market economies,
lower production and exports reduce incomes, households and firms cut expenditure, and output declines
more modestly than in advanced economies. However,
households in both advanced and emerging market
economies suffer equally, owing to the deterioration in
emerging market economies’ terms of trade. Advanced
economy exchange rates appreciate, raising the real
cost of emerging market economies’ imports. More
emerging market production must be exported to
pay for their import bundle, leaving less for domestic
consumption.
1It is worth noting that, in sectors where domestic production
expands, employment could increase; here, however, the aggregate net impact is shown, which is negative.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Global Manufacturing Downturn, Rising Tr ade Barriers

Scenario Box 1.1 (continued)
One possible response of multinational firms might be
to not pass on the higher production costs fully and, so,
allow their profit margins to be squeezed (yellow line).
Moderating the resulting price increase helps maintain
household consumption and supports investment as firms
need more capital to produce the additional goods. The
extent to which firms would compress margins is highly
uncertain, and the modest reduction considered here
is for illustrative purposes only. The more margins are
squeezed, the less harmful is the impact of reshoring on
advanced economies. However, lower margins do little to
ameliorate the impact on emerging markets.
Although reductions in profit margins could
offset some of the negative implications of
reshoring, a less favorable implication of a more
closed global economy could be less technological diffusion. Empirical evidence points to trade
openness as a key driver of technological diffusion.2
2See “Is Productivity Growth Shared in a Globalized Economy?” in Chapter 4 of the April 2018 World Economic Outlook.

If multinational firms shorten supply chains by
producing more goods closer to final consumers
in advanced economies, emerging markets could
have much less access to the latest technological
developments. This box considers modest temporary reductions in productivity growth in tradable
goods sectors (red line) that are a function of a
country’s or region’s distance from the productivity
frontier and relative openness (0.1 percentage point
for advanced economies, 0.25 percentage point for
emerging markets).3 Weaker technological diffusion
would notably amplify the negative implications
for emerging markets and modestly exacerbate the
impact on advanced economies.

3A temporary decline in productivity growth is assumed.
However, it is possible that a more closed global economy could
lead to some lasting damage to productivity growth. If that were
the case, the longer-term implications would be much worse
than those estimated here.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Scenario Box 1.2. Trade Tensions: Updated Scenario
Updates of the estimated impact of ongoing
global trade tensions on economies are generated
here using the IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary
and Fiscal Model (GIMF). Inputs to the model’s
simulations include explicit tariff measures and
off-model analysis of the possible impact of confidence effects on investment, financial conditions
for firms, and productivity developments that result
when resources are reallocated across economies.
Given that all of the tariff measures considered in
these simulations are incorporated in the baseline
projections of this World Economic Outlook (WEO),
their impact on global GDP should be interpreted
as relative to a no-tariff baseline (such as the one in
the October 2017 WEO).1
The first three layers (out of six) of the analysis
estimate the direct trade impacts of tariff measures,
both implemented and announced. All of the measures are assumed to be permanent. The first layer
contains the impact of implemented tariff measures
included in the April 2019 WEO baseline. Among
them are tariffs that the United States imposed
on aluminum and steel, 25 percentage points in
tariffs on $50 billion in imports from China, and
10 percentage points in tariffs on an additional
$200 billion in imports from China. All retaliatory
measures by US trading partners are included in this
layer. The second layer adds the impact of the May
2019 US tariff increase of $200 billion on Chinese
imports and China’s retaliation. The third layer adds
the US imposition of 15 percentage points in tariffs
on all goods from China (roughly $300 billion) that
had not yet incurred tariffs, starting in September
2019, and a 5 percentage-point increase on the
already-tariffed $250 billion in imports from China.
China’s retaliation is included in this layer.
The remaining three layers are based on off-model
analysis. The fourth layer adds the potential impact
on investment of declining confidence. This is the
same temporary effect that is included in the October
2018 WEO analysis of the impact of trade tensions
on investment via confidence effects.2 However, the
1The analysis in the October 2018 WEO also includes a layer
of US-imposed tariffs on all imported cars and car parts. This
layer is not included in this analysis.
2The magnitude of this effect was calibrated based on
the Baker, Bloom, and Davis (BBD) overall “economic
policy uncertainty” measure and its estimated impact on
investment in the United States. (For details on the BBD

timing has been altered to more closely match changes
in timing of implementation of tariff measures from
that assumed in 2018. The peak impact on activity is
delayed, given that the tariff measures were imposed
later than had been assumed. The fifth layer adds the
impact on corporate spreads of the potential market
reaction to the trade tensions. The size of the impact is
identical to that used in the October 2018 WEO, but
the timing is adjusted to match the delayed implementation of the tariff measures. The peak in the increase
in corporate bond spreads now occurs in 2020,
one year later than assumed in the October 2018
WEO analysis.3 The final layer adds the potential
impact on productivity resulting from the reallocation
of resources across sectors within economies. This
layer is new and is not included in the analysis in the
October 2018 WEO. The impact of tariff measures in
GIMF captures the macroeconomic distortions that
tariffs induce in the utilization of productive factors,
capital, and labor, as well as income effects. However, tariffs also lead to sectoral distortions from the
reallocation of factors across sectors within economies, which highly aggregated models, such as GIMF,
cannot capture. Computable general equilibrium
(CGE) trade models, in contrast, capture the impact
on output of the shift of resources across sectors,
Uncertainty Index, see http://​www​.policyuncertainty​.com.)
A one-standard-deviation increase in the BBD uncertainty
measure (which is roughly one-sixth of the change during the
global financial crisis) leads to an estimated 1 percent drop in
investment in the United States in one year. Here, this 1 percent decline in investment is spread over three years, with the
peak effect in 2020. The impact of the decline in investment
in other countries is then scaled by their trade openness
relative to the United States—countries more dependent on
trade than the United States experience greater declines in
investment than does the United States. Note that, since fall
2018, some of this impact would already be factored into
WEO forecasts, given that the tariff measures were imposed.
3The magnitude of this tightening is based on several
financial market participants’ estimates of the impact on US
corporate earnings of a worst-case United States–China trade
war. (In the worst-case scenario, the United States imposes
tariffs of 25 percent on all Chinese imports and China does the
same in response.) Based on historical relationships, this estimated 15 percent decline in earnings is then mapped into an
increase in US corporate bond spreads. The rise in US spreads
is then mapped into corporate bond spreads in other countries
based on their credit rating relative to US corporate debt. This
increase in spreads is assumed to start in 2019 and peak in
2020, with half of the peak increase remaining in corporate
spreads in 2021.

Scenario Box 1.2 (continued)
under the assumption that total utilization of resources
remains unchanged. Implicitly, this is an estimate of
the impact on productivity of the movement of factors
between sectors with different underlying productivity.
To estimate the possible magnitude of this productivity effect, the tariff increases in the first three layers are
run on a new global CGE model detailed in Caliendo
and others (2017). The resulting impact on activity is
an estimate of the medium-term effect and embodies
an implicit change in labor productivity. The final
layer adds this change in labor productivity, phased in
over five years beginning in 2020.
Consistent with past scenarios, all layers assume that
the euro area and Japan are unable to ease (conventional) monetary policy further in response to macroeconomic developments, given the lower bound on
nominal interest rates. If other unconventional monetary policy measures are implemented, the decline
in GDP in Japan and the euro area would be smaller
in the near term than estimated here. In all other
countries and regions, conventional monetary policy
responds according to a Taylor-type reaction function.
It is important to note the considerable uncertainty
surrounding the magnitude and persistence of the
confidence effects on investment and the tightening in
corporate spreads. These effects could be either milder
or more severe than assumed here. Regarding the layer
that contains the tightening in corporate spreads, one
aspect not included in the analysis is the potential for
safe-haven flows to mitigate the impact of financial
tightening in such countries as Germany, Japan, and
the United States.
The estimated impact on activity (shown in Scenario
Figure 1.2.1) indicates that tariffs included in the April
2019 WEO baseline (dark blue line) are estimated to
have a fairly mild direct effect: the United States and
China are most affected and China bears the greatest
burden. The largest effect falling on the United States
and China also holds true for the direct effect of
tariff measures implemented in May 2019 (gray line)
and those announced in August 2019 (yellow line).
However, the magnitude of the impact becomes much
more material. The short-term spillovers on other
countries from these measures are estimated to be positive as some countries—notably the North American
trading partners of the United States—benefit from
trade diversion. These benefits, however, disappear in
the medium term, and the spillovers become negative
as households and firms in China and the United
States are able to source more goods domestically that

were previously imported. Adding the confidence
effects on investment (green line) and the increase in
corporate spreads (red line) results in a negative result
for all countries. For the United States and China,
adding the estimated productivity effects (light blue
line) amplifies the economic damage, but because they
are phased in over five years, that negative impact
grows over time and is substantial in both the medium
and the long term. For some other countries, the
productivity impact is positive, but small. Changes in
global demand reallocate resources in these countries
from less to more productive sectors.4

Overall, China suffers the most, as output falls by
2 percent in the short term and 1 percent in the long
term (light blue bar). The United States runs a close
second, with output falling by 0.6 percent in both time
spans. The trough in global activity is estimated to take
place in 2020, with output about 0.8 percent below
baseline. The trough in activity across advanced economies is very similar to the trough in the United States,
at roughly –½ percent. Unlike in the United States, the
long-term direct trade effects are small and negative in
advanced economies, although they are more than offset
by positive productivity effects in some countries.

4As noted earlier, the productivity effect arises from resources
shifting between sectors with different productivity. The
countries with the closest trading ties to Canada, Mexico, and
the United States benefit the most. In the trade model analysis,

resources shifting from agriculture and mining to manufacturing in these two countries drives the improvement in aggregate
productivity.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Global Manufacturing Downturn, Rising Tr ade Barriers

Box 1.1. The Global Automobile Industry: Recent Developments and Implications for the
Global Outlook
The automobile industry contracted in 2018 for
the first time since the global financial crisis, contributing to the global slowdown since last year. Two
main factors explain the downturn: the removal of
tax breaks in China and the rollout of new carbon
emission tests in Europe. Near-term prospects for the
industry remain sluggish, and efforts to decarbonize
pose a fundamental challenge in the medium term.
The automobile sector is a globally interconnected
industry with a large economic footprint. The size
of the sector’s gross output (that is, the sum of its
value added and intermediate consumption) is about
5.7 percent of global output, according to the World
Input-Output Database (Timmer and others 2015).
Vehicles and related parts are the world’s fifth largest
export product, accounting for about 8 percent of
global goods exports in 2018 (Figure 1.1.1). The sector
is also a major consumer of commodities, other manufactured products, and services: the vehicle industry
is the second largest consumer of steel and aluminum
and demands significant amounts of copper, rubber,
plastic, and electronics (Figure 1.1.2).
During the 2018 contraction (measured in units;
Figure 1.1.3, panel 1) global automobile production
declined by about 1.7 percent, or about –2.4 percent
after correcting for differences in unit values (for example, German cars, on average, are more expensive than
Indian cars). Global car sales fell by about 3 percent.
China (the largest vehicle market in the world) experienced a 4 percent contraction in units produced, its first
decline in more than two decades. Large declines were
registered in Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom,
while production in the United States and large emerging markets expanded marginally (Figure 1.1.3, panel
2). The downturn has continued into 2019, as indicated
by declining global light vehicle sales through June
2019 (Figure 1.1.4, panel 1) on continued subdued
momentum in China and Europe. Consistent with
performance, stock prices of the largest 14 car manufacturers have declined by 28 percent, on average, since
March 2018 (compared with about a 1 percent increase
in the MSCI World index during that time).
The industry’s downturn contributed to the slowdown in global growth beginning in the second half
of 2018. National income account data by sector are

not yet available for 2018 in many countries. However,
assuming a proportional decline in value added, IMF
estimates suggest that the contraction in car production
directly subtracted 0.04 percentage point from global
output growth last year (following a positive contribution of 0.02 percentage point in 2017). Considering
that global growth slowed by 0.2 percentage point last
year—from 3.8 percent in 2017 to 3.6 percent—these
estimates suggest that automobile production has been
an important factor in the global slowdown.
Developments in the automobile industry also played
a role in global trade dynamics. Automobile exports from
the 14 biggest car-producing countries fell by 3.1 percent in 2018 when measured in units. Controlling for
differences in unit values across exporters, IMF estimates
suggest that the contraction in car exports directly subtracted 0.12 percentage point from global trade volumes

in 2018 (following a positive contribution of 0.03 percent
in 2017). In addition, the sector’s extensive value-chain
linkages imply that the overall effects may be larger once
the impact on trade in car parts—for which volume data
are not yet available for a sufficiently large number of
countries—and other intermediate goods used in car production is considered. A global input-output framework
based on Bems, Johnson, and Yi (2011) suggests that the
sector may have subtracted as much as 0.5 percentage
point from global trade in 2018, once these spillover
effects are factored in. For reference, the growth of all
global exports of goods and services was 3.8 percent
points in 2018 (down from 5.4 percent growth in 2017).
Several factors help explain the sector’s performance:
•• Vehicle demand in China was weighed down
by higher taxes and tighter financial conditions. Tax breaks have been used in China to
encourage vehicle ownership. In late 2015,
the purchase tax on small and medium
vehicles was lowered to 5 percent from 10 percent and subsequently increased to 7.5 percent
in 2017 and to 10 percent in 2018 (Figure 1.1.4,
panel 2). According to industry analysts, the lower
tax rates in 2016–17 brought sales forward by
2–7 million units (about 20 percent of total production), which then reduced sales in 2018–19.1
1Mian and Sufi (2012) document similar intertemporal
reallocation in the United States during the “Cash for Clunkers”
program of 2009.

Tighter regulations on peer-to-peer lending also
weighed on demand, while tariff increases on US
car imports and decreases on car imports from
other countries may have led consumers to take a
precautionary stance.
•• The rollout of new emission tests in Europe
disrupted car production and trade. In September
2018, a new euro-area-wide emission test (known
as WLTP) went into effect. The large number
of models requiring certification led to bottlenecks at testing agencies, and several automakers
had to adjust production schedules to avoid
unwanted inventory accumulation. Other developments weighing on activity included falling
demand from emerging markets (most notably
Turkey) and the United Kingdom and acceleration of the shift out of diesel into gasoline and
alternative-fuel vehicles.
•• Car demand in the United States held up in 2018
despite tighter financial conditions (and the higher
steel and aluminum tariffs). Although higher
interest rates on car financing throughout 2017–18,
and tighter lending standards, weighed on demand,
provisions for vehicle depreciation in the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act provided support. In addition,
although higher tariffs on steel and aluminum
added an estimated $240 to the production cost of
an average car in the United States in 2018 (Schultz
and others 2019), it is unclear how much of that
was passed on to final consumers.

saturation (Figure 1.1.4, panel 3), a young vehicle fleet,
and lower subsidies on purchases of electric vehicles are
likely to continue to hold back demand; the introduction of a new emission standard in mid-2019 could
also disrupt production. The outlook for Europe is
affected by falling demand for diesel-powered vehicles,
continued Brexit-related uncertainty, and emission tests
set for late 2019. Elsewhere, easier financial conditions
should provide support, especially in the United States
and large emerging markets, but ongoing discussions
around Section 232 tariffs on US imports from the
European Union and Japan could weigh on activity in
the near term.

More fundamentally, efforts to decarbonize are
set to shape the medium-term outlook. A significant
ramp-up of investment in the production of electric
and other alternative-fuel vehicles is expected in the
medium term, particularly in Europe. However, the
supply chains for electric vehicles are several orders
of magnitude shorter than those for fuel-powered
vehicles. Furthermore, entry-level prices remain higher
than for fuel-powered cars, which could limit demand
uptake. Accordingly, automakers are facing challenges
that mean they will have to make changes to business
models above and beyond those required by technological reconfiguration.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Global Manufacturing Downturn, Rising Tr ade Barriers

Box 1.2. The Decline in World Foreign Direct Investment in 2018
Financial flows to and from advanced economies
have been much weaker since the global financial
crisis (Figure 1.2.1). In particular, portfolio debt
flows have weakened, reflecting a combination of
factors: large government debt asset purchases by
central banks, increased fragmentation in euro area
debt markets, and much-reduced accumulation of
reserves by emerging market and developing economies. Other investment flows have also fallen sharply
as global banks reduced the size of their balance
sheets after dramatic expansion of their cross-border
activities during the precrisis boom. But, until the
end of 2017, foreign direct investment (FDI) flows
had actually increased slightly relative to the precrisis
period, averaging more than 3 percent of GDP annually (more than $1.8 trillion).
The data for 2018 show a different picture: FDI
abroad by advanced economies, as well as inward
FDI, came to a virtual standstill. This box looks at the
factors behind this large decline as well as the implications for emerging market and developing economies.
Does this decline in FDI point to increased fragmentation? This box argues that it does not and that most
of the decline in FDI reflects purely financial operations by large multinational corporations, including in
response to changes in US tax law.
Specifically, a significant policy development
affecting FDI in 2018 was the 2017 US Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act, which generally eliminated taxes on repatriated earnings by US multinationals.1 In response
to the law, US multinational corporations repatriated
accumulated prior earnings of their foreign affiliates.
During 2011–17 these multinationals, on average,
reinvested in their overseas affiliates about $300 billion
a year in earnings on FDI (about two-thirds of their
total overseas earnings), but in 2018 they repatriated
$230 billion. In other words, the dividends paid to
parent companies by overseas affiliates exceeded these
affiliates’ earnings by $230 billion (Figure 1.2.2,
panel 1, blue bars). This repatriated amount exceeded
new FDI abroad and, hence, total FDI abroad by
The author of this box is Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti.
1Earnings by foreign affiliates can be repatriated to the parent
company in the form of dividends or reinvested in the foreign
affiliate. Both types of earnings are reflected as primary income
in the current account, and reinvested earnings are counted
as new FDI abroad (a financial outflow). Under the previous
tax system, US companies would typically retain most of their
earnings abroad.

US corporations was negative in 2018 (Figure 1.2.2,

Where did this repatriation of earnings originate? As documented by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and as discussed in Setser (2019), it
originated primarily in a few financial centers, with
dividends paid out of Bermuda, the Netherlands,
and Ireland accounting for about $500 billion—
almost three times more than the income reported
by US affiliates in these locations. The evidence also
suggests that the repatriated assets were invested
primarily from overseas in US financial instruments
(Smolyansky, Suarez, and Tabova 2019). Hence, the
repatriation of earnings would reduce FDI abroad
and, correspondingly, reduce claims of nonresidents

on the US economy (for instance, in the form of
portfolio investment in debt securities), given that
overseas affiliates of US multinational corporations are residents of the country where they are
established.
But the decline in US FDI abroad by itself
explains only part of the $1.5 trillion reduction in
advanced economies’ FDI abroad between 2017
and 2018. The remainder comes mostly from the
euro area, in particular from Luxembourg and the
Netherlands, where FDI abroad fell from $340 billion in 2017 to –$730 billion in 2018. In these
countries, the lion’s share of FDI reflects financial
operations of special purpose entities. These multinational corporation affiliates are pass-through entities
with little or no employment or value added, whose
financial balance sheets are composed primarily of
cross-border assets and liabilities. They are established to (1) access capital markets or sophisticated
financial services, (2) isolate owner(s) from financial risk, (3) reduce regulatory and tax burdens, or
(4) safeguard the confidentiality of their transactions
and owner(s).2
Statistics published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suggest that
FDI abroad by advanced economy special purpose
entities—mostly domiciled in Luxembourg and the
Netherlands—declined from $240 billion in 2017
to –$740 billion in 2018 and hence accounts for
more than 90 percent of the decline in FDI flows.
Panel 2 of Figure 1.2.2 shows the pattern of special
purpose entities’ investment in advanced economies
since 2005, highlighting the large decline in 2018
as well as the symmetry between the behavior of
assets and liabilities.3 The decline in FDI positions
by special purpose entities is also the main factor
explaining the sharp reduction in inward FDI for
advanced economies highlighted in panel 2 of
Figure 1.2.1. Panel 3 of Figure 1.2.2 highlights the
contributions of the United States and of special
purpose entities to the decline in advanced economies’ FDI abroad.

2See IMF (2018) for a discussion of the nature of special purpose entities and the recording of their activities in the balance
of payments.
3Not all countries report FDI transactions and holdings by
special purpose entities separately; hence, the estimates in the
figure understate to some extent their role.

Box 1.2 (continued)
As noted in DNB (2019) and BCL (2019), these
transactions reflect mostly operations by US-based
multinationals seeking to simplify their international
group structure by liquidating intermediate holdings, also in relation to the US tax reform of 2017.
Similarly, SNB (2019) notes that the US tax reform
led foreign-controlled finance and holding companies
domiciled in Switzerland to reduce their balance
sheets. On the liability side, inward FDI was negative: nonresident parent companies withdrew equity
capital from companies in Switzerland. Other factors
are also likely to have been at play, including ongoing broader tax reform initiatives, such as the Base
Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative and the European Union’s Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives 1 and 2.
Figure 1.2.3 depicts the pattern of capital flows
to and from the largest emerging market economies.
Inflows in 2018 were weaker than in 2017, but FDI
inflows fell only slightly in relation to GDP, and this
decline is entirely accounted for by another large
reduction in FDI positions by special purpose entities
in Hungary. The picture for financial outflows also
shows some decline in 2018, including in FDI. The
largest component of this decline is, again, the reduction in FDI by special purpose entities in Hungary,
coupled with some reduction in FDI abroad by China,
which is the largest overseas investor among emerging
market economies. On net, emerging market economies remain FDI destinations, and their FDI liabilities
exceed their assets.
In sum, the sharp decline in global FDI flows
in 2018 seems to be explained almost entirely by
multinational corporations’ financial operations, with
no meaningful aggregate impact on emerging market
economies. These developments further underscore
how FDI transactions and positions recorded in the
balance of payments are often unrelated to greenfield
investment or mergers and acquisitions, but rather
reflect tax and regulatory optimization strategies by

clarify the nature of FDI flows and positions.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.3. Global Growth Forecast: Assumptions on Policies, Financial Conditions, and Commodity Prices
The global forecast rests on the following key
assumptions on policies, financial conditions, and
commodity prices:
•• Tariffs: The tariffs imposed and announced by the
United States as of August 2019 and retaliatory
measures by trading partners are factored into the
baseline forecast. For US actions, besides tariffs on
solar panels, washing machines, aluminum, and steel
announced in the first half of 2018, these include
a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion in imports from
China (July and August 2018), rising to 30 percent
in October 2019; tariffs on an additional $200 billion in imports from China (September 2018, at
10 percent until May 2019, 25 percent from May
through September 2019, and 30 percent thereafter); and the August 2019 announcement of a
further 10 percent tariff on the remaining $325 billion of imports from China (subsequently increased
to 15 percent for a subset of the list beginning in
September 2019 and the remainder beginning in
December 2019). China’s retaliation included a
25 percent tariff on $50 billion of imports from
the United States (July and August 2018); tariffs of
5–10 percent on $60 billion of imports from the
United States (September 2018); and additional
tariffs of 5–10 percent on $75 billion of imports
from the United States (effective September and
December 2019). Following the May and August
2019 announcements, the average US tariff on
imports from China will rise to just over 24 percent
by December 2019 (compared with about 12¼
percent assumed in the April 2019 World Economic
Outlook (WEO)), while the average Chinese tariff
on imports from the United States will increase
to about 26 percent (compared with about 16½ percent assumed in the April 2019 WEO).
•• Fiscal policy: Fiscal policy in 2019 is projected
to be expansionary both in advanced economies

(Canada, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Korea,
Spain, United States) and emerging market
economies (China, Turkey). It is assumed to be
neutral across advanced economies in 2020—as
opposed to contractionary as assumed in the April
2019 WEO—given that the unwinding of the US
tax stimulus will be more than offset by spending
increases in a new budget deal. It is expected to
be contractionary in emerging market economies,
given that stimulus in China is assumed to unwind
to some extent (Figure 1.3.1).
•• Monetary policy: Compared with the April 2019
WEO, monetary policy of major central banks is
assumed to be more accommodative over the forecast horizon. The US federal funds rate is expected
to be in the 1.75–2 percent range through 2023,
rising to 2–2.25 percent in 2024. Policy rates are
assumed to remain below zero in the euro area and
Japan through 2024.
•• Commodity prices: Based on oil futures contracts,
average oil prices are projected at $61.8 in 2019,
declining to $57.9 in 2020 (compared with $59.16
and $59.02, respectively, in the April 2019 WEO).
Oil prices are expected to decline to about $55 a
barrel by 2023 (lower than in the April 2019 WEO
forecast), consistent with subdued medium-term
demand prospects (Figure 1.3.2). Metal prices
are expected to increase by 4.3 percent year over
year in 2019, before declining by 6.2 percent in
2020 (compared with a decrease of 6 percent and
a further decline of 0.8 percent in the April 2019
WEO assumptions). Price forecasts of most major
agricultural commodities have been revised down
for 2019. Food prices are projected to decline by
3.4 percent year over year in 2019 before increasing by 2.8 percent in 2020 (compared with the
projected decrease of 2.6 percent and increase of
1.7 percent in the April 2019 WEO).

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.4. The Plucking Theory of the Business Cycle

The author of this box is Damiano Sandri.

Figure 1.4.1. An Illustration of the Plucking
Theory
Output

Potential output

Expansion

Output

According to conventional business cycle theory,
the economy fluctuates symmetrically around a certain
level of potential output. Consistent with this view,
estimates of potential output are generally obtained by
fitting a smooth trend through output, removing business cycle fluctuations. These techniques imply that
several advanced economies are now operating close to
or above potential, facing inflation risks. Nonetheless,
inflation has been remarkably subdued in recent years,
raising questions about the state of the business cycle
and suggesting that potential output could be higher
than currently estimated.
The sluggish behavior of inflation has renewed interest in alternative interpretations of the business cycle.
One prominent hypothesis is that economic fluctuations may behave in line with the “plucking theory”
originally proposed by Friedman (1964, 1993).
According to this view, the economy suffers occasional
contractions that reduce the level of output below
potential, as illustrated in Figure 1.4.1. In Friedman’s
words, “output is viewed as bumping along the ceiling
of maximum feasible output except that every now
and then it is plucked down by a cyclical contraction.”
Dupraz, Nakamura, and Steinsson (2019) shows
that business cycle dynamics consistent with the plucking theory can occur when wages are sticky downward
but can freely adjust upward. In this case, negative
shocks pluck the economy below potential, while
positive shocks are absorbed through higher prices.
Accordingly, potential output should be estimated not
by smoothing out economic fluctuations, but by interpolating historical peaks of the business cycle. Therefore, current estimation techniques may significantly
underestimate potential output and provide premature
alarms about the risk of overheating.
Conventional estimates of potential output can
be too conservative, even if wages are also sticky
upward, provided downward nominal rigidities are
more severe. Building on this idea, Abbritti and Fahr
(2013) provides a model in which asymmetric wage
rigidities generate economic contractions below potential that are more severe than economic expansions
above it. Aiyar and Voigts (2019) points out that this
leads, on average, to negative output gaps and that,
when conventional filtering techniques are applied
to the model-generated data, they underestimate
potential output by generating output gaps centered
around zero.

Contraction

To test the validity of the plucking theory, the business cycle can be analyzed for particular asymmetries.
As shown in Figure 1.4.1, if output is temporarily
plucked down by occasional contractions, the severity
of an economic downturn should predict the strength
of the subsequent economic expansion. By contrast,
the amplitude of economic expansions should have no
bearing on the depth of subsequent contractions.
Dupraz, Nakamura, and Steinsson (2019) performs
a similar test looking at the behavior of the unemployment rate in the United States.1 Consistent with
the plucking theory, the study finds that increases
in the unemployment rate during economic downturns tend to be followed by reductions of a similar
size (Figure 1.4.2, panel 1). Declines in unemployment during economic expansions are, however, not
1The method requires identifying peaks and troughs in
seasonally adjusted monthly unemployment rates. A point in
the unemployment series, ​u̲​t ​, qualifies as a trough if it satisfies the following criterion. Take the first month in which the
unemployment rate increases by 1.5 percent above ​u̲​t​. If up to
that month the unemployment rate never falls below ​u̲​t ​, then ​u̲​t​​
is an unemployment trough. A symmetric procedure is used to
identify unemployment peaks.

2Data is pooled across the other advanced economies, given
that they display much fewer observations for the analysis than
in the case of the United States. This is for two reasons. First,
the unemployment rate series in the United States starts in
the late 1940s, while data for the other countries tend to be
available beginning in the 1970s. Second, the US unemployment
rate involves much more regular swings, while it follows more
slow-moving trends in other countries.

How well does the plucking theory fit the data for
other economies? Unemployment dynamics in other
Group of Twenty advanced economies reveal similar
behavior. Panel 3 of Figure 1.4.2 displays the pooled
data.2 It shows that increases in unemployment during
economic contractions are followed by proportional
unemployment declines during subsequent recoveries.
However, the relationship is marginally weaker than in
the United States, and the regression coefficient, equal
to 0.52, indicates that increases in the unemployment
rate are only partially reversed during subsequent
economic expansions, reflecting a trend increase in
structural unemployment. Consistent with the plucking theory, there is no significant relationship between
unemployment declines and subsequent increases
(Figure 1.4.2, panel 4).
In sum, unemployment dynamics in major advanced
economies display patterns that appear consistent with
theories that generate asymmetric business cycle fluctuations; while increases in unemployment are at least partially reversed, declines in unemployment are not. More
research on the robustness of these asymmetric dynamics
and the mechanisms behind them is warranted.
The implications of the plucking theory for macroeconomic policy are not trivial. For example, the
insight that conventional filtering techniques underestimate potential output could be used to argue that
countries have a stronger structurally adjusted fiscal
position (and a smaller fiscal consolidation need) than
generally assessed. However, the plucking theory also
implies that economies operate below potential, on
average. Therefore, a proper assessment of fiscal sustainability should not be based on a measure of potential output consistent with the plucking theory, but on
the lower expected output path. Regarding monetary
policy, the plucking theory implies a non-linear Philips
curve, with prices being slow to decline in a downturn
because of downward nominal rigidities. Monetary
policy may therefore want to rely more on measures
of economic slack to calibrate the appropriate level
of stimulus, withdrawing accommodation only when
inflationary pressures are clearly materializing.

SPECIAL FEATURE

Commodity Market Developments and Forecasts

Special Feature: Commodity Market Developments and Forecasts
Energy prices—especially for coal and natural gas—
have seen a broad-based decline since the release of the
April 2019 World Economic Outlook (WEO). After
a temporary rebound in April led by positive market
momentum and supply cuts, oil prices have retrenched
following record-high US production growth and weaker
economic growth prospects, especially in emerging markets. In response to declining oil prices, Organization
for the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and
non-OPEC oil exporters (including Russia) agreed to
extend their production cuts until March 2020. While
supply concerns caused iron ore and nickel prices to rally,
most base metal prices declined following continued
trade tensions and fears of a global economic slowdown.
Agricultural prices decreased slightly as an increase in
meat prices caused by disease outbreaks was more than
offset by price declines of other foods. This special feature
includes an in-depth analysis of precious metals.
The IMF’s primary commodity price index declined
by 5.5 percent between February 2019 and August
2019, the reference periods for the April 2019 and
current WEO, respectively (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 1).
Energy prices drove that decline, falling by 13.1 percent; food prices decreased by 1.2 percent, and base
metal prices decreased by 0.9 percent, driven by continued trade tensions and fears of a global economic
slowdown only partially offset by the supply-driven
price rally in the iron ore and nickel markets. Oil
prices rebounded sharply at the beginning of the year,
surpassing $71 a barrel in April,1 driven by positive
momentum in financial markets, supply cuts, and
declining US crude oil stockpiles. Since then, however, oil prices have retrenched substantially due to
record-high production growth in the United States
and subdued global economic growth (especially in
emerging markets). In response to the price decline,
OPEC and non-OPEC oil exporters (including
Russia) in July agreed to extend their December
2018 production cuts to the end of the first quarter
of 2020. Coal and natural gas prices decreased amid

a decline in industrial activity and power generation
across regions.

Oil Prices in a Narrow Range amid Energy
Prices’ Decline and Heightened Uncertainty
Oil prices have been relatively stable, trading within
a narrow range this year despite heightened geopolitical
uncertainty. In April, they surpassed $71, their highest
for 2019, and hit their recent bottom of $55 in August
before rebounding back above $60 in September.
Initially, prices were pushed higher by the recovery of
financial conditions as well as outages in Venezuela
and US tensions with Iran. But in late spring a weaker
global economy raised concern about the strength of
global oil demand, which was amplified by a buildup
of US crude oil stockpiles.
Supply outages and geopolitical tensions, however,
masked the oil demand weakness and, so, temporarily
supported prices. Venezuela suffered production loss
after a power outage in March, and Russian oil exports
were partially halted in May because of pipeline contamination. Although these outages were temporary,
they helped balance the market, resulting in lower US
inventories in early spring. In addition, in May, previously issued US waivers to eight major importers of
Iranian crude oil were not extended. Moreover, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East rose because of several attacks on Saudi oil infrastructures and oil tankers
near the Strait of Hormuz; given that about 20 percent
of global crude oil trade passes through the Strait, the
fear of a conflict in that area drives up precautionary
oil demand and insurance costs. On September 14, an
attack on two key oil facilities in Saudi Arabia knocked
out 5.7 million barrels per day of production for a few
days (that is, about half of Saudi Arabia’s total production, or 5 percent of global oil production), raising
initially the fear of disruptions in the physical crude oil
market and further escalating tensions. Further support
for oil prices came from OPEC and non-OPEC oil
exporters (including Russia), which, on July 1, 2019,
agreed to extend their crude oil production cuts
beyond their initial six-month period for an additional
nine months until March 2020, by 0.8 million barrels
a day (mbd) and 0.4 mbd, respectively.
On the demand side, weaker global economic
fundamentals have contributed to lower prices.

The IMF’s October downward revision of the global
growth forecast—by 0.3 percent to 3.0 percent and by
0.2 percent to 3.4 percent for 2019 and 2020, respectively, from its April forecast—illustrates a slowdown
in global activity, driven in particular by emerging
markets and the euro area. In line with this slowdown,
the International Energy Agency revised its oil demand
growth forecast as of September for this year down to
1.1 mbd from 1.4 mbd in February.
In the natural gas market, spot prices have been
declining in recent months amid increased production and higher stock levels due to lower global power
demand. Coal prices have decreased in tandem because
of declining power generation. Further downward
pressure followed last year’s record retirement of US
coal-fired power capacity. Its replacement by cheaper
gas-fired power plants, as part of a global trend, has
lowered the share of coal in US power generation.
Despite the ongoing decarbonization of the power sector
in the United States and the rest of the world, however,
global greenhouse gas emissions increased again in 2018
following strong global growth (see Box 1.SF.1).
As of late September 2019, oil futures contracts
indicate that Brent prices will gradually decline to $55
over the next five years (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 2). Baseline assumptions, also based on futures prices, suggest
average annual prices of $61.8 a barrel in 2019—a
decrease of 9.6 percent from the 2018 average—and
$57.9 a barrel in 2020 for the IMF’s average petroleum
spot prices. Despite the weaker demand outlook, risks
are tilted to the upside in the near term but balanced
in the medium term (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 3). Upside
risks to prices in the short term include ongoing
geopolitical events in the Middle East disrupting oil
supply and contributing to rising insurance and shipping costs of oil cargoes. Downside risks include higher
US production and exports thanks to new Permian
pipelines coming online, noncompliance among
OPEC and non-OPEC members, and a downturn in
petrochemical demand. Further, a rise in trade tensions
and other risks to global growth could decelerate global
activity and reduce oil demand in the medium term.

Metal Prices Mixed
Base metal prices declined slightly by 0.9 percent
between February 2019 and August 2019 as continued
trade policy uncertainty and fears of a global economic
slowdown—especially in China—were only partially
offset by supply-driven price increases in iron ore

and nickel. Precious metal prices rose, reflecting in
part increased expectations of monetary easing in the
United States and a flight to safety amid trade tensions.
Iron ore prices increased 6.7 percent between
February 2019 and August 2019. Widespread
disruptions—including the Vale dam collapse in
Brazil and tropical cyclone Veronica in Australia—
coupled with record-high steel output in China
pushed iron ore prices to five-year highs during
the first half of 2019. However, the normalization
of previously disrupted operations and escalating
trade tensions between the United States and China
triggered a sharp correction in August, partially
offsetting the gains since the beginning of the year.
The price of nickel, a key input for stainless steel
and batteries in electric vehicles, gained 24.1 percent
between February 2019 and August 2019 on supply
concerns as Indonesia, the world’s largest nickel producer, introduced a complete ban on exports of raw
nickel ore beginning in January 2020.
Other base metal prices suffered from a weaker global
economy, however. Copper prices declined 9.4 percent
on global trade uncertainty despite recent production
cuts in the Republic of Congo, a labor dispute in
Chuquicamata (Chile), and increasing extraction costs
in Indonesia’s Grasberg mine. The price of aluminum
fell by 6.6 percent because of overcapacity in China and
weakening demand from the vehicle market there. The
price of zinc, which is used mainly to galvanize steel,
decreased 16 percent from February to August 2019
as steel demand prospects deteriorated. The price of
cobalt continued its downward trend and declined by
6.1 percent, reflecting a supply glut after production was
ramped up in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The IMF annual base metals price index is projected
to increase by 4.3 percent in 2019 (relative to its
average in 2018) and decrease by 6.2 percent in 2020.
Major downside risks to the outlook include prolonged
trade negotiations and a further slowdown of industrial
activity globally. Upside risks are supply disruptions
and more stringent environmental regulations in major
metal producing countries.

Commodity Market Developments and Forecasts

Following the rapid spread of African swine fever
across China (the world’s largest producer and consumer of pork) and other parts of Southeast Asia,
prices of pork jumped by 42.8 percent. News of
disease outbreaks and animal culling have raised uncertainty regarding Chinese pork supplies in the near
future. The outbreak has also led to tighter supplies
and higher prices in Europe and the United States as
domestic producers increased exports to China. In
the wake of the crisis, prices of some other animal
proteins surged too, with beef, for example, rising by
8.3 percent.
Record rainfall in the Midwest of the United States
delayed corn and soybean-planting in May and June,
introducing a high weather premium into grain markets. This premium then left the markets between late
July and end of August, however, as US corn acreage
and yields surpassed expectations. Strong global production also weighed on corn prices, which ultimately
decreased by 3.6 percent between February and
August. Soybeans experienced a net loss of 5.9 percent
as trade tensions and the African swine fever outbreak
in China continued to depress animal feed demand.
Cocoa prices decreased by 2.7 percent following
favorable weather conditions in west Africa during July
and August. Palm oil prices declined, by 2.6 percent,
given that inventories are expected to increase and
global demand in 2019–20 may shrink for the first
time in two decades, following environmental concerns
in some importing countries and rising competition
from other vegetable oils.
Food prices are projected to decrease by 3.4 percent
a year in 2019, mainly because of higher prices in the
first half of 2018, and then increase by 2.8 percent in
2020. Weather conditions have been unusual in recent
months and additional weather disruptions remain an
upside risk to the forecast. On August 9, 2019, the US
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
announced that El Niño climate conditions that started
last September are now officially over. A resolution
of the trade conflict between the United States—the
world’s largest food exporter—and China remains the
largest source of upside potential for prices.

The IMF’s food and beverage price index has decreased
slightly, by 1.3 percent, as price declines of cereals,
vegetables, vegetable oils, and sugar overwhelmed a large,

discipline, or is their role as a store of value overstated?
This section tries to answer these questions by offering
a brief historical overview, then investigating the basic
characteristics of precious metals, including the geographical distribution of their production, and, finally,
through an econometric analysis to test some possible
answers to these questions.

Coinage, Money, and Precious Metals: A Brief
Historical Overview
Since ancient times, luster, ductility, rarity, and
remarkable chemical stability have conferred high value
on precious metals (that is, gold and silver and, later,
platinum and palladium, which share similar physical
properties).2 The first use of gold and silver for ornaments, rituals, and to signal social status dates to prehistoric times and was widespread across cultures and
civilizations (Green 2007). The combination of these
unique characteristics made precious metals excellent
stores of value and probably was crucial in fostering the
introduction of coins—a fundamental innovation in
the history of money and a transition in the development of civilization itself (Mundell 2002). Coinage, in
turn, inextricably connected precious metals to money
and currencies for centuries.3
Thanks also to their density, gold and silver
coins were strongly favored as medium of exchange
relative to other metals (such as copper), especially
for (sizable) international transactions. As a result,
2Gold and silver belong to the seven metals of antiquity
(with copper, tin, lead, iron, and mercury). Today 86 metals
are known. The first European reference to platinum appears in
1557 in the writings of the Italian humanist Giulio Cesare della
Scala. Only at the end of 18th century, however, did platinum
gain appreciation as a precious metal. Palladium was discovered
by William Hyde Wollaston in 1802 (curiously named after
the asteroid 2 Pallas) and has been used as a precious metal in
jewelry since 1939 as an alternative to platinum in alloys called
“white gold.” (The naturally white color of palladium does not
require rhodium plating.) Other precious metals, in addition
to those analyzed, include the platinum group metals: ruthenium, rhodium, osmium, and iridium, which are, however, not
widely traded.
3The introduction of coinage is still shrouded in mystery, but
it seems likely that the first coin (the electrum, a mix of gold and
silver) was minted in Lydia around 600 BCE, and it rapidly spread
throughout the Mediterranean area. The Lydian electrum coins
were overvalued, yielding profit or seigniorage to the issuer. This
overvaluation indicates that the issuing state must have been strong
enough to enforce a monopoly of coinage, inhibiting entry by means
of drastic prohibitions (Mundell 2002).

48

some gold and silver coins minted by reliable
entities gained wide international acceptance (for
example, gold florins and ducats in the Middle Ages
and silver pesos in modern times)—facilitating and
stimulating trade across kingdoms and civilizations
(Vilar 1976).4
Mixed metallic standards, in which government or
central bank notes are convertible into metal coins at
a fixed price, were a natural evolution to overcome
some of the obvious limitations of pure coin standards (Officer 2008). After centuries of widespread
bimetallism, in which the gold–silver ratio is given
by the mint price, in the third quarter of the 19th
century, following the lead of Britain, monometallic
gold standards prevailed across the major economic
powers of that time—possibly stimulating global
trade.5 As silver was demonetized across the world,
silver prices declined substantially, especially after the
1873 Coinage Act (also known as the “Crime of ’73”;
Friedman 1990). Hence, after thousands of years of
relative stability, the silver–gold price ratio became
volatile and shot up from 16:1 in the mid-1800s to
almost 100:1 in subsequent decades (Figure 1.SF.2,
panel 2).6
The stability of gold purchasing power was quite
remarkable—with the exception of the world wars
and the Great Depression—until the suspension of
dollar-gold convertibility in 1971, which two years
4By 500 BCE, after Darius conquered Lydia, Persia embraced
coinage (opting for a bimetallic monetary standard) and struck
massive quantities of Persian sigloi (a silver coin), which became the
international currency of its time, along with two other Anatolian
coins (that is, the gold coins of Lampsacus and the electrum coins
of Cyzicus) (Mundell 2002). After the Roman aureum, in the
middle ages, the gold Florentine florins and Venetian ducats became
accepted across Europe, while the silver peso (also known as the
“piece of eight”), minted in the Spanish Empire, was the international currency of modern times, the antecedent of the US dollar,
and was legal tender in the United States until the Coinage Act of
1857 (Vilar 1976).
5Some studies have found that the rise of the classical gold
standard, between 1870 and 1913, could account for 20 percent
of the increase in global trade between 1880 and 1910—strongly
supporting the idea that commodity money regime coordination
and currency unions were an important catalyst for 19th century
globalization (Lopez-Cordova and Meissner 2003).
6Silver was demonetized first in the United Kingdom in
1819, later during the 1870s in Germany, France, the Scandinavian Union, the Netherlands, Austria, Russia, and in the Latin
Monetary Union (Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland), and in the
United States with the 1973 Coinage Act. By the late 1870s,
China and India were the only major countries effectively on a
silver standard.

later led to the collapse of the system, inaugurating a
new era of fluctuating gold prices and indefinitely severing the link between precious metals and currencies
(Figure 1.SF.2).
Even today in a world of fiat currencies, the legacy
of gold-currency convertibility is visible as official
holdings of gold—mostly held by central banks and
international institutions such as the IMF and the
Bank for International Settlements—still represent a
large share of the total stock of the precious metals of
official reserves and, sometimes, even of a country’s
public debt (Table 1.SF.1).
The next section investigates the current role of
precious metals in the global economy, looking at their
production volumes and values (sizable for various
countries) and their usage.

The production of precious metals, especially platinum and palladium, is concentrated in a few places.
The global flow of production for gold was about 3,260
metric tons in 2018, equivalent to about $134 billion.
The top five producers (China, Australia, Russia, United
States, Canada) make up more than 40 percent of
production. The value of gold production is bigger than
copper and dwarfs other precious metals. Global production of silver, palladium, and platinum was $13 billion, $9 billion, and $4 billion in 2018, respectively.
Their production, however, is much more concentrated;
for example, the two largest silver producers (Mexico
and Peru) represent almost 40 percent of global production. Similarly, Russia and South Africa account for
three-quarters of global palladium production, while
South Africa alone accounts for more than two-thirds
of global platinum production (Table 1.SF.2).
Taken as a group, total production and reserves of
precious metals represent a nonnegligible share of GDP
(exports) for various countries (Figure 1.SF.3), especially
for medium and small low-income countries (for example, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Suriname). Fluctuations
in prices may, thus, induce significant income and
wealth effects on a wide variety of countries.
The mining of precious metals is relatively inelastic
to prices, as a price boom in the mid-2000s showed
(Erb and Harvey 2013). Precious metal production
ratios exhibit no clear trend over a long period, and
the gold–silver ratio was, surprisingly, barely affected
by the American silver production boom of the 16th
and 17th centuries (Table 1.SF.3).7 In addition,
silver–gold production and price ratios have shown no
obvious relationship in the past decade, suggesting that
the relative supply of precious metals has not been a
significant source of price fluctuations.
The Use of Precious Metals
Demand for precious metals can be classified
as follows: industrial, jewelry, and investment
and net official purchases by central banks and
7Interestingly, while the production volume of precious metals has
increased about 500 times since 1500, global GDP and population
have increased 50 and 15 times, respectively (Malanima 2009). Over
the same period, the purchasing power of gold and silver has not
declined (Erb and Harvey 2013).

international organizations. More than half of
newly mined gold is used in jewelry (Figure 1.SF.4).
Silver, instead, has various industrial applications,
which account for half of silver consumption, while
only 25 percent of silver demand is for jewelry.
Investment demand for gold and silver (in the form
of coins and bars or holdings in exchange-traded
funds) varies significantly as it is more sensitive to
prices.8 Industrial use is more important for platinum and, especially, palladium—which are used in
catalytic converters by the car industry.
Official sector gold holdings are large, accounting for
about 30 percent of the global stock of gold. Their sale
can disrupt the market and therefore has been limited to
400 metric tons a year.9 The declining role of gold in the
balance sheets of central banks in advanced economies,
however, has been more than offset by a recent surge
in emerging market gold reserves (Table 1.SF.1). The
next section will take a financial investment perspective
on precious metals by looking at them as an asset class,
analyzing their major price determinants, and paying
attention to their safe haven and hedging properties
during market turmoil and against high inflation.

Price Properties of Precious Metals
Precious metals can be considered an asset class
of their own. Their returns show a high correlation
among themselves, especially gold, silver, and platinum,
consistent with their respective ranking in industrial use
(Figure 1.SF.5). At monthly frequencies, gold and silver
have the highest correlation, 0.72, while palladium and
gold have the lowest, at 0.33. At lower frequencies, palladium prices are more related to industrial metals (such
as copper) than to gold, but the highest correlation for
palladium is still with its close substitute, platinum.
Movements in global industrial production have, however, minor implications for precious metal prices, even
for palladium and platinum (Table 1.SF.5).
The relationship between precious metals and inflation throughout history has changed with the monetary system in place. In historical metallic regimes, in
8The exchange-traded fund GLD holds 20 percent of total stock
scattered in warehouses across the world. Scrap metal is another
significant, price-sensitive source of supply, which for gold is almost
half of mining production.
9The central bank moratorium on gold sales, in September 1999,
led the price of gold to rise by 25 percent within a month. There
have since been three further agreements, in 2004, 2009, and 2014,
limiting the amount of gold that signatories can sell in any one year.

which a currency was pegged to metals, such as under
the Bretton Woods system, an increase in price was
associated with a decline in the real price of metals
(Figure 1.SF.6). This result is, however, reversed in
contemporary fiat currency regimes.
Bekaert and Wang (2010) proposes testing whether
an asset is a good inflation hedge by simply regressing
its nominal return on inflation, arguing that if the
regression slope (inflation beta) is 1 then the asset is

a good inflation hedge. Averages of precious metals’
inflation betas calculated across a broad set of countries
during 1978–201910 are below 1 at monthly frequencies but get close to 1 as the horizon increases, especially for gold and silver (Table 1.SF.4). However, the
regression fit is usually modest, and betas vary substantially across countries (see Online Annex Table 1.SF.1),
suggesting that precious metals, including gold and silver, are not a reliable and robust inflation hedge.11 This
result, however, is not that surprising, given that the
volatility of precious metal prices increased substantially after the end of the Bretton Woods agreements,
even for gold. It does, however, suggest that gold prices
peaked in 1980 and 2012, two periods during which
there was fear, justified or not, of a globally widespread
wave of high inflation.12 This observation would call
10Executive Order 6102, issued in 1933, prohibited hoarding
of gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates in the continental
United States. The limitation on gold private ownership in the
United States was repealed in 1974, leading to a resumption of gold
bullion trading in spot and futures markets in 1975.
11A similar conclusion is obtained when testing for the presence
of a unit root in the real price of precious metals over a long time
span. Most of the tests are inconclusive, suggesting that metal prices
are not an obvious inflation hedge. In fact, even though long-term
real returns are close to zero, fluctuations in the real price of precious
metals can be very persistent, especially in local currency.
12In early 1980 US consumer price inflation peaked at almost
15 percent. By 2012 many central banks around the world had
embarked on quantitative easing; the Federal Reserve balance
sheet doubled in size while consumer price inflation in the United
States had peaked at almost 4 percent in the previous year. Bekaert
and Wang (2010) argues that the “recent crisis has made market
observers and economists wonder whether inflation will rear its ugly
head again in years to come. Central banks across the world have
injected substantial amounts of liquidity in the financial system, and
public debt has surged everywhere. It is not hard to imagine that
inflationary pressures may resurface with a vengeance once the economy rebounds.” In both episodes, however, concerns were probably
overplayed given that inflation declined in the subsequent years (in
most advanced economies).

for testing precious metals’ ability to hedge against
tail events, such as the collapse of major fiat currency
systems—a daunting task, however, given that that has
never happened.
A more viable alternative is to regress precious metal
prices on a measure of inflation risk (such as past
inflation volatility or inflation forecast dispersion) and
a set of control variables (Table 1.SF.5). Results of the
analysis support the view that precious metal prices
react to inflation concerns. The analysis uses monthly
data starting in 1978 and controlling for the exchange
rate (traditionally, an important determinant), Treasury
yields (a proxy for carrying costs), mean reversion, and
expected and surprise inflation. An increase in inflation
uncertainty by one standard deviation tends, within a
month, to raise the price of gold by 0.8 percent and
silver by 1.6 percent. A decline in inflation uncertainty
can explain half of the observed gold price decline of
the 1990s and one-third of the price rise after 2008.

The role of inflation uncertainty is, instead, positive but not significant for platinum and palladium,
yet irrelevant for copper. Interestingly, because of dollar
invoicing, an appreciation of the US dollar has a similar strong negative effect on all metals tested, including
copper. What is more surprising is a coefficient above

unity, suggesting that metal prices are excessively sensitive to the US dollar.13
In addition to tail events in the monetary sphere,
precious metals have been considered safe assets
during sharp movements in economic and policy uncertainty, as proxied by stock price changes.
Table 1.SF.6 shows that gold and (to a lesser extent)
13Capie, Mills, and Wood (2005) and Sjaastad (2008) examine
the hedge property of gold with respect to changes of the US dollar
and show that dollar exchange rates and gold prices are inversely
related. This result has also been found for oil prices (Kilian
and Zhou 2019).

silver returns do not correlate during days of high
stock market swings: the top 30 stock market booms
are associated with a stable gold price, on average,
while the top 30 stock market declines are associated
with an average slight increase in gold prices (there is
still-sizable uncertainty around the average reaction).
This safe haven property—which stands out for gold
and, to a lesser extent, silver but is not present for
platinum nor, especially, palladium—is shared by
the US dollar and Treasury notes, typical safe haven
assets. It is not shared by other base metals. Finally,

low-income countries) and have relevant industrial use,
especially platinum and palladium—even though their

price is only mildly affected by global activity. Gold and
silver can function as inflation hedges, but this property
should not be overstated, especially when changes in
inflation are modest. Instead, given their historical role
in monetary systems and purchasing power stability,
gold and silver seem to have been buoyed at times by
the (possibly irrational) fear of a collapse of major fiat
currency systems. The safe haven properties of precious
metals have probably been more apparent during some
(but not all) major economic and policy shocks, proxied
by stock market swings, that triggered or reversed investor flight to safety—with gold standing out as a safe
asset, much like US Treasury notes. Crypto assets do not
seem to share this property, so far.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Global Manufacturing Downturn, Rising Tr ade Barriers

Box 1.SF.1. What’s Happening with Global Carbon Emissions?
To slow the pace of climate change, carbon emissions need to be reduced. But how have emissions
changed over the past decade? And which countries are
driving those changes? Although global carbon emissions were flat between 2014 and 2016, they alarmingly rebounded in 2017 and 2018 (Figure 1.SF.1.1).
China has been a key driver of emission growth
since the turn of the century, but its impact has
diminished in recent years as economic reforms have
picked up pace. India and other emerging markets,
instead, are partially filling the gap. In 2018 emissions
decreased in all Group of Seven economies besides the
United States, whose emissions increased because of a
resurgence of industrial production and bad weather
(see BP 2019).
The authors of this box are Christian Bogmans, Akito Matsumoto, and Andrea Pescatori.

Emissions, by Location

China
India

It is possible to decompose total emissions E as a
product of carbon intensity c (carbon emissions per
unit of energy), energy intensity e (energy per unit of
GDP), GDP per capita y, and human population P
(Kaya and Yokobori 1997):
Energy

GDP
E  ​   ​ _____ ​   ​ ____
_____
​E = ​ 
 ​  P = c * e * y * P​.
Energy * GDP * P

The contribution of income growth to the growth
of carbon emissions is larger, on average, and more
cyclical than that of population growth (Figure 1.
SF.1.2). Declining energy intensity has consistently
helped reduce emission growth, but in 2018 its
contribution was lower, possibly because of a cyclical
pickup in global industrial production. In 2018 decarbonization was the most important mitigation force
as wind, solar, and natural gas slowly replaced coal as
the energy source of choice in the power sectors of all
major emitters.

CLOSER TOGETHER OR FURTHER APART? WITHIN-COUNTRY REGIONAL
DISPARITIES AND ADJUSTMENT IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES

Subnational—within-country—regional disparities in real
output, employment, and productivity in advanced economies have attracted greater interest in recent years against
a backdrop of growing social and political tensions.
Regional disparities in the average advanced economy have
risen since the late 1980s, reflecting gains from economic
concentration in some regions and relative stagnation in
others. On average, lagging regions have worse health
outcomes, lower labor productivity, and greater employment shares in agriculture and industry sectors than other
within-country regions. Moreover, adjustment in lagging
regions is slower, with adverse shocks having longer-lived
negative effects on economic performance. Although
much discussed, trade shocks—in particular greater
import competition in external markets—do not appear to
drive the differences in labor market performance between
lagging and other regions, on average. By contrast, technology shocks—proxied by declines in the relative costs of
machinery and equipment capital goods—raise unemployment in regions that are more vulnerable to automation,
with more exposed lagging regions particularly hurt.
National policies that reduce distortions and encourage
more flexible and open markets, while providing a
robust social safety net, can facilitate regional adjustment
to adverse shocks, dampening rises in unemployment.
Place-based policies targeted at lagging regions may also
play a role, but they must be carefully calibrated to ensure
they help rather than hinder beneficial adjustment.

Introduction
Disparities in economic activity across subnational
regions in the average advanced economy have been
gradually creeping upward since the late 1980s,
undoing some of the marked decline over the previous
three decades and mirroring trends in overall income
inequality in many advanced economies (Figure 2.1,
The authors of this chapter are John Bluedorn (co-lead), Zsóka
Kóczán (co-lead), Weicheng Lian, Natalija Novta, and Yannick Timmer,
with support from Christopher Johns, Evgenia Pugacheva, Adrian
Robles Villamil, and Yuan Zeng. The chapter also benefited from
discussions with Philip Engler, Antonio Spilimbergo, and Jiaxiong Yao,
and from comments from internal seminar participants.

panel 1).1,2 Real GDP per capita in the advanced
economy region at the 90th percentile is now, on
average, 70 percent higher than that in the region
at the 10th percentile. Such a wide disparity means
that within-country regional differences in economic
activity in a number of advanced economies are larger
than the average differences between peer countries
(Figure 2.2). By contrast, average subnational regional
(simply regional hereafter) disparities in emerging
market economies have trended down since 2010,
after rising from the early 2000s (Figure 2.1, panel 3).
On average, though, they remain about double those
in advanced economies. In parallel, the average speed
of regional convergence in advanced economies has
slowed to less than one-half percent per year, while
picking up to more than 1 percent in emerging market
economies (Figure 2.1, panels 2 and 4).
Slowing regional convergence and rising disparities in some advanced economies, alongside regional
labor market and productivity developments, have
attracted much interest in recent years, in part because
of evidence that poor regional performance within a
country can fuel discontent and political polarization,
erode social trust, and threaten national cohesion.3
1For evidence on trends in overall income inequality in advanced
economies, see Dabla-Norris and others (2015); the October 2017
Fiscal Monitor; and Nolan, Richiardi, and Valenzuela (2019), among
others. Immervoll and Richardson (2011) argues that declining fiscal
redistribution accounts for some of this rise.
2Subnational regions are the TL2 regions as defined in OECD
(2018) unless otherwise indicated. These are typically the first-level
administrative units within a country, corresponding roughly to US
states or German Länder. Consequently, the geographic extents of
TL2 regions are not homogenous across or within countries. Alternative geographic aggregates (for example, higher resolution areal or
metropolitan aggregates or different administrative classifications)
may generate different findings. Subnational regional real GDP per
capita is purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted for cross-country
comparability, although not adjusted for within-country regional
price differences. Box 2.1 discusses some of the issues with measuring regional real GDP per capita and its link to welfare.
3See Algan and Cahuc (2014) and Guriev (2018) on social trust,
regional performance, and rising political polarization. Looking at
Europe, Winkler (2019) presents evidence that regional income
inequality engenders greater political polarization in regions. Rajan
(2019) argues that lack of attention to peripheral regions is fostering
despair and a backlash, destabilizing societies.

Figure 2.1. Subnational Regional Disparities and Convergence
over Time

Figure 2.2. Distribution of Subnational Regional Disparities in
Advanced Economies

Subnational regional disparities in the average advanced economy have risen over
the past three decades, while regional convergence has slowed. Disparities in
emerging market economies are typically larger but have been coming down,
while within-country average convergence has picked up.

Many advanced economies have larger within-country regional disparities than
exist between advanced economies.

More generally, a recurring theme in the latest economic research is that local conditions play an essential
role in shaping individual opportunities and social
mobility—in other words, place can be primal.4
Aside from their political and social ramifications, are disparities in regional economic activity
a macroeconomic concern? To be sure, increases in
4For example, see Chetty and Hendren (2018a, 2018b) on
how place-of-birth has profound and long-lasting effects on an
individual’s lifetime economic opportunities, even accounting for
family background and other influences. Durlauf and Seshadri
(2018) argues that causation flows from economic inequality to
lower social mobility, rather than the reverse. Drawing on other
evidence from the United States, Chetty, Hendren, and Katz (2016)
contends that geographic mobility is a key means by which social
mobility—improved lifetime incomes and opportunities—can be
achieved. See also Conolly, Corak, and Haeck (2019) for similar
analyses and evidence from Canada.

disparities between regions of a country can be a
normal feature of growth. Increasing specialization
and agglomeration—the phenomenon in which the
increasing spatial density of economic activity makes
trade and exchange more efficient—can boost productivity and lead to a greater concentration of economic
activity in some regions within a country, causing them
to pull away from others.5 Growth in core regions can
nonetheless eventually spread outward to peripheral
regions, generating catch-up.6
However, persistently large or increasing regional
disparities can also be a sign that some regions are not
adjusting to changing economic circumstances and are
falling behind. Failure to adjust to adverse shocks—
contributing to high regional unemployment and persistent shortfalls in productivity—could reflect barriers
to labor and capital moving to regions and firms where
their returns would be higher. Indeed, long-term unemployment rates tend to be higher in worse-performing
regions within advanced economies, suggesting some
persistent inefficiencies may be at work (Figure 2.3).
Consistent with the notion that regional disparities
can drive social and political discontent, lagging regions
in advanced economies—those failing to converge
toward richer regions of the same country over the past
couple of decades—tend to do worse than other regions,
on average, on key measures of well-being, including
health, human capital, and labor market outcomes
(Figure 2.4).7 The age profiles of populations in lagging
regions may explain part of their overall lower employment rate—lagging regions have significantly lower
5The underlying impetus for these dynamics may be simple
geography (less costly access to trading partners and inputs), natural
resource booms, or the persistent effects of historical factors. See
Krugman (1991), Davis and Weinstein (2002), Duranton and Puga
(2004), Moretti (2011), and Nunn (2014) for further discussion of
these mechanisms and drivers.
6See Coe, Kelly, and Yeung (2007) and WB (2009) for evidence
on these spillovers.
7Specifically, lagging regions are defined as those whose real GDP
per capita in 2000 was below the country’s regional median and
whose growth was slower than the country’s average from 2000–16.
Similar patterns for human capital and labor market outcomes also
hold if lagging regions are defined by predetermined criteria, such as
below median initial real GDP per capita and initial service sector
employment share. Nunn, Parsons, and Shambaugh (2018) finds that
US counties that had initially low human capital, were less diversified
in production, and were more dependent on manufacturing, had worse
health, income, and labor market outcomes. It is important to note
that the findings for lagging regions hold, on average; it is possible for a
given region to differ from that average behavior. Moreover, due to data
availability constraints, as noted, the classification is based on real GDP
per capita data from 2000–16. See Online Annex 2.1 for further details.

significantly younger (under age 25) than other regions.
But these demographic characteristics are not the complete story for lagging regions, as seen by their higher
overall unemployment rate and higher youth inactivity
rate (share of youth not in employment, education,
or training), on average. Given the importance of
employment status for life satisfaction, independent of
its effect on income, improving regional labor market
performance can generate welfare gains beyond those
that can be achieved through income redistribution.8
Motivated by these considerations and taking into
account the greater recent rise in disparities in advanced
economies alongside data availability constraints, this

adjustment in advanced economies, with a focus on the

the variables. Results are based on regressions of each variable on an indicator for
whether a region is lagging or not, controlling for country-year ﬁxed effects and
with standard errors clustered at the country-year level. Solid bars indicate that
the estimated coefﬁcient on the lagging indicator is statistically signiﬁcant at the

labor force that is unemployed. The long-term unemployment rate is the share of
the working-age labor force that has been unemployed for one year or more. The
youth unemployment rate is the share of the youth (ages 15–24) labor force that is

characteristics and dynamics of lagging regions since
2000. It also explores whether differences in national
policies related to labor and product market functioning
influence regional disparities and adjustment. Specifically, the chapter investigates the following questions:
•• How different are advanced economies in the extent
of their regional disparities in economic activity?
How do regional differences in sectoral production
account for variation in labor productivity across
regions within countries? How do lagging regions
compare with other regions in their sectoral mix of
employment and productivity? How effective have
lagging regions been in responding to trends in the
sectoral reallocation of labor?
•• What are the regional labor market effects of
local labor demand shocks—in particular trade
and technology shocks—in advanced economies?
Is adjustment to these shocks in lagging regions
different from that in other regions?
•• Do national policies and distortions play a role in
regional disparities and adjustment in advanced
economies?
The chapter’s main findings are the following:
•• The extent of regional disparities differs markedly
across advanced economies—with the 90/10 ratios
for regional real GDP per capita ranging from about
1.3 to more than 3. Underlying these disparities are
regional differences in sectoral labor productivities
and the sectoral employment mix, with lagging
regions, on average, being systematically less productive and more specialized in agriculture and industry.
oo Intrinsic sectoral productivity differences across
regions tend to drive most regional labor productivity differences within a country. But for lagging
regions, the employment mix matters more than
it does for other regions.
oo Even controlling for differences in trends across
countries, lagging regions’ employment is more
concentrated in agriculture (suggesting that some
are more rural) and industry, and less in services.
Moreover, labor productivity across sectors is systematically lower in lagging regions than in others.
oo From the early 2000s to the mid-2010s, one-third
of the increase in the overall labor productivity
gap between lagging and other regions appears
to have reflected relatively ineffective sectoral
labor market adjustment in lagging regions,
with the rest attributed to growing sectoral
productivity differences.

•• Adverse trade and technology shocks affect more
exposed regional labor markets, but only technology
shocks tend to have lasting effects, with even larger
unemployment rises for vulnerable lagging regions,
on average.
oo Increases in import competition in external
markets associated with the rise of China’s productivity do not have marked effects on regional
unemployment, although labor force participation
falls in the near term, but quickly abates. Conditions in lagging regions do not look very different
from other regions after such shocks.
oo By contrast, differences in vulnerability to automation across regions translate into noticeable differences in labor market responses to capital goods
prices. When machinery and equipment prices fall,
more vulnerable regions see more persistent rises in
unemployment and declines in labor force participation than do less vulnerable regions. More vulnerable
lagging regions have even larger rises in unemployment rates. Out-migration from more vulnerable
lagging regions also appears to drop, suggesting that
adjustment to technology shocks through labor
mobility may be weaker in lagging regions that are
more vulnerable to automation pressures.
•• National structural policies that encourage more
open and flexible markets are associated with
improved regional adjustment to shocks and a lower
dispersion of firms’ efficiencies in allocating capital,
which may narrow regional disparities.
oo Less stringent employment protection regulations
and less generous unemployment benefits are
associated with milder unemployment effects of
trade and technology shocks.
oo National policies that encourage more open and
flexible product markets are associated with lower
variability in firms’ capital allocative efficiencies,
which is associated with lower regional disparities.
This chapter documents patterns and associations between regional disparities and adjustment
and national policies in advanced economies. This
is intended to help inform debate and discussion,
complementing the vast literature examining regional
differences on a country-by-country basis.9 Much of
9For

a selection of work examining or leveraging regional economic differences in specific countries, see, for example, Kaufman,
Swagel, and Dunaway (2003) and Breau and Saillant (2016) on
Canadian provincial differences; Bande, Fernández, and Montuenga
(2008), IMF (2018), and Liu (2018) on Spanish regional differences;

the chapter’s analysis focuses on the relatively short
period since 2000 for which broad, cross-country
regional data are available, enabling a look at labor
market adjustment but precluding study of longer-term
regional development dynamics. Furthermore, regions
in the analysis are typically defined as countries’ firstlevel administrative units, which are economically and
politically meaningful within countries and for which
good data coverage is available (see also footnote 2).
However, this means that regions as diverse in size
as Texas and Rhode Island in the United States are
pooled together, despite the very different potential
extents of their within-region markets for adjustment.
Although the analysis attempts to account for this
diversity through the inclusion of a variety of controls,
alternative levels of geographic aggregation could generate different findings. Robustness checks are undertaken to confirm that the stylized facts and analysis
results hold excluding capital-intensive, resource-rich
regions. Finally, given that national policies may be
affected by many different variables, their estimated
effects on regional adjustment should be interpreted as
associational rather than causal.
Although regional differences in economic
activity and labor market outcomes are substantial within advanced economies, analysis of overall
household-level inequality in disposable incomes at
the country-level suggests that its regional component
is small (Figure 2.5; see also Box 2.1 for a discussion
of the measurement of regional economic activity and
welfare).10 For the subset of advanced economies and
years since 2008 for which the decomposition can
be calculated, the regional component of household
disposable income inequality ranges from less than
1 percent in Austria to about 15 percent in Italy. This
means that for advanced economies, further reducing
differences in average disposable income across regions
would typically have only moderate effects on income
inequality in a country. However, there are some
important exceptions. If, for example, average regional
differences were eliminated in Italy, its income inequality could drop to levels seen in the early 1990s, which
Felice (2011), Giordano and others (2015), and Boeri and others
(2019) on Italian regional differences.
10See Shorrocks and Wan (2005), Novotný (2007), and Cowell
(2011), which come to broadly similar conclusions with alternative personal income concepts and multiple decomposable
income inequality metrics. A similar finding holds using pretax
and pretransfer household income. Note that household disposable
income differs from GDP in that it incorporates factor income flows
to/from elsewhere and the effects of fiscal redistribution.

of regional disparities in advanced economies and how
lagging regions differ from others. Then, the regional
responses to local labor demand shocks arising from
trade and technology shocks are examined, focusing
on how lagging regions differ and how national labor
market policies may influence regional adjustment. The
chapter then presents some evidence on labor mobility
and the effects of national policies on regional disparities
in the effectiveness of factor reallocation. Finally, a summary and concluding thoughts consider the potential
implications for policies, including place-based policies.

Note: The overall index shown is the generalized entropy index, also known as
Theil’s L, or the mean log deviation index of inequality. The income measure used
is equivalized household disposable income (household income after tax and
transfers transformed to account for household size differences), by country in the
latest available year after 2008. The height of the bar indicates the overall level of
the income inequality index, which is then decomposed into two components: (1)
inequality attributable to average income differences across regions (the between
component), and (2) inequality attributable to income differences across
households within regions, after adjusting for average regional income differences
(the within component). The Gini index of income inequality is also shown for
comparison, as a more familiar inequality measure (but that is not decomposable).

were the lowest since the 1970s.11 But, as discussed
above, reducing regional disparities and improving
performance in economic activity and employment can
have important consequences beyond current income.
Moreover, some evidence indicates that countries with
larger regional disparities may experience lower longterm growth (Che and Spilimbergo 2012).
The chapter begins with a brief discussion of how
to think about regional development and adjustment.
The subsequent section presents evidence on patterns
11Based on the historical path of Italy’s Gini coefficient from
Atkinson and others (2017) and the assumption that the Gini would
decline in proportion to the decline in the mean log deviation or
generalized entropy index (Theil’s L; which is a decomposable income
inequality measure) if the regional component were eliminated.

70

As in the large body of literature on the drivers
of cross-country economic differences, the causes of
persistent regional disparities within countries are hotly
debated.12 However, unlike countries, regions within
a country are typically subject to the same overarching
institutional structure (both political and economic) and
common, national policies, with free exchange of goods
and services and no legal impediments to the movements of capital and labor across the country.13 Under
perfectly competitive output and input markets and no
market frictions (such as barriers to cross-regional factor
movements), capital and labor would flow within and
across regions to equalize marginal returns of capital and
12The

development accounting framework (Caselli 2005; Hsieh
and Klenow 2010) is often used to organize the potential drivers
of regional differences within a country into proximate (physical
capital, labor and human capital, and total factor productivity) and
other intermediate and ultimate determinants (such as policies,
culture, institutions, geography, climate, luck). Based on the analysis
of global samples, Acemoglu and Dell (2010) and Gennaioli and
others (2013, 2014) argue for the critical importance of human
capital for development. Lessmann and Seidel (2017) also points
to the importance of mobility and trade openness for regional
development. Hsieh and Moretti (2019) contends that economies
arising from regional agglomeration are substantial and that regional
zoning restrictions lowered US aggregate output growth by one-third
from the 1960s through the 2000s. Rodríguez-Pose and Storper
(2019) pushes back against Hsieh and Moretti’s (2019) contention,
arguing that housing price differences across regions are not the
primary drivers of regional migration. Rodríguez-Pose and Ketterer
(forthcoming) asserts that regional differences in governance quality
within-country lead to persistent differences in regional development
and performance. See also OECD (2016b; 2018) for further analysis
and evidence on broad patterns and drivers of persistent regional
disparities across a wide range of countries.
13There are exceptions—often in federal states—where free
exchange and movement within countries are inhibited. For example, Canadian provinces and territories differ in their standards and
regulations for some goods and services, de facto restricting interprovincial trade (Alvarez, Krznar, and Tombe 2019).

CLOSER TOGETHER OR FURTHER APART? Within-Country REGIONAL DISPARITIES AND ADJUSTMENT IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES

labor within a country, even if differences in regional
total factor productivity were persistent. For instance,
workers would move to regions with the highest returns
to labor, and hence wages, pushing down wages in
the destination region over time. At the same time,
lower labor supply in source regions where wages are
relatively low would, in turn, help raise wage rates there,
facilitating convergence of labor productivities.
Nonetheless, such an efficient allocation of factors
across regions can be consistent with differences in
regional real GDP per capita if, for example, labor
is differentiated by skill level.14 In practice though,
markets may be neither perfectly competitive nor
friction-free across regions, leading to diminished
efficiency, misallocation of factors across regions, and
hampered adjustment to shocks. Labor mobility may
be constrained or evident only among the highly
skilled, leading to more persistent regional unemployment in response to adverse shocks.15
The propensities for economic activity to cluster in
space (agglomeration economies) and for productivity to
rise with the density of skilled workers (human capital
externalities) can also generate divergence if differences
in production costs and the concentration of skills
across regions are large enough.16 Although these features may suggest the presence of market failures (that
is, inefficient barriers to regions growing even more
concentrated), their implications for optimal policies are
ambiguous.17 Overall social welfare could actually be
larger if lagging regions were given help to create their
own virtuous cycles of growing agglomeration economies, rather than be depopulated through population
shifts to leading regions. Given these ambiguities and
14For

example, if labor and human capital are differentiated (such
as high skill/low skill), then total factor productivity differences may
entail differences in the human capital composition of the workforce,
affecting output per worker. If technology differs across regions, this
may also lead to differences in output per worker across regions even
if marginal returns to factors are equalized.
15See Kim (2008) and Duranton and Venables (2018) for evidence and arguments.
16See Krugman and Venables (1995); Fujita, Krugman, and
Venables (1999); and Gennaioli and others (2013) on how increasing returns from agglomeration economies and human capital
externalities can manifest in spatial economic models.
17See Austin, Glaeser, and Summers (2018) for further discussion
of the ambiguous implications of agglomeration economies. As noted
earlier, Hsieh and Moretti (2019) argues that housing and zoning
restrictions present substantial barriers to beneficial agglomeration in
the United States, lowering welfare and increasing spatial wage dispersion. However, Giannone (2018) suggests that the bulk of the increase
in spatial wage dispersion in the United States over the past 40 years is
due to skill-biased technological change rather than agglomeration.

the more general difficulty of quantifying the relative
importance of efficient versus inefficient allocation in
driving regional disparities, the chapter focuses on lagging regions and their characteristics and adjustment.

Patterns of Regional Disparities in
Advanced Economies
The extent of regional disparities in economic activity
varies widely across advanced economies (Figure 2.6).
For example, Japan’s regional differences are relatively
narrow, with real GDP per capita of the region at the
90th percentile only about 30 percent higher than

that of the 10th percentile region. France has a similar
90/10 ratio, but with a notable better-performing
outlier region (centered on the capital Paris) that has
about double the real GDP per capita of the median
French region. The United States has a 90/10 ratio
which is about average for advanced economies, but it
also shows greater dispersion in the tails of the distribution, with even more extreme regional outcomes than
average (the District of Columbia’s regional real GDP
per capita is more than three times that of the median
US region, while Mississippi’s is about one-third lower
than the median). Among the advanced economies
with larger regional differences are Canada and Italy,
with 90/10 ratios at about 2.
Regional labor productivity—output per worker—is
closely related to regional real GDP per capita. A shiftshare analysis of regional labor productivity provides
insights into the relative importance of differences
in sectoral labor productivities, sectoral employment
shares, and the allocation of workers to more or less
productive sectors in accounting for regional disparities within a country (Figure 2.7).18 For most
advanced economies, the bulk of regional variation in
labor productivity appears to be due to sectoral labor
productivity differences across regions rather than the
sectoral employment mix—in other words, intrinsic
sectoral productivity differences across regions tend to
be the most important. However, Greece, Italy, Korea,
and Portugal are notable examples in which other
components explain the overall regional variation. In
these cases, simply reallocating regional employment
across sectors (holding sectoral productivity differences
constant) could substantially lower regional variability
in labor productivity.
The greater presence of lagging regions does not
appear to be systematically related to differences in the
drivers of regional variation across countries. About
20 percent of regions in advanced economies are classified as lagging, with the distribution differing across
countries. That said, analysis suggests that the sectoral
employment mix has been more influential in driving
regional differences for lagging regions compared to
others, consistent with the view that labor markets in
lagging regions may be reallocating employment across
sectors less effectively than other regions.19

Lagging regions also have significantly lower labor
productivities across sectors than do other regions
(Figure 2.8, panel 1). These range from about 5 percent
less in public services, to about 15 percent less in
industry and finance and professional services. This
lower productivity for lagging regions could reflect a
mix of poorer characteristics, such as lower human
capital—something highlighted as essential in much
work on regional development, including Acemoglu and
Dell 2010 and Gennaioli and others 2013, 2014—and
less efficient labor allocation across sectors. It may also
reflect poorer quality of complements to labor in lagging
regions, such as connective infrastructure, which has
been identified as important in development in some

studies (Allen and Arkolakis 2014; Donaldson and
Hornbeck 2016). Box 2.2 presents evidence that local
climate also plays a role, and that climate change may
exacerbate differences in productivity between lagging
and other regions in advanced economies.
In addition to being less productive, lagging
regions, on average, are also significantly likelier to
have employment more concentrated in agriculture
and industry than in services, including the high
productivity growth service sectors of information
technology and communications and finance
(Figure 2.8, panel 2). In other words, lagging
regions, on average, tend to be more rural and have
employment more reliant on sectors with lower
potential for productivity growth.20
A simple counterfactual exercise supports the view
that sectoral labor allocation plays an important role
in the relative performance of regions (Figure 2.9). In
advanced economies from 2002 to 2014, the average
labor productivity of lagging regions as a percentage
of the labor productivity of other regions declined
by about 5 percent, reflecting the evolution of both
sectoral labor productivities and employment shares.
If only sectoral labor productivity changes were operative, with no change in employment shares, the ratio
would still have declined, but by about one-third less
than it did. In other words, rather than mitigating the
relative decline in overall labor productivity for lagging
regions, the shift in sectoral labor allocation appears to
have exacerbated it.

performance may reflect differences in shocks and
responses to shocks, the chapter investigates the
effects of adverse local labor demand shocks on
regional unemployment and migration.21 If sectoral

Blanchard and Katz’s (1992) early work on US regional labor market
dynamics and convergence. Decressin and Fatás (1995) contrasts US
and European regional dynamics, finding less of a common component for employment and less migration in response to shocks in
Europe. More recently, Dao, Furceri, and Loungani (2017) updates
the analysis by Blanchard and Katz (1992) for the United States
with improved and more recent data, finding that labor mobility
has declined.

labor reallocation in a region functions effectively,
regional unemployment and participation should be
largely shielded from adverse shocks, while migration
flows and within-region sectoral employment shifts
to absorb them. The critical insight that regional
differences in the preexisting sectoral employment
mix translate into regional differences in exposure
to external shocks enables region-level shocks to be
constructed.22 Two particular types of local labor
demand shocks are considered. They attempt to

conceptualized and used by Bartik (1991), this insight
for the construction of plausibly exogenous regional shocks
based on preexisting regional differences in exposure to aggregate
drivers was then popularized in the field of regional development

Topalova (2010). Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin, and Swift (2019)
presents a critical evaluation of these kind of instruments.

capture some of the much-discussed drivers of trade
and technology:23
•• A shock from increased import competition in external
markets that is associated with the rise of China’s productivity (Autor, Dorn, and Hanson 2013a, 2013b).24
•• A shock based on the interaction between a region’s
vulnerability to automation and the costs of machinery and equipment capital goods (building upon
Autor and Dorn 2013; Chapter 3 of the April 2017
WEO; Das and Hilgenstock 2018; and Lian and
others 2019).
In general, the findings point to regional labor
markets having sluggish adjustment and reallocation in
response to negative shocks in advanced economies.25
Moreover, even though the incidence of these shocks is
actually somewhat lower for lagging than other regions
(see Online Annex 2.5), some evidence, detailed below,
suggests that lagging regions do suffer more in response
to some shocks.
Shocks from increasing import competition in external markets from China’s economic rise do not have
marked average effects on regional unemployment in a
broad sample of advanced economies, although they do
tend to reduce labor force participation after one year,
but this quickly abates (Figure 2.10). The responses of
23For recent work on the roles of trade and technology in driving
disparities and other trends, see Jaumotte, Lall, and Papageorgiou
(2013); Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014); Dabla-Norris and others
(2015); Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2015); Helpman (2016); Abdih
and Danninger (2017); Dao and others (2017); and Chapter 2 of
the April 2018 WEO, among others.
24Although the trade shock associated with China’s rising productivity has been well studied, it is by no means the only trade shock
for advanced economies. In general, advanced economies have faced
increasing competition as emerging market economies have become
more productive and engaged in international markets.
25See Online Annex 2.5 for further details on the construction of
the shocks and the regression model specification and estimation.
The dynamic responses of regional unemployment and labor force
participation rates, and inward and outward migration, are estimated
using the local projection method (Jordà 2005), controlling for
lagged regional real GDP per capita, lagged regional population
density (helping to capture the degree of urbanization), lagged
country real GDP per capita, and region-specific and year fixed
effects. Although the analysis controls for many regional characteristics through region-specific fixed effects (capturing time-invariant
characteristics of regions, including geography and membership in
a federation) and lagged regional real GDP per capita (proxying for
many aspects of regional development), unobserved time-varying
regional variables, such as the extent of cross-regional fiscal redistribution, may also impact adjustment and reallocation. The findings
therefore represent the average effects of the shocks within the
sample, given the existing distribution of unobservables. Changes in
the distribution of unobservables could entail changes in the effects
of the shocks.

lagging regions do not look very different from those of
other regions. This stands in contrast to recent literature
examining more highly localized labor markets in specific countries. For example, Autor, Dorn, and Hanson
(2013a) finds significant adverse local effects on employment for the United States from a similarly defined
shock. Applying a similar approach over a similar period,
Dauth, Findeisen, and Suedekum (2014) estimates an
overall positive net employment effect of the rise in trade

for Germany. These studies suggest that the regional
effects of trade may vary across countries. However, the
results presented here are not inconsistent with these
studies, given that they reflect the average regional effect
within countries for the group of advanced economies,
rather than country-specific responses. Moreover, the
analysis here is undertaken at a higher level of regional
aggregation and over a later period (post-1999).
By contrast, adverse shocks to local labor demand
arising from technological change have noticeable
and persistent effects on labor markets (Figure 2.11).
Although there is little sign of an impact effect, unemployment rates in regions more vulnerable to automation rise steadily over the following four years—a pattern
consistent with a gradual substitution of capital for
labor. The absence of much change in gross migration
flows over the near term indicates that labor mobility
across regions is low after automation shocks. For
lagging regions that are more vulnerable to automation,
the rise in unemployment rates is even larger and statistically significantly different from that of other regions.
Moreover, unlike other regions, more vulnerable lagging
regions see a persistent and statistically significant drop
in out-migration after an automation shock, suggesting that workers in these regions may find it harder to
move than if they were in other regions. Box 2.3 studies
the regional effects of automotive manufacturing plant
closures, which may ultimately be driven by trade or
technology shocks, finding similarly persistent increases
in unemployment, which tend to be worse in regions
where gross migration flows are lower.
Can national labor market policies and distortions
inhibit regional labor market adjustment? They
might if they contribute to more rigid regional labor
markets, leading adverse shocks to have more longlived effects on unemployment and participation.26
The following discussion examines how the calibration
of two national labor market policies—the stringency
of employment protection regulations and the generosity of unemployment insurance schemes—influence
regional labor market responses to local shocks. More
stringent employment protection regulation will tend
to reduce job destruction, dampening the likelihood
of layoffs, but also job creation and the hiring rate,
as employers recognize that new hires come with
the potential cost of more sluggish adjustment in
26An example of a national structural policy that alters the functioning of regional labor markets is presented in Boeri and others
(2019), which compares the regional effects of Italy’s and Germany’s
national collective bargaining systems.

Note: The blue and red solid lines plot the impulse responses of the indicated

machinery and equipment capital price growth for a region that experiences a one
standard deviation rise in its vulnerability to automation (Autor and Dorn 2013;
Lian and others 2019). Horizon 0 is the year of the shock. Lagging regions in a
country are deﬁned as those with real GDP per capita below the country’s regional
median in 2000 and with average growth below the country’s average over

downturns. Whether unemployment rises in response
to adverse shocks depends on which of these two
forces dominates, which is theoretically ambiguous
(Pissarides 2001). Unemployment insurance provides
security against income shocks from job loss, but can
also impact the dynamics of unemployment through
its impacts on an individual’s job search efforts and job
quality with reemployment (Chetty 2008; Tatsiramos
and van Ours 2014; Schmieder, von Wachter, and
Bender 2016).
76

Analysis suggests that national policies do matter
for regional labor market adjustment—they may
exacerbate or dampen adverse unemployment effects,
although their impact varies across outcomes and
shocks (Figure 2.12). Moreover, the findings should be
interpreted as associational, given that national policies
are only considered one-by-one, rather than jointly.
That means that the change in regional responses
associated with national employment protection and
unemployment benefits policies may incorporate the
influence of correlated national policies that are not
included in the analysis.
More stringent national employment protection
is associated with greater regional unemployment
effects from import competition and automation
shocks. Automation shocks are also associated with
higher unemployment in the near term, where
benefits are greater, suggesting that the incentive
effects of greater benefits do make unemployment
more persistent, although the difference vanishes at
longer horizons. Responses to import competition
shocks meanwhile show little difference between
more versus less generous unemployment benefit
regimes. The overall takeaway from these findings is
that national policies that encourage more flexible
labor markets may ease adjustment and reallocation
in regional labor markets, improving their resilience
to shocks.

Regional Labor Mobility and Factor Allocation:
Individual and Firm-Level Evidence
As noted, regional adjustment to shocks depends
on the effectiveness of factor reallocation—the ability
of capital and labor to move across sectors, firms,
and space, toward their most productive use. Where
factor mobility within and across regions is hampered
or reallocation ineffective, negative shocks may have
prolonged effects, contributing to poorer performance
in some regions and exacerbating disparities within
a country. This section examines differences in labor
mobility between lagging regions and others, the
characteristics of regional migrants, and the differences
across regions in the efficiency with which firms allocate capital—the sensitivity of their investments to the
marginal returns to capital.
Lagging regions, on average, have lower gross migration flows (inward or outward) than other regions.
This suggests that their labor reallocation mechanisms are less powerful, given that lagging regions are
actually less likely than other regions to experience

shocks (Figure 2.13, panel 1).27 The better educated
(either upper secondary or tertiary education) or
employed are more likely to move within countries
(Figure 2.13, panels 2 and 3). Those facts are consistent
with migration being more constrained in lagging regions,
where unemployment tends to be higher and education
and skills lower.
For another perspective on factor allocation across
regions within a country, differences in firms’ allocative efficiency across regions of a country are analyzed.
Allocative efficiency is measured at the firm level by the
responsiveness of their investment (capital growth) to the
firm’s marginal return on an additional unit of capital
(captured by the marginal revenue product of capital),
after accounting for a host of region-sector-country-year
differences. These firm-level estimates are then mapped to
the region-country-sector-year, enabling the construction
of their distribution across regions by country, sector,
and year. Analysis shows that greater variability in firms’
allocative efficiency across regions within a country—as
captured by the ratio of the standard deviation to the
mean allocative efficiency by country-sector-year—is
correlated with greater regional disparities in economic
activity. In essence, when regional differences in firms’
responsiveness to marginal returns to capital are large, the
spread in regional performance also tends to be wider.28
As with regional adjustment dynamics, national-level
structural policies and distortions may affect the variability in firms’ allocative efficiencies across regions of a
country by creating incentives for more or less efficient
firm choices. The analysis indicates that national
policies that support greater flexibility and openness in
product markets are associated with lower variability of
firms’ allocative efficiency across regions of a country
(Figure 2.14). In particular, countries with less stringent product market regulation (related to the level of
protection for incumbent firms), lower administrative
costs for starting a business, and greater trade openness, are all associated with lower variability in capital
allocative efficiency across regions. These associations
might reflect the selective effects of more competitive
and contestable markets on firms, pushing allocative
efficiency across regions closer together, and of the
beneficial effects of greater flexibility for factors to be
reallocated by individual firms and also across firms.
27See Online Annex 2.5 for further details on the incidence of
import competition from China and automation shocks for lagging
versus other regions.
28See Online Annex 2.6 for further details on the construction of
the measure. The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of a
distribution is also known as the coefficient of variation.

The regional dimension of economic performance
has generated much interest in recent years, reflecting
the perception that increasing regional differences in
growth and employment opportunities in advanced
economies are stoking social unease and distrust, as
some regions and peoples are left behind. The chapter
shows that while there is a grain of truth in these
contentions, the size and scope of regional disparities
differs markedly across economies. Regional disparities
are closely associated with differences in the sectoral
composition of employment and levels of sectoral productivity. Lagging regions of a country are more likely
to have lower labor productivity across sectors and
to be more concentrated in agriculture and industry
than in services (and particularly high productivity
growth service sectors, such as information technology

and communications). They also tend to have
smaller populations of prime-age workers than other
regions, which may contribute further to their poorer
productivity performance (Feyrer 2007; Adler and
others 2017).
Regional adjustment to adverse local labor demand
shocks generally takes time and is associated with
higher unemployment, reflecting frictions in shifting production and employment across sectors and
labor mobility. Lagging regions do not appear more
likely to be hit by these shocks, but they do appear to
suffer more in response to some—in particular shocks
related to differences in exposure to technological
changes—suggesting that adjustment mechanisms
in lagging regions may be more obstructed than in
other regions.
How might policies reduce these disparities and
promote improved regional adjustment? The analyses
here and in earlier literature suggest several possible
actions. As noted earlier, the consensus is that human
capital plays a pivotal role in driving regional development. Boosting educational and training quality and
opportunities where there are gaps, as well as introducing more broad-based educational reforms to improve
learning outcomes and adapt to the changing world of
work, would disproportionately benefit lagging regions
(see also Coady and Dizioli 2017 and WB 2018,
2019a). Similarly, deploying more active labor market
policies to create jobs, retrain the displaced, and find
new job matches for the unemployed could also help
lift lagging regions and ease adjustment. However,
the design of active labor market policies matters
enormously for their success. They must be carefully
tailored to address the labor market failures specific to
a region’s context and assessed and improved regularly
(Card, Kluve, and Weber 2018).
National labor and product market policies and
distortions also affect regional adjustment and factor
reallocation (Dabla-Norris and others 2015; Boeri and
others 2019). Evidence presented here suggests that
the appropriate calibration of employment protection
regulations and unemployment insurance regimes can

facilitate regional labor market adjustment, dampening the unemployment effects of adverse shocks.
Greater flexibility can also be helpfully accompanied
by stronger retraining and other forms of job assistance to help ensure displaced workers achieve any
necessary reskilling and reemployment rapidly (Aiyar
and others 2019).29 Product markets that are more
open—through lower barriers to entry and greater
trade openness—are associated with lower variability
in the capital allocative efficiencies of firms across
the regions of a country, which is in turn associated
with lower regional disparities. More competitive
markets within a country are associated with greater
efficiency in the reallocation of capital, both in and
across regions.
Although not a focus of the analysis here owing
to data constraints, spatially targeted, place-based
fiscal policies and investments may also help lagging
regions, but only when need is spatially concentrated
and individual-level targeting has been less effective
(Box 2.4 explores place-based policies and offers more
in-depth discussion). There is evidence that greater
fiscal decentralization, which effectively enables more
spatially differentiated policies, may also help reduce
regional disparities (Lessmann 2009; Kappeler and
others 2013; Blöchliger, Bartolini, and Stossberg
2016). Austin, Glaeser, and Summers (2018) argues
that explicit spatial targeting may also be justified
if some regions are more sensitive to fiscal interventions than others—for example, if an area has greater
labor market slack because local demand conditions
are depressed. However, place-based policies must be
carefully designed to ensure that beneficial adjustment is encouraged rather than resisted (Kline and
Moretti 2014) and to avoid interfering with the
continued success of leading regions (Barca, McCann,
and Rodríguez-Pose 2012; Pike, Rodríguez-Pose, and
Tomaney 2017; Rodríguez-Pose 2018).
29For example, see the Danish model of “flexicurity,” which
accompanies great flexibility in hiring and firing, with retraining,
job matching, and unemployment benefits that are subject to strong
monitoring and conditionality (OECD 2016a).

Although real GDP per capita has many shortcomings as a measure of individual well-being and social
welfare, it remains a touchstone in much economic
analysis and cross-country comparisons.1 Recent
research suggests that it is also still useful as a broad
metric for cross-country comparisons, finding it
highly correlated for a large set of indicators based on
various aspects of human welfare (including subjective well-being, mortality, inequality, and leisure).2
However, in the case of within-country regional
comparisons, two issues arise that can complicate the
welfare interpretation of patterns of real GDP per
capita—regional price or cost-of-living differences and
the effects on personal income of fiscal redistribution
and income flows to and from elsewhere.
Although real GDP per capita is typically corrected
for average cross-country differences in cost-of-living
(purchasing power parity adjustments), regional
differences in the cost-of-living are often not fully
reflected in regional real GDP per capita measures,
largely because regional price indexes are not broadly
available.3 Gennaioli and others (2014) attempts to
correct for this for a subset of countries in its global
data set, using housing cost differences as a proxy
for the cost of living. The study finds that, although
the size of regional disparities fell, they remained
substantial. Gbohoui, Lam, and Lledo (2019)
undertakes a similar calculation using more recent
data. As shown in Figure 2.1.1, it also finds that
regional disparities (as captured by the ratio of real
GDP per capita in the 75th to the 25th percentile
region within-country) narrowed with the correction,
but remained significant, with the ratio going from
1.34 to 1.26, on average. Hence, although regional
price differences are part of the picture, they do
not account for all regional disparities in economic
activity.

over a given period (UN 2009). It is not a measure
of an individual’s or household’s income available
for their consumption and investment, which would
be a more direct measure of welfare. This is more
properly captured by disposable income—the sum
of labor compensation and investment income after
taxes and transfers.4 Given that disposable income
incorporates income streams from elsewhere, such as
capital income from geographically diversified portfolios, it can better capture interregional risk sharing
and result in narrower regional disparities.5 Fiscal

redistribution through taxes and transfers within
and across regions can provide a further channel for
narrowing income differences across regions.6 For
the limited countries and years for which data on
regional disposable income per capita are available,
regional differences are smaller than they are as measured by real GDP per capita differences, but again,
can be substantial (OECD 2018). For example, the
top income regions in the United States had average

disposable income per capita more than 50 percent
higher than the national average.
With its wider availability across time and
countries, regional real GDP per capita remains the
best measure for assessing the extent and evolution
of regional differences in economic activity. However,
recognizing its drawbacks as a measure of welfare and
motivated by the extensive evidence on the pivotal
role of employment in individual’s life satisfaction,
the chapter’s analysis focuses more on regional
labor market outcomes and adjustment, paralleling
some of the latest research (Austin, Glaeser, and
Summers 2018).

sector. In contrast, because the median non-lagging
region is at 10.5°C, an increase in average annual temperature by 1°C would raise productivity in the service
sector, lower it in the industry sector, and have no
statistically significant effect on the agriculture sector.

Percent change in labor productivity

Climate change may further exacerbate subnational
regional disparities in many advanced economies
by the end of the 21st century. This conclusion is
based on two findings. First, estimates of the effect of
temperature increases on sectoral labor productivity—
agriculture, industry, and services—at the subnational
level indicate that agriculture and industry are likely to
suffer, even in advanced economies. Second, because
lagging regions tend to specialize in agriculture and
industry (see Figure 2.9), the negative effect of global
warming on labor productivity may be larger in
lagging regions, therefore pushing them to fall behind
even more by the end of the 21st century.1
Analysis at the country-level, presented in Chapter 3
of the October 2017 World Economic Outlook, already
establishes that a 1.0°C increase in temperature
lowers labor productivity in heat-exposed industries
(mostly agriculture and industry), while there is no
negative effect on non-heat-exposed industries (mostly
services).2 It also shows little adaptation to climate
change, except in advanced economies. Because the
analysis in this box focuses only on the advanced
economies, which have already invested in climate
adaptation, any negative effects uncovered here are
likely to be at the lower bound of estimates in a
global sample.
In general, temperature has a nonlinear effect on
economic activity—in very cold regions, warming may
bring economic benefits. Beyond a certain “optimal”
level, temperature increases hurt economic output
and labor productivity. However, there is significant
heterogeneity in the relationship between temperature
and labor productivity across sectors, as Figure 2.2.1
demonstrates.3 For example, for a median lagging
region, which has an average annual temperature of
12°C in this sample, an increase in temperature by
1°C would reduce labor productivity in the agriculture
and industry sectors and have no effect on the service

Because temperature has a nonlinear effect, its marginal
effect is shown at each level of regional average annual
temperature. The baseline speciﬁcation mirrors that of
Chapter 3 of the October 2017 World Economic Outlook but
is reestimated in a sample of subnational regions within
advanced economies with a population of at least a quarter
million. The industry sector includes industry, manufacturing,
and construction from the OECD classiﬁcation (ISIC Revision
4). Sectoral labor productivity is deﬁned as sectoral gross
value added divided by the number of employees in that
sector. The dependent variable is the growth of sectoral
labor productivity, and it is regressed on average annual
population-weighted temperature, temperature squared,
precipitation, and precipitation squared, controlling for
one-year lags of all the climate variables, a lag of the
dependent variable and subnational regional ﬁxed effects.

CLOSER TOGETHER OR FURTHER APART? Within-Country REGIONAL DISPARITIES AND ADJUSTMENT IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES

Box 2.2 (continued)
Given these findings, it is not surprising that
lagging (warmer) regions might be expected to fall
further behind in the coming decades. In the early
2000s, labor productivity in lagging regions was, on
average, at about 85 percent of that in other regions
(Figure 2.9). Under an unmitigated climate change
scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway
(RCP) 8.5),4 labor productivity in lagging regions
could fall by about 2–3 percentage points in Italy,
Spain, and the United States by 2100 (Figure 2.2.2).
This is similar to the decline in relative labor productivity of the lagging regions between 2002 and 2014
(Figure 2.9). Under a milder scenario, which assumes
emissions peaking around 2050 (RCP 4.5), the
decline in labor productivity of lagging regions would
be smaller, at about 1.5 percentage points.
Historical weather patterns may have already
contributed to some regions falling behind. An
increase in a region’s average annual temperature by
1°C increases the probability of being lagging by about
2 percentage points or about 10 percent relative to
the baseline likelihood of about 20 percent, even after
controlling for country-year fixed effects. This means
that a hypothetical move from the coolest to the
warmest region within a country, which have a median
temperature difference of about 5.5°C, is associated
with about an 11 percentage point higher chance of
being lagging.
Finally, it is important to note that, even though
climate change is a relatively slow process, it is very
persistent and its negative effects have historically
been extremely hard to eliminate. Therefore, even
the seemingly small absolute effects demonstrated
here should be a cause for concern, especially because
they appear in the context of advanced economies
that are relatively well-adapted and tend to have
temperate climates.

Box 2.3. The Persistent Effects of Local Shocks: The Case of Automotive Manufacturing Plant Closures
The declining share of manufacturing jobs in overall
employment over the past decades has attracted attention in recent years due to concerns that manufacturing might play a role as a catalyst for productivity
growth and income convergence and be a source of
well-paid jobs for less-skilled workers (Chapter 3
of the April 2018 World Economic Outlook presents
in-depth analysis of this contention). Factory closures
have accompanied this trend, with job losses sometimes concentrated in particular regions within countries. A large literature exists on the local labor market
impacts of factory closures, with most early studies
focused on closures affecting heavy industry, such as
coal, steel, and shipbuilding.1 In more recent years,
the effects of automotive manufacturing plant closures
have become the focus of more studies, although
most examine the effects for a single country or of a
specific closure.2
With these in mind, this box looks at the impact
of automotive manufacturing plant closures—events
caused by forces originating outside the immediate
region—on the regional labor markets for a sample
of six advanced economies for which historical data
on automotive factory closures are available.3 The
box compares unemployment rates in regions that
experienced car factory closures during 2000–16 and
in regions in the same country that did not experience
such shocks. If regions of a country were adept at reallocating labor and capital, they could absorb shocks,
including permanent shocks, and show no persistent
effects on local activity and employment and little
difference between the two groups of regions.
The analysis suggests that regions that experienced
car factory closures typically had bigger increases
in unemployment rates after the closures than
comparator regions in the same countries, with the
difference being statistically significant. Regressing
regional unemployment rates on a dummy variable

Box 2.3 (continued)
To examine the role of migration, the regressions in
this study are repeated separately for regions with high
and low gross migration flows. The persistent unemployment effects are driven by regions with low gross
migration flows. The negative effects of closures are
not statistically significant in regions with high gross
migration flows (Figure 2.3.1, high and low migration
subsamples). The highly persistent effects of permanent automotive factory closures are consistent with
adjustment being stuck in some regions, particularly

those where mobility is low, potentially due to the
more constrained and selective nature of migration.5
Endogenous local demand effects and expectations
about the future development of a place hit by
factory closures could further reinforce the effects of
such local shocks, exacerbating regional disparities
within countries.

Box 2.4. Place-Based Policies: Rethinking Fiscal Policies to Tackle Inequalities within Countries
Policymakers deploy a variety of tools to reduce
economic inequality, including fiscal redistribution
through taxes and transfers and growth-friendly policies to improve education, health care, infrastructure,
and affordable housing (October 2017 Fiscal Monitor).
Most national policies have been spatially blind,
targeting individuals based on their circumstances and
characteristics, regardless of their residency. Examples
of such policy measures include national disability
and unemployment payments in the United States
and unemployment benefits in France and Spain,
which are targeted to individuals in need or who are
unemployed, irrespective of their location. However,
persistent and growing regional economic disparities in
some countries have increased interest in place-based
or spatially targeted fiscal policies as a further way to
tackle inequality.
Place-based policies intend to promote regional
equity and inclusive growth and to insure against
region-specific shocks (Kim and Dougherty 2018).
Examples of such policies include the European
Union’s Regional Development Funds that support
naturally disadvantaged (remote, less-developed,
or disaster-stricken) subnational regions; Canada’s
Regional Development Agencies, which provide
support to diversify regional economies and foster
community development; and US enterprise zones,

which provide tax credits to generate new jobs and
investment. As shown in Table 2.4.1, spatially targeted
interventions can differ according to their proximate
objectives, spatial coverage, and fiscal instruments. The
decision on what to use will depend on the nature of
the underlying regional issues.
Place-based policies can boost the success of existing
fiscal policies in reducing inequality if (1) the intended
recipients, such as low-income households or the
unemployed, are geographically concentrated; and
(2) traditional nationwide means-testing approaches
have limited coverage, are less progressive, or are difficult to enforce (Coady, Grosh, and Hoddinott 2004;
October 2017 Fiscal Monitor).1 Place-based policies
may also have merit if fiscal interventions are expected
to have stronger impacts on the disadvantaged in certain regions, for example, in the case of hiring incentives that might be more effective in creating jobs and
growth in regions with higher unemployment rates
(Austin, Glaeser, and Summers 2018). Place-based
policies should ensure that interventions facilitate
convergence and sectoral reallocation in response to
shocks, rather than create new barriers. But policymakers should also be mindful that such policies may
raise horizontal equity concerns, as individuals with
1Limited coverage refers to the fact that, in most countries,
only a portion of the households that meet the criteria to receive
a transfer (for example, means-tested) actually receive the transfer. Coverage is calculated as the percent of eligible households
that in fact receive the transfer.

the same status, but living in different regions, may
receive different treatment.
Drawing on individual household income surveys
for a selected sample of countries, illustrative simulations suggest that combining spatial targeting with
conventional means-testing programs could improve
the effectiveness of fiscal redistribution—as captured
by the size of the decline in income inequality—by
7–10 percent, without increasing fiscal costs (see
Figure 2.4.1 and Gbohoui, Lam, and Lledo 2019 for
further details). For example, because France and the
United Kingdom have highly progressive social safety
nets and are successful at reaching a high percentage
of households eligible for transfers, the potential gains
from spatial targeting are relatively small (at about
7–8 percent). But improvements are larger (about
10 percent) in the United States, where poorer households are more concentrated in lagging regions and a
higher percentage of eligible households end up not
receiving transfers (that is, coverage is worse).
When designing and implementing place-based
policies, it is important to assign responsibilities to the appropriate level of government. The
choice should be sensitive to intergovernmental
fiscal arrangements within a country (for example, a unitary or federal state) and the associated
revenue-raising capacity and scope for intergovernmental transfers. As a general principle, the central
government should take the lead on overall policy
design and monitoring, given that it can account for
possible externalities and spillovers across states and
provinces. Subnational governments could be more
involved in the implementation, as they are more
attuned to local needs and preferences. For example, in federal or highly decentralized countries,
such as the United States, subnational governments
have greater autonomy to determine income and
property tax rates, and spending on education and
health care.

means-testing can enhance the coverage at the same ﬁscal
cost. The ﬁscal redistribution effect is deﬁned as the
difference in nationwide income inequality (Gini coefﬁcient)
before and after taxes and transfers, and is calculated
separately for conventional and spatially targeted
means-tested transfers. The improvement is calculated as
the difference in Gini reduction, expressed as a percentage

transfers.

REIGNITING GROWTH IN LOW-INCOME AND EMERGING MARKET
ECONOMIES: WHAT ROLE CAN STRUCTURAL REFORMS PLAY?

The pace of structural reforms in emerging market and
developing economies was strong during the 1990s,
but it has slowed since the early 2000s. Using a newly
constructed database on structural reforms, this chapter
finds that a reform push in such areas as governance,
domestic and external finance, trade, and labor and
product markets could deliver sizable output gains in
the medium term. A major and comprehensive reform
package might double the speed of convergence of the
average emerging market and developing economy to the
living standards of advanced economies, raising annual
GDP growth by about 1 percentage point for some
time. At the same time, reforms take several years to
deliver, and some of them—easing job protection regulation and liberalizing domestic finance—may entail
greater short-term costs when carried out in bad times;
these are best implemented under favorable economic
conditions and early in authorities’ electoral mandate.
Reform gains also tend to be larger when governance
and access to credit—two binding constraints on
growth—are strong, and where labor market informality
is higher—because reforms help reduce it. These findings
underscore the importance of carefully tailoring reforms
to country circumstances to maximize their benefits.

Introduction
Emerging market and developing economies have
enjoyed good growth over the past two decades.
Living standards have been converging toward those
in advanced economies at a fast pace in the aggregate.
However, for many countries, the speed of income
convergence remains modest. The typical (median)
emerging market has been closing its (purchasing-­
power-parity-adjusted) income per capita gap with the

United States by about 1.3 percent a year since the
2008 financial crisis, while the equivalent speed for a
typical low-income developing country is 0.7 percent
(Figure 3.1). At these rates, it would take more than
50 years for a typical emerging market economy, and
90 years for a typical low-income developing country,
to close half of their current gaps in living standards.
Furthermore, convergence has been highly heterogeneous; while some countries have been converging fast
(mostly Asian economies and, during the 2000s, some
commodity producers), others have stagnated or—in
the case of almost a quarter of economies—even
diverged. For the latter, disasters (crises, wars, disease
outbreaks, extreme climatic events) played a role in
some cases, but there is also broader concern about
weak underlying trends in income per capita growth.
Subdued and uneven growth, concerns about policies
and growth prospects in advanced economies—a key
driver of growth in emerging market and developing economies (April 2017 World Economic Outlook
(WEO)), waning chances of a new commodity price
boom, and shrinking macroeconomic—primarily fiscal
policy (April 2019 Fiscal Monitor)—space have revived
emerging market and developing economy policymakers’ interest in structural reforms. There is also a sense
that reform efforts waned after the liberalization wave
that followed the economic crises of the 1990s, leaving
much scope for improving the functioning of (financial,
labor, product) markets and for improving the quality
of other government-influenced drivers of economic
growth—such as education, health care, and infrastructure. In some areas, such as, for example, labor markets,
automation and globalization put existing regulations
that protect jobs rather than workers under pressure,
further strengthening the case for reform.
At the same time, broad uncertainty surrounds the
potential scope for, and gains to be reaped from, structural reforms in emerging market and developing economies. Individual countries’ experience with reforms
have been mixed.1 Some prominent reformers over one

of pervasive microeconomic distortions that have
encouraged informality (Levy 2018). In other cases,
it may be that reform gains were negated by adverse
events, such as macroeconomic shocks or misguided
policies. Examples include the exchange rate overvaluation and the collapse of the currency board in the

REIGNITING GROWTH IN LOW-INCOME AND EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES: WHAT ROLE can STRUCTURAL REFORMS Play?

early 2000s in Argentina—which also led to a reversal
of earlier reforms; the 2016 recession driven by the
decline in global oil prices, delayed policy adjustment
and oil production disruptions in Nigeria; and the hit
from the 1997 Asian crisis in the Philippines, which
then recovered quickly and grew rapidly beginning
in the early 2000s. Macroeconomic shocks can entail
persistent or even permanent income losses (Cerra
and Saxena 2008), especially when their impact is
amplified by specific macroeconomic and structural
vulnerabilities (for example, high public debt mostly
denominated in foreign currency, or an unsustainable
exchange rate peg). This underscores the importance—
and difficulty—of disentangling the effects of reforms
from those of other drivers of economic growth, such
as macroeconomic shocks and policies.
Mixed experience with past reforms could also
reflect a given reform’s different effects across countries,
depending on their specific characteristics. In particular, reforms may pay off only if strong core institutions
are in place (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2005).
Key among these may be laws and institutions that
deliver strong governance; for example, reducing border or behind-the-border barriers to competition may
not lead to much new firm entry, innovation, and productivity growth if property rights are not well defined
and enforced or incumbent domestic firms continue to
benefit from tacit government support. More broadly,
given the many market imperfections in most emerging market and developing economies, addressing one
may not necessarily help the economy if other market
distortions are not remedied (Hausmann, Rodrik, and
Velasco 2005). For example, opening up the capital
account may trigger fickle and poorly allocated capital
inflows if the domestic financial system is insufficiently
developed, regulated, and supervised to mediate these
inflows safely, and so weakens the benefits from capital
flow liberalization. Likewise, raising female labor supply through support for childcare or stronger legal protections against discrimination may not fully translate
into formal employment gains if labor market institutions, such as stringent job protection legislation for
formal workers, make firms less willing to hire. This
points to the need to uncover some of the important
factors that may account for cross-country differences
in the impact of reforms.
A more practical difficulty in assessing the case for
structural reforms is the lack of recent comprehensive
data and analysis. Although information on structural
policies is up to date for selected areas (for example,

governance or the cost of doing business, as assessed in
Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2010 and WB 2019),
and for a broader range of areas for a few larger emerging
market economies (for example, OECD 2018), comprehensive cross-country time-series information is lacking.
Partly reflecting these data limitations, there has also
been little recent cross-country evidence regarding the
growth impact of past reforms, with some exceptions,
including earlier IMF work based on indicators constructed in the late 2000s (Christiansen, Schindler, and
Tressel 2013; Prati, Onorato, and Papageorgiou 2013).
To assess the macroeconomic effects of structural
reforms, this chapter builds on a new IMF reform data
set covering regulations for many emerging market
economies and low-income developing countries
during 1973–2014 in five areas (Alesina and others,
forthcoming): trade (tariffs); domestic finance (credit and
interest rate controls, entry barriers, public ownership,
quality of supervision in the domestic financial system);
external finance (capital account openness, encompassing
regulations governing international transactions); labor
market regulation (stringency of job protection legislation); and product market regulation (stringency of
regulations and public ownership in two large network
industries—namely, electricity and telecommunications).
These new data are supplemented by the World Governance Indicators (Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi
2010).2 The growth impact of regulatory changes in each
of the six areas is then explored through empirical analysis, supplemented by model-based analysis that provides
alternative quantification of the impact of reforms and
sheds light on the channels through which they affect the
economy, including the role of informality. Specifically,
the chapter tackles the following questions:
•• How has structural reform progress evolved over
the past couple of decades? Has the pace of reform
slowed in emerging market and developing economies in recent years? What is the remaining scope
for reform, and how does it vary across regulatory
areas and countries?
•• What are the short- to medium-term effects of
reforms on economic activity? To what extent could
such reforms speed up the convergence of emerging market economies and low-income developing
countries to living standards in advanced economies?
2While

the database covers 90 economies around the world,
the analysis in this chapter excludes those classified as advanced
economies at the beginning of the sample; as such, it covers the
41 current emerging markets, seven former emerging markets, and
20 low-income developing countries.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Global Manufacturing Downturn, Rising Tr ade Barriers

•• What are the channels through which reforms
affect the economy? For example, do reforms affect
primarily productivity or employment? How do they
affect informality, which is often associated with
poor firm productivity?
•• When should reforms be implemented? Do they pay
off less, or more, in bad times?
•• Do the effects of reforms vary across economies,
and, if so, why? Are there particular reforms that
could magnify the gains from others? More broadly,
should reforms be implemented as packages, or
should policymakers focus on the most binding
constraint(s) to growth and, if so, which one(s)?
In addressing these questions, the chapter reaches
the following conclusions:
•• After the major liberalization waves of the late
1980s and the 1990s, reform in emerging market
and developing economies slowed in the 2000s.
Although this reflects in part gradual narrowing
of the scope for further deregulation, there is still
ample room for a renewed reform push, particularly
in low-income developing countries—notably, across
sub-Saharan Africa and, to a lesser extent, in the
Middle East and North Africa and Asia and Pacific
regions.
•• Reforms can yield sizable payoffs in the medium
term, even though gains vary across different types
of regulations. For the average emerging market
and developing economy, empirical analysis suggests that major simultaneous reforms across all six
areas considered in this chapter could raise output
by more than 7 percent over a six-year period. This
would increase annual GDP growth by more than
1 percentage point and double the average current
speed of income-per-capita convergence to advanced
economy levels from about 1 percent to more than
2 percent. Model-based analysis points to output
gains about twice as large in the longer term.
•• Reducing informality, which helps boost firms’
productivity and capital investment, is one important channel through which reforms raise output.
Given that reforms facilitate formalization, they tend
to pay off more in countries where informality is
higher, all else equal to start with.
•• However, reforms generally take time to deliver. It
typically takes at least three years for significant positive effects on output to materialize, although some
reforms—such as product market deregulation—pay
off more quickly. Possibly reflecting this delay, the
96

political cost of reform—in the executive power’s
electoral prospects—is lowest when measures are
enacted early in the government’s political mandate.
•• The timing of reform matters—some reforms are
best implemented in good times. In normal times,
the reforms studied in this chapter are not found to
entail short-term macroeconomic costs. However,
when macroeconomic conditions are weak, easing
job protection legislation or deregulating domestic finance does not pay off and may even lower
employment and output in the short term, possibly
because stimulating labor or credit supply fails to
elicit much response when the demand for labor or
credit is depressed.
•• Getting reform packaging and sequencing right can
also make a difference. Reforms typically deliver
larger gains in countries where governance is stronger. This means that strengthening governance can
support economic growth and income convergence,
not just directly by incentivizing more productive
formal firms to invest and recruit, but also indirectly
by magnifying the payoff from reforms in other
areas. Therefore, there are advantages to combining
trade, financial, labor, and product market reforms
with, or implementing them after, concrete actions
to improve governance. Such concrete actions
include streamlined and transparent public spending
and tax administration procedures and stronger protection and enforcement of property and contractual
rights, for example. Reforms that incentivize formal
firms to grow—such as lower administrative burdens
or easier labor regulations—also tend to work better
when there is better access to credit, which makes
it possible for firms to expand. This underscores
the importance of domestic finance liberalization,
supported by a strong regulatory and supervisory
framework. More broadly, identifying binding
constraints on growth and specific reform complementarities is key.
Three other important issues that go beyond the
scope of this analysis should be borne in mind when
considering, prioritizing, and designing reforms.
First, this chapter considers reforms essentially aimed
at improving the functioning of (financial, labor,
product) markets. It ignores others that seek, instead,
to directly facilitate the accumulation of productive
factors—physical and human capital and labor. Key
reforms in this regard involve improving education
and health systems, public infrastructure spending

f­rameworks, and laws and regulations that obstruct
women’s participation in the labor force. Second, in
the long term, reforms could entail larger gains than
found here by (1) enabling economies to be not just
more efficient but also more innovative, leading to
more persistent effects on economic growth, and (2)
enhancing the reforming economies’ resilience to,
and thereby alleviating permanent output losses from,
economic and financial crises (Aiyar and others 2019).
Third, policymakers should factor in and implement
up-front complementary reforms to mitigate any
adverse effects of reforms on income distribution.
Absent any redistribution through the tax-benefit
system, some of the reforms considered in this chapter
might yield highly uneven gains across the population
(Fabrizio and others 2017; Furceri, Loungani, and
Ostry, forthcoming). Tackling inequality issues is an
important policy objective, but it also matters for the
ultimate impact of reform on economic growth (Ostry,
Berg, and Kothari 2018). The poor have fewer opportunities for education and less financial access and
therefore are less likely to reap the benefits of market
reform. More fundamentally, reforms whose gains are
captured only by a small fraction of society risk losing
support and stalling, or being undone, down the road
(Alesina and others, forthcoming).
The next section examines reform patterns in
emerging market and developing economies over the
past four decades. It also identifies remaining scope
for reform and existing differences across geographic
regions and countries. The subsequent section analyzes
the effects of reforms on growth and the channels
through which they materialize. After that, the investigation turns to the drivers of differences in the effects
of reforms across countries and over time. In particular, it looks at whether the effects of reforms vary
depending on business conditions and explores reform
complementarities. The final section discusses the main
takeaways and policy implications.

Structural Policy and Reform Patterns in
Emerging Market and Developing Economies
This chapter relies on a new IMF database on
economic regulations that identifies structural policies and reforms in trade (tariffs), domestic finance
(regulation and supervision), external finance (capital
account openness), labor market regulation (job protection legislation), and product market regulation (in
electricity and telecommunications, two large network

industries) in 90 advanced and emerging market and
developing economies—of which 48 are current and
former emerging markets and 20 are low-income
developing countries—during 1973–2014 (see Online
Annex 3.1 for details about the indicators and country coverage). The database was compiled through
a systematic reading and coding of policy actions documented in various sources, including national laws and
regulations as well as in IMF staff reports (for more
details see Alesina and others, forthcoming). While the
indices capture the stringency of regulations in each
area, they need not imply that all such regulations
are unwarranted; indeed, whether full deregulation
is optimal depends on individual countries’ circumstances and the availability of alternative policy tools
to meet governments’ policy objectives—as discussed
in IMF (2012) regarding capital account liberalization,
for example. These data on market regulations and
reforms are complemented by a composite indicator of
the quality of governance (political stability, government effectiveness, strength of rule of law, control
of corruption) based on the Worldwide Governance
Indicators (WGIs).3 All indices are normalized to vary
continuously between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating the
most restrictive regulations in a given policy area and
1 indicating the most unrestricted. For the governance
indicator, higher scores denote stronger governance
frameworks.
These indicators have several limitations. First, the
new IMF data capture de jure regulations. As such,
they may not always fully capture de facto changes in
intended outcomes—even though indicator scores in
domestic finance, external finance, and trade correlate
rather well with related outcomes, such as the share of
credit in GDP, financial openness, and trade openness
(see Online Annex 3.1). Second, indicator scores are
comparable across time and countries within each individual policy area, but they are not comparable across
different policy areas.4 Therefore, while useful to study
broad reform trends, the overall reform index, constructed as a simple average of the five IMF indicators,
should be interpreted with caution. Third, the WGIs
3The analysis in the chapter uses a composite governance indicator
rather than all its individual components because the latter are highly
correlated. Empirical analysis based on each indicator considered in
isolation yields qualitatively similar findings.
4For instance, if a country has a higher score in the area of
domestic finance than in product market regulation, it cannot be
concluded that the country has a more liberalized financial than
product market.

are perception indices summarizing the views of many
businesses, citizens, and expert survey respondents on
the quality of governance in a country; the quality of
underlying data can vary across countries and data
sources.5 Therefore, individual country rankings based
on these indicators should be avoided. Fourth, the
scope of reforms studied in this chapter is limited to
the six areas mentioned earlier, which relate mainly to
the functioning of markets. There are, however, several
other important reforms that could facilitate the accumulation of capital and labor, such as improving education and health care systems, strengthening public
infrastructure spending frameworks, or changing laws
and regulations that obstruct women’s participation
in the labor force. Finally, within each reform area,
the scope of regulations covered by the corresponding
indicator is also limited. For example, the indicator for
product market regulations focuses on two important
network industries—that is, electricity and telecommunications—but it does not cover other industries
or broader administrative burdens on companies.
Likewise, the domestic finance indicator captures
regulations in the banking system, but does not cover
nonbank financial institutions.
After the major liberalization waves in the late
1980s and—most important—the 1990s, the pace
of structural reform slowed in emerging market and
developing economies in the late 2000s, especially
in low-income developing countries (Figure 3.3).
This was the result of some stabilization of policy
in (domestic and external) finance, trade, and product markets after the significant deregulation of the
previous decades. Deregulation included phasing out
of credit and interest rate controls in banking sectors;
liberalization of foreign capital inflows and outflows;
external tariff reductions, including from multilateral trade liberalization rounds; and reduced entry
barriers as well as privatization in network industries
(Figure 3.4). In turn, stabilization during the 2000s
in part reflects a gradual narrowing of the scope for
further reforms, but also waning reform efforts, notably in the sub-Saharan Africa and Middle East and
North Africa regions. Labor market regulation differs
from other areas: it has been far more stable for the
average emerging market and developing economy,
without any noticeable deregulation trend since the
5WGIs do not reflect the official views of the World Bank and are
not used by the World Bank Group to allocate resources.

advanced economies (Chapter 3 of the April 2016

importantly aim to protect workers from the risk of
income loss—even though this may be best pursued
by shifting from stringent employment protection
legislation, which is the dimension considered in this
chapter, toward unemployment insurance (Duval and
Loungani 2019). Finally, over the past two decades,
there has been no noticeable improvement in governance in the average emerging market and developing
economy.6

EMs = emerging markets; LIDCs = low-income developing countries.

Reforms have been generally more far-reaching in
emerging markets than in low-income developing
countries over the past few decades. Exceptions include
international trade—widespread international trade
liberalization has led to tariff convergence toward low
levels around the world—and labor laws—there is no
evidence of a trend toward labor market deregulation
and, in fact, there has even been tightening in recent
years. In product markets and in domestic and external
finance, regulation was strict for both the average
emerging market economy and low-income developing
country until the 1990s but, since then, liberalization
has sped up, particularly in emerging markets. These
average patterns mask considerable heterogeneity, however. Among both emerging markets and low-income
developing countries, some economies have undergone
far-reaching liberalization while others have maintained
stringent restrictions, most strikingly on international
capital flows (external finance). For example, since the
early 1990s, emerging market economies that have
substantially improved their structural indicator scores
include, among others, Estonia and Latvia (domestic
finance); Peru and Romania (external finance); Chile
and Colombia (product markets); China and Egypt
(labor markets); and South Africa and Uruguay (international trade). Among low-income countries, examples of major reformers over the same period include
Madagascar and Tanzania (domestic finance); Kenya
and Uganda (external finance); Nicaragua and Senegal
(product markets); Cameroon and Côte d’Ivoire (labor
markets); and Bolivia and Ghana (international trade).
A few emerging market economies have achieved
significant improvements in governance (Albania
and Georgia, for example), as have some low-income
developing countries (Cameroon and Ethiopia, for
example).
Broad differences in reform trends have also been
observed across and within regions. Overall, reform
efforts have been greater among emerging market and
developing economies in Europe and in the Latin
America and Caribbean region than across sub-Saharan
Africa and, to a lesser extent, the Middle East and
North Africa and Asia and Pacific regions (Figure 3.5).
The European integration process after the collapse of
the Soviet Union played a key role for Europe, while
for Latin American emerging market and developing
economies the crises of the 1980s and 1990s were
contributing factors. Again, there have been wide differences across countries in these reform trends. Within

they can differ in nature, nontariff barriers to trade
tend to be pervasive in both advanced and emerging market economies and in low-income developing countries (see, for example,
Ederington and Ruta 2016).
8The statistical method follows the approach proposed by Jordà
(2005). The baseline specifications control for past economic
growth and past reforms, as well as country and time-fixed
effects. A possible concern regarding the analysis is that the
probability of structural reform is influenced not only by past
economic growth and the occurrence of recessions, but also by
contemporaneous economic developments and expectations of
future growth. However, this is unlikely to be a major issue,
given long lags associated with the implementation of structural
reforms and that information about future growth is likely to
be largely embedded in past economic activity. Most important,
controlling for expectations of current and future growth delivers
very similar results to, and not different with statistical significance from, those reported in this chapter. Similar results for
the medium-term effects are also obtained when controlling for
current economic growth. Another possible concern regarding
the analysis is that the results may suffer from omitted variable
bias, as reforms may occur across different areas at the same time
or because they are undertaken within the context of broader
macroeconomic stabilization packages. However, including all the
reforms simultaneously in the estimated equation, and controlling
for macroeconomic policies aimed at reducing inflation and public debt, does not substantially alter the magnitude and statistical
significance of the results. See the discussion later in the chapter
and in Online Annex 3.2 for details.

and to address the impact that expected growth may

the channels through which reforms affect economic
activity, and to deal with some of the limitations
of the country time-series approach, industry-level
empirical analysis is carried out. This analysis exploits
the fact that reforms benefit some industries more
than others—for example, job protection reform that
makes it easier for firms to hire and lay off workers
is expected to offer more benefit for industries that
typically need high job turnover. The third approach,
adopted to analyze the effects of reforms and shed light
on ­transmission channels—the role of informality, in
particular—is to use a model that captures key regulations and other features of a “typical” emerging market
and developing economy.

(Percent; effect on output, unless noted otherwise)
Empirical estimates point to sizable average effects of reforms that materialize
only gradually.

6 1. Domestic Finance

2. External Finance

Major historical reforms have had sizable average
positive effects on output over the medium term
(­Figure 3.8).9 In normal times, the reforms studied in
this chapter do not appear to entail short-term macroeconomic costs. However, with some exceptions, such
as product market deregulation, which pays off rather
quickly, it takes some time—typically at least three
years—for reform gains to become economically and
statistically significant. In addition, wide confidence
bands around point estimates are indicative of significant cross-country differences in the effects of past
reforms. Some important aspects of this heterogeneity
are explored in the next section.
The quantitative effects vary across historical major
reforms:10
•• For domestic finance (Figure 3.8, panel 1), a major
liberalization event—for example, a reform of
the size that took place in Egypt in 1992—leads
to a statistically significant increase in output
of about 2 percent on average six years after
reform implementation.11 Estimates suggest that
domestic finance liberalization also increases
investment and employment, although to a
smaller extent. The weak impact on investment is

change in the relevant indicator above two standard deviations of the
distribution (of annual changes in the relevant indicator across the
whole sample).

comparable across different policy areas.
11The reform in Egypt involved easing bank entry restrictions and
improving banking supervision and regulation.

consistent with existing literature that fails to find
an unambiguous positive relationship between
domestic finance reforms and the quantity of
savings and investment (for example, Bandiera
and others 2000). In contrast, the main channel
at play seems to be that of an improvement in the

allocative efficiency of financial markets (see, for
example, Abiad, Oomes, and Ueda 2008).12
•• For external finance (Figure 3.8, panel 2), a major
liberalization—of the type carried out by Romania in
2003, for example—is found to lead to a statistically
significant increase in the output level of more than
1 percent six years after the reform.13 Estimates also
suggest that one of the channels underpinning this
increase is higher investment. In contrast, external
finance reforms do not have a large or statistically
significant effect on employment (see, for example,
Furceri, Loungani, and Ostry, forthcoming). This
implies that the positive output impact of liberalization largely reflects increases in labor productivity.14
•• For international trade (Figure 3.8, panel 3), a large
tariff cut—for example, similar to that in Kenya in
1994—is estimated to increase output by an average
of about 1 percent six years later. Labor productivity,
which rises by about 1.4 percent after six years, is
the key transmission channel, in line with extensive
literature on the productivity gains from trade liberalization (for example, Ahn and others 2019 and
references therein). These aggregate effects on real
activity bolster the traditional view against protectionism (Furceri and others 2018).
•• In product markets (Figure 3.8, panel 4), major
deregulation—such as, for example, the adoption of
the Law on Regulators of Public Utilities in Latvia in
2001—leads to a statistically significant increase in
output of about 1 percent three years after the reform.
This is a remarkable effect considering that the analysis
is restricted to deregulation in only two key network
industries, namely electricity and telecommunications.
The gains from broader reforms across a wider range of
protected industries would therefore be expected to be
larger. Further estimates suggest that product market
deregulation increases employment and investment as
well as productivity, in the medium term.
12Furthermore, the increase in output is larger than the increase
in employment, which implies an increase in labor productivity. At
a six-year horizon, the productivity increase amounts to 1.4 percent
and the effect is statistically significant.
13The reform in Romania included the liberalization of capital
movements related to the performance of insurance contracts and
other capital flows with significant influence on the real economy,
such as lifting restrictions concerning the access of nonresidents to
bank deposits.
14This is in line with recent cross-country studies finding that
financial openness affects growth primarily through higher productivity (Bonfiglioli 2008; Bekaert and others 2011).

•• In labor markets (Figure 3.8, panel 5), a major easing
of job protection legislation—along the lines of the
labor code revisions in Kazakhstan in 2000, which
facilitated dismissal procedures and lowered severance
pay—is found to increase employment by almost
1 percent, on average, in the medium term. Also,
investment is positively impacted, possibly reflecting
higher (marginal) returns on capital as employment
rises and profitability increases. However, the short- to
medium-term output and productivity effects of job
protection deregulation are not found to be statistically
significant at conventional levels (Duval and Furceri
2018 has a similar finding for advanced economies).
•• As regards governance (Figure 3.8, panel 6),
an improvement of a magnitude similar to
that achieved by Ghana when it adopted its
anti-corruption laws in 2006, for example, increases
output by about 2 percent after six years.15 The
main transmission channel is investment (IMF
2018), although the reform also has a (smaller)
positive and statistically significant effect on employment and labor productivity.
Summarizing, the results of the empirical analysis
suggest that a very ambitious and comprehensive reform
agenda involving simultaneous major reforms across all
six areas considered—that is, summing up the effects of
each individual reform, and abstracting from possible
complementarities between them, which are explored
in the next section—might raise output in the average
emerging market and developing economy by more
than 7 percent over a six-year period.16 This would raise
annual GDP growth more than 1 percentage point and
double the current speed of income-per-capita convergence to advanced economy levels from about 1 percent
to more than 2 percent. An even larger increase in
annual GDP growth, exceeding 1.25 and 2 percentage
points in the average emerging market economy and
low-income developing country, respectively, would
be possible under an even more ambitious scenario in
15The index is computed as the arithmetic average of six WGIs
(see Online Annex 3.1 for details).
16Summing up the effects of each individual reform implicitly
assumes that reforms do not entail major complementarity—which
would imply a larger gain from a package than from the sum of
each individual reform undertaken in isolation—or substitutability.
As discussed in detail in the next section, while not all reforms are
complementary, some of them are. As a result, the potential gain
from a comprehensive reform package may be even larger than
reported here.

which all emerging market and developing economies
align their policies in each area with those of the currently most liberalized emerging market economies.

(Percent)

Financial reforms have stronger effects in industries with greater dependence on
external sources of ﬁnancing.

Sector-Level Results
As a robustness check for the economy-wide results,
and to shed further light on transmission channels,
country-industry-level analysis explores how reforms
affect within-country differences in the response of
output between industries.17 For domestic and external
finance, the empirical approach follows the methodology proposed by Rajan and Zingales (1998), which
assesses the long-term effect of financial depth on
industry growth according to differences in external
finance dependence across industries.18 For labor
market reforms, the approach follows Duval, Furceri,
and Jalles (2019), which examines the effect of job
protection deregulation on industry-level employment
in advanced economies depending on differences in
“natural” layoff rates across industries—that is, the natural propensity of firms in a given industry to adjust
their workforce to idiosyncratic shocks.19
The industry-level analysis confirms the findings
of the aggregate country-level analysis for domestic and external finance reforms. The difference in
medium-term output effects of major domestic finance
liberalization between industries with high and low
dependence on external finance (at the 75th and
17The

analysis focuses on the manufacturing sector and explores
the differential effects of reforms across different industries using an
unbalanced panel of 19 manufacturing industries at the 2-digit level in
66 emerging market and developing economies from 1973 to 2014.
Like the country-level analysis, the industry-level analysis also relies on
the local projection method, but reforms are identified at the industry
level by interacting the (country-level) reform variable with relevant
industry-specific characteristics that capture each industry’s exposure to
reform. The main advantage of this approach is that it is less prone to
endogeneity concerns and thereby to enhance the causal interpretation
of the chapter’s findings (see Online Annex 3.2 for technical details).
18Following Rajan and Zingales (1998), the degree of dependence
on external finance in each industry is measured as the median across
all US firms, in each industry, of the ratio of total capital expenditures minus current cash flows to total capital expenditures.
19The measure of “natural” industry-specific layoff rates is the
ratio of the number of workers dismissed for business reasons to
total employment in the United States, following the methodology
proposed by Micco and Pagés (2006) and Bassanini, Nunziata, and
Venn (2009). Data on laid-off workers and employed individuals
come from the US Current Population Survey covering 2003–07.
Because of the quasi absence of employment protection legislation, the United States provides the closest empirical example of a
frictionless labor market and, as a result, its industries can be seen as
exhibiting “natural” layoff rates.

(­Figure 3.9, panel 2)—even though the magnitude
and the precision of the point estimates decline in the
medium term. For labor market reforms, the analysis
does not find a statistically significant difference, on
average, in the impact of deregulation between industries with high turnover and low turnover. However, as
discussed in the next section, this insignificant effect
masks considerable heterogeneity depending on whether
the reform was undertaken in good or bad times.

CHAPTER 3

REIGNITING GROWTH IN LOW-INCOME AND EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES: WHAT ROLE can STRUCTURAL REFORMS Play?

Model-Based Results
The empirical estimates are complemented by use of
a structural general equilibrium model that brings three
key benefits for assessments of reform impacts.20 First,
it allows for quantification of reform gains over a longer
horizon than considered in the empirical analysis—the
medium to long term, once the effects of reforms on
the economy fully play out. Second, while the effects of
historical reforms may have varied, depending on the
quality of their implementation and other prevailing
circumstances that might not be fully controlled for in
the empirical setup, model-based analysis is, by design,
free of such limitations. Third, it sheds light on the
transmission channels of reforms. This is because the
model captures several key features of many emerging
market and developing economies—their large informal
sectors (La Porta and Shleifer 2008, 2014), financial
constraints on firm growth (Midrigan and Xu 2014),
large sunk costs of registering in the formal sector
(Djankov and others 2002), employment protection
laws that raise formal sector labor costs (Alesina and
others, forthcoming), and weak governance that acts
as a tax on the output of formal sector firms (Mauro
1995; IMF 2018).21 Another important model feature
is that the formal sector is both more capital intensive
and more productive than the informal sector, and
only firms in the formal sector have access to external
finance (La Porta and Shleifer 2008, 2014).
The model-based analysis points to three key channels through which reforms can increase output: they
facilitate entry from the informal sector to the formal
sector, incentivize formal firms to invest and grow,
and can reduce misallocation of resources between
formal firms.22 In particular, product market and
20The

model is an extension of Midrigan and Xu (2014). Online
Annex 3.3 provides a technical description of the model.
21It is important to note that data limitations mean that the costs
of governance are simply modeled as a fraction of formal sector output that is lost (potentially due to corruption and weak rule of law).
The model therefore abstracts from many other channels through
which governance can affect GDP, including through informal firms
(see Online Annex 3.3 for further discussion).
22The model is calibrated to account for the distortions created
by regulations studied in the empirical analysis, such as productivity
differentials between sectors and financial market distortions, based
on the observed values of key variables such as the private sector
debt-to-GDP ratio and the share of employment in the informal sector, across a large set of emerging market and developing economies
between 2013 and 2018. The size of reforms considered in the analysis is designed to be as comparable as possible to the size of reforms
presented in the empirical analysis. The results are qualitatively
robust to, and quantitatively stable across, alternative calibrations
(see Online Annex 3.3 for further details).

financial market reforms make it easier for informal firms to enter the formal sector—the former by
reducing entry costs and the latter by enabling firms
to finance such costs. Formalization, in turn, leads to
capital deepening, higher aggregate productivity, and
increased ­output.23 Improving governance or easing
job protection legislation increases the profitability of
formal sector firms directly; this encourages them to
grow, increasing investment and reallocating resources
from the less productive informal sector. Domestic
finance reforms have qualitatively similar effects,
given that they relax credit constraints on formal sector firms and so enable them to grow rapidly to their
optimal size.24
The reforms are found to yield larger—twice as large,
on average—output gains in the long term than those
estimated in the empirical analysis for the medium
term (Figure 3.10).25 Two key factors help explain the
higher long-term gains predicted by the model. First,
firm formalization and capital accumulation typically
take place over a longer horizon than is considered in
the empirical analysis. Second, the model represents an
ideal reform scenario, while average empirical estimates
also reflect cases of imperfect reform implementation.
These effects are those for an average emerging market
and developing economy, given that the model is
calibrated to match a large set of average microeconomic and macroeconomic characteristics across a large
sample of emerging market and developing economies.
23The productivity gain from doing business in the formal sector
is consistent with the large gap in value added per worker between
informal and formal firms reported in La Porta and Shleifer (2008,
2014). Drivers of this gap may include, among others, better access
to intermediate inputs (Amiti and Konings 2007), access to export
markets (De Loecker 2007), and higher-skilled workers (Ulyssea
2018). Aggregate capital deepening follows from the formal sector’s
greater access to credit markets and capital intensity. Martin, Nataraj,
and Harrison (2017) finds that product market deregulation in India
between 2000 and 2007 led to increases in district-level capital, as
well as in output and employment.
24By contrast, resource misallocation across formal firms does not
constitute an important source of output gains from these reforms
in the model, compared with the gains from formalization and
increased investment. This is partly because restricted access to credit
is the only regulation that affects different formal firms differently—
and therefore the only one that generates misallocation—in this
version of the model (see Online Annex 3.3 for details).
25Reforms simulated with the model are designed to be comparable in magnitude to those considered in the empirical section
(see Online Annex 3.3 for details). These are large reforms in practice; for example, the size of the domestic finance reform considered
in Figure 3.10 would enable Mexican firms to increase their leverage,
raising the corporate sector debt-to-GDP ratio to the level observed
in Poland.

Note: Bars represent the percent increase in aggregate output from a reduction in
the corresponding friction at the benchmark calibration. The size of the reforms is
designed to be in line with a major reform in the reform indices (∆Reform:
∆Targeted Moment = (2σ∆Reform Index /σReform Index ) · σTargeted Moment ). For example, in
the case of domestic ﬁnance reform, the parameter representing the ﬁnancial
friction is changed such that the credit-to-GDP ratio shifts across the distribution
(of the credit-to-GDP ratios across countries) the same way the domestic ﬁnance
regulation indicator does across the distribution (of this indicator across countries)
after a major reform in the empirical analysis.

“Governance” is modeled as a reduction in an implicit tax on formal ﬁrms’
revenue. While conventional, this modeling choice ignores other potential gains
from strengthening governance, such as lower costs of doing business in the
informal sector, lower operational uncertainty, and reduced misallocation across
ﬁrms in the formal sector—to the extent that these might suffer to different
degrees from poor governance.

Accounting for Differences across Countries
While past reforms have delivered sizable average gains,
wide confidence intervals around these estimated impacts
point to substantial differences across countries. So do
the mixed experiences of past reformers, even within
given regions. For example, reforms in Latin American
economies during the 1980s and 1990s were followed
by growth spurts in some cases (such as Chile), but not

106

in others (such as Argentina or Mexico). Likewise, while
most reforming countries in central and eastern Europe
converged fast to advanced economies’ living standards
after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s,
most reforming economies of the Commonwealth of
Independent States did not.
This section investigates some of the drivers of that
heterogeneity by asking the following question: Which
country characteristics tend to be associated with
larger gains from reforms? In doing so, it highlights
the influence of business conditions at the time of
reform and—focusing more on longer-term effects—
the importance of informality and interactions across
reform areas.26

Prevailing business conditions may affect an economy’s short- to medium-term response to reforms in
certain areas. For example, liberalizing credit supply
may not elicit much credit and output growth when
demand for credit is weak, as would be the case in a
depressed economy. Likewise, easing job protection
legislation in a recession may not induce firms to
recruit but, instead, incentivize them to lay off workers, so further reducing aggregate employment and
output in the short term (Cacciatore and others 2016).
The role of business conditions is explored empirically
using state-dependent regressions in which the state
of the economy at the time of reform is captured by
a smooth-transition function of the GDP growth rate
(Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2012) or, alternatively,
by a dummy variable for crisis.27
Although the effects of most reforms do not appear
to differ significantly, whether passed in good or bad
times, domestic finance liberalization appears to pay
off far more when implemented in an expansionary
26Another open question is whether reform priorities should differ
according to the level of development, including between emerging
market economies and low-income developing countries. While
there is generally a strong case for tailoring reform priorities along
these lines, no evidence could be found that the effects of reforms
considered in this chapter vary systematically depending on the level
of income per capita or across country income groups. Likewise, a
comprehensive analysis of interactions across reforms, performed
by conditioning the impact of reform in one area on the regulatory
stance in other areas, did not provide systematic evidence of complementarity (or substitutability) between reforms. One exception is the
importance of strong governance for other reforms’ payoffs, which is
discussed below.

phase of the business cycle (Figure 3.11, panels 1
and 2). Under very strong business conditions, the
estimated impact of reform on output is found to be
three times larger than it would be in normal times,
consistent with a stronger response of credit demand to
credit supply deregulation during an economic boom.
By contrast, point estimates suggest that financial
liberalization can be contractionary if passed when
economic conditions are weak, although this negative
effect is not statistically distinguishable from zero. One
interpretation of this result is that increasing competition in the financial sector at a time of weak credit
demand may push certain financial intermediaries out
of business, further weakening the economy.
Likewise, job protection deregulation appears
to deliver short-term gains in good times, but not
in bad times (Figure 3.11, panels 3 and 4). This is
in line with previous IMF evidence for advanced
economies (Duval and Furceri 2018; Duval, Furceri,
and Jalles 2019) and reflects the fact that when it is
easier to hire and fire workers, firms tend to increase
primarily hires when they face strong demand
for their goods and services—while they tend to
increase primarily layoffs when facing weak demand.
Job protection deregulation, when implemented
during strong economic conditions, is estimated
to raise employment three times as much as when
enacted in normal times. If undertaken during
a financial crisis, it may even be contractionary,
although the estimated negative effect is not statistically distinguishable from zero. Industry-level results
are consistent with these country-level estimates
(Figure 3.11, panels 5 and 6). When the labor market is liberalized in good times, employment rises
significantly in industries with high natural layoff
rates—that is, those where stringent job protection
legislation is likely to be more binding—relative
to those with low layoff rates. The reverse holds
when the reform is implemented during bad times:
employment in industries with high layoff rates falls
more than in industries with low layoff rates. These
results suggest that accompanying macroeconomic
policies that boost aggregate demand could magnify
the effects of certain structural reforms.28
28For example, further analysis not reported here suggests that
labor market reforms are more effective at raising output when
implemented together with expansionary fiscal policy. This is in line
with previous IMF analysis for advanced economies (Chapter 3 of
the April 2016 WEO; Duval, Furceri, and Jalles 2019).

Role of Informality
The role of individual country characteristics for the
impact of reform is investigated using both empirical
and model-based analyses. On the empirical side, the
chapter uses a flexible approach to explore sources
of parameter heterogeneity across units (countries):
the Bayesian hierarchical empirical model along the
lines of Boz, Gopinath, and Plagborg-Møller (2017).
This method makes it possible to estimate flexibly the
country-specific impact of each reform conditional
on observed individual country characteristics such
as the weight of the informal sector in the economy
(see Online Annex 3.2 for technical details).29 On the
model side, the impact of a given reform is simulated
under alternative sets of regulations and characteristics, such as under low versus high barriers to entry
in the formal sector—that is, under high versus low
informality.30
Among the many possible country characteristics
that could shape the impact of reforms, informality
appears particularly important. Empirical findings suggest that, in most areas (domestic finance,
product and labor market regulations, governance),
reforms have larger effects when informality is high
(­Figure 3.12, panels 1–4). At a five-year horizon,
the gain from reform is typically twice as large in
a country with a high degree of informality (at the
75th percentile of the cross-country distribution of
informality rates) as in a country with low informality (at the 25th percentile of the distribution).
Model-based analysis also points to larger reform
gains in an economy with a higher initial level of
informality (such as India) than in one with lower
informality (such as South Africa or Panama), as
shown in Figure 3.13.
Reforms tend to pay off more when informality is
higher because one of the effects of reforms is precisely
29The main advantage of this approach over the more conventional use of multiplicative interactions is that it does not impose
any functional form on the interaction between the country
characteristic of interest (for example, the level of informality) and
the reform coefficient, but instead uses a nonparametric specification
for the distribution of the coefficient conditional on the country
characteristic.
30In the model, the size of the informal sector is determined by
all the structural features of the economy, including regulations.
Here, the lower-informality economy is one in which entry costs
into the formal sector are lower than in the baseline case—they are
set equal to the 25th percentile of the cross-country distribution
of entry costs. The higher-informality economy is the baseline
economy.

to reduce informality, which in turn benefits the economy. This channel is generally more powerful when
informality is high to start with. For example, cutting barriers to entry in the formal sector, or explicit
(labor) and implicit (corruption) taxes on formal
firms, induces some informal firms to become formal.
In turn, formalization boosts output by increasing
productivity and capital accumulation; for example,
becoming formal can help firms invest by enhancing
their access to credit and improve their productivity
by giving them access to better intermediate inputs or
export markets. Empirical analysis confirms that this
formalization channel is important. Applying the local
projection method to study the impact on informality of a change in the average regulation indicator
(across the areas studied in this chapter) suggests

“Governance” is modeled as a reduction in an implicit tax on formal ﬁrms’
revenue. While conventional, this modeling choice ignores other potential gains
from strengthening governance, such as lower costs of doing business in the
informal sector, lower operational uncertainty, and reduced misallocation across
ﬁrms in the formal sector—to the extent that these might suffer to different
degrees from poor governance.

that a major broad-based reform is associated with a
statistically ­significant decrease in informality of about
1 percentage point at a five-year horizon (Figure 3.14).
This is consistent with evidence reported in microeconomic studies.31

Reform Complementarities
Reforms do not always entail complementarity (or
substitutability), in the sense that a package combining
multiple reforms does not necessarily yield a larger
(or smaller) gain than the sum of the effects of each
reform taken in isolation. This is confirmed by rather
inconclusive empirical analysis (using the Bayesian procedure mentioned earlier) of whether countries reaped
larger gains from a given reform when they had already
deregulated other areas; in general, reforms are not
found to have widely different effects across different
countries with different regulations. Model analysis
confirms that reforms need not always be complementary, and it also explains why. For example, as reforms
the impact of deregulation on firms’ market entry in Mexico. However, Mexico’s experience highlights the variation in the response of
informality across reform areas and its dependence on reform design.
Despite major macroeconomic reforms during the 1990s, informality
has since risen considerably (Levy 2018), coinciding with slow productivity growth. Levy (2008) argues that this increase in informality
resulted from the introduction of new policies (such as changes in the
relative benefits provided by contributory and noncontributory social
insurance programs, among others) in the early 2000s that disincentivized firms and workers to formalize.

are implemented, informality falls, reducing the scope
for further declines in informality and thereby dampening potential gains from other reforms.
However, policymakers can exploit specific reform
complementarities, notably by prioritizing improvements in governance. This may in part help explain the
success in income convergence of some eastern European countries, such as Estonia, Latvia, and Romania,
that joined the European Union and have carried out
major reforms alongside improvements in governance
since the 1990s. Bearing in mind the limitations of
governance indicators mentioned above, the empirical

110

analysis indicates that the impact of past reforms was
most often larger in countries where the quality of governance was higher, while reforms yielded considerably
smaller gains where governance was weaker (Figure 3.15,
panel 4). The quality of governance matters particularly
for the impact of product market deregulation; such
reforms failed to pay off where governance was poor, but
delivered larger gains where governance was strong. This
is consistent with the view that reduced entry barriers in
product markets foster new firm entry and push incumbent firms to be more efficient and innovative only if all
firms are treated equally, which is easier to achieve when
the rule of law is strong and property rights are strictly
enforced. By the same token, strong governance can
magnify the gains from other pro-competition reforms
in finance or international trade.
Complementarities also exist between reforms that
incentivize firms to grow and reforms that enable them to
do so. Key among the growth-enabling reforms is domestic finance liberalization, which, by improving access to
credit, can magnify the gains from reforms in other areas.
As an illustration, model-based analysis highlights the
complementarity between reforms that liberalize labor
markets and financial markets simultaneously—as, for
example, Bolivia did in 1985.32 Labor market reform
improves the profitability of the formal sector, inducing
formal firms to expand and informal ones to formalize.
Given that entrepreneurs need to finance their entry into
the formal sector and their capital investment, improving access to credit through liberalization of domestic
finance—alongside strengthened financial sector supervision33—amplifies the investment and output effects of
labor market reform (Figure 3.16).34

Summary and Policy Implications
Key findings of this chapter make a strong case for
a renewed structural reform push in emerging market
and developing economies for two main reasons. First,
even after the major liberalization wave of the 1990s,
much scope generally remains for further reforms in
32In 1985 Bolivia removed directed credit by the government and
liberalized interest rate controls. In addition, Supreme Decrees 7072,
9190, and 17610 were repealed, reestablishing the right of employers
to dismiss workers according to previously existing provisions.
33While not captured by the model used here, sound supervision
is key to alleviating risks of a buildup in financial sector vulnerabilities following domestic finance liberalization (Johnston and
Sundararajan 1999).

the areas covered in this chapter: domestic and external
finance, international trade, labor and product market
regulations, and governance. This holds true particularly for low-income developing countries—notably
across sub-Saharan Africa and, to a lesser extent, in
the Middle East and North Africa and Asia and Pacific
regions. Second, the reforms studied in this chapter are
not found to entail short-term macroeconomic costs—
except for some of them when implemented in bad
times—and they can yield sizable output and employment gains in the medium to long term: for a typical
emerging market and developing economy, major
simultaneous reforms across the areas listed above could
raise annual economic growth by about 1 percentage
point over five to 10 years, doubling the current speed
of income-per-capita convergence to advanced economy levels over the next decade. In countries where
informality is comparatively high, reform gains could
be even larger, all else equal. In addition, these estimates do not factor in further potential gains from
other growth-oriented policies not covered in this
chapter, such as improving education and health care

systems, public infrastructure spending frameworks,
and laws and regulations that impede women’s labor
force participation.
At the same time, reform in one area has different
effects across economies, depending on their existing regulations in other areas and prevailing business
conditions at the time of reform. This suggests that
getting reform packaging, sequencing, and prioritizing
right is key to maximizing payoffs. Concrete actions to
improve governance and facilitate access to credit by
firms are often an important step to remove binding constraints on growth and amplify reform gains.
In countries where economic conditions are weak,
priority should also be given to reforms—such as
cutting barriers to international trade or firm entry in
domestic nonmanufacturing industries—whose gains
do not depend on prevailing economic conditions.
Reforms, such as easing job protection legislation and
deregulating the domestic financial sector, that do not
pay off in bad times, would be best enacted with a
credible provision that they will take effect later, when
economic conditions are stronger. If it is not possible to delay when they take effect (for labor market
reforms), reforms can be grandfathered—that is, new
rules would apply only to new beneficiaries—although
this comes at the cost of delaying the full gains from
reform. In addition, job protection deregulation should
be accompanied by some strengthening of social safety
nets (Duval and Loungani 2019). In countries with
credible medium-term fiscal frameworks and available
fiscal space, countercyclical fiscal policy could also
alleviate short-term costs of reforms.
Reform strategies should also internalize political
economy considerations. Even if reforms deliver a net
gain for society as a whole, they often produce hardto-perceive gains that are spread broadly across the
population, while losses are more visible and concentrated on small but sometimes powerful population
groups (Olson 1971). Experience with past reforms
highlights the need for careful design and prioritization, ownership, good communication, and transparency to ensure broad-based support.
There are also three more specific lessons from the
past. First, given that reforms take time to deliver,
government should act swiftly following an electoral
victory to implement them during their political
“honeymoon” period. This strategy will mitigate
potential political costs (Box 3.1). Second, reforms
are best implemented when economic conditions are

favorable—that is, governments should “fix the roof
while the sun is shining.” In bad times, because voters
are often unable to disentangle the effect of reform
from that of poor economic conditions, reforms tend
to be electorally costly. During recessions, macroeconomic policy support—where feasible—may
reduce the political costs of reform. Third, policymakers should factor in, and implement up-front,

112

complementary reforms to mitigate any adverse effects
of reforms on income distribution. Strong social
safety nets and active labor market programs that
help ­workers move across jobs can help in this regard,
given that reforms often lead simultaneously to new
job creation and destruction. Reforms whose gains are
captured only by a small fraction of society risk losing
support and could stall, or be undone, down the road.

CHAPTER 3

REIGNITING GROWTH IN LOW-INCOME AND EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES: WHAT ROLE can STRUCTURAL REFORMS Play?

Box 3.1. The Political Effects of Structural Reforms
While the evidence presented in this chapter speaks
strongly in favor of the economic benefits of structural reforms, their political benefits are much less
clear, which has long been perceived as an obstacle to
reform. One problem is that even if reforms deliver a
net gain for society as whole, they often produce hardto-perceive gains spread broadly across the population,
and more visible losses that are concentrated on small
but sometimes powerful population groups (Olson
1971). For example, cutting barriers to entry in a
network industry—such as electricity or telecommunications, both of which are considered in this chapter—
typically yields diffuse gains to consumers in the form
of lower prices or better products, while incumbent
firms and workers may lose much from the entry of
new competitors and reduced profits. In these circumstances, politicians may hold back on reforms for fear
they will be penalized at the ballot box by vocal losers
from reform.
This box examines empirically whether fears of a
political cost of reform are supported by historical
experience. Specifically, it asks whether structural
reforms lead to electoral losses or gains, and whether
the timing of reform in the electoral cycle and the
state of the economy matter for subsequent electoral
outcomes.
To examine these issues, the analysis maps a new
data set on electoral outcomes with the new reform
data set presented in the chapter and estimates the
effect of reforms on the change in the vote share of
the incumbent party or coalition in the following election.1 This dependent variable is especially useful in
assessing the magnitude of electoral penalties or gains
from reforms. A leader of the executive might remain
in office, but with a much-reduced majority, or might
be forced into a coalition government.
The key independent variable used in the analysis is
the unweighted average of all the reform indices.2

The results of the analysis suggest that reforms entail
electoral costs only when implemented in the year
before an election; in this case, a major broad-based
reform (defined in the rest of the chapter as a major
change across all regulatory areas simultaneously) is
associated with a decrease in the vote share of the
coalition of about 3 percentage points. This effect is
economically significant and is roughly equivalent to
a 17 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of
the incumbent leader of the coalition being reelected
(Figure 3.1.1). In contrast, reforms earlier in an
incumbent’s term do not appear to affect election prospects. These results are suggestive of myopic behavior
of the electorate and are also consistent with empirical
evidence in this chapter that the economic gains from
reforms take time to materialize.
These average results mask considerable differences
across reformers, depending on whether measures were
implemented in good or bad times (Figure 3.1.2).
Reforms are not found to entail political costs when
undertaken under strong economic conditions, but
they tend to be politically costly when enacted in periods of weak economic activity, possibly because they
lead to larger distributional costs (Alesina and others,
forthcoming) and voters fail to disentangle the effects
of reform from those of poor economic conditions.
Because reforms have been predominantly undertaken
under weak economic conditions (Box 3.2), their
average impact on the vote share is also estimated to
be negative (Figure 3.1.2).
These results hint at two ways reform strategies
can helpfully internalize political-economy considerations and maximize chances of political success. First,
because reforms take time to deliver, governments
should act swiftly following an electoral victory to
implement reforms during their political “honeymoon”
period. Second, reforms are best implemented when
economies are performing well.

CHAPTER 3

REIGNITING GROWTH IN LOW-INCOME AND EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES: WHAT ROLE can STRUCTURAL REFORMS Play?

Box 3.2. The Impact of Crises on Structural Reforms
A broad range of political and economic factors
can explain why and when reforms (do not) happen;
one of these, which is particularly significant, is the
presence of a crisis. Political factors may include
government ideology, the type of political system
(presidential versus parliamentary), the degree of
political fragmentation, and the strength of democratic
institutions (Ciminelli and others, forthcoming, and
references therein). Economic factors may include
prevailing business conditions, in particular. Crises
can act as turning points and catalyze popular support
for reform by increasing the cost of, and the support
of incumbent workers and firms (“insiders”) for,
maintaining the status quo. At the same time, crises
may lead to increased parliamentary fragmentation,
which could weaken reform efforts (Mian, Sufi, and
Trebbi 2014).
The relationship between crisis and reform may
depend on whether the crisis is economic or financial, and it may also differ across regulatory areas. A
collapse in domestic demand may lower opposition to
trade liberalization from industries that usually rely on
domestic demand (Lora and Olivera 2005). Similarly,
periods of high unemployment may increase pressure
on governments to enact reforms that ease labor market regulation in the hope of boosting employment
(Duval, Furceri, and Miethe 2018). By contrast, a
financial crisis after a period of deregulation could lead
governments to reregulate the financial sector and the
economy (Mian, Sufi, and Trebbi 2014; Gokmen and
others 2017).
This box examines empirically the role of crises in
fostering reforms using a vector autoregression (VAR)
framework. This approach has two main advantages
over a static framework. First, it allows investigation
of the possibility that crises lead to reforms with long
lags, an issue neglected in the empirical literature.
Second, it makes it possible to account for feedback
effects between changes in regulation in different
areas. The set of structural reforms considered in the
analysis is the same as in the rest of the chapter. As for

crises, both economic recessions (defined as periods
of negative real GDP growth) and systemic banking
crises (defined in Laeven and Valencia 2008, 2012) are
investigated.
Two VARs (one for each—economic or financial—
type of crisis) are estimated according to the following model:
​​Xi,t
​  ​​  = ​A​​  0​ + ​∑ 4l=1
 ​​ ​A​​ 
​ l​ ​Xi,t−l
​  ​ ​ + ​
​ τ​  t​​ ​+ γ​  i​​  + ​ε​  i,t​​​,

(3.2.1)

in which the subscripts i and t refer to country
and time. X​ 
​​ i,t​​​is a seven-variable vector containing
the crisis dummy considered and the six structural
reform ­indicators (in first differences); ​​A​​  0​​is a vector
of constant terms; ​​A​​  l​​is the vector of parameters to
be estimated; τ​ ​​ t​​​ and γ​​ ​  i​​​refer, respectively, to timeand country-fixed effects; and ε​ ​​ it​​​is the error term.
Four lags of the dependent variables are included.
The responses of reforms to crises are obtained using
a Cholesky decomposition, with the crisis dummy
ordered first; the implicit assumption is that the occurrence of a crisis in year t does not depend on reforms
implemented in the same year.1
The results suggest that economic and banking
crises have different effects on structural reforms
(­Figure 3.2.1). Economic recessions foster trade
liberalization and, to a lesser extent, labor market and
financial deregulation over the medium term. These
results are supportive of the “crisis-induces-reform”
hypothesis and consistent with the findings of Lora
and Olivera (2004) and Duval, Furceri, and Miethe
(2018). They suggest that governments respond to
weaker external demand and higher unemployment by
opening up to trade and liberalizing the labor market
to foster employment. By contrast, banking crises
are found to foster tighter regulation in the domestic
finance and capital account areas. These effects are
rather large and can be interpreted as an attempt by
governments to control or mitigate perceived sources
of financial instability.

1The ordering of the (reform) variables “below” the crisis
dummy does not alter the results (for a formal derivation, see
Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans 1999).

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical data as well as projections. It comprises
seven sections: Assumptions, What’s New,
Data and Conventions, Country Notes,
Classification of Countries, Key Data Documentation,
and Statistical Tables.
The assumptions underlying the estimates and projections for 2019–20 and the medium-term scenario
for 2021–24 are summarized in the first section. The
second section presents a brief description of the
changes to the database and statistical tables since the
April 2019 World Economic Outlook (WEO). The third
section provides a general description of the data and
the conventions used for calculating country group
composites. The fourth section summarizes selected
key information for each country. The fifth section
summarizes the classification of countries in the various groups presented in the WEO. The sixth section
provides information on methods and reporting standards for the member countries’ national account and
government finance indicators included in the report.
The last, and main, section comprises the statistical
tables. (Statistical Appendix A is included here;
Statistical Appendix B is available online at www.imf​
.org/en/Publications/WEO.)
Data in these tables have been compiled on the basis
of information available through September 30, 2019.
The figures for 2019 and beyond are shown with the
same degree of precision as the historical figures solely
for convenience; because they are projections, the same
degree of accuracy is not to be inferred.

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced economies
are assumed to remain constant at their average levels
measured during the period July 26 to August 23, 2019.
For 2019 and 2020, these assumptions imply average
US dollar–special drawing right (SDR) conversion rates
of 1.382 and 1.377, US dollar–euro conversion rates of
1.123 and 1.120, and yen–US dollar conversion rates of
108.2 and 104.5, respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average $61.78
a barrel in 2019 and $57.94 a barrel in 2020.

Established policies of national authorities are
assumed to be maintained. The more specific policy
assumptions underlying the projections for selected
economies are described in Box A1.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that the
London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on six-month
US dollar deposits will average 2.3 percent in 2019
and 2.0 percent in 2020, that three-month euro deposits will average –0.4 percent in 2019 and –0.6 percent
in 2020, and that six-month yen deposits will average
0.0 percent in 2019 and –0.1 percent in 2020.
As a reminder, in regard to the introduction of the
euro, on December 31, 1998, the Council of the
European Union decided that, effective January 1, 1999,
the irrevocably fixed conversion rates between the euro
and currencies of the member countries adopting the
euro are as described in Box 5.4 of the October 1998
WEO. See Box 5.4 of the October 1998 WEO for
details on how the conversion rates were established.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: GLOBAL MANUFAC TURING DOWNTURN, RISING TR ADE BARRIERS

What’s New
• Mauritania redenominated its currency in
January 2018 by replacing 10 old Mauritanian
ouguiya (MRO) with 1 new Mauritanian ouguiya
(MRU). Local currency data for Mauritania are
expressed in the new currency beginning with the
October 2019 WEO database.
• São Tomé and Príncipe redenominated its currency
in January 2018 by replacing 1,000 old São Tomé
and Príncipe dobra (STD) with 1 new São Tomé
and Príncipe dobra (STN). Local currency data
for São Tomé and Príncipe are expressed in the
new currency beginning with the October 2019
WEO database.
• Beginning with the October 2019 WEO, the
regional group Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) is discontinued. Four of the CIS economies (Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine) are
added to the regional group Emerging and Developing Europe. The remaining eight economies—
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz
Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan,
which comprise the regional subgroup Caucasus and
Central Asia (CCA)—are combined with Middle
East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan
(MENAP) to form the new regional group Middle
East and Central Asia (MECA).

Data and Conventions
Data and projections for 194 economies form the
statistical basis of the WEO database. The data are
maintained jointly by the IMF’s Research Department
and regional departments, with the latter regularly
updating country projections based on consistent
global assumptions.
Although national statistical agencies are the
ultimate providers of historical data and definitions,
international organizations are also involved in statistical issues, with the objective of harmonizing methodologies for the compilation of national statistics,
including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions,
classifications, and valuation procedures used in the
production of economic statistics. The WEO database
reflects information from both national source agencies
and international organizations.
Most countries’ macroeconomic data presented in the
WEO conform broadly to the 2008 version of the System
of National Accounts (SNA). The IMF’s sector statistical
122

standards—the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments
and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6),
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and
Compilation Guide (MFSMCG), and the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014)—have
been or are being aligned with the SNA 2008. These
standards reflect the IMF’s special interest in countries’
external positions, financial sector stability, and public
sector fiscal positions. The process of adapting country
data to the new standards begins in earnest when the
manuals are released. However, full concordance with
the manuals is ultimately dependent on the provision
by national statistical compilers of revised country data;
hence, the WEO estimates are only partially adapted
to these manuals. Nonetheless, for many countries, the
impact on major balances and aggregates of conversion
to the updated standards will be small. Many other
countries have partially adopted the latest standards and
will continue implementation over a period of years.1
The fiscal gross and net debt data reported in the
WEO are drawn from official data sources and IMF
staff estimates. While attempts are made to align gross
and net debt data with the definitions in the GFSM, as
a result of data limitations or specific country circumstances, these data can sometimes deviate from the
formal definitions. Although every effort is made to
ensure the WEO data are relevant and internationally
comparable, differences in both sectoral and instrument coverage mean that the data are not universally
comparable. As more information becomes available,
changes in either data sources or instrument coverage can give rise to data revisions that can sometimes
be substantial. For clarification on the deviations in
sectoral or instrument coverage, please refer to the
metadata for the online WEO database.
Composite data for country groups in the WEO are
either sums or weighted averages of data for individual
countries. Unless noted otherwise, multiyear averages
of growth rates are expressed as compound annual rates
of change.2 Arithmetically weighted averages are used
1 Many countries are implementing the SNA 2008 or European
System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA) 2010, and a
few countries use versions of the SNA older than that from 1993.
A similar adoption pattern is expected for the BPM6 and GFSM
2014. Please refer to Table G, which lists the statistical standards
adhered to by each country.
2 Averages for real GDP and its components, employment,
inflation, factor productivity, GDP per capita, trade, and commodity
prices are calculated based on the compound annual rate of change,
except in the case of the unemployment rate, which is based on the
simple arithmetic average.

for all data for the emerging market and developing
economies group—except data on inflation and money
growth, for which geometric averages are used. The
following conventions apply:
Country group composites for exchange rates,
interest rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates
are weighted by GDP converted to US dollars at market
exchange rates (averaged over the preceding three years)
as a share of group GDP.
Composites for other data relating to the domestic
economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are weighted
by GDP valued at purchasing power parity as a share
of total world or group GDP.3 Annual inflation rates
are simple percentage changes from the previous
years, except in the case of emerging market and
developing economies, for which the rates are based on
logarithmic differences.
Composites for real GDP per capita in purchasing
power parity terms are sums of individual country
data after conversion to the international dollar in the
years indicated.
Unless noted otherwise, composites for all sectors
for the euro area are corrected for reporting discrepancies in intra-area transactions. Unadjusted annual GDP
data are used for the euro area and for the majority
of individual countries, except for Cyprus, Ireland,
Portugal, and Spain, which report calendar-adjusted
data. For data prior to 1999, data aggregations apply
1995 European currency unit exchange rates.
Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual
country data after conversion to US dollars at the
average market exchange rates in the years indicated.
Composite unemployment rates and employment
growth are weighted by labor force as a share of group
labor force.
Composites relating to external sector statistics
are sums of individual country data after conversion
to US dollars at the average market exchange rates
in the years indicated for balance of payments data
and at end-of-year market exchange rates for debt
denominated in currencies other than US dollars.
Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes
and prices, however, are arithmetic averages of

and Annex IV of the May 1993 WEO. See also Anne-Marie Gulde

percent changes for individual countries weighted by
the US dollar value of exports or imports as a share
of total world or group exports or imports (in the
preceding year).
Unless noted otherwise, group composites are
computed if 90 percent or more of the share of group
weights is represented.
Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of
a few countries that use fiscal years; Table F lists the
economies with exceptional reporting periods for
national accounts and government finance data for
each country.
For some countries, the figures for 2018 and earlier
are based on estimates rather than actual outturns;
Table G lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators
in the national accounts, prices, government finance,
and balance of payments indicators for each country.

Country Notes
The consumer price data for Argentina before
December 2013 reflect the consumer price index (CPI)
for the Greater Buenos Aires Area (CPI-GBA), while
from December 2013 to October 2015 the data reflect
the national CPI (IPCNu). The government that took
office in December 2015 discontinued the IPCNu,
stating that it was flawed, and released a new CPI for
the Greater Buenos Aires Area on June 15, 2016 (a new
national CPI has been disseminated starting in June
2017). At its November 9, 2016, meeting, the IMF
Executive Board considered the new CPI series to be in
line with international standards and lifted the declaration of censure issued in 2013. Given the differences in
geographical coverage, weights, sampling, and methodology of these series, the average CPI inflation for 2014,
2015, and 2016 and end-of-period inflation for 2015
and 2016 are not reported in the October 2019 WEO.
Argentina’s authorities discontinued the publication
of labor market data in December 2015 and released
new series starting in the second quarter of 2016.
The fiscal series for the Dominican Republic have the
following coverage: public debt, debt service, and the
cyclically adjusted/structural balances are for the consolidated public sector (which includes central government, rest of the nonfinancial public sector, and the
central bank); and the remaining fiscal series are for
the central government.
India’s real GDP growth rates are calculated as per
national accounts: for 1998 to 2011, with base year
2004/05 and, thereafter, with base year 2011/12.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: GLOBAL MANUFAC TURING DOWNTURN, RISING TR ADE BARRIERS

Against the backdrop of a civil war and weak capacity,
the reliability of Libya’s data, especially medium-term
projections, is low.
Data for Syria are excluded from 2011 onward
because of the uncertain political situation.
Trinidad and Tobago’s growth estimates for 2018
are based on full-year energy sector data from the
Ministry of Energy and Ministry of Finance, preliminary national accounts data for the first three quarters
of the year from the Central Statistical Office, and
staff projections for fourth-quarter nonenergy output
based on available information. Growth projections
from 2019 are unchanged from the April 2019 WEO
in the absence of updates to published national
accounts data.
Ukraine’s revised national accounts data are available
beginning in 2000 and exclude Crimea and Sevastopol
from 2010.
Starting from October 2018 Uruguay’s public pension system has been receiving transfers in the context
of a new law that compensates persons affected by the
creation of the mixed pension system. These funds are
recorded as revenues, consistent with the IMF’s methodology. Therefore, data and projections for 2018–22
are affected by these transfers, which amounted to
1.3 percent of GDP in 2018 and are projected to be
1.2 percent of GDP in 2019, 0.9 percent of GDP in
2020, 0.4 percent of GDP in 2021, 0.2 percent of GDP
in 2022, and zero percent of GDP thereafter. Please
see IMF Country Report 19/64 for further details. The
disclaimer about the public pension system applies only
to the revenues and net lending/borrowing series.
The coverage of the fiscal data for Uruguay was
changed from consolidated public sector (CPS) to
nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) with the October
2019 WEO. In Uruguay, NFPS coverage includes
central government, local government, social
security funds, nonfinancial public corporations,
and Banco de Seguros del Estado. Historical data were
also revised accordingly. Under this narrower fiscal
perimeter—which excludes the central bank—assets
and liabilities held by the NFPS where the counterpart
is the central bank are not netted out in debt figures.
In this context, capitalization bonds issued in the past
by the government to the central bank are now part of
the NFPS debt. Gross and net debt estimates for the
period 2008–11 are preliminary.
Projecting the economic outlook in Venezuela,
including assessing past and current economic

124

developments as the basis for the projections,
is complicated by the lack of discussions with the
authorities (the last Article IV consultation took place
in 2004), incomplete understanding of the reported
data, and difficulties in interpreting certain reported
economic indicators given economic developments.
The fiscal accounts include the budgetary central
government; social security; FOGADE (insurance
deposit institution); and a sample of public enterprises,
including Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA); and
data for 2018 are IMF staff estimates. The effects of
hyperinflation and the paucity of reported data mean
that the IMF staff’s estimated macroeconomic indicators need to be interpreted with caution. For example,
nominal GDP is estimated assuming the GDP deflator
rises in line with the IMF staff’s estimated average
inflation. Public external debt in relation to GDP is
estimated using the IMF staff’s estimate of the average
exchange rate for the year. Wide uncertainty surrounds
these projections. Venezuela’s consumer prices are
excluded from all WEO group composites.

Classification of Countries
Summary of the Country Classification
The country classification in the WEO divides the
world into two major groups: advanced economies
and emerging market and developing economies.4
This classification is not based on strict criteria,
economic or otherwise, and it has evolved over time.
The objective is to facilitate analysis by providing
a reasonably meaningful method of organizing
data. Table A provides an overview of the country
classification, showing the number of countries in each
group by region and summarizing some key indicators
of their relative size (GDP valued at purchasing
power parity, total exports of goods and services, and
population).
Some countries remain outside the country
classification and therefore are not included in the
analysis. Cuba and the Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea are examples of countries that are not IMF
members, and their economies therefore are not
monitored by the IMF.
4 As used here, the terms “country” and “economy” do not always
refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice. Some territorial entities included here are
not states, although their statistical data are maintained on a separate
and independent basis.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

General Features and Composition of Groups in
the World Economic Outlook Classification
Advanced Economies
The 39 advanced economies are listed in Table B.
The seven largest in terms of GDP based on market
exchange rates—the United States, Japan, Germany,
France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada—
constitute the subgroup of major advanced economies, often referred to as the Group of Seven (G7).
The members of the euro area are also distinguished
as a subgroup. Composite data shown in the tables
for the euro area cover the current members for all
years, even though the membership has increased over
time.
Table C lists the member countries of the European
Union, not all of which are classified as advanced
economies in the WEO.

Emerging Market and Developing Economies
The group of emerging market and developing economies (155) includes all those that are not classified as
advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging market and
developing economies are emerging and developing
Asia; emerging and developing Europe (sometimes
also referred to as “central and eastern Europe”); Latin
America and the Caribbean (LAC); Middle East and
Central Asia (MECA, which comprises the regional
subgroups Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan,
and Pakistan; and Caucasus and Central Asia); and
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Emerging market and developing economies
are also classified according to analytical criteria.
The analytical criteria reflect the composition of
export earnings and a distinction between net creditor
and net debtor economies. The detailed composition
of emerging market and developing economies
in the regional and analytical groups is shown in
Tables D and E.

The analytical criterion source of export earnings distinguishes between the categories fuel (Standard International Trade Classification [SITC] 3) and nonfuel
and then focuses on nonfuel primary products (SITCs
0, 1, 2, 4, and 68). Economies are categorized into one
of these groups if their main source of export earnings exceeded 50 percent of total exports on average
between 2014 and 2018.
The financial criteria focus on net creditor economies,
net debtor economies, heavily indebted poor countries
(HIPCs), and low-income developing countries (LIDCs).
Economies are categorized as net debtors when their
latest net international investment position, where
available, was less than zero or their current account
balance accumulations from 1972 (or earliest available
data) to 2018 were negative. Net debtor economies are
further differentiated on the basis of experience with
debt servicing.5
The HIPC group comprises the countries that are or
have been considered by the IMF and the World Bank
for participation in their debt initiative known as the
HIPC Initiative, which aims to reduce the external debt
burdens of all the eligible HIPCs to a “sustainable” level
in a reasonably short period of time.6 Many of these
countries have already benefited from debt relief and
have graduated from the initiative.
The LIDCs are countries that have per capita
income levels below a certain threshold (set at $2,700
in 2016 as measured by the World Bank’s Atlas
method), structural features consistent with limited
development and structural transformation, and
external financial linkages insufficiently close for them
to be widely seen as emerging market economies.
5 During 2014–18, 25 economies incurred external
payments arrears or entered into official or commercial bank
debt-rescheduling agreements. This group is referred to as economies
with arrears and/or rescheduling during 2014–18.
6 See David Andrews, Anthony R. Boote, Syed S. Rizavi,
and Sukwinder Singh, “Debt Relief for Low-Income Countries:
The Enhanced HIPC Initiative,” IMF Pamphlet Series 51
(Washington, DC: International Monetary Fund, November 1999).

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: GLOBAL MANUFAC TURING DOWNTURN, RISING TR ADE BARRIERS

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions Underlying the Projections for Selected Economies
Fiscal Policy Assumptions
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in
the World Economic Outlook (WEO) are normally
based on officially announced budgets, adjusted for
differences between the national authorities and the
IMF staff regarding macroeconomic assumptions and
projected fiscal outturns. When no official budget has
been announced, projections incorporate policy measures that are judged likely to be implemented. The
medium-term fiscal projections are similarly based on
a judgment about the most likely path of policies. For
cases in which the IMF staff has insufficient information to assess the authorities’ budget intentions and
prospects for policy implementation, an unchanged
structural primary balance is assumed unless indicated
otherwise. Specific assumptions used in regard to some
of the advanced economies follow. (See also Tables B5
to B9 in the online section of the Statistical Appendix
for data on fiscal net lending/borrowing and structural
balances.)1
Argentina: Fiscal projections are based on the available information regarding budget outturn and budget
plans for the federal and provincial governments, fiscal
measures announced by the authorities, and the IMF
staff’s macroeconomic projections.
Australia: Fiscal projections are based on data from
the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the fiscal year
2019/20 budgets of the commonwealth and states,
and the IMF staff’s estimates and projections.
Austria: Fiscal projections are based on data from
Statistics Austria, the authorities’ projections, and the
IMF staff’s estimates and projections.
Belgium: Projections are based on the 2019–22
Stability Programme and other available information
1 The output gap is actual minus potential output, as a
percentage of potential output. Structural balances are expressed
as a percentage of potential output. The structural balance is the
actual net lending/borrowing minus the effects of cyclical output
from potential output, corrected for one-time and other factors,
such as asset and commodity prices and output composition
effects. Changes in the structural balance consequently include
effects of temporary fiscal measures, the impact of fluctuations
in interest rates and debt-service costs, and other noncyclical
fluctuations in net lending/borrowing. The computations of
structural balances are based on the IMF staff’s estimates of
potential GDP and revenue and expenditure elasticities. (See
Annex I of the October 1993 WEO.) Net debt is calculated as
gross debt minus financial assets corresponding to debt instruments. Estimates of the output gap and of the structural balance
are subject to significant margins of uncertainty.

on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for
the IMF staff’s assumptions.
Brazil: Fiscal projections for 2019 take into account
the deficit target approved in the budget law.
Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts in the
2019 federal budget and the latest provincial budget
updates as available. The IMF staff makes some adjustments to these forecasts, including for differences in
macroeconomic projections. The IMF staff’s forecast
also incorporates the most recent data releases from Statistics Canada’s Canadian System of National Economic
Accounts, including federal, provincial, and territorial
budgetary outturns through the first quarter of 2019.
Chile: Projections are based on the authorities’
budget projections, adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s
projections for GDP and copper prices.
China: Fiscal expansion is expected for 2019 due
to a series of tax reforms and expenditure measures in
response to the economic slowdown.
Denmark: Estimates for 2018 are aligned with the
latest official budget numbers, adjusted where appropriate for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions.
For 2019, the projections incorporate key features
of the medium-term fiscal plan as embodied in the
authorities’ Convergence Programme 2019 submitted
to the European Union.
France: Projections for 2019 and beyond are based
on the measures of the 2018 budget law, the multiyear
law for 2018–22, and the 2019 budget law, adjusted
for differences in assumptions on macroeconomic and
financial variables, and revenue projections. Historical
fiscal data reflect the May 2019 revisions and update
of the historical fiscal accounts, debt data, and
national accounts.
Germany: The IMF staff’s projections for 2019
and beyond are based on the 2019 Stability Program
and data updates from the national statistical agency,
adjusted for the differences in the IMF staff’s macroeconomic framework and assumptions concerning
revenue elasticities. The estimate of gross debt includes
portfolios of impaired assets and noncore business
transferred to institutions that are winding up, as well
as other financial sector and EU support operations.
Greece: Greece’s general government primary balance
estimate for 2018 is based on the April 2019 Excessive
Deficit Procedure release by Eurostat. Historical data
since 2010 reflect adjustments in line with the primary
balance definition under the enhanced surveillance
framework for Greece.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1 (continued)
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: Projections
are based on the authorities’ medium-term fiscal projections on expenditures.
Hungary: Fiscal projections include the IMF staff’s
projections of the macroeconomic framework and of
the impact of recent legislative measures, as well as fiscal policy plans announced in the 2018 budget.
India: Historical data are based on budgetary execution data. Projections are based on available information
on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for the
IMF staff’s assumptions. Subnational data are incorporated with a lag of up to one year; general government
data are thus finalized well after central government
data. IMF and Indian presentations differ, particularly
regarding disinvestment and license-auction proceeds,
net versus gross recording of revenues in certain minor
categories, and some public-sector lending.
Indonesia: IMF projections are based on moderate
tax policy and administration reforms and a gradual
increase in social and capital spending over the
medium term in line with fiscal space.
Ireland: Fiscal projections are based on the country’s
Budget 2019.
Israel: Historical data are based on government
finance statistics data prepared by the Central Bureau
of Statistics. The medium-term fiscal projections are
not in line with medium-term fiscal targets, consistent
with long experience of revisions to those targets.
Italy: The IMF staff’s estimates and projections are
informed by the fiscal plans included in the government’s 2019 budget and April 2019 Economic and
Financial Document. The IMF staff assumes that the
automatic value-added tax hikes for future years will
be canceled.
Japan: The projections reflect the consumption tax
rate increase in October 2019, the mitigating measures
included in the FY2019 budget and tax reform,
and other fiscal measures already announced by the
government.
Korea: The medium-term forecast incorporates the
medium-term path for public spending announced by
the government.
Mexico: Fiscal projections for 2019 are broadly in
line with the approved budget; projections for 2020
onward assume compliance with rules established in
the Fiscal Responsibility Law.
Netherlands: Fiscal projections for 2019–24 are
based on the authorities’ Bureau for Economic Policy
Analysis budget projections, after differences in

macroeconomic assumptions are adjusted for. Historical data were revised following the June 2014 Central
Bureau of Statistics release of revised macro data
because of the adoption of the European System of
National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and the
revisions of data sources.
New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on the fiscal year 2019/20 budget and the IMF staff’s estimates.
Portugal: The projections for the current year are
based on the authorities’ approved budget, adjusted
to reflect the IMF staff’s macroeconomic forecast.
Projections thereafter are based on the assumption of
unchanged policies.
Puerto Rico: Fiscal projections are based on the
Puerto Rico Fiscal and Economic Growth Plans
(FEGPs), which were prepared in October 2018, and
are certified by the Oversight Board. In line with this
plan’s assumptions, IMF projections assume federal aid
for rebuilding after Hurricane Maria, which devastated
the island in September 2017. The projections also
assume revenue losses from the following: elimination
of federal funding for the Affordable Care Act starting in 2020 for Puerto Rico; elimination of federal
tax incentives starting in 2018 that had neutralized
the effects of Puerto Rico’s Act 154 on foreign firms;
and the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which
reduce the tax advantage of US firms producing in
Puerto Rico. Given sizable policy uncertainty, some
FEGP and IMF assumptions may differ, in particular those relating to the effects of the corporate tax
reform, tax compliance, and tax adjustments (fees and
rates); reduction of subsidies and expenses, freezing of payroll operational costs, and improvement of
mobility; reduction of expenses; and increased health
care efficiency. On the expenditure side, measures
include extension of Act 66, which freezes much
government spending, through 2020; reduction of
operating costs; decreases in government subsidies;
and spending cuts in education. Although IMF policy
assumptions are similar to those in the FEGP scenario
with full measures, the IMF’s projections of fiscal
revenues, expenditures, and balance are different from
the FEGPs’. This stems from two main differences in
methodologies: first, while IMF projections are on an
accrual basis, the FEGPs’ are on a cash basis. Second,
the IMF and FEGPs make very different macroeconomic assumptions.
Russia: Projections for 2019–24 are based on the
new oil price rule, with adjustments by the IMF staff.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: GLOBAL MANUFAC TURING DOWNTURN, RISING TR ADE BARRIERS

Box A1 (continued)
Saudi Arabia: The IMF staff baseline projections
of total government revenues, except exported oil
revenues, are based on IMF staff understanding of
government policies as announced in the 2019 Budget
and Fiscal Balance Program 2019 Update. Exported
oil revenues are based on WEO baseline oil prices and
the assumption that Saudi Arabia will overperform
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries+
agreement. Expenditure projections take the 2019
budget and the Fiscal Balance Program 2019 Update
as a starting point and reflect IMF staff estimates
of the latest changes in policies and economic
developments.
Singapore: For fiscal year 2019, projections are based
on budget numbers. For the rest of the projection
period, the IMF staff assumes unchanged policies.
South Africa: Fiscal assumptions are based on the
2019 Budget Review and the special appropriation
of July 2019 for Eskom. Nontax revenue excludes
transactions in financial assets and liabilities, as they
involve primarily revenues associated with realized
exchange rate valuation gains from the holding of foreign currency deposits, sale of assets, and conceptually
similar items.
Spain: For 2019, projections assume expenditures
under the 2018 budget extension scenario and already
legislated measures, including pension and public wage
increases, and the IMF staff’s projection of revenues.
For 2020 and beyond, fiscal projections are IMF staff
projections, which assume an unchanged structural
primary balance.
Sweden: Fiscal projections take into account the
authorities’ projections based on the 2019 Spring Budget. The impact of cyclical developments on the fiscal
accounts is calculated using the 2014 Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development’s elasticity
to take into account output and employment gaps.
Switzerland: The projections assume that fiscal
policy is adjusted as necessary to keep fiscal balances in
line with the requirements of Switzerland’s fiscal rules.
Turkey: The fiscal projections assume a more negative primary and overall balance than envisaged in
the authorities’ New Economic Program 2019–21,
based partly on recent weak growth and fiscal outturns and partly on definitional differences: the basis
for the projections in the WEO and Fiscal Monitor is
the IMF-defined fiscal balance, which excludes some
revenue and expenditure items that are included in the
authorities’ headline balance.

144

United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based on
the UK’s Spring Statement 2019, with expenditure
projections based on the budgeted nominal values, but
adjusted to account for the Spending Round 2019,
and with revenue projections adjusted for differences
between the IMF staff’s forecasts of macroeconomic variables (such as GDP growth and inflation) and the forecasts of these variables assumed in the authorities’ fiscal
projections. The IMF staff’s data exclude public sector
banks and the effect of transferring assets from the Royal
Mail Pension Plan to the public sector in April 2012.
Real government consumption and investment are part
of the real GDP path, which, according to the IMF
staff, may or may not be the same as projected by the
UK Office for Budget Responsibility. Fiscal year GDP is
different from current year GDP. The fiscal accounts are
presented in terms of fiscal year. Projections do not take
into account revisions to the accounting (including on
student loans) implemented on September 24, 2019.
United States: Fiscal projections are based on the
August 2019 Congressional Budget Office baseline,
adjusted for the IMF staff’s policy and macroeconomic
assumptions. Projections incorporate the effects of tax
reform (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law at the
end of 2017), the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 passed
in February 2018, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019
passed in July 2019. Finally, fiscal projections are adjusted
to reflect the IMF staff’s forecasts for key macroeconomic
and financial variables and different accounting treatment
of financial sector support and of defined-benefit pension
plans and are converted to a general government basis.
Data is compiled using SNA 2008; when translated into
government finance statistics, this is in accordance with
the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014. Because
of data limitations, most series begin in 2001.

Monetary Policy Assumptions
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the
established policy framework in each country. In
most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative stance
over the business cycle: official interest rates will
increase when economic indicators suggest that inflation will rise above its acceptable rate or range; they
will decrease when indicators suggest inflation will
not exceed the acceptable rate or range, that output
growth is below its potential rate, and that the margin
of slack in the economy is significant. On this basis,
the London interbank offered rate on six-month US

dollar deposits is assumed to average 2.3 percent in
2019 and 2.0 percent in 2020 (see Table 1.1). The rate
on three-month euro deposits is assumed to average
–0.4 percent in 2019 and –0.6 percent in 2020.
The interest rate on six-month Japanese yen deposits is assumed to average 0.0 percent in 2019 and
–0.1 percent in 2020.
Argentina: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with the current monetary policy framework,
which targets zero base money growth in seasonally
adjusted terms.
Australia: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with market expectations.
Brazil: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent
with gradual convergence of inflation toward the
middle of the target range.
Canada: Monetary policy assumptions are based on
the IMF staff’s analysis.
China: Monetary policy is expected to remain on
hold.
Denmark: Monetary policy is to maintain the peg to
the euro.
Euro area: Monetary policy assumptions for euro
area member countries are in line with market
expectations.
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: The IMF
staff assumes that the currency board system will
remain intact.
India: Monetary policy projections are consistent
with achieving the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation
target over the medium term.

Indonesia: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with the maintenance of inflation within the central
bank’s targeted band.
Japan: Monetary policy assumptions are in line with
market expectations.
Korea: The projections assume no change in the
policy rate in 2019–20.
Mexico: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent
with attaining the inflation target.
Russia: Monetary projections assume that the
Central Bank of Russia is moving toward a neutral
monetary policy stance.
Saudi Arabia: Monetary policy projections are based
on the continuation of the exchange rate peg to the
US dollar.
Singapore: Broad money is projected to grow in line
with the projected growth in nominal GDP.
South Africa: Monetary policy will be moderately
accommodative.
Sweden: Monetary projections are in line with
Riksbank projections.
Switzerland: The projections assume no change in
the policy rate in 2019–20.
Turkey: The outlook for monetary and financial conditions assumes further monetary policy easing in 2019.
United Kingdom: The short-term interest rate path is
based on market interest rate expectations.
United States: The IMF staff expects the Federal
Open Market Committee to continue to adjust the
federal funds target rate in line with the broader
macroeconomic outlook.

Note: The methodology and specific assumptions for each country are discussed in Box A1. The country group composites for fiscal data are calculated as the sum of the US dollar values
for the relevant individual countries.
1Debt data refer to the end of the year and are not always comparable across countries. Gross and net debt levels reported by national statistical agencies for countries that have adopted
the System of National Accounts 2008 (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong SAR, United States) are adjusted to exclude unfunded pension liabilities of government employees’ defined-benefit
pension plans. Fiscal data for the aggregated major advanced economies and the United States start in 2001, and the average for the aggregate and the United States is therefore for the
period 2001–07.
2Percent of potential GDP.
3Figures reported by the national statistical agency are adjusted to exclude items related to the accrual-basis accounting of government employees’ defined-benefit pension plans.
4Nonconsolidated basis.
5Includes equity shares.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance-of-payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the US dollar
values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook, in which the composites were weighted by GDP
valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. The estimates of gross national savings and investment (or gross capital formation) are from individual countries’ national
accounts statistics. The estimates of the current account balance, the capital account balance, and the financial account balance (or net lending/net borrowing) are from the balance-of-payments
statistics. The link between domestic transactions and transactions with the rest of the world can be expressed as accounting identities. Savings (S ) minus investment (I ) is equal to the current
account balance (CAB ) (S – I = CAB ). Also, net lending/net borrowing (NLB ) is the sum of the current account balance and the capital account balance (KAB ) (NLB = CAB + KAB ). In practice,
these identities do not hold exactly; imbalances result from imperfections in source data and compilation as well as from asymmetries in group composition due to data availability.
1Excludes the Group of Seven (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and euro area countries.

IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK,
OCTOBER 2019

The following remarks were made by the Chair at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the
Fiscal Monitor, Global Financial Stability Report, and World Economic Outlook on October 3, 2019.

E

xecutive Directors broadly shared the assess‑
ment of global economic prospects and risks.
They observed that global growth in 2019 is
expected to slow to its lowest level since the
global financial crisis, reflecting a broad‑based weak‑
ening of industrial output and business confidence
amid rising trade tensions. While growth is expected
to pick up modestly in 2020, the outlook is precari‑
ously hinged on a turnaround in a small number of
countries that are currently underperforming or under
stress. Meanwhile, overall growth in low‑income
developing countries continues to be relatively resilient,
although prospects for convergence toward advanced
economy income levels remain challenging.
Directors noted with concern that the global econ‑
omy faces increased downside risks. Most notable
in the near term are intensifying trade, technology,
and geopolitical tensions with associated increases in
policy uncertainty. Directors also pointed to the risk
of an abrupt tightening of financial conditions that
could be triggered by a range of events. They noted
that downside risks remain elevated in the medium
term, reflecting increased trade barriers, a further
accumulation of financial vulnerabilities, and the
consequences of unmitigated climate change.
Given these risks, Directors stressed the need to
enhance multilateral cooperation, with most consid‑
ering it a priority to de‑escalate trade tensions, roll
back the recent tariff increases, and resolve trade
disagreements cooperatively. Directors also urged
policymakers to limit greenhouse gas emissions and
reduce global imbalances. Closer multilateral coop‑
eration on international taxation and global financial
regulatory reforms would help address vulnerabilities
and broaden the gains from economic integration.
Directors underscored the urgency of deploying
policies proactively to secure growth and enhance
resilience. They supported the more accommodative
monetary policy stance in many economies while

emphasizing the continued importance of remaining
data‑dependent and clearly communicating policy
decisions. Directors noted that the very low interest
rates have expanded fiscal resources in many coun‑
tries. They broadly agreed that, where fiscal space
exists and debt is sustainable, high‑quality fiscal
policy should be used to support aggregate demand
where needed. Ensuring debt sustainability requires
rebuilding buffers in countries with relatively weaker
fiscal positions, although the pace could be calibrated
as market conditions permit to avoid prolonged
economic weakness and disinflationary dynamics.
If downside risks materialize, policymakers should
stand ready to implement a contingent, and possibly
coordinated, response.
Directors emphasized the importance of
growth‑enhancing structural reforms in all econo‑
mies. The priority is to raise medium‑term growth,
improve inclusiveness, and strengthen resilience.
Structural policies can help ease adjustment to shocks
and boost output over the medium term, narrow
within‑country income differences, and encourage
faster convergence across countries. Many countries
should continue to strengthen institutions, gover‑
nance, and policy frameworks to bolster resilience
and growth prospects.
Directors noted that the prolonged low inter‑
est rate environment in advanced economies has
encouraged risk‑taking, including among institu‑
tional investors, and led to a continued build‑up
in financial vulnerabilities. These include rising
risks in non‑bank financial institutions, mounting
corporate debt burdens, and a growing reliance on
external borrowing by emerging and frontier market
economies. Directors highlighted the urgent need
to safeguard financial stability through stronger
and broader macroprudential policies, and address
corporate vulnerabilities with stricter supervision
and oversight. They also supported the call for

strengthened oversight and disclosures of institu‑
tional investors and prudent sovereign debt manage‑
ment practices and frameworks, as well as a closer
monitoring of U.S. dollar funding fragility. Directors
reiterated their call for the full implementation of
the global regulatory reform agenda.
Directors noted that emerging market and devel‑
oping economies need to implement an appropriate
mix of fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and macro‑
prudential policies. Ensuring financial resilience is
a priority in emerging and frontier markets that are
vulnerable to abrupt reversals of capital flows.
Directors urged low‑income developing econo‑
mies to adopt policies aimed at lifting potential
growth, improving inclusiveness, and combating
challenges that hinder progress toward the 2030
Sustainable Development Goals. Priorities include
strengthening monetary and macroprudential
policy frameworks and tackling debt vulnerabili‑
ties. Directors emphasized the need for fiscal policy
to be in line with debt sustainability and progress
toward development goals, importantly through
building tax capacity while protecting the vulner‑
able. Complementarity between domestic revenues,
official assistance, and private financing is essential
for success, while investing in disaster readiness and
climate‑smart infrastructure will also be important.
Countries need to improve education quality, narrow
infrastructure gaps, enhance financial inclusion, and

188

boost private investment. Commodity exporters
should continue diversifying their economies.
Directors broadly welcomed the focus of the
Fiscal Monitor on climate change. Most Directors
concurred that carbon taxation, or similar pricing
approaches such as emissions trading systems, is
an effective tool for reducing emissions. Depending
on country circumstances and preferences, other
approaches, such as feebates and regulations, are also
worth considering. Directors noted that, for climate
change mitigation policies to be widely acceptable,
they should be part of a comprehensive strategy that
includes productive and equitable use of revenues, a
social safety net for vulnerable groups, and support‑
ive measures for clean technology investment. While
many Directors noted that an international carbon
price floor could help scale up mitigation efforts, fur‑
ther work and greater collaboration at the global level
would be necessary to reach a broad‑based agree‑
ment on a fair burden‑sharing basis. Many Directors
took the opportunity to welcome the Fund’s work on
analyzing mitigation policy options and integrating
such analysis into its surveillance activity, leverag‑
ing the expertise within its mandate. Most Directors
welcomed the attention paid to sustainable finance
that embraces environmental, social, and governance
considerations in investment decisions, and empha‑
sized the importance of continued cooperation with
other international organizations.
