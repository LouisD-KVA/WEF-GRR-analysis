TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2018

FOREWORD

FOREWORD
We live at a time of technological change that is unprecedented in its pace, scope and depth of impact. Harnessing
that progress is the surest path for the international community to deliver on the 2030 agenda for people,
peace and prosperity. Frontier technologies hold the promise to revive productivity and make plentiful resources
available to end poverty for good, enable more sustainable patterns of growth and mitigate or even reverse
decades of environmental degradation. But technological change and innovation need to be directed towards
inclusive and sustainable outcomes through a purposeful effort by governments, in collaboration with civil society,
business and academia. If policy-makers are not proactive technological disruption can entrench inequality,
further marginalize the poorest, and fuel reactionary movements against open societies and economies.
The Technology and Innovation Report 2018: Harnessing Frontier Technologies for Sustainable Development
notes that change is becoming exponential thanks to the power of digital platforms and innovative combinations
of different technologies that become possible every day. This opens exciting possibilities for the democratization
of frontier technologies to materialize in development solutions. The Report proposes strategies and actions,
some of them based on existing experiences in STI policy for development, and some more innovative ones to
make technology an effective means of implementation of our common development agenda ‚Äì nationally and
globally.
The Report also suggests that countries develop policies to help people navigate the transition period that lies
ahead. This may require that stakeholders adapt the social contract to the new world that frontier technologies
are forming. Education will become an even more indispensable lever for development and social justice. Since
digital technologies as enablers and multipliers of other frontier technologies we should ensure that all ‚Äì and
specially women and girls ‚Äì are given a real chance to build digital capabilities. Lifelong learning will need to be
supported. For those who may struggle to keep up with the transformation, countries will have to be innovative
in providing effective social protection mechanisms.
Most crucially, there is an urgent need for a sustained effort by the international community to ensure that
the multiple gaps in technological capabilities that separate developed and developing countries are closed.
Investment in hard and soft infrastructure and human capital, complemented by a scaled up, coherent and
accelerated effort to enhance innovation systems for sustainable development are necessary to spread the

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2018

OVERVIEW

OVERVIEW
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development sets
ambitious global goals, demanding unprecedented
actions and efforts across multiple interconnected
social, economic and environmental issues. Science,
technology and innovation (STI) must play a central
role in the achievement of these goals. The process
of creative destruction initiated by technological
progress can help to transform economies and
improve living standards, by increasing productivity,
reducing production costs and prices, and helping to
raise real wages.
Harnessing frontier technologies ‚Äì combined with
action to address persistent gaps among developed
and developing countries in access and use of existing
technologies, and to develop innovations (including
non-technological and new forms of social innovation)
‚Äì could be transformative in achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals and producing more prosperous,
sustainable, healthy and inclusive societies. They
offer the prospect of solutions and opportunities for
sustainable development that are better, cheaper,
faster, scalable and easy to use. The extent of the
developmental impact of technological advances
has already been seen in the transformative effects
of information and communication technologies
(ICTs) in many low-income economies, while the
potential to increase the environmental sustainability
of development is evident in recent advances in
renewable energy. However, new technologies
threaten to outpace the ability of societies and
policymakers to adapt to the changes they create,
giving rise to widespread anxiety and ambivalence or
hostility to some technological advances.

I.

FEATURES AND POTENTIAL OF
FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES

The dramatically accelerating pace of development
and adoption of new technologies in recent decades
is likely to continue, driven by (a) the cumulative nature
of technological change; (b) the exponential nature of
technologies such as microchips, which have doubled
in power every two years for half a century; (c) the
convergence of technologies into new combinations;
(d) dramatic reductions in costs; (e) the emergence
of digital ‚Äúplatforms of platforms‚Äù ‚Äì most notably the
Internet; and (f) declining entry costs.

Several frontier technologies show the greatest
potential to enable the achievement of the Sustainable
Development Goals. Big data analysis can help to
manage or resolve critical global issues, create new
VFLHQWL∆ÑF EUHDNWKURXJKV DGYDQFH KXPDQ KHDOWK DQG
improve decision-making, by providing real-time
streams of information. The Internet of Things allows
the condition and actions of connected objects and
machines to be monitored and managed, and allows
more effective monitoring of the natural world, animals
and people. These two technologies have important
applications in health care, agriculture, energy and
water management and quality, as well as in monitoring
development indicators to assess progress towards
the Sustainable Development Goals. Governments
should consider developing strategies to harness
these technologies towards their development goals.

robotics, also has the potential to transform production
processes and business, especially in manufacturing.
So too does 3D printing, which can allow faster and
cheaper low-volume production of complex products
and components, and rapid iterative prototyping of
new manufactured products. In addition to offering
some potential carbon savings by reducing the need to

countries, businesses and universities, allowing
monitoring of crops and environmental damage.

II.

ECONOMIC AND SOCIETAL
CHALLENGES

The relationship between technology and employment
has long been controversial. Like earlier technological
advances, frontier technologies can be expected to
eliminate some jobs, while creating others. While the
net effect on employment remains ambiguous, there
are already signs of a polarization of employment
between low- and high-skilled non-routine jobs,
as jobs at medium skill levels have declined. There
are also signs that the net impacts may be most
unfavourable for women.
For most developing countries, the impact of frontier
technologies on employment is likely to depend less
on their technological feasibility than on their economic
feasibility. Fears about short-term adverse effects of
digitalization and automation on employment may
be exaggerated, particularly if labour and education
policies promote complementarity between skills
available in the workforce and new technologies. Since
the impact of technology depends on the structure of
each country‚Äôs economy, the impact at the national
level cannot be assumed to be necessarily negative,
but rather requires a balanced analysis of the net
effects of technological and market forces. Thus, the
future lies in workers creating economic value with
machines rather than against them.
Effects on productivity are also ambiguous, as
emerging technologies will by no means be universally
adopted. Expert opinion is divided between those
who see a secular decline in productivity, and those
ZKR VHH D GLYHUJHQFH EHWZHHQ qIURQWLHUr ∆ÑUPV WKDW
adopt new technologies and reach historically high
SURGXFWLYLW\DQGRWKHU∆ÑUPVWKDWODJEHKLQG+RZHYHU
the interpretation of current trends is complicated
by issues pertaining to the appropriateness of
existing indicators to measure productivity in the new
technological era.
Emerging digital technologies such as big data and
the Internet of Things also give rise to important
issues of citizen‚Äôs rights, privacy, data ownership and
online security. This highlights the need for effective
institutional frameworks and regulatory regimes for
data collection, use and access, to safeguard privacy

and security, balancing individual and collective
rights and allowing private sector innovation. Similar
considerations apply to concerns about technological
convergence driving simultaneous convergence in
platforms, commercial interest and investments that
can result in concentration of market power.
While the implications of frontier technologies remain
uncertain, it is clear that they hold the potential
for profound positive implications for almost every
aspect of sustainable development. They also involve
a potential risk of exacerbating existing economic,
social and technological divides, as countries with
strong existing capabilities harness new technologies
for development, leaving others ever further behind.
Applying technology to the challenges of achieving
the Sustainable Development Goals requires building
local capacities and developing policies and an
enabling environment ‚Äì as well as unprecedented
resource mobilization, partnerships and multilateral
global collaboration ‚Äì to (a) fund research and
development (R&D) that is relevant to the Sustainable
Development Goals; (b) build networks; (c) strengthen
the global science‚Äìpolicy interface; (d) transfer
technologies; and (e) support the development of
capabilities in developing countries. Current national
and international efforts are seriously inadequate for
this task. Wide and persistent gaps in STI capacities,
PXOWLSOHGLJLWDOGLYLGHVDQGLQVXI∆ÑFLHQWLQYHVWPHQWVLQ
STI limit the discovery, development, dissemination
and absorption of technologies that could accelerate
the achievement of the SDGs. Alongside resource
mobilization, a scaled up and accelerated application
of policies is needed to enhance innovation systems
for sustainable development and spread the

technologies.

III. THE DIVIDE IN TECHNOLOGICAL
CAPABILITIES
Capabilities are critical to countries‚Äô ability to exploit
the opportunities offered by new and emerging
technologies ‚Äì and there is a wide gap in capabilities
between developed and developing countries.
R&D expenditures in developing countries (except for
the Republic of Korea, Singapore and China), remain
much smaller both in absolute terms and relative to
gross domestic product, than the world average. In

THE CRITICAL ROLE OF SKILLS
TO COMPLEMENT FRONTIER
TECHNOLOGIES

Research capacity, however, is only one aspect
of the capabilities needed for the exploitation of
new technologies. Also important are generic, core
and fundamental skills that are complementary to
new technologies ‚Äì such as literacy, numeracy
and basic academic skills ‚Äì together with
basic financial and entrepreneurial skills and,
increasingly, basic digital and even coding skills.
Internet access is also critical. Besides advanced
cognitive skills, such as STEM, inherently human
skills and aptitudes are also gaining increasing
importance, as they are difficult for robots and
machines to emulate. These include various
behavioural, interpersonal and socio-emotional
skills, creativity, intuition, imagination, curiosity,
risk-taking, open-mindedness, logical thinking,
problem-solving, decision-making, empathy and
emotional intelligence, communication, persuasion
and negotiation skills, networking and teamwork,
and the capacity to adapt and learn new abilities.
Matching the supply of skills to rapidly evolving market
needs is critical. This requires agility in education
policies, and may mean transforming education and
training systems, as there are signs that education
institutions are not keeping pace with technological
advances, giving rise to skills shortages, especially
in digital technologies. While big data can play an

important role, this also requires a holistic approach,
with collaboration among policymakers, education
and training systems, and employers.
Curricula need to be adapted to emphasize the skills
WKDWDUHEHFRPLQJPRUHVLJQL∆ÑFDQW7HDFKHUVpPHWKRGV
also need to change to reorient education towards more
practical, applied and experimental learning approaches,
and the development of skills, competencies and
capacities for continuous learning. Digital and online
methods have an increasing role to play.

V.

TECHNOLOGY AND DIGITAL GENDER
DIVIDES

A key issue is the gender divide in STEM,
information technology and computing. Globally,

2013, with still wider gender gaps in South and
West Asia, and in East Asia and the Pacific.
Despite increases in sub-Saharan Africa, the Arab
world and parts of Asia, the proportion of women
researchers in engineering and technology in most
GHYHORSLQJFRXQWULHVLVt}SHUFHQW:RPHQDUH
also a steadily declining minority among graduates
in computer science, and are underrepresented
among STI decision makers.
Women are also seriously underrepresented in the
digital sector. There is a major gender divide in mobile
phone ownership, especially in South Asia, and in
Internet use, especially in LDCs and sub-Saharan
Africa, where the gap has widened since 2013.
The gender gap in access to the Internet is now an
LQWROHUDEOH}SHUFHQWLQGHYHORSLQJFRXQWULHVDQG
11.3 for the world a s a whole.
Access to energy is a major constraint to increasing
ICT access for men and women alike, especially in rural
areas. Decentralized energy systems, based on minior microgrids using renewable energy technologies,
offer considerable potential to address this issue,
particularly in LDCs, if technological, economic,

countries in STI capabilities can both perpetuate
existing inequalities and create new inequalities,
particularly affecting LDCs. Addressing this divide will
require strengthening national strategies in developing
countries, as well as complementary international
support measures, to enable them to harness new
and emerging technologies effectively for sustainable
development.

HARNESSING FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

VI. HARNESSING FRONTIER
TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRES
ATTENTION TO THE BASICS OF STI
POLICY
The overarching challenge for developing countries to
UHDSWKHEHQH∆ÑWVIURPIURQWLHUWHFKQRORJLHVDVPXFK
as from more established ones, is to learn, adopt and
disseminate knowledge and technologies to promote
sustainable development. Success is dependent on
the effectiveness of relevant innovation systems,
which are weaker and more prone to systemic failures
DQG VWUXFWXUDO GH∆ÑFLHQFLHV LQ GHYHORSLQJ FRXQWULHV
:KLOH FHQWUHG RQ ∆ÑUPV LQQRYDWLRQ V\VWHPV WKDW
also encompass research and education systems,
government, civil society and consumers ‚Äì and
their effectiveness ‚Äì rest on the capabilities of these
various actors, the connections among them, and
the enabling environment for innovation that they
create.
In developing countries with nascent innovation

capacity to learn how to adopt, assimilate and diffuse
existing knowledge and technologies. This is an
essential requirement for technology transfer, which is
a complement to, not a substitute for, efforts to build
endogenous innovation potential.
Connections among actors are equally essential,
to facilitate learning, technology adoption and the
development of new technologies. This requires
networking and collaboration capabilities among all
actors, even where there are innovation intermediaries
or knowledge and technology brokers. Where the
local knowledge base is underdeveloped and access
to market intelligence limited, developing links with

key step. While innovation collaboration can occur
spontaneously, it often requires active facilitation by
government or non-government actors, especially in
areas related to social and environmental challenges.
An effective innovation system requires attention to
WKH ∆ÑYH NH\ HOHPHQWV of innovation systems as an
enabling environment:
(a) The regulatory and policy framework, which should
provide a stable and predictable environment to
IDFLOLWDWH ORQJWHUP SODQQLQJ E\ ∆ÑUPV DQG RWKHU
innovation actors;
(b) The institutional setting and governance, which

with
organizational
capabilities and managerial competences;
(d) Human capital, including both the technical and

to meeting the needs of innovation, particularly in
the earliest stages of technology development and
innovation, due to a combination of uncertainty and
market failures related to asymmetric information,
principal‚Äìagent problems and the limited ability of
private agents to appropriate knowledge.
This has led to most Governments becoming
LQYROYHG GLUHFWO\ RU LQGLUHFWO\ LQ ∆ÑQDQFLQJ 5 '
technology and innovation. Tax incentives are
widely used, and have generally been found
WR EH HIIHFWLYH EXW ZLWK XQFHUWDLQ ∆ÑVFDO FRVWV
However, successful innovation systems require
D FRPELQDWLRQ RI SXEOLF ∆ÑQDQFH DQG GHYHORSPHQW
bank funding, often including grants, with private
capital, market-based solutions and philanthropic
∆ÑQDQFLQJ$QLPSRUWDQWREMHFWLYHRI67,SROLF\LVWR
SURPRWH WKH GHYHORSPHQW RI ∆ÑQDQFLQJ LQVWUXPHQWV
appropriate to each stage of the innovation process.
Useful mechanisms include matching grants for
seed funding, and lending or loan guarantees by
development banks in priority areas.
Intellectual property protection, particularly through
patents, is an important issue for innovation. Such
protection has strengthened in recent years, partly as
a result of ‚ÄúTRIPS (trade-related intellectual property
rights)-plus‚Äù provisions in free trade agreements and
bilateral investment agreements. While intended
to promote innovation, patent protection does not
necessarily lead to better development outcomes, as
most patents have been taken by foreign rather than
GRPHVWLF∆ÑUPVOLPLWLQJWKHVFRSHIRUORFDOLQQRYDWLRQ

OVERVIEW

Creation of low-cost research activities is generally a
higher priority, and may be encouraged by a ‚Äúpetty
patent‚Äù system, granting less stringent protection to
relatively unsophisticated innovations.
While strengthening intellectual property protection
globally was intended to encourage technology
transfer, particularly to LDCs, it can do so only as
part of the wider indigenous innovation system, in
conjunction with industrial and other policies, and with
adequate local capabilities.
There are important areas of tension between
intellectual property protection and the realization of
the potential of frontier technologies in areas such
as agriculture, health and energy, suggesting that an
exclusive focus on strengthening intellectual property
protection may be inappropriate. The principle of policy
VSDFHIRU∆ÖH[LELOLW\DQGLQFOXVLYHQHVVLVIXQGDPHQWDO
to allow intellectual property regimes to be geared
to each country‚Äôs needs and capacities, through an
appropriate balance between the granting of exclusive
rights and the promotion of follow-on innovation by
competitors.

VII. POLICY COHERENCE IS CRITICAL
To be fully effective, STI policies need to be internally
consistent and fully aligned with national development
plans. The former can be promoted through the design
and deployment of strategies and policy instruments
at the most appropriate level, while the latter requires
a ‚Äúwhole-of-government‚Äù perspective, facilitating
cooperation across ministries and other public bodies
LQGLIIHUHQW∆ÑHOGVRISROLF\&RKHUHQFHLVQHHGHGDFURVV
policy areas such as industrial policies and those on
STI, foreign direct investment (FDI), trade, education
and competition, along with macroeconomic policies,
including monetary policies.
Key steps towards building synergies between STI
policy and overall development strategies include:
(a) Conducting a critical review of the innovation
system and STI policy;
(b) Building a shared vision and choosing strategic
priority areas for STI policy;
(c) Facilitating strategic partnerships;
(d) Designing a long-term STI strategy and policy road
map; and
(e) Establishing monitoring and evaluation systems
and nourishing policy learning.

Establishing advanced capabilities in policy design and
implementation is a priority area for capacity-building.

VIII. REDIRECTING INNOVATION
TOWARDS INCLUSIVENESS AND
SUSTAINABILITY
Addressing the challenges of inclusiveness and
sustainability in the context of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development requires (a) broadening
the strategic focus of STI policy to integrate societal
challenges at its core; (b) internalizing the direct and
indirect contributions of innovations to economic,
social and environmental aspects of sustainable
development; and (c) fostering transformative
innovations with the potential to supplant unsustainable
practices and systems.
Concerns about the employment implications of
frontier technologies have fuelled a growing debate
about the need to adapt the social contract to a
new context of rapid change in technology, but also
in key parameters of the social, cultural and political
environment. Two themes have emerged consistently
in this debate: (a) OLIHORQJ OHDUQLQJ, through skills
updating and skills upgrading, can help to match
the supply of skills to match demand, while allowing
workers to adapt to a rapidly changing labour market;
and (b) XQLYHUVDOEDVLFLQFRPH 8%,  periodic cash

society, has been proposed as a means to provide
∆ÑQDQFLDO VHFXULW\ ERWK WR WKRVH XQDEOH WR DGDSW
successfully to changing skills needs and to potential
innovators. A number of (mostly local) experiments are
underway, and the preliminary results are encouraging;
EXWWKHFRQVLGHUDEOH∆ÑVFDOFRVWUHPDLQVDQREVWDFOH
Beyond these foundations of STI policy, several
new concepts and policy approaches could further
strengthen the contribution of technological change to
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

innovation are emerging that focus on inclusiveness,
including pro-poor, inclusive, frugal, grass-roots and
social innovation. Policies to support such approaches

FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES
AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

HARNESSING FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

A. INTRODUCTION
With the vision of ‚Äúleaving no one behind‚Äú, the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development demands
unprecedented actions and efforts. Unlike the
Millennium Development Goals, the Sustainable
Development Goals are universal and comprehensive
goals that give equal importance to the economic, social
and environmental pillars of sustainable development.
Islands of prosperity surrounded by poverty, injustice,
climate change and environmental degradation are
viewed as neither sustainable nor acceptable.
UNCTAD‚Äôs research indicates that developing
countries face an annual gap of $2.5 trillion in public
and private investment relative to the needs of the
Sustainable Development Goals (UNCTAD, 2014b),
including $342 billion per year for low-income
countries and around $900 billion per year for lower
middle-income countries (UNCTAD, 2016d). Bridging
such a gap is a formidable task, especially in least
developed countries (LDCs).
The Sustainable Development Goals go beyond the
Millennium Development Goals‚Äô objective of halving
extreme poverty, to require its complete eradication
everywhere by 2030. This is a particularly ambitious
goal in LDCs ‚Äì ‚Äúthe battleground on which the 2030
Agenda will be won or lost‚Äù (UNCTAD, 2015b) ‚Äì
ZKHUHLWPHDQVUHGXFLQJSRYHUW\IURP}SHUFHQWWR
zero in 15 years, requiring a much greater economic
miracle than that achieved by China since 1978
(UNCTAD, 2015c). The Sustainable Development
Goals also envisage, inter alia, universal access to
water, sanitation and affordable and reliable energy;
combatting child mortality; reducing inequality within
and among countries; making cities and human
settlements inclusive, resilient and sustainable; and
generating more productive jobs. It is clear that
business as usual will fall far short of delivering these
ambitious goals.
Science, technology and innovation (STI) played a pivotal role in the progress towards the Millennium Development Goals; and the new and more ambitious
2030 Agenda will require still greater engagement by
the global STI community. This is recognized explicitly

of the Sustainable Development Goals, while Goal 9

economies, tackling vulnerability, building resilience
and achieving inclusive prosperity. The role of STI is

also formally recognized in other global development
policy agreements.1
The task of achieving the Sustainable Development
Goals is complicated by the multiple interconnected
social, economic and environmental issues involved,
including poverty, food security, nutrition, health, water
and sanitation, energy access and access to ICTs.
The depth and complexity of these interconnections
requires new forms of development in STI.
The 2030 Development Agenda is being pursued
in a context of profound transformation, driven by
rapidly evolving and often converging technologies
that are expected to change radically the operation
of production systems, the roles of different players
DORQJYDOXHFKDLQVDQGHYHQWKHGH∆ÑQLWLRQVRIVHFWRUV
and industries themselves. Beyond their potential
for economic development, frontier technologies
may have far-reaching implications for the ability of
societies to respond to many pressing social and
environmental needs. They also give rise to concerns,
increasingly present in the global public debate, about
their consequences for equality, employment and the
industrialization prospects of developing countries. For
these reasons, this report focuses on the opportunities
and challenges of harnessing frontier technologies for
sustainable development.
Far from removing the need to address the persistent
gap between developed and developing countries
LQ WKHLU DELOLW\ WR EHQH∆ÑW IURP WHFKQRORJ\ IURQWLHU
technologies reinforce the urgency of sustained efforts
by the international community to ensure that no one
is left behind in the race to the new world that they are
forming. This report therefore outlines strategies and
actions to increase the effectiveness of frontier and
established technologies as means of implementation
of the 2030 Agenda nationally and globally, combining
existing experiences in STI policy for development with
more innovative approaches. It should, however, be
emphasized that the focus of this report on the role
of technological innovation in development does not
imply a disregard for the power of non-technological

digitalization of economic activities has been accelerated
by expanding access to high-speed broadband and
drastic reductions in the cost of ICT equipment and

being obsolete before they come to fruition.

The social, economic and environmental
challenges of the twenty-first century and the
ambitious agenda of the Sustainable Development
Goals coexist with frontier technologies that
can and should play a major role in finding and
applying the necessary global solutions. Such
technologies provide fundamentally new and
often underappreciated possibilities for economic
development, environmental protection, education
and governance, offering the potential for a
world of far greater prosperity, while enhancing
environmental sustainability and mitigating climate
change. Many of these technologies also offer the
prospect of solutions and opportunities that are:
(a) Better, in that they solve problems more effectively,
provide new capabilities and opportunities, and
DOORZ PXFK PRUH HI∆ÑFLHQW XVH RI QDWXUDO DQG
human resources;
(b) Cheaper, in that the cost of technologies such
as microchips and renewable energy has fallen
exponentially as they have become more powerful
DQGRUHI∆ÑFLHQW
(c) Faster, in that the new technologies are diffusing
ever more rapidly around the world, propelled by
Internet connectivity and sharply falling prices;
(d) 6FDODEOH, in that they often offer small-scale
solutions that can be rapidly scaled up to meet
human needs for energy, food, clean water, health
care and education; and
(e) (DV\WRXVH, in that they have rendered previously
complex, laborious and/or time-consuming tasks,
such as searching for patterns in huge data sets,
almost effortless, while becoming increasingly
transparent to users.
These traits open the possibility of a democratization
of technology, making technological innovation

However, the proliferation of new technologies threatens
to outpace the ability of societies and policymakers to
adapt to the changes they create. The rate of turnover
of technology platforms can reportedly be as short as
5‚Äì7 years ‚Äì half the 10‚Äì15 years it may take society and
regulatory measures to adapt (Friedman, 2016).2 This
has created widespread anxiety, causing ambivalence

Deep learning allows computational models that
are composed of multiple processing layers to learn
representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction.
These methods have dramatically improved the state of the
art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object
detection and many other domains, such as drug discovery
and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure
in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm
to indicate how a machine should change its internal
parameters that are used to compute the representation
in each layer from the representation in the previous layer.
Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs
in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas
recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as
text and speech (LeCun et al, 2015).

Robert Gordon notes that technology innovations after
1870 included an energy revolution with the exploitation
of oil and the harnessing of electricity, and the
development of the internal combustion engine. ‚ÄúThese
led in turn to the creation of machines: the electric light,
the telephone, the radio, the refrigerator, the washing
machine, the automobiles and the aircraft. They resulted
in the transformation of lives via urbanization and the
grid-connected home. These then drove an education

Technologies building on each other

Moore‚Äôs Law

The pace of development and adoption of technologies
has been accelerated exponentially by ‚ÄúMoore‚Äôs
Law‚Äù, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore,
who predicted in 1965 that the processing power of
microchips would double every 18‚Äì24 months. This
revolution, as the economy demanded literate and
disciplined workers‚Äù (Gordon, 2016: chapter 1).

Technology convergence

Technologies are converging through the increasing
use of digital platforms to produce new combinatory
technologies, which are expected to continue
to accelerate the pace of technological change,
resulting in simultaneous technology-induced
disruptive changes across multiple sectors. Such
changes quickly spread worldwide, with important

resetting ‚Äúthe state of the art‚Äù. They are changing
how people communicate, work, organize their social
life or monitor their health. They are also changing
business organization and government. Examples
of technological convergence include: personalized
medicine enabled by large databases of disease
states and patient information; rapid and parallel
gene sequencing; ability to design and test new
drugs using computer simulations; wearable personal
medical monitoring devices; new nanotech-enabled
miniaturized, highly sensitive chemical and biological
sensors; fabrics that incorporate electronics, power

and membranes.6
Convergence is taking place not only in terms of
technology but also in terms of platforms, interests
and investments. In agriculture, for example, the
convergence of mobile and cloud computing, sensor
deployment in machinery, genomics and other
technologies promises to enable quantum leaps in
precision farming. The same convergence is also
motivating commercial alliances and mergers among
companies in sectors such as farming equipment,

Declining costs

The cost of digitally-enabled devices tends to drop
precipitously. The cost of smartphones is expected

poor the power of a connected supercomputer‚Äù
with ‚Äúmore computing power than our own brains‚Äù
by 2023 (Wadhwa with Salkever, 2017: 15). Cost
reductions are also affecting the energy sector,
notably in solar photovoltaic (PV) power, which has
become cost-competitive with fossil-fuel generation,
and in electric vehicles and batteries.7
In some cases, digital technologies are reducing
marginal production costs almost to zero. For
example, while a book, CD or DVD entails the cost
of materials, printing, shipping, etc., the marginal
cost of an e-book or streaming is virtually zero
(Rifkin, 2014). This tendency toward ‚Äúzero marginal
cost‚Äù accelerates the diffusion of such technologies,
further accelerating technological development and
innovation.

Multiple platforms

Two ‚Äúplatforms of platforms‚Äù have played a central
role in accelerating technological change: the
Internet, enabling global mobile connectivity;
and the global positioning system (GPS), which
functions as a source of geolocation for millions
of apps. These two platforms have allowed new
subsidiary platforms to be built, driving further
technological innovation and business creation, as
start-up businesses exploit an ecosystem of ‚Äúapps‚Äù
based on smartphone platforms.
Platforms built on the Internet are creating new
opportunities for entrepreneurs all over the world to start
new technology-based companies, and for both startups and existing SMEs to reach global markets. While

TO SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT
The two key features of frontier technologies have
been digitalization and connectivity. The rapid
connection of most of the global population through
the mobile Internet is creating an extraordinary
range of new opportunities to exploit the vast array
of digitally-enabled frontier technologies to address
the Sustainable Development Goals in virtually every
country.

Big data and IoT are new digital developments that
make it possible to optimize business operations
and facilitate the creation of new products, services
and industries. The possibility of collecting unlimited
amounts of data through Internet-connected sensors
and monitoring of the web and social media allows
prediction of demand, estimation of rural incomes
(based on mobile phone activity) and anticipation of
civil unrest. While such technologies add to the existing

move from sampling data to analysing all the data,
while facilitating segmentation and targeting within a

The Internet of Things (IoT) allows the condition and
actions of connected objects and machines to be
monitored and managed, while connected sensors
can monitor the natural world, animals and people

data with other connected objects, systems and users
through the Internet (Catholic Relief Services, 2015).
IoT devices include devices to monitor eating, sleeping

Big data and Internet of Things

In countries with functional health systems, big data
and IoT could contribute to improving health care by
allowing treatments to be personalized, clinical data
to be collected beyond the occasional patient‚Äìdoctor

proactively, and more effective cures to be found
for intractable conditions. Clinical trials can also be
facilitated by applying statistical tools and algorithms
to mine patient data, and by recommending better
protocol designs (Manyika et al., 2015b), while
mapping data can strengthen responses to disease
outbreaks. During a typhoid outbreak in Uganda, for
example, the Ministry of Health used data-mapping
applications to facilitate decision-making on the
allocation of medicine and mobilization of health
teams (box 1.3).
Big data and IoT have also been used in medical
research. For example, researchers from the Institute
for Computational Health Sciences are using freely

Box 1.2 Increasing automation in China
China is rapidly expanding its deployment of industrial robots as a result of demographic factors, since its workingage population is declining, but also due to the increasing cost of labour, which is eroding its advantage as a
low-cost production country. Moreover, the Government is encouraging the use of robots through the industrial
strategy called ‚ÄúMade in China 2025‚Äù.. UNCTAD (2016b) notes that China is also evolving as a major producer of
industrial robots, as a result of its lower costs and better ability to understand the needs of Chinese customers. In
this context, the Government released a guideline to triple annual production of industrial robots by 2020. In 2015,
China sold around 68,000 robots, which was 20 per cent above its previous year‚Äôs figure, and plans to produce
up to 400,000 units by 2019 (International Federation of Robotics, 2016a). However, Chinese technology in
producing robots still lags far behind that of the foreign leading robot-making companies. And Chinese producers
need to import a large part of their components (W√ºbbeke et al., 2016).
The increasing automation in China could have a significant impact on the labour force. A remarkable recent
example is that of Foxconn Electronics, a major electronics assembly company, with its massive automation drive
in Chinese factories in three phases. In the end, entire factories would be automated, with a small number of
workers in production, logistics, testing and inspection processes (Tech Times, 2016; Forbes, 2016). As a result
of increasing automation in China, prospects for cheap labour production of manufactures, which was taking
place in China and moving into other developing countries, could be vanishing; automation will allow China to
continue to produce these goods. This suggests that lower-income countries that could have expected to fill the
gap left by China in low-cost manufacturing production and exports as it upgrades its technology content (flying
geese pattern) are seeing export-led manufacturing fading away as a possible industrial development strategy
that could help in generating much-needed jobs.

Big data for development indicators

Monitoring progress towards the Sustainable
Development Goals requires collecting data on
development indicators (United Nations, 2015),
and international organizations, researchers and
private sector companies are harnessing big data to
this end.14 IoT devices and big data hosted on the
Internet may provide new opportunities to measure
development. For example, a study carried out by the
United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) using
mobile phone data found that airtime could serve as a
proxy indicator for food expenditure (box 1.7). Internet
search data may also help to predict social and
economic trends. For example, a correlation has been
found between Google Trends indices (real-time daily
14

For example, the United Nations Statistical Commission
and United Nations Global Pulse.

and weekly index of the volume of queries that users
enter into Google) and various economic indicators
that are potentially helpful to short-term economic
forecasting (Choi and Varian, 2012).
However, while such big data-derived indicators may
help to create additional tools to measure and evaluate
progress towards the Sustainable Development
Goals, it remains to be seen whether they will prove
as accurate as research and pilot projects suggest.
Big data algorithms cannot be taken at face value but
must be critically examined, especially when used to
generate complementary indicators for development
efforts, and the veracity and accuracy of big data and
IoT-derived data must be continuously monitored.
Human capabilities are critical to assessing and
evaluating the accuracy of big data algorithms
and understanding when the results are useful or
misleading.

Box 1.7. Big data for estimating food security in Rwanda
A study in Rwanda by WFP, Universit√© Catholique de Louvain and Real Impact Analytics of Belgium investigated the potential
of mobile phone data as a proxy indicator for food security, by comparing the results of a nationwide household survey
conducted by WFP with data on airtime credit purchases (‚Äútop-ups‚Äù) and mobile phone activity. A strong correlation was
found between airtime credit purchases and consumption of several food items, including vitamin-rich vegetables, meat
and cereals, suggesting that they could serve as a proxy indicator for these expenditures across locations. Models based
on mobile phone activity and airtime credit purchases were also shown to provide accurate estimates of multidimensional

might enhance their existing plans and strategies.
Governments may consider developing a ‚Äúnational
big data strategy‚Äù to harness the potential of big
data towards national development, in collaboration
with other stakeholders, such as the Big Data Joint
Laboratory in China (box 1.8). Such a strategy, linked
with the overall national development framework,

can allow governments to integrate big data analysis
into national strategies, as in Malaysia (box 1.9).
Governments might also consider creating crosssectoral units staffed by data scientists to apply big
data and IoT to problem-solving across a range of
applications. In the past few years, countries such as
Singapore and the United States have created chief
data scientist positions at the national level, while many
cities are creating similar positions to harness data to
improve internal government processes and services.

expected to use the Laboratory to produce prototype ideas for testing and implementation, and Baidu‚Äôs big data engine

3D printing

Another recent digital development, 3D printing,
also offers potential economic, social and
environmental benefits for developing countries.
Invented three decades ago, 3D printing has become
a viable technology for global manufacturers to
produce critical parts for airplanes, wind turbines,
automobiles and other machines as a result of
huge reductions in its costs and complementary
developments in computer-aided design, the
Internet, new materials for manufacturing and
cloud computing (Campbell et al., 2011). The
process of 3D printing, which produces objects
through a simple process of layering, is sometimes
referred to as additive manufacturing, in contrast

with traditional (subtractive) manufacturing, which
creates parts out of raw materials. As well as
global manufacturers, tens of thousands of early
adopters are now experimenting with 3D printers
or starting mini-manufacturing enterprises (Garrett,
2015:15‚Äì16).
As a ‚Äúplatform technology‚Äù, 3D printing can be used in a
range of applications, including health care, aerospace
(e.g. printing airplane parts) and construction (e.g.
printing houses and large buildings) (Garrett, 2015).
It has also been argued that 3D printing could help
developing countries to leapfrog into manufacturing
and produce large numbers of products on demand
with retooling, while using recycled materials and less
costly infrastructure (ibid.).

to $12.8 billion 2018, and exceed $21 billion by
2020 (Ubhaykar, 2015), the growth occurring in

main elements:
(a) Cost and time savings compared with traditional
manufacturing processes;
(b) Potential to manufacture complex, low-volume
parts and products; and
(c) Potential for rapid, iterative

The 3D printing technologies could also help to
reduce carbon emissions by producing goods in a
single process, thus averting the need for multiple
parts to be transported (UNCTAD, 2016a), while
reducing resource use by using only the material
it needs (Dewey, 2015). Ultimately, concerted
efforts and innovation will be required to maximize

Applications of 3D printing: Health care

The 3D printing technologies are allowing the
development of some low-cost prosthetics.
South Africa‚Äôs Centre for Rapid Prototyping
and Manufacturing at the Central University of
Technology, Free State, for example, has 3D-printed
titanium jaws for at least a dozen patients at
Kimberley Hospital (APANEWS, 2014; Diamond
Fields Advertiser, 2015). However, there are
important limitations: most 3D printers can only use
one material at a time, rather than the combination
of materials generally required for prosthetic limbs,
for example; and 3D-printed models may not be
able to reconstruct the interface between prosthetic
limbs and soft tissue (Andrews, 2013). A clear
understanding of such trade-offs is essential in the
consideration of such applications.

Applications of 3D printing: Construction of
buildings

Rapid urbanization, especially in developing countries,
requires new approaches to cost-effective and

has been constructed in an industrial park in Jiangsu
Province in China using printing with glass, steel,
cement and recycled construction waste (Arch Daily,
2015).
The 3D printing process offers faster and more
accurate construction with lower labour costs,

waste generation, and health and safety risks.
However, in considering 3D printing as a means
of addressing housing and urbanization needs,
it is important also to consider potential effects
on employment in the construction industry, the
implications for the types of materials used in
construction, and the risk of errors in digital models
being translated into printing and construction
(Husseini, 2014).

c.

Applications of 3D printing: Education

The 3D printing process is also being used as a
tool for primary, secondary and post-secondary
education, to make abstract concepts concrete for
students to explore. In India, for example, students
are 3D printing historical artefacts, organ parts,
cities, dinosaurs and art projects (Kohli, 2015;
India Education Diary, 2015). Collaborative efforts
between private firms and nonprofit organizations
to digitize diagrams and educational images for the
visually impaired as 3D models are also showing
positive results (Dataquest, 2015). Fabrication
laboratories provide another example of 3D printing
technologies as experimental learning spaces for
local innovation systems (box 1.11). However,
integrating 3D printers into education also requires
upgrading of the capacities of teachers to create
and print 3D models and to assess the suitability
of such technology to existing learning strategies.
Box 1.11 gives an example of 3D printers as tools
for driving local innovation in universities and
schools.

While 3D printing technology has the potential to promote innovation, design and tool-creation capacity in developing
countries, potentially improving livelihoods and contributing to economic empowerment, its deployment is usually limited
to universities, in specialist research centres such as Fabrication Laboratories (FabLabs).
FabLabs, found in both developed and developing countries, are small-scale workshops equipped to offer digital
fabrication for individuals or small-sized companies. FabLab Nairobi, for example, was established as part of the
University of Nairobi‚Äôs Mechanical Engineering Department to promote local innovation systems in Kenya, and introduced

Biotechnology and health tech

Advances in ICT have allowed an increasing
integration of synthetic biology, systems biology
and functional genomics into biotechnology.
Through convergence of an ever-expanding range
of ‚Äúomics‚Äù technologies ‚Äì genomics, proteomics
(proteins), metabolomics (biochemical activity),
etc. ‚Äì computational biology explores the roles,
relationships and actions of the various types of
molecules that make up the cells of an organism
(Emerging Technologies, 2014), allowing the
functions of organisms to be better understood,
from the molecular level to the system level, and
advancing biotechnology applications. The cost of
sequencing a complete human genome has fallen
faster even than implied by Moore‚Äôs Law (section
C.2) to around $1,000, and is expected to cost no
more than a regular blood test by the early 2020s
(Wadhwa with Salkever, 2017:123‚Äì124).
Digitization of biology has also led to an orderof-magnitude decline in the cost of biotech
development, for example by allowing experiments
to be designed digitally and conducted by cloudbased laboratories for a small fraction of the cost
of acquiring laboratory equipment and hiring
technicians.17 Rather than being built from scratch,

While CRISPR has the potential to operate as a stand-alone technology, its application in plants still relies on other
genetic engineering tools (e.g. recombinant DNA, biolistic electroporation). It has been tested as a means of increasing
yields and drought tolerance of commercial crops, improving their growth in low-nutrient environments, improving their
nutritional properties and combatting plant pathogens. CRISPR-based genome engineering can also help to accelerate
trait improvement in crops through conventional breeding approaches.
The possibility of genome editing requires consideration of various safety and ethical issues. Safety concerns include the

Nanotechnology is a general-purpose technology
with multiple applications, which has the potential to
revolutionize many industrial sectors. Its applications
include:

Using smart grids, big data and IoT technologies can
help to reduce energy consumption, balance energy
demand and supply, and ensure and improve the
management of energy distribution, while increasing
the role of renewable sources by allowing households
to feed surplus energy from solar panels or wind
turbines into the grid. The real-time information
provided by smart grids helps utility companies to
respond better to changes in demand, power supply,
costs and emissions, and to avert major power
outages (UNCTAD, 2015d:23). Zenatix, a Delhibased start-up, for example, uses smart meters and

Renewable energy technologies

Renewable energy technologies can provide electricity
in remote and isolated rural areas inaccessible to
centralized grid systems (UNCTAD, 2017c); and costs
have declined dramatically, especially for solar power,
which is now cost-competitive with coal and natural
gas. The cost of solar cells has dropped by a factor of
more than 100 in the last 40 years, from $76.67/watt
in 1977 to $0.029/kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2017 (Clark,
2017). Solar energy is now the cheapest generation
technology in many parts of the world.24
There is also progress regarding innovation in material
science to produce third-generation solar PV. Although

and are expected to fall further. Energy density has
also increased, allowing more storage per kilogram,
while durability has improved.
Rapid declines can also be observed in the cost of
electric vehicles, fuelling a growing expectation that
they will soon compete with conventional cars, in
part because of deliberate policies in some countries.
Scotland is aiming to phase out gasoline and diesel
cars by 2032, and China, France and the remainder of
the United Kingdom by 2040, while India is committed
to selling only electric vehicles by 2032. The rapid
development of electric cars has contributed to
the improvements and cost reductions for battery
technology (Clark, 2017).

Satellites and drones

Communication satellites have been used for Internet
access in rural areas and developing countries since
the early days of the Internet, and the industry has
remained viable as a result of technical progress in
launch technology (public and private), antennas,
solar power, radios and other electronics, as well as
tuning of TCP/IP protocols to account for the quartersecond latency due to the orbital altitude. It has been
suggested that these technologies have progressed to
the point where high-altitude platform stations (HAPSs)
and lower orbit satellites are now viable as well. HAPSs
are non-rigid airships, drones or balloons that hover
or circulate around 15‚Äì30 km in the stratosphere
(UNCTAD, 2014a). HAPSs have lower transmission
delay (latency), but their signal cover (footprint) tends
to be lower compared to other technologies (ibid.:38).
An example of a project that offers broadband Internet
using satellite communications is the Google Project
Loon (ibid.), which uses HAPSs to create an aerial
wireless network with up to 3G-like speeds.
In the future, everyone on Earth may have ubiquitous
access to outer space (Buscher and Brie√ü, 2014).
Exponential technologies have also made possible
development of small, cheap and capable satellites,
including ‚Äúcubesats‚Äù ‚Äì 10-centimetre cubes with
various sensors, using smartphone technology ‚Äì
hundreds of which have been deployed. Microbes in
Space and NanoRacks have partnered to produce
cubesats on demand on the International Space
Station: the design for a satellite can be emailed to
a printer on the International Space Station, where
the key components will be stored, allowing the case
to be manufactured and the satellite assembled and
deployed directly into orbit (Garrett, 2016). Custom
cubesats will cost around $100,000, allowing them
to be deployed by developing countries, businesses
and universities, for example, for monitoring of crops
or environmental damage or for surveillance.
Like robots, drones have existed for decades, but
their cost and size have shrunk dramatically in recent
years, powered by Moore‚Äôs Law, while their capabilities
have increased with smartphone technology. Small
quadcopter drones are now being employed for an
increasing number of tasks, including commercial
delivery of packages and delivery of high-value
items such as vaccines to rural areas in developing

(Wadhwa with Salkever, 2017:113).
The decreasing cost of drones could also facilitate
a wide range of services in developing countries,
including delivering supplies to conflict areas,
refugee camps and rural areas with poor ground
transportation networks. Drone delivery in cities
could significantly reduce congestion and pollution
by reducing the use of delivery trucks, while
drones can also perform hazardous jobs such
as inspecting bridges, cell phone towers and
roofs, and fire-spotting in rural areas, as well as
providing new and cheap capabilities for precision
agriculture, including monitoring the growth of
weeds and crops, spraying insecticides and
monitoring soil hydration.

Blockchain

A blockchain is a form of exchange that is permanent
and transparent between parties, which does not rely
on a central authority (Mulligan, 2017). The premise
of the exchange is that each party on a blockchain
has access and means to verify the entire database.
Further, all transactions are visibly recorded across
a distributed peer-to-peer network (Mainelli, 2017).
Applications include the following:
(a) ‚ÄúSmart contracts‚Äù25 are a form of a trusted third
party which can automate transactions such as
licencing, revenue collection and social transfers,

approximately 1.5 billion people who lack it,
which would otherwise leave them vulnerable to

Blockchain has been used in identity management,
which aids in validating individual identities. For
example, Estonia offers citizens a digital identity
card based on blockchain, which allows citizens to

While frontier technologies can be expected to create
new markets and jobs, they will also disrupt existing
productive sectors and labour markets, with impacts
that may particularly affect disadvantaged communities.
The relationship between technology and employment
has historically been controversial. At least in theory,
the main objectives of technological progress are
productivity growth leading to economic growth, and
improved living standards. But technologies have often
been seen as a major contributor to unemployment
and inequality. For example, the Luddite movement
in the United Kingdom emerged in response to the
First Industrial Revolution, to protest against the use
of machines that were destroying jobs in the textile

industry. The debate about the impact of technology
on employment has been reignited recently, particularly
in developed countries, by increasing inequality, high
UDWHVRIXQHPSOR\PHQWWKHUDSLGDGYDQFHRIDUWL∆ÑFLDO
intelligence and robotics, and increasing digital
automation of production processes ‚Äì the so-called
Fourth Industrial Revolution.
The rapid pace and widening scope of technological
progress could lead to more job destruction than
job creation, at least in the short and medium term.
A polarization of employment has been observed as
jobs at medium skill levels have declined, while nonroutine jobs, both manual (low-skilled) and cognitive
(high-skilled) have increased (UNCTAD, 2016b).
While digital automation allows some countries
and businesses to produce goods and services at
unprecedented scale, increasing labour productivity
and expanding operations at marginal cost, this may
eliminate the need for workers. Recent advances in
automation thus have the potential to affect a radical
reshaping of work.

a.

Differing perspectives on the potential impact of
automation on employment

Numerous recent studies have considered the impact
of automation and robotics on employment. The more
pessimistic side of the debate considers that, contrary
to previous historical experiences, robots may replace
workers faster than the labour market and policies
can adapt, resulting in a negative net impact on
employment. Studies taking this view focus on the
many jobs that are at risk of automation through the
rapid pace of digital automation, which could result in
increasing productivity not being matched by higher
ZDJHV DQG MRE JURZWK )UH\ DQG 2VERUQH 
World Economic Forum (WEF), 2016a and 2016b;
Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014; Pew Research
Center, 2014). Some such studies also highlight the
gender implications of automation and employment
(box 1.13).
There are three reasons to consider that the relatively
favourable long-term labour market outcomes of
past technological shocks may not be replicated
in the current circumstances, or at least that the
job losses during the transition may be higher and
take longer to absorb. First, recent and prospective
technological changes are occurring much more
rapidly and within a much shorter time frame than
agricultural mechanization, the Industrial Revolution
and mechanization of manufacturing. This requires

21

HARNESSING FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

much faster adaptation, and increases the likelihood
of a medium-term hiatus between negative short-term
effects on employment and potential off-setting effects
in the long term. The current pace of technological
change, together with its unpredictability, also raises
concerns about the viability of retraining: skills may
be useful only for a relatively short time, reducing
returns relative to the costs, particularly given the time
required for training itself.
Second, past technological changes have created
a certain amount of employment with limited skill
requirements in the affected sectors because new
technologies (tractors and farm machinery in the
agricultural revolution, and increasingly mechanized
factories) required human operators with moderate

autonomous machines means that, in many cases, the
need for human agency is averted (or limited to users,
in the case of services). This implies that employment

largely to much higher-skilled tasks, often in different
locations, for the design, manufacture, maintenance
and repayment of the new equipment.
Third, previous episodes of technological change
KDYHPDLQO\DIIHFWHGDVLQJOH EURDGO\GH∆ÑQHG VHFWRU
Workers displaced by agricultural mechanisation
could move into pre-industrial manufacturing and
services, and later move to urban areas, providing the

workforce for the Industrial Revolution. As employment
was reduced by increasing mechanization in industry,
workers could move into services. By contrast,
the revolutionary nature of current and prospective
technological changes means that all sectors will
be affected simultaneously. Moreover, employment
effects are likely to be particularly strong in major
services such as wholesale and retail trade, retail

previously played an important role in absorbing
labour displaced from agriculture and industry.
More optimistic studies consider that the negative
short-term effects will be offset in the long term by higher
productivity and the creation of new jobs involving
more creative and interesting tasks ‚Äì those requiring
personal interaction, social skills, negotiation skills,
empathy and emotional intelligence, human touch and

losses due to disruptive change over the 2015‚Äì2020 period are likely to amplify current gender gap dynamics.‚Äù This
is because a large share of women tend to be employed mostly in routine and lower-skills occupations which present
the highest risk of automation. These women‚Äôs job losses resulting from automation could be particularly important in
developing countries, where export processing, exports on non-traditional agricultural products and exports of services
such as data entry and call centres have led to increased hiring of women, who receive lower wages and have lower skills

The impact of automation on employment in
developing countries

The impacts of automation vary according to levels
of development and industrialization, labour costs,
skills capacities, production and export structures,
and related factors such as technological capacities,
infrastructure, demography and policies that encourage
or discourage automation (box 1.14). However, most

analyses of the social and employment impact of
digital automation to date have focused primarily

automating processes where labour costs are higher,
and the presence of large companies and factories
with the advanced technologies needed to produce
higher-end robots (Boston Consulting Group, 2015:6;
National Bank of Canada, 2013).

wealth in the hands of today‚Äôs rich nations, often referred to as the ‚ÄúGreat Divergence‚Äù. However, since the 1990s, the
‚ÄúGreat Convergence‚Äù has been reversing the gains of those rich nations.
The share of manufacturing has radically shifted since the 1990s, in what Baldwin calls the ‚Äúshocking share shift‚Äù, where
the Group of Seven‚Äôs rapid loss has been accompanied by massive growth in the share of the Industrializing Six, or I6
(China, Republic of Korea, India, Poland, Indonesia and Thailand). He argues that globalization unbundles the ‚Äúforcible
bundling‚Äù of production with consumption. Globalization reduces the ‚Äúseparation‚Äù costs of production and consumption
through three dimensions of distance-related costs: moving goods, moving ideas and moving people. These constraints,
and the sequence by which these constraints are ameliorated, explain how globalization has and is evolving.

(or the ‚Äúsecond unbundling‚Äù) involved a reduction in the cost of moving ideas. Lower-cost communications enabled the
offshoring of production and international production networks, which not only created jobs in developing countries but
diffused knowledge (e.g. ‚Äúmarketing, managerial and technical know-how‚Äù). What distinguishes this New Globalization is
the combination of low-wage labour from the South with know-how from the North. Baldwin argues that the diffusion of
knowledge to these regions, along with jobs, was necessary to construct well-functional global production networks. This

moving people. Most offshore locations are near ‚ÄúG7 industrial powerhouses‚Äù or where face-to-face interaction is not as
salient. Baldwin argues that because half of humanity lives in these industrializing developing countries, income growth
has driven a ‚Äúcommodity super-cycle‚Äù, impacting other commodity-exporting nations (even those untouched by global
value chains).
Baldwin hypothesizes that a ‚Äúthird unbundling‚Äù could occur if the costs of moving people are reduced, either through
‚Äútelepresence‚Äù technologies or ‚Äútelerobotics‚Äù that allow people to perform tasks in remote locations. Such ‚Äúvirtual
immigration‚Äù or ‚Äúinternational telecommuting‚Äù would enable workers to perform services in other nations without physical
presence.

There are two main channels through which
automation may affect employment in developing
countries. First, increasing automation in
developed countries may erode the comparative
advantage of developing countries, which is based
largely on abundant low-cost and low-skilled labour.
Increasing use of robots in developed countries
may slow the offshoring of activities by transnational
companies, although labour cost differences

(relative to robots) remain a factor in such decisions.
If robots in the home country of a company that
has offshored its activities can do the same work as
low-wage workers in developing countries at lower
cost, such activities may also be reshored to the
home country, leading to job losses. While there
has already been some reshoring of manufacturing
activities linked to automation, the evidence of its
importance is limited and mixed (UNCTAD, 2016b;

23

HARNESSING FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

De Backer et al., 2016). Reshoring linked to
automation is unlikely to increase employment in
developed countries significantly, as robots may
perform most of the previously offshored tasks, so
that jobs created may be a fraction of those lost
through past offshoring.
Second, employment may be affected by the
automation of industrial production processes
in developing countries themselves. This reduces
the potential of the manufacturing sector to absorb
large domestic labour surpluses from the primary
sector, and adds to existing stresses on labour
markets associated with relatively high population
growth. It may also weaken developing countries‚Äô
traditional comparative advantage in low-cost
and low-skill labour by making production less
labour-intensive, again contributing to a reversal
of the offshoring of labour-intensive manufacturing
activities from developed to developing countries.
2YHUDOO DXWRPDWLRQ LQ GHYHORSLQJ FRXQWULHV PD\
imply some net job destruction by limiting their
ability to create new jobs through manufacturing,
contributing to premature deindustrialization
(Rodrik, 2015; Frey, 2015).
The ability of countries to take advantage of an
increasingly automated world has become a key
determinant of competitiveness (UNCTAD, 2017b).
The role of manufacturing is particularly important
in this regard, as a share of manufacturing in
HPSOR\PHQW RI DW OHDVW } SHU FHQW KDV EHHQ
identified as a good predictor of eventual prosperity
(UNCTAD, 2017a). In principle, the maturing
of structural transformation in more advanced
developing countries is shifting employment
towards services, facilitating the transitions of
other developing countries. However, increasing
automation in manufacturing raises important
questions about the future feasibility of such
transitions.
The impact of automation is likely to depend less
on its technological feasibility than on its economic
feasibility; and adverse employment effects may be
greater in economies that do not use robots than in
those that do (ibid.). This suggests that fears about
short-term adverse effects of digitalization and
automation on employment may be exaggerated,
particularly if labour and education policies
promote complementarity between skills available
in the workforce and new technologies.

The critical issue is the need for technical feasibility
WR EH PDWFKHG E\ HFRQRPLF SUR∆ÑWDELOLW\ :KLOH
automation has developed rapidly, market selection
will likely dictate the most economic sense. Since the
impact of automation on industrialization depends
on the structure of each country‚Äôs economy (ibid.),
the impact at the national level cannot be assumed
to be necessarily negative, but rather requires a
balanced analysis of the net effects of technological
and market forces. Thus, the future lies in workers
creating economic value with machines rather than
against them (UNCTAD 2017b).
In the longer term, automation should give rise to new
opportunities for job creation in those middle-income
FRXQWULHVZLWKVXI∆ÑFLHQWWHFKQRORJLFDODQGDEVRUSWLYH
capacities, the skills and technological infrastructure
needed to make robots work and maintain them,
and the capacity to upgrade skills according to the
new occupations created. China and the Republic of
Korea provide examples of possible trajectories for
such countries. However, if robots are imported, job
creation effects linked to their production will accrue
in the producing countries.
In the LDCs, where the creation of jobs for a large
pool of low-skilled new entrants to the labour
force is a major priority, the introduction of robots
is unlikely to be economical. LDCs‚Äô production
structures are typically dominated by small-scale
agriculture and large informal sectors. There
are major gaps in technological and absorptive
capacities and technological infrastructure, and
serious shortages of high-skill workers. Also,
declining costs of automation do not compensate
for low wage levels.
While automation in LDCs might in principle be
possible by leapfrogging (chapter IV), as many
have done by adopting mobile telephones before
developing fixed telephoned lines, this would
require the cost of automation costs to fall below
that of the cheapest labour. Moreover, as noted
E\ ,/2   WKHVH WHFKQRORJLHV ZLOO PDNH LW
increasingly difficult for African countries to leapfrog
into cutting-edge manufacturing technologies
unless they rapidly develop a highly skilled labour
force with the capabilities to implement and
operate highly automated production processes.
As in many developing countries, the fact that
most technology in LDCs is imported, mainly from
developed countries, will limit any job creation
effect domestically.

CHAPTER I. FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Box 1.15 Studies on the impact of automation on employment in developing countries
Studies about the impact of automation on employment in developing countries are rather scarce. According
to the World Bank (2016), the proportion of jobs at risk of automation is even higher in developing countries
than in developed countries: from a purely technological standpoint, two thirds of jobs in developing countries
are susceptible to automation in coming decades. However, the effects of that process could be moderated by
the lower wages and the slower adoption of technology in developing countries. Therefore, although given the
technological advances the potential for automation is clear, this should not be considered as a concern in the
short term for a number of reasons: first, there will be creation of new jobs and new tasks in existing occupations;
second, robots are not perfect or even good substitutes for many tasks. Moreover, automation is likely to be
slower and less widespread in developing countries as a result of barriers to technology adoption, lower wages
and the higher presence of jobs based on manual dexterity. As the labour disruptions from automation are
expected to arrive more slowly to the poorest countries, this may give more time for policies and institutions to
adapt.
According to estimates by the World Bank (2016:figure 2.24), using an unadjusted measure (based on technological

developing countries are also susceptible to automation. Due to technological advancement, low-wage regions
which have traditionally attracted manufacturing firms will not have the same possibility of achieving rapid growth
by shifting workers from farms to higher-paying factory jobs ‚Äì therefore, they would need to find a different path
to prosperity.‚Äù They also show that countries with a higher share of their workforce at risk of automation tend to
be those with lower levels of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.
In a study of 46 countries, McKinsey Global Institute (2017) shows that automation has the potential to affect

also give rise to potential risks, and pose important
ethical questions, that should be considered and
appropriately managed. Digital technologies for
instance can pose new challenges to citizens‚Äô rights
and the power balance between stakeholders related
to the ownership of data. The increasing availability
of data associated with big data applications and IoT
devices, and the increasing accessibility of personal
data to commercial and government entities, raise
important issues of privacy and security, reinforcing
the need for regulation of data sharing and use. The
report of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Human Rights, the Right to privacy in the digital
age,32 warns of ‚Äúa lack of adequate national legislation
and/or enforcement, weak procedural safeguards,
and ineffective oversight‚Äù with respect to the right
to privacy (UNCTAD, 2015e:30). Particular issues
are individual notice and consent, opt-out policies
and anonymization (Mayer-Sch√∂nberger and Cukier,
2013:6).
Big data allows the use of digital automation

companies to decide which advertisements to show
users, and by retailers to decide which discounts
or deals to show potential and repeat customers.
Such algorithms are not infallible, and errors can
arise from communications or sensor failures,
unforeseen data volumes, incorrect computer
code, or computer or data-storage failures.33 They
also need to be better understood, to identify and
mitigate potential discriminatory biases.
Consideration is therefore needed of appropriate
regulatory frameworks for data collection, usage
and access, to safeguard privacy and security, while
balancing individual and collective rights (including
freedom of expression and information), and allowing
private sector innovation. Governments can also
create and support new institutional mechanisms for
monitoring data sharing and use, and work with local
companies to promote practices for safeguarding
privacy and security that are compatible with

also be appropriate for monitoring and transparency

Governments can also play a role in developing
standards for the interoperability of big data and

development, particularly productivity. Expert opinion
is broadly divided between three views:
(a) That there has been a secular decline in productivity
due to declining innovation, and that this is likely to
continue, negatively affecting employment growth;
(b) That productivity is near historic highs in those

Some influential economists maintain that the
impact on productivity of ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù technological
breakthroughs in the last decade has been much
more limited than that of the inventions of the late
nineteenth century (Gordon, 2016). Productivity
growth has slowed since 1970, with an uptick
between 1994 and 2004. The major period of
productivity growth was 1920‚Äì1970, when output

EH ∆ÖDZHG DQG WKDW RI∆ÑFLDO HFRQRPLF VWDWLVWLFV PD\
underestimate it by a wide margin (Karabell, 2017).
For example, several decades ago, a long-distance
domestic telephone call could cost $1.00 per minute
and an international call $5.00 per minute, which was
added to GDP, and thus contributed to measured
productivity. Now, video calls are possible globally via
free telecommunications application software, greatly
enhancing business communications and productivity
as well as improving lives. However, since these
applications are free, they add nothing directly to GDP,
or therefore to productivity as currently measured.

economy is driving a global economic transformation
that creates opportunities to cut costs, streamline
supply chains and more easily market products and
services worldwide. With adequate policy support,

countries. In agriculture, as noted above, drones,
sensors, robotics, mobile and cloud computing,
DUWL∆ÑFLDO LQWHOOLJHQFH DQG JHQRPLFV FRXOG FRPELQH WR
bring large improvements to food security. Renewable
energy and distributed energy systems have the
potential to create local jobs, directly and indirectly,
as well as widen electricity access, particularly in rural
areas.
Crucial to the development of these frontier
technologies is that connectivity, including broadband
Internet access and mobile devices, are affordable
and available. In addition, an enabling environment
that includes business-friendly regulations, investing in
modern energy and transport infrastructure, increasing
DYDLODELOLW\RIFDSLWDOLQFOXGLQJIRULQQRYDWLYH∆ÑUPVDQG
SMEs, will be needed.
The global availability of frontier technologies at
declining costs can enable entrepreneurs to create new
companies and other organizations, and governments
to apply these technologies and draw on a large and
growing base of platform users. By 2025, nearly every
person on the planet is expected to have access to
the extraordinary capabilities of Internet-connected
mobile devices, including free access to the GPS for
geolocation, enhancing business prospects through
its integration into commercial apps and websites. In
the right environment, such technologies could enable
developing countries to leapfrog stages of technological
development (see chapter IV). In this regard, the use
of smartphones offers important lessons: while very
few people understand the workings of a smartphone,

27

HARNESSING FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

more than 2 billion people are able to use them for an
amazing array of functions, many directly relevant to
work, including geolocation, information access and
retrieval, email and messaging, posting of economic
and other business information on social media, ridehailing and other ecommerce functions, translation,
DFFHVVLQJWKRXVDQGVRIVHUYHUVIRUDUWL∆ÑFLDOLQWHOOLJHQFH
enabled functions, and many other tasks.
However, frontier technologies can also exacerbate
existing economic, social and technological divides.
Big data, IoT and other digital technologies could
be harnessed by countries, regions and cities with
strong existing capabilities, leaving others further
behind. Much of the innovation in 3D printing, for
example, emanates from countries that already have
well-established manufacturing capabilities. Similarly,
massive open online courses may enable better-off,
more educated and more digitally-connected students
and professionals to supplement their education with
world-class content, leaving further behind those
without digital access, economic opportunities or
accessible education. As already noted, convergence
multiplies the power of technology but may also result
in a concentration of power in large market players,
with potential negative impact on the empowerment
of operators from developing countries. Some
technologies may also carry risks of overexploitation

as discussed in the rest of the report, governments
and other stakeholders need to be proactive in putting
in place policies that minimize such socioeconomic

of technologies are distributed equitably within and
across countries.
Despite their considerable potential, frontier
technologies alone will not address the challenges
of sustainable development. History shows that the
application of technology to sustainable development
challenges
requires
resource
mobilization,
national capacities and policies, and regional and
international cooperation. Nationally, there is a need
to build local capacities and develop policies and an

enabling environment to support the use of new and
existing technologies for sustainable development.
For example, with regard to digital technologies
and as noted by UNCTAD (2017d), many countries
still fail to address investment issues in their digital
development plans. There is also a need to facilitate
the adaptation of technologies to very varied local
contexts and to ensure that they are deployed in a
manner that responds to the needs and lifestyles of
local communities. Globally, achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals will require unprecedented
resource mobilization, partnerships and multilateral
collaboration to fund Sustainable Development
Goal-relevant R&D, to build networks, to strengthen
the global science‚Äìpolicy interface, to transfer
technologies and to support the development of
capabilities in developing countries.
Current national and international efforts are seriously
inadequate to this task. The discovery, development,
dissemination and absorption of useful technologies

Development Goals. This is followed in chapter III by
the consideration of the foundations of STI policy that
need to be in place in order for technology, both frontier
and more established technology, to be harnessed
for inclusive and sustainable development. Chapter
IV presents several new approaches to STI policy for
development, some of which are facilitated by new
forms of collaboration thanks to digital platforms, that
present opportunities for countries to consider in their
efforts to make frontier technologies effective means
of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development.

they hold the promise to deliver better, cheaper, faster results in an easier and more scalable way. However, they also
bring challenges and risks that need to be understood.
(c) The rapid proliferation of new technologies could overwhelm the capacity of policymakers and societies to adapt
to them. Policymakers need to develop plans based on technology foresight and the assessment of technologies
future effects. This could also involve increasing policy experimentation and facilitating shorter, more responsive
innovation cycles.
(d) Governments may consider developing national big data strategies to harness big data for sustainable development.
(e) The net impact of rapid technological change on employment is still uncertain, although in the short term it could
lead to more job destruction than creation.
(f)

Frontier technologies pose questions related to privacy, security and the transparency of algorithms. Policymakers
should consider the need for appropriate regulatory frameworks for data collection, usage and access, to safeguard
privacy and security, while balancing individual and collective rights and allowing private sector innovation.

(g) We do not yet properly understand the relationship between frontier technologies, productivity growth and the
implications on society. More research is needed to inform policy in this respect.

BENEFITING FROM FRONTIER
TECHNOLOGIES: GAPS AND CAPABILITIES

HARNESSING FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

A. INTRODUCTION
Developed and developing countries face the
challenges and opportunities of sustainable
development in the era of the Fourth Industrial
Revolution presented in chapter I from very different
starting points. Trends in frontier technologies, which
are fundamentally enabled by the Internet and ICTs, are
superimposed on a world with existing technological
divides both between and within nations.
To address the overarching commitment of the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development to ‚Äúleave no one
behind‚Äù, this chapter focuses on the key divides that
FRXOG KLQGHU FRXQWULHV LQ KDUQHVVLQJ WKH EHQH∆ÑWV RI
frontier technologies. This is vital to understanding who
is lagging how far behind and to identifying measures
to mitigate such divisions. Responding adequately to
such challenges will require capabilities.
This chapter considers the gaps in such capabilities,
both to generate new technologies domestically and
to absorb technologies produced in other countries

(a) The divide in research and development (R&D)
intensity and the uneven distribution of researchers,
particularly in developing countries;
(b) The vast differences in science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM) education
both between and within regions;
(c) The impact of technological advancement in
manufacturing economic structural transformation;
(d) The need for reform of educational institutions
to allow better preparation of present and future
workers for digital skills;
(e) 7KHVLJQL∆ÑFDQFHRIJHQGHULQWKHWHFKQRORJLFDODQG

Expenditure on R&D36 as a proportion of GDP, also
known as R&D intensity, is the most widely used
indicator of countries‚Äô efforts on science, technology

a long-term objective worldwide. In the European

enterprises, government or higher education
institutions, among others. The objectives of public and
private research differ widely. Public research generally
has the objective of expanding the knowledge base
and obtaining recognition for this, and does not
necessarily result in upgrading of the technological
capabilities of industrial sectors. Conversely, private
research is motivated primarily by the practical
application of the knowledge that it develops.
Business R&D is therefore particularly relevant to such
upgrading and to encouraging innovation, and thus to
development.

HARNESSING FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

The impact of the R&D gap is by no means limited
to the ability of countries to generate new knowledge
or to identify and adapt knowledge generated
elsewhere to their own context. The R&D gap also
affects the capacity of countries to undertake foresight
exercises that allow them to chart the path of their
STI development on their own terms. R&D gaps limit
the ability of developing countries to assess not only
the technological but also the economic, social and
environmental opportunities, challenges and risks
that may emerge from frontier technologies, and put
in place the relevant policy frameworks. Synthetic
biology for example is a key frontier technology with
VLJQL∆ÑFDQWSRWHQWLDOLPSDFWRQIRRGVHFXULW\KHDOWKDQG
the environment. Without adequate R&D capabilities,
a country will struggle to establish and implement
the biosafety regulatory framework needed for the
development of competitive productive capacity in
this sector.

in chapter I, digitalization and automation will give
rise to profound changes across many sectors,
including manufacturing, which has historically driven
structural transformation and provided better jobs for
workers displaced from lower productivity sectors.
A labour force with skills that are complementary to
technological advances is essential if technological
change is to be compatible with social inclusion.
Rapid technological progress requires the labour
force to develop a broader range of skills, focusing
on humans‚Äô comparative advantage, to increase
employability. In the new technological landscape,
there is a need for generic, core or fundamental skills,
such as literacy, numeracy and basic academic skills,
WRJHWKHUZLWKEDVLF∆ÑQDQFLDODQGHQWUHSUHQHXULDOVNLOOV
and, increasingly, basic digital and even coding skills.
Indeed, the predominance of digital technologies in

transversal or transferable skills, and behavioural,
interpersonal and socio-emotional skills. So, too,
are competencies and attitudes such as creativity,
intuition, imagination, curiosity, risk-taking, openmindedness, logical thinking, problem-solving,
decision-making, the ability to engage in contact
and interact with others (empathy and emotional
intelligence), communication, persuasion and
negotiation skills, networking and teamwork, and
the capacity to adapt and learn new abilities.
Education and training policies at all levels should
aim to strengthen such abilities, skills and attitudes
among current and future workers.
As technology advances mismatches may emerge
between the demand for skills and their availability.
These can be minimized by properly assessing
future needs. The relationship between technology
and education in the context of the labour market
has been depicted as a ‚Äúrace between education

However, there are indications that educational

Anticipating changes in skills requirements will
be crucial for education policies to address these
mismatches quickly. Big data analysis may play a
useful role in monitoring labour market changes and
identifying likely skills shortages. This also requires
a holistic approach, entailing collaboration among
policymakers, education and training systems and
employers, to match supply and demand for the skills
required. Such a holistic approach is also needed for
a successful overall lifelong learning system (Riad,
2017). It should also include families, who play an
important role in providing a positive environment for

learning. The role of lifelong learning in harnessing
emerging technologies for sustainable development is
discussed further in chapter IV.
The need for constant updating of skills requires
rethinking of the formal education system to make
learning to learn a key objective. Addressing the
employment challenges of the new technological era
requires curricula to be adapted to teach the skills

literacy and learning to learn competencies, as well
as numeracy and literacy ‚Äì and to focus more on
transferable and socio-emotional skills. What matters
is not merely acquiring knowledge, but increasing the
capacity to learn: learning how to learn is fundamental
to developing new skills and competencies later in life,
initiating a cumulative process through which learning
generates further learning.
Transforming the education and training systems will
also require changes in the way teachers work and
in their pedagogical methods, and improvements
in the quality of education. Indeed, the quality of
education is becoming more important than the
quantity of education received. Education system

therefore be reoriented from memorizing and theory to
acquiring knowledge and learning in a more practical,
applied and experimental manner, through projects
and interaction among students. The role of teachers
should be to facilitate learning and to provide guidance

sources and to use knowledge and information

However, while the development of digital skills is an
important part of the response to frontier technologies,
a prior condition for success is addressing the
fundamental divide that seriously disadvantages the

Gender divides in manufacturing
employment, including ICTs

In developing countries, particularly LDCs, women are
employed mostly in agriculture and services, very often
in the informal economy. While the services sector has
overtaken agriculture as employer of both women
and men, women are employed mainly in lower-paid
and lower-skills jobs rather than in advanced and
high-tech services (United Nations Economic and
Social Council, 2016). For both men and women,
employment is lowest in industry, which accounted for

As discussed in chapter I, the Internet is the
major platform of platforms through which frontier
technologies deploy their effects. Access to the
Internet is key to expanding economic opportunities
and improving service delivery. For example, the
growth of the digital economy is entirely dependent

reliable access to electricity. As UNCTAD (2017b)
notes, accessible, affordable and reliable electricity
is central to structural transformation and frontier
technologies can accentuate the transformative role.
As discussed in chapter I several frontier technologies
can improve access to electricity and the management
of electricity networks, as well as increasing the role
of renewable sources of electricity, giving rise to a
positive loop. Energy consumption is also closely
related to rapid growth of the ICT industry, which has

been estimated to be responsible for 3-4 percent of

CONCLUSIONS

The analysis presented in this chapter
demonstrates the significant and persistent divide
between countries in STI capabilities ‚Äì a divide
that can both perpetuate existing inequalities
and create new ones. The greatest divide is in
the LDCs, which will need to make the greatest
progress by 2030 if the Sustainable Development
Goals are to be achieved. More than ever, it is
imperative for developing countries to strengthen
their efforts towards technological catch-up with
advanced countries and to build knowledge-based
economies. In a digital age, a crucial factor is the
premium on those skills that enable workers to
complement rather than compete with machines.
National strategies in developing countries are
also needed, together with international support
measures, to ensure that they are not left behind,

CHAPTER II. BENEFITING FROM FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES: GAPS AND CAPABILITIES

and to enable them to reap the potential benefits of
frontier technologies. The next chapter discusses
how governments and other STI stakeholders
can collaborate to develop the foundations of
STI policy for development to address the gaps

presented here and create the conditions to exploit
the full potential of frontier technologies ‚Äì and,
equally important, of established technologies ‚Äì
to support the implementation of the Sustainable
Development Goals.

Box 2.2 Key messages and conclusions
(a) There are large divides among countries in technical skills and R&D efforts and capacity. Most developing countries
are lagging behind, especially the LDCs.
(b) The skills base of countries will need to evolve to take advantage of frontier technologies and adapt to rapid
technological change. Anticipating skills changes will be crucial for education policies to address these skills
mismatches quickly.
(c) Some skills will be hard to automate. These include advanced cognitive skills and soft skills that are most inherently
human in nature.
(d) (GXFDWLRQDQGWUDLQLQJV\VWHPVZLOOQHHGWREHUHIRUPHGDQGEHFRPHPRUH∆ÖH[LEOHWRPDWFKVNLOOVZLWKFKDQJLQJ
skills requirements. Learning to learn will itself become a more valuable skill.
(e) There are gender gaps in technical education, employment in the manufacturing and ICT sectors, and in access to
ICTs and the Internet.
(f)

Mutually reinforcing divides in access to electricity and in access to the Internet are a serious bottleneck to the
effective deployment of frontier technologies and exploiting their potential for transformation.

The overarching challenge for developing countries

disseminate knowledge and technologies to promote
sustainable development. For developing countries,
this challenge is equally vital with regard to frontier
technologies and those that are more established in
international markets, which many developing countries

to their full potential. Without appropriate STI policies,
no form of technology is likely to deliver progress in the
global development agenda. Such progress requires
an environment that nurtures learning and innovation ‚Äì
and the dedication of resources, time and concentrated
efforts ‚Äì to build and manage effective innovation
systems.
This chapter therefore provides an overview of the
foundations of STI policy in the context of the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development, drawing
on UNCTAD‚Äôs experience in reviewing STI policy
frameworks in developing countries. Section A outlines
the prerequisites for effective innovation systems in
terms of capabilities, connections and the enabling
environment, and addresses key policy issues in the

protection; section B places STI policy in the wider
context of overall development strategies, highlighting
the importance of policy coherence and coordination;
and section C discusses the reorientation of STI towards
the goals of sustainable and inclusive development in the
context of the 2030 Agenda.

A. INNOVATION SYSTEMS:
BUILDING AN ENABLING
ENVIRONMENT FOR STI
The prevalent view of STI policies has evolved from
a linear model driven primarily by science to a model
based on innovation systems, in which successful
innovation is seen as a response to market demand
and systemic stimuli outside R&D facilities and
laboratories. The latter is now the main theoretical
foundation of innovation policies in developed and
developing countries alike.

systems. The common theme is the idea that the
extent and nature of innovation depend not only on

on their ability to interact (within a given economic

to produce and disseminate economically valuable
knowledge. Such systems develop over time, coevolving with their economic, political, social and
environmental contexts. They are less developed

Firms are at the core of innovation systems, by virtue
of their central role in connecting different types of
knowledge to bring innovative technologies, products
and services to the market (Metcalfe and Ramlogan,
2008). However, the innovation system is a broader
concept, also encompassing research and education
systems, government, civil society and consumers.
The key aspects of innovation systems are the
capabilities of these various actors, the connections
among them, and the enabling environment for
innovation that they create.

1.

Capabilities of actors in the innovation
system

The capability of∆ÑUPVDQGHQWUHSUHQHXUVto absorb
new knowledge and transform it into innovation is
fundamental to any effective innovation system. This
includes a range of capabilities, from absorptive capacity
(to assimilate existing knowledge and technology) to the
ability to engage in advanced R&D and technological
innovation. Firms‚Äô capacities to introduce innovations
in local, national and international markets are a
prerequisite for technological upgrading and improving
a country‚Äôs productive capacity. Technological learning
is not limited to formal mechanisms of R&D: learning
by doing and by interacting with users, clients and
suppliers plays a critical role in many contexts.

capabilities, research actors can offer various services
in support of innovation, ranging from support to
WHFKQRORJ\DGRSWLRQ HJWHVWLQJ WRIXOO\∆ÖHGJHG5 '
and demonstration processes. Their ability to learn
and apply knowledge to innovation processes is thus
critical to technological learning and building the local
knowledge base. Education systems can improve the

The capability of governments to negotiate and

connections is critical to the formation of any innovation
system. Policymakers can deploy a range of instruments
to support innovation processes directly and to tackle
systemic failures inhibiting the performance of the
innovation system. A coherent STI policy mix is crucial,
to provide a stable and predictable environment for
innovation. Governments play a key role in aligning STI
priorities with the challenges of sustainable development
and the Sustainable Development Goals.

enterprises and engaged citizens can be drivers of
technological change and play a critical role in the
adoption and assimilation of new technologies. Civil
society can also assume a mediating role between the
developers of new technologies and societal needs. In
developing countries particularly, civil society can also
be instrumental in testing, promoting and diffusing

develop a basic capacity to learn how to adopt,
assimilate and diffuse existing knowledge and
technologies. Building absorptive capacity and
technological upgrading often relies on local actors‚Äô
access to and assimilation of foreign knowledge and
technology as well as technologies developed by other
ORFDO∆ÑUPV $PVGHQ:RUOG%DQN0HWFDOIH
and Ramlogan, 2008; Malerba and Nelson, 2012;
UNCTAD, 2007, 2017a). While foreign knowledge may
be accessible through trade, foreign direct investment
(FDI), licensing, migration, participation in global value
chains and imitation, successful technology transfer
depends on the development of local absorptive
capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). Technology
transfer should thus be seen as a complement to, not
a substitute for, efforts to build endogenous innovation
potential.

and skills,and is often supported by governments.
While there may be innovation intermediaries or
NQRZOHGJH DQG WHFKQRORJ\ EURNHUV specializing
in facilitating knowledge exchange and innovation
collaborations, all actors in the innovation system
should build capabilities to engage in different forms
of collaboration, from information exchanges to the
formation of innovation partnerships that may become
actors in their own right (e.g. clusters or competence
centres).
Mature innovation systems encourage local, national
and international collaborations that cut across
HFRQRPLF VHFWRUV DUHDV RI WHFKQRORJ\ DQG VFLHQWL∆ÑF
disciplines. Building collaboration capabilities between
national actors is fundamental to strengthening a
country‚Äôs endogenous potential over the long term.
Collaborations along supply and value chains, including
RUJDQL]DWLRQV WKDW SURYLGH ∆ÑQDQFLQJ FRQWULEXWH WR
demand responsiveness and social acceptance as well
as the commercial viability of innovation. For developing
countries with an underdeveloped local knowledge base
and limited access to market intelligence, developing
OLQNVZLWKIRUHLJQ∆ÑUPVIXQGHUVDQGUHVHDUFKFHQWUHVLV
one of the key steps. However, such links will only be
operative if some local capacity has been built previously
through investment in education and training.
The emergence of successful innovation networks is a
long-term process based on a shared vision, common
goals and trust. While innovation collaboration can occur
spontaneously, in many areas ‚Äì notably those related to
social and environmental challenges ‚Äì it requires active
facilitation by government or non-government actors.

most remote communities (Lucas, 1988; Lloyd Ellis
and Roberts, 2002; World Bank, 1993, 2010; Malerba
and Nelson, 2012). Human capital relies on all levels
of education, and includes both the technical and
the managerial skills involved in innovation activities,
from R&D, design and engineering, to technology
brokerage and networking. It is also critical to learning
to design and implement STI policies and develop
effective institutions (Bell, 1984; Bell and Pavitt, 1993,
1995; Lall, 1992, 1996; UNCTAD, 2007). A strong
technical and vocational education system must
provide both basic science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM), as well as management
skills. As discussed in chapter II, new technologies
have greatly increased the importance of skills such
as problem-solving, teamwork, creativity, learning to
learn and ICT skills.

facilities); and existing technologies. Basic technical
infrastructure is one of the key factors promoting
innovation, by facilitating the physical mobility of people
and exchanges of information and knowledge, locally
and internationally. In many developing countries with
inadequate infrastructure, policies target the provision
of specialized infrastructure supporting productive
capacity in selected geographical locations through the
development of various types of industrial estates, such
as cluster industrial parks, special economic zones
and science and technology parks, often including
accelerators and business incubators (as discussed
in chapter IV) (UNCTAD, 2015b). Different elements of
technical infrastructure are functionally connected, and
synergies between them can provide a strong boost
to local development. For example, adequate transport
infrastructure allows easier transportation of windmill

components to wind farms in remote locations,
while reliable ICT infrastructure provides a channel
for information and knowledge on their installation,

ICT is now considered part of a country‚Äôs critical
infrastructure. The digital infrastructure is rapidly
becoming a central element of the ICT infrastructure
(UNCTAD, 2017a). As an enabling technology, ICT
creates synergies with other key technologies such
as biotechnology, nanotechnology and advanced
manufacturing. ICTs have the potential to contribute to
the social, economic and environmental dimensions
of sustainable development, and are relevant to
virtually all the Sustainable Development Goals. Taking
advantage of this potential requires investments in
basic ICT infrastructure, a reliable energy supply and
telecommunication infrastructure, and regulation that
ensures a competitive marketplace providing quality,
affordability and accessibility. Ensuring affordable
access to ICT and overcoming geographical, gender,
generational and income digital divides are crucial,
also helping to avoid new divides in access to, and

to inadequate investment in R&D, development and

broadly. Investment in R&D is particularly low in
developing countries, especially LDCs (UNCTAD,

Patent protection and incentives for
innovation and investment

An important issue in harnessing STI for development
is that of intellectual property (IP) transactions ‚Äì the
purchase, sale, assignment and licensing of intellectual
property rights (IPRs).48 As the principal form of IPR
associated with technical innovation, patents are of
particular importance in the present context.
The common rationale for the patent system is to
provide incentives for innovation. In the pre-TRIPS era,

Free trade agreements (FTAs) and bilateral investment

Evidence suggests that stronger IP protection
established under international treaties does not
necessarily lead to better development outcomes in
terms of local innovation and technology transfer.50
In general, strengthening patent laws has led to
increased patenting by foreign rather than domestic
entities (Lerner, 2002). In most developing countries,

The primary obstacle to local innovation in developing
countries and LDCs is not inadequate IPR protection,
but lack of capabilities. The creation of low-cost
research activities is therefore a higher priority to
stimulate the knowledge economy (Blakeney and

but relatively unsophisticated innovations that do not
meet the eligibility standards for patent protection
(Foray, 2007; UNCTAD, 2015a). Such systems also
offer faster and cheaper registration.51
Strengthening IPRs globally was intended to
encourage technology transfer to developing
countries, particularly LDCs,52 but unresolved issues
remain regarding the effectiveness of the international
IP regime in this respect (UNCTAD, 2016: chapter
3). While some studies (e.g. Maskus, 2004) have

as part of the wider indigenous innovation system,

competition policies (Dhar and Joseph, 2012).

7 of the TRIPS Agreement notes that IPRs should
contribute to the ‚Äútransfer and dissemination of
technology‚Ä¶ in a manner conducive to social and
economic welfare, and to a balance of rights and
obligations‚Äù. Article 8.2 recognizes that countries
may wish to prevent ‚Äúpractices which unreasonably
restrain trade or adversely affect the international
transfer of technology‚Äù. And article 66.2 states that
‚ÄúDeveloped Country Members shall provide incentives
to enterprises and institutions in their territories for the
purpose of promoting and encouraging technology
transfer to least-developed country members in
order to enable them to create a sound and viable
technological base‚Äù.
However, translating such statements into policy

developing countries has proved challenging. The very
notion of technology transfer has been a fundamental
point of contention, and can be interpreted in various

and educational activities. Another important issue is
the absence of any operative institutional apparatus
that could help LDCs to realize the objective of article
66.2, in particular (UNCTAD, 2014b).
The rationale for strengthening the protection of IPRs
has been questioned from a sustainable development
perspective, and reforming the patent system appears
increasingly desirable. The growth in patenting activity

concerns about the viability of patent evaluations.
It has also raised doubts about the extent to which
the incentive structures that encourage patenting
behaviour encourage wider innovation (Wagner,
2009). Particular concerns are the systematic use
of patents to deter market rivals, the accrual of rents
through monopolies and quasi-monopolies, and that
the emergence of ‚Äúpatent trolls‚Äù risks dislocating entire
groups of economic actors, such as small farmers,
without contributing to technological innovation
(UNCTAD, 2017b; Merges, 2009).
Building the capacity of developing countries and
LDCs to foster innovation, absorb technologies
and leverage the IPR system is a key issue. The
experiences of several LDCs highlight the need for a
more strategic approach, in order to boost absorptive
capacities and harness intellectual property to
promote radical innovation and technological
leapfrogging (UNCTAD, 2012, 2015a; UNECA et al.,
2016). However, technological learning and innovation
need to be appropriate to each country‚Äôs level of
technological development, its economic structure
and the capabilities of its public institutions and private
sector (UNCTAD, 2007). Allowing them policy space
to tailor IP laws in line with their national innovation
strategies may also promote better use of IPRs for
sustainable development in the long term. Historical
development experiences highlight the desirability of
IPR regimes that limit the scope of patent protection
and other IPRs (to the extent possible within countries‚Äô
international obligations) during the early stages of
industrial development. This can be done, to a limited

the TRIPS Agreement (UNCTAD, 2015a). The 2030

issues in terms of the orientation of IPR systems
towards the needs of sustainable and inclusive
development, as discussed in section C below.

Aligning STI policy with national

STI policies play an important role in promoting growth,
employment and productivity, by fostering an effective
innovation system and helping to overcome the market
and systemic failures that inhibit innovation. Key
objectives are to build up the innovation capabilities of

Harnessing innovation effectively for development
requires an integrated package of STI, industrial
and trade policies directed towards building local
capabilities and allowing them to be exploited
competitively (Metcalfe and Ramlogan, 2008). This
requires effective integration of STI policies in overall
development strategies in support of development
goals.
To be fully effective, STI policies need to be fully
aligned with national development plans, to ensure
coherence and synergies between the two. This
requires consideration of the wider objectives of the
development strategy throughout the policy process,
from the initial vision to policy evaluation, and a systemic
and integrated approach to the design, implementation
and evaluation of STI instruments and policies.

Box 3.2 Key lessons from UNCTAD‚Äôs work on STI policies for development
STI policy challenges in emerging innovation systems
While STI policy remains highly context-specific, policy-makers in developing countries face similar market and
system failures. STI policy instruments need to be adapted to the structure of developing economies, often
dominated by micro and small enterprises and the informal sector, while the majority of firms and innovation
actors have limited absorptive capacities. STI policy should gradually build local capacity to learn and adopt
new technologies; invest in R&D, training and innovation; and introduce major technological innovations. To build
productive capacity and foster technological upgrading, STI policy needs, first and foremost, to support basic
absorptive capacity and incremental innovation in traditional sectors.
Emerging innovation systems are fragmented, with only limited innovation collaboration among firms and between
industry and research institutions, while investment in R&D and innovation is generally limited in both the private
and public sectors. Scaling up investment in STI capacity will require significant external financial support,
especially in the LDCs. Governance challenges are common, with inadequate coordination, short time horizons
and a lack of sustained policy support. There is a great need for innovation support with a focus on longer-term
development goals rather than only on short-term deliverables. Finding effective institutional frameworks for STI
management is a priority.
Building STI policy capacity in developing countries
STI is not always a priority policy area in developing countries, and not all have an explicit STI strategy or policy.
Building foundations for effective STI policy requires:
(a) $VVXPLQJ D V\VWHPLF DSSURDFK WR 67, SROLF\: Many developing countries rely on a linear sciencepush model of innovation, which does not fully harness the potential benefits of technology adoption and
entrepreneurship. STI policy needs to be underpinned by a better understanding of innovation systems, to
target the main market and system failures challenging innovation.
(b) A broad definition of innovation: Many developing countries focus too narrowly on technological
innovation. Innovation needs to be understood broadly as including new products and services, processes,
organizational improvements and business models, as well as other forms of innovation, including social,
pro-poor and frugal innovation.
(c) (IIHFWLYHSULRULW\VHWWLQJ: Many countries have difficulties in establishing STI priorities and identifying where
potential returns to the use of public resources in STI are greatest. This often results in long lists of ‚Äúpriority
actions‚Äù that spread resources too thinly, making it difficult to accumulate critical mass and undermining the
overall credibility of STI policy. This fragmentation, coupled with inadequate funding, limits the contribution
of STI policy to development.
(d) 0DLQVWUHDPLQJ DQG LQWHJUDWLRQ RI 67, SROLFLHV: Improving policy coordination across ministries and
between government and other stakeholders is critical to improve innovation performance. Building strategic
links and coordination between STI policy and other development policies (notably industrial policy, FDI,
trade, competition, education and training, entrepreneurship and SME policies) is critical to harnessing the
development potential of innovation.
(e) ,PSURYHG SROLF\PDNLQJ DQG LPSOHPHQWDWLRQ FDSDFLW\: This includes improving overall policy capacity
throughout the policy cycle, from design through implementation, to monitoring and evaluation of STI
instruments and portfolios. Some policy instruments are hardly used in developing countries (e.g. innovation
funds or technology foresight), while others require greater managerial capacity (e.g. IPR).
UNCTAD‚Äôs advice on STI policy has helped to raise awareness and systemic understanding of innovation among
policymakers, and promoted STI policy mainstreaming across various development policy areas. Nonetheless,
challenges remain in improving the design and implementation of STI policy and in seeking synergies between
STI and long-term development goals. (Padilla-P√©rez and Gaudin (2010) provide an analysis of common causes
of STI policy failure in developing countries.) Fostering such synergies requires buy-in from diverse stakeholders,
notably from politicians and top-level policymakers.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2018

a.

Conduct a critical review of the innovation
system and STI policy

A systemic approach to STI requires a solid
understanding of innovation system performance
among policymakers, including knowledge of
systemic bottlenecks in all its dimensions. In
developing countries with limited experience of STI
policy, a useful starting point is a comprehensive
policy review to assess existing innovation potential
and the STI policy mix, including a cross-impact
assessment of existing policy instruments. By
providing knowledge of current STI policy coverage,
gaps and overlaps, and of causal relationships and
FRQ∆ÖLFWVEHWZHHQGLIIHUHQWLQVWUXPHQWVVXFKDUHYLHZ
can provide a foundation for evidence-based policy
design, coordination and improved policy coherence.
The process of conducting a comprehensive STI
policy review is also an important part of policy
learning, which is a key aspect of building policy
capacity.

b.

Build a shared vision and choose strategic
priority areas for STI policy

A sustainable innovation policy requires a longterm vision to provide the framework and direction
for short-term goals. Building a shared vision and
choosing strategic priorities through a participatory
policy learning process help to reduce the perceived
uncertainty and complexity of policy choices, and to
pre-empt possible contestation of the selected course
of action.
Given the political nature of priority-setting
processes, key stakeholders should be actively
engaged in the development of a vision and in
deliberations on STI priorities. The process should
be based on a critical assessment of where STI can
contribute most to the country‚Äôs key development
objectives, considering the likely economic, social
and environmental impacts of innovation, and
should be accompanied by dedicated impact
assessments of alternative options. Prioritysetting should seek to ensure an equitable
distribution between communities and localities of
the risks and benefits of the selected innovation
pathways (Altenburg and Pegels, 2012; Weber
and Rohracher, 2012). It should also take into
account existing policy mandates and capabilities
to address selected challenges systematically. As
discussed in chapter IV, the smart specialization
approach can be a useful approach to the selection
of priorities for policy intervention.

CHAPTER III. FOUNDATIONS OF STI POLICY FOR SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT

c.

Facilitate strategic partnerships

Political leadership and strategic partnerships are
fundamental to effective STI policy and governance
(see box 3.3). The vision and strategic priorities for
STI should be supported by established and new
partnerships involving key stakeholders for the selected
areas, including both established and emerging
DFWRUV%XLOGLQJSDUWQHUVKLSVDURXQGVSHFL∆ÑFSULRULWLHV
from the outset of strategy formulation is essential,

to ensure a sense of ownership and commitment
among key actors, and can contribute to building
new networks of actors mobilized around societal
challenges. Building such partnerships and fostering
innovation in support of sustainable development
in priority areas require political commitment and
leadership and actions by public and private actors,
including different ministries. Collaboration skills are
essential, among both policymakers and other actors
in the system.

Box 3.3 Finland‚Äôs Research and Innovation Council ‚Äì Leadership and coordination of key stakeholders in innovation
policy design, and well-developed M&E practices
The Research and Innovation Council of Finland is a powerful multi-stakeholder STI policy coordination mechanism, which
has contributed to the country‚Äôs consistent rating as highly innovative in international rankings. The Council is chaired
by the Prime Minister, and includes ministerial-level representation of key government ministries, including Education,
Industry, Trade, Science and Finance. High-level representatives of the science community, the private sector, trade
unions and civil society also participate. The Council meets twice a month to discuss strategic issues, budget allocations
and institutional topics.
The Council played an important role in the design of Finland‚Äôs development strategy, integrating STI into its central focus.
It combined political leadership at the highest level with broadly based representation of important national actors to
establish a consensus on economic strategy, which was essential to the design of a coherent national strategy based on
developing innovation capacity. This leadership was critical to establishing a coherent and coordinated basis for STI and
other policies to respond to and overcome the national economic crisis of the early 1990s. Implementation challenges
have been addressed through careful design, measurement and M&E, and through representation of all key actors in the
Council, which promotes coordination and buy-in by these key stakeholders.
There is a culture of policy learning within various layers of Finnish policy-making, commonly based on periodic evaluations
of institutions and programmes. The Finnish experience demonstrates the time needed to develop an open evaluation
culture: evaluations started slowly in the 1970s, only becoming institutionalized in the 2010s. Policy learning in Finland is
largely based on drawing lessons from evaluations of its own institutions, together with benchmarking through searching
for best practices around the world.

Government submits to Parliament a report on the future, focusing on long-term perspectives. Each report is restricted to
key strategic issues related to policy decisions to be taken in a 10‚Äì20 year period, and aims to encourage broad debate
in society. The Parliament of Finland itself has had a standing Committee for the Future since 1993, consisting of 17
Members of Parliament, which serves as a think tank for futures, science and technology policy.
The Finnish experience of monitoring and evaluation suggests two overarching lessons. First, impartial evaluations of
institutions, policies, instruments and programmes are an important means of providing valuable lessons and improving
transparency, particularly if published. Second, policy learning can be complemented by building evaluation into

external trends. The STI strategy and road map should
include a GHGLFDWHG 0 ( V\VWHP allowing progress
towards the stated objectives to be measured. The
policy road map is a continuing process, and should be
updated as policies are implemented.
The experience of countries that have been successful
in technological upgrading strongly supports the need
for long-term strategic planning in developing countries.
Building a well-functioning national innovation system
requires long-term and patient policies. Countries
such as China, the Republic of Korea and Singapore
established the basics in an initial phase before moving on
to more advanced learning and capability development.
The Republic of Korea, for example, established the
foundations for an innovation system between the early
1960s and the mid-1970s. It then implemented revised
strategies in the late 1970s and the 1980s, allowing it to
catch up exceptionally rapidly with more technologically
advanced countries (Lee, 2016).

Addressing the challenges of inclusiveness and

tackled entirely by market-based instruments such
as carbon pricing, emissions trading and support

stringent targets that impose limits on production
and consumption systems.
More generally, sustainable development requires
fostering transformative innovations with the potential
to supplant unsustainable practices and systems.
This requires a portfolio of mutually reinforcing policy
instruments, exploiting synergies between policies in
STI and in other areas, ensuring that public interventions

and environmental sustainability, focusing on areas

Developing capacity in technology foresight (e.g.
horizon scanning and ex ante impact assessments)
can help, by allowing countries to identify and exploit
the potential of frontier technologies for sustainable
development, to identify priority technologies in the
short, medium and longer term, and to assess the
potential effects of emerging technologies. There are
also important implications for the methodologies
and types of evidence needed to support policy

design and implementation, for example combining
methodologies and data for technological, economic,
social and environmental impacts in assessment of
the environmental impacts of innovation.
UNCTAD and the United Nations Commission on
Science and Technology for Development have
formulated a number of policy recommendations
for developing countries to systematize foresight

Intellectual property rights and the
Sustainable Development Goals

As discussed in chapter I, many emerging technologies
have the potential to make a major contribution towards
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals across
multiple areas. However, there are important areas of
tension between these objectives and some aspects
of current IPR protection arrangements. Realizing this
potential will thus require harnessing IPRs to this end.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2018

Furthermore, many of the proprietors of the intellectual
property of frontier technologies are concentrated in
the private sector of developed countries and some
larger developing countries with greater technological
capabilities. This raises further questions as to the
potential for licensing in frontier technologies, reverse
engineering and technology diffusion, given the limitations
imposed by the TRIPS Agreement and the even higher
standards established by some free trade agreements
(Max Planck Institute, 2012; UNCTAD, 2015a).

driven, and the application of IPRs associated with
biotechnology has major implications for food security.
The international IPR system for patenting seeds54
also reinforces the concentration of the agricultural
biotechnology sector in a few multinational enterprises,
particularly in the seed sector, resulting in an oligopoly
in the supply of inputs vital to food security (Blakeney,
2009).55 Patents for many cutting-edge technologies
are held by a handful of multinational enterprises,
which thus control a vast proportion of the agricultural
inputs market. The need for small-scale farmers to
adopt new technologies to remain competitive in
global value chains creates a state of dependency on
these few companies for inputs, and may also give
rise to production bottlenecks unless addressed by
competition laws (Lianos et al., 2016; UNCTAD, 2008).

of plant variety rights have allowed plant materials

Technological solutions are also essential to
Sustainable Development Goal 7, to ‚Äúensure access
to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern
energy for all‚Äù and Sustainable Development Goal
13, to ‚Äútake urgent action to combat climate
change and its impacts‚Äù. While IPRs can encourage
innovation to provide technical solutions to tackle
climate change and provide clean energy, they can
be a barrier to technology transfer in some cases
(de Coninck and Sagar, 2015). Patent protection
of climate change mitigation technologies such
as biofuels, solar thermal, solar photovoltaic (PV)
DQG ZLQG HQHUJ\ KDYH LQFUHDVHG VLJQL∆ÑFDQWO\
in recent years (Helm et al., 2014). Equally, the
higher technical standards required for advanced
biofuel production will ultimately be proprietary and
costly to obtain, limiting transfer of the technology
to developing countries (Juma and Bell, 2009).
Achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 7
and 13 will therefore require greater clarity regarding
IP transactions in the development and transfer of
climate-friendly technologies within international
forums on climate change.
Such linkages between IPRs and the Sustainable
Development Goals suggest that an exclusive focus
on increasing standards of IPR protection is not
the optimal way forward. Rather, the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development further highlights the
importance of recognizing the need for special
and differential treatment for developing countries
to facilitate sustainable development, especially
in relation to the targets on technology and trade.
This is a key aspect of Sustainable Development

they are to contribute to the 2030 Agenda for

technological capacities, especially in LDCs, to

the public and private dimensions of knowledge
(UNCTAD, 2010), and between the granting of
exclusive rights and the promotion of follow-on
innovation by competitors. A regional approach

to IP in relation to local production issues may
foster regional innovation and R&D, particularly in
the pharmaceuticals sector, to develop regional
markets and economies of scale.

academia, politics and technology have recently
raised the issue of the implications of current and
prospective changes in productive technologies, and
particularly their potential effects on employment (as
discussed in chapter I) for the social contract.59
Historically, the evolution of the concept of the social
contract (from an economic perspective) has been
closely connected with socioeconomic dislocations,
particularly those arising from major technological
changes, from agricultural mechanization through the
industrial revolution. The widespread unemployment
and increased inequality associated with the
HFRQRPLFGLVUXSWLRQVRIWKH∆ÑUVWKDOIRIWKHWZHQWLHWK
century, in particular, were an important driver of the
materialization of the social contract in many developed
countries in the form of the welfare state. However,
the welfare state has come under increasing pressure
VLQFHWKHODWHVDVDUHVXOWRI∆ÑQDQFLDODQGSROLWLFDO
pressures; and it now faces fundamental challenges,
not only from rapid technological change, but also
from a wider context of globalization, asymmetries
in the mobility of capital and (especially unskilled)
labour, international migration, increasing inequality,
demographic change and increasingly insecure labour
markets (associated with the ‚Äúgig economy‚Äù).
Consideration of the implications of these changes
for the social contract remains at an early stage,60 but
the challenges are clearly considerable. While many
observers anticipate, extrapolating from past episodes
of technological change, that there will be no net
reduction in employment in the long term, this view is
far from universal, and there are widespread concerns

(Pew Research Center, 2014). Moreover, these
changes come at a time when unemployment and
underemployment are already at high levels globally.
Unless effective means can be found to ensure lifelong

independently from employment, and to counter
increases in inequality, this could raise the risk of
social and political disruption, as well as undermining
economic sustainability (West, 2015).
Recent interventions on the theme of technological
change and the social contract have included coownership by workers of infrastructural technologies,

taxes, shorter working hours to share the available
work more widely, and credits for voluntary work. The
following subsections discuss two themes that have
been almost universal in discussions to date:
(a) Lifelong learning, to allow workers to adapt to
rapidly changing demands in the labour market;
and
(b) Universal basic income (UBI) ‚Äì periodic cash

a.

Lifelong learning policies

Taking full advantage of new technologies requires
ensuring that education remains ahead in the race
against technology, by anticipating the effects of
technological change on employment and ensuring
the availability of the necessary skills (chapter II).
Workers themselves also need to reskill constantly to
remain employable in a context of rapidly changing
skill requirements, changing occupations more often
across longer working lives. This requires a constant
and dynamic process of transformation through lifelong
OHDUQLQJLQZKLFKWKHNH\FRPSHWHQFHVDUH∆ÖH[LELOLW\
adaptability and capacity to learn. The importance of
lifelong learning is recognized explicitly in Sustainable
Development Goal 4, to ‚Äúensure inclusive and quality
education for all and promote lifelong learning‚Äù.
As well as skills upgrading, this requires skills updating,
to perform the non-routine manual and cognitive tasks
left to humans as automation polarizes the labour
market by displacing primarily middle-skilled workers.
Such tasks include, in particular, manual tasks

visual and language recognition, in-person interaction,
and ‚Äúcommon-sense skills that we understand
only tacitly‚Äù, which are particularly challenging for
automation (Autor, 2016:3, citing Polanyi).
Many workers do not have the capacity to pursue
continuous education without support and guidance.
It is noteworthy that participation in adult education
and learning is greatest among adults who are highly

Moreover, private sector support is limited by lack of
resources for training, particularly in SMEs, and the
disincentives arising from high levels of staff mobility,
which limit the ability of employers to appropriate

Governments thus have a key role in investing in
lifelong learning, particularly for those in the lowerskilled occupations most vulnerable to automation
and other disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, by
ensuring the availability of affordable and high-quality
lifelong learning opportunities.
This means reforms to educational and training
systems, both to provide children and young people
with the skills needed to evolve with a continuously
changing environment, and to promote retraining,
skills upgrading and skills updating for adults.
However, while some general patterns emerge, as

b.

Universal basic income

The risk of future job losses, with many workers
unable to adapt to the changing demands of the
labour market, is among the main concerns raised
by the prospect of future large-scale deployment of
frontier technologies. Such risks pose an important
threat to, the principle of inclusiveness fundamental to
a development agenda that aspires to leave no one
behind. The concept of a minimum income available
to every member of a society, now generally referred
to as universal basic income, is being increasingly
debated as a possible response to such fears.
Several developed and developing and countries have
experimented with UBI programmes locally, including the United States (the Developed country cases

at the local level in the United States, Netherlands and
Italy, while Finland has initiated a small-scale controlled experiment on the use of a partial basic income
model at the national level (box 3.5).
While controversial, UBI has supporters on both
sides of the ideological divide. Some proponents

emphasize its role in promoting social justice
and redistribution and to support consumption
and demand; others stress its potential to limit
welfare programmes, to reduce the associated
bureaucratic burden and fraud, and to reduce
public sector influence on markets operations
and individual choices. By providing a minimum
element of economic and social inclusiveness,
UBI could also help to sustain aggregate demand
and reduce the risk of social and political unrest;
and it may offer an economically efficient means
of distributing the rents generated by naturalresource endowments in resource-rich developing
countries.
An additional benefit of a UBI, particularly pertinent
in the present context, is its potential to promote
innovation and entrepreneurship by allowing more
time for creativity and providing the basic financial
security needed to limit the risks involved. As
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (2017) has
observed:
‚ÄúAn entrepreneurial culture thrives when it‚Äôs easy
to try lots of new ideas ‚Ä¶ The greatest successes
come from having the freedom to fail ‚Ä¶ Right
now, our society is way over-indexed on rewarding
success and we don‚Äôt do nearly enough to make
it easy for everyone to take lots of shots‚Ä¶ I
know a lot of entrepreneurs, and I don‚Äôt know a
single person who gave up on starting a business
because they might not make enough money. But
I know lots of people who haven‚Äôt pursued dreams
because they didn‚Äôt have a cushion to fall back
on if they failed ‚Ä¶ We should explore ideas like
universal basic income to give everyone a cushion
to try new things‚Äù (Zuckerberg, 2017).

Box 3.5 Finland‚Äôs partial basic income experiment, 2017‚Äì2018
Basic income is a key project of the current Government of Finland. It put out a tender for proposals to conduct a
controlled experiment on the application of UBI in late 2015, and contracted the Research Department of the Finnish
Social Insurance Institution (Kela) to carry it out in 2017‚Äì2018.

CHAPTER III. FOUNDATIONS OF STI POLICY FOR SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT

A general concern that has been raised regarding UBI
is its potential to reduce labour supply, by weakening
incentives for employment.62 In the present context,
however, this is not necessarily a disadvantage:
provided any reduction in labour supply was not
excessive, its effect would be to counter the mediumterm (and possibly long-term) reduction in labour
demand anticipated as a result of rapid technological
change, moderating the net impact on labour markets.
Provided the UBI was set at a level below the living
standard to which most people aspired, reduced
labour supply could be expected to take the form of a
reduction in each individual‚Äôs working hours, allowing
the reduced employment opportunities and labour
income to be distributed more widely.
While the empirical evidence is limited and based
only on small-scale local programmes, direct cash
transfers have been found to be an effective way of
addressing extreme poverty at a low administrative
cost (through digital technologies), without distorting
market signals. Results from developing countries
indicate positive effects on access to health and
education, nutrition, microentrepreneurial activity and
women‚Äôs empowerment. Favourable effects on health
and education outcomes and poverty have also been
observed in developed countries, while effects on
labour-force participation have been limited.
By simultaneously promoting innovation, strengthening

represents a particular obstacle in the current global
macroeconomic context. While direct costs would

marginal tax rate, seriously affecting incentives for
labour market participation (Kangas et al., 2017).
62

Alternative approaches intended to limit potential
disincentives to work include a negative income tax (such
as the Earned Income Tax Credit in the United States)
and a shift of the tax burden from labour income towards
Pigouvian taxes on negative externalities (Brynjolfsson
and McAfee, 2016).

This suggests a need to investigate other sources

Microsoft founder Bill Gates as a means of managing
the pace of innovation and creating new employment

the potential to provide genuinely additional resources

Economic and Social Affairs, 2012).

D. CONCLUSIONS
As discussed in chapter I, frontier technologies have
immense potential to contribute to sustainable and
inclusive development, and could make a major
contribution to the achievement of the Sustainable
Development Goals. However, harnessing this
potential will require the establishment of effective
innovation systems in developing countries, through
the development of capabilities and connections
among the key actors, and strengthening regulatory
and policy frameworks, institutions and governance,
HQWUHSUHQHXULDO HFRV\VWHPV DFFHVV WR ∆ÑQDQFH
human capital and technical and R&D infrastructure. It
also requires a reorientation of STI policies to address
the three pillars of sustainable development, and their
integration into national development strategies, to
ensure policy coherence and optimize the contribution
of technological change to societal goals.
Also essential is to address the potential social
costs of the disruptive effects of rapid technological
change, particularly on labour markets, over
the short and medium term. This highlights the
importance of lifelong learning, for skills updating
as well as skills upgrading, which will require active
policy support. Strengthened social protection

HARNESSING FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

is also important, to offset negative impacts on
employment and protect those unable to adapt
to rapidly changing skills requirements. Growing
concern about the potential social impact of
rapid technological change has led to a renewal
of interest in the idea of a universal basic income,
including several experimental applications, mostly
at the local level. While the globalization of markets
for goods, services and financial and human
capital represents an important constraint, given
its high fiscal cost, consideration could be given to

strengthened international coordination in this area
‚Äì possibly including a global UBI ‚Äì if this is merited
by the results of such experiments.
Beyond these foundations of STI policy for inclusive and
sustainable development, several new approaches are
emerging ‚Äì notably in technology, industrial policy and

The implications of frontier technologies on society are yet uncertain; providing a safety net for those who may be
adversely affected can encourage innovation and creativity by lowering its risks. In this regard, countries could learn
from ongoing experimentation with universal basic income programmes, and the potential of applying for future
social protection initiatives.

development goals discussed in chapters I to III. There
have also been a number of important developments
in conceptual and policy approaches to technology

frontier technologies, particularly the opportunities for
networking and collaboration that digital technologies
and platforms afford. A key part of building on the
foundations of STI policy outlined in chapter III is to
apply these new concepts effectively and to make
optimal use of new opportunities and emerging policy
approaches.
This chapter discusses these new concepts,
opportunities and policy approaches from the
perspective of STI policy for inclusive and sustainable
development. It begins, in section A, with a discussion
of the potential and limitations of technological
leapfrogging as a means to development. Section B

A. LEAPFROGGING: LOOK

Discussions of the developmental dimension of
frontier technologies, particularly digital technologies,
often highlight the possibility of ‚Äúleapfrogging‚Äù. The
traditional notion of ‚Äúcatch-up‚Äù refers to the narrowing
of gaps in income and technological capabilities
between a late-developing country and a front-runner

entailed a sequential process of learning by latecomers
in skills, process technology, design technology and
new product development (Lee, 2005).

nature of recent technological advances, notably in ICT

but may rather be achieved by technological

stages of technology through which countries have
historically passed during the development process
(Lee, 2016; Steinmueller, 2001).
A key distinction is that between leapfrogging
through the development of new technologies and
leapfrogging through the adoption of technologies
that have been developed elsewhere. A few countries,
notably the Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province
of China, have achieved rapid economic growth by
successfully leapfrogging in the development of a
limited number of short-cycle technology sectors
such as semiconductors and other electronic goods,
skipping certain stages through which leading foreign

such latecomers have begun with assembly of

development of low-tech and then progressively
higher-tech components, before learning to modify the
design of existing products, and ultimately to develop
new products (Lee and Lim, 2001).
For
many
developing
countries,
however,
leapfrogging in the industrial sector, particularly
through the development of new technologies, is
beset with challenges. Catch-up, whether in the
historical sense, or through leapfrogging, requires the
learning of modern technologies and accumulation
of indigenous technological capabilities in innovation
and technological know-how for production, as well
DVLQYHVWPHQWLQSK\VLFDODVVHWV 2GDJLULHWDO 
and the development of upstream industries requires
a manufacturing base with innovation capabilities,
which is often lacking, especially in LDCs. Moreover,
technological learning and innovation in the Republic

greatly from reverse engineering, which allowed
the build-up of capabilities in the creation of new
products; and the advent of more stringent IPR
protection represents an additional barrier to this
course.
In most developing countries, even the ability to
leapfrog through adoption of existing technologies
varies between technologies and sectors. The recent
increase in attention to technological leapfrogging
has been motivated in large part by the experience
of the ICT sector. Rapid technological advances and
associated cost reductions in ICT in recent decades
(chapter I) have enabled some developing countries,
notably in Africa, to skip the development of analogue
landline infrastructure by moving directly to digital
mobile telecommunications. As well as contributing

frontier in the absence of widespread technological
capabilities in other sectors.63
Advances in ICTs have been hailed as opening up
opportunities to bypass the manufacturing stage of
development to leapfrog into the services economy
‚Äì and some developing countries have moved in this
direction, participating in global value chains through
global outsourcing in ICT services. As yet, however,
relatively few countries have succeeded in developing
substantial activities in this area, partly due to
stringent requirements in terms of infrastructure,

segments of society are not automatic, and largely
limited to second-order effects such as indirect job
creation. Even in the successful cases of India and
the Philippines, most direct and indirect job creation
has occurred in a few major urban agglomerations
(UNCTAD, 2010).
Successful as it has been in many respects, Africa‚Äôs
mobile revolution also demonstrates the limitations of
leapfrogging. Despite their potential developmental
role, the economic impact of ICTs in sub-Saharan
Africa in recent years appears smaller than in
63

See The Economist (2017).

limitations of innovation policy in Africa to coevolve
with the development of ICT, which has resulted in
opportunities to build on the mobile revolution to
foster innovation and development not being fully
exploited (Juma and Lee, 2005). As well as adoption
of ICTs, catching up requires ensuring an adequate
and reliable energy supply and availability of the
skills needed to enhance productivity and stimulate
innovation. Moreover, sustaining progress requires
a constant process of innovation and investment
in the latest technologies to keep pace with
continuing rapid technological change in the sector
(WEF, 2016). Investment in extensive broadband
installation, building absorption capabilities and
skills development are also needed, to ensure that
digitization does not exacerbate the digital divide
within societies (UNCTAD, 2017).
The energy sector is often seen as a parallel to ICTs,
offering an opportunity to leapfrog to decentralized
renewable energy systems through the adoption
of new technologies, bypassing traditional reliance
on fossil fuels; and some developing countries have
made substantial progress in this direction. As in the
ICT sector, international prices in renewables have
fallen dramatically in recent years as investments in
their development have increased: the cost of wind
turbines has fallen by nearly a third, and that of solar

making both increasingly competitive with fossil
fuel generation. This suggests that leapfrogging in
energy systems may be a viable path to economic
development, as well as promoting a ‚Äúgreen

economy‚Äù64 and contributing to climate change
mitigation.
Innovation policies can certainly help to promote and
facilitate the development, adaptation, deployment
and use of renewable energy technologies to support
sustainable development. However, if the transition
of developing countries from fossil fuels to renewable
energy is to be a catalyst for industrial development
and structural change, it needs to be backed by
∆ÑQDQFHDQGLQYHVWPHQWWHFKQRORJ\WUDQVIHUDQGRWKHU
supportive measures to ensure adequate energy
supply at reasonable costs (UNCTAD, 2011a). In
LDCs particularly, such a transition itself requires
overcoming important technological, economic,
∆ÑQDQFLDODQGJRYHUQDQFHREVWDFOHV 81&7$' 
Again, the distinction between leapfrogging
through the adoption of existing technologies and
leapfrogging through the development of new
technologies is critical. In both ICT and renewable
energy, the transformative potential of leapfrogging is
limited by the obstacles of backward linkages to the
production of (and still more to innovation in) related
equipment. ICT services and renewable electricity
generation require only the adoption of technologies
and entail little risk; but manufacturing of ICT and
renewable energy equipment is characterized by
high concentration of global production and exports,
VLJQL∆ÑFDQW HFRQRPLHV RI VFDOH DQG KLJK EDUULHUV
to market entry. Leapfrogging in the design and
manufacture of technologies entails innovation in
design and product development, which requires
much more advanced capabilities than leapfrogging
through technology adoption. In most developing
countries, technological capabilities thus represent an
important constraint, compounded by the complexity
and irregularity of technological leapfrogging in the
development of upstream industries.
Hence, only a limited number of developing countries
have yet made their mark as developers of renewable
energy technologies ‚Äì most notably Brazil, now
the second largest producer of liquid biofuels for
transport after the United States (WEC, 2016), and
China, which produces the majority of the world‚Äôs PV
and solar thermal heating technologies (International
Renewable Energy Agency, 2016). Ultimately, longterm technological innovation depends on industrial

development and a manufacturing base, and thus on
the hard and soft infrastructure for such development
(Juma, 2017).
Nonetheless, leapfrogging through technology
adoption in sectors such as ICT and renewable energy
can provide a cost-effective means of accelerating
sustainable development, and may open further
leapfrogging opportunities in other areas. International
initiatives such as the United Nations‚Äô multi-stakeholder
forum on STI and the Technology Bank for LDCs
offer useful knowledge-sharing platforms enabling
developing countries to make informed policy choices
on frontier technologies in such areas.
In leapfrogging as in other contexts, technological
learning and innovation need to be appropriate to
each country‚Äôs level of technological development, its
economic structure and the capabilities of its public
institutions and private sector (UNCTAD, 2007). The
potential to harness and sustain a development
trajectory based on leapfrogging depends on the
state of infrastructure, institutional capacity and other
sources of externalities, which are lacking in many
developing countries, particularly in the early stages
of technological development (Fong, 2008). Also
important are the selection of technological standards
appropriate to local circumstances (Lee, 2005) and
the development of markets for complementary
technologies, given the systemic nature of ICT
and energy and their linkages with other sectors
(Steinmueller, 2001).

to deliver fully on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. New approaches are needed, within
which the notions of directionality and participation
are essential. This means that innovation should
be approached as a phenomenon that takes place
within networks of actors in which civil society plays
a central role. Harnessing innovation for sustainable
and inclusive development requires changes in the
direction of key economic and social processes
(for example with regards to sustainable patterns of
production and consumption) which cannot take
place without the strong involvement of civil society.
That is why growing attention is being given to several

CHAPTER IV. FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES, EMERGING APPROACHES AND OPPORTUNITIES

new approaches to innovation. Such approaches are
variously termed pro-poor, inclusive, below-the-radar,
frugal, bottom-of-the-pyramid, grass-roots and social
LQQRYDWLRQ ODUJHO\ UH∆ÖHFWLQJ GLIIHUHQFHV LQ HPSKDVLV
This section considers some of the broad themes
underlying these approaches, and highlights policy
options to promote them.

of innovation to previously excluded groups, either
as consumers of new products and services or as
participants in the innovation process (box 4.2). The
main focus is on developing low-cost products and
services and new commercialization and distribution
strategies to serve untapped markets, such as lowcost medical products and mobile telemedicine
clinics in remote rural areas; and innovations that
strengthen the entrepreneurial skills of people
living in poverty, to help raise their incomes. The

reduce their travel costs.
The concept of IUXJDO LQQRYDWLRQ focuses on
innovation by marginalized groups themselves,
particularly informal forms of innovation in contexts
of scarcity. Such innovation often entails building on
simple ideas and local knowledge, as in the case
RI VRODU qEXOEVr t UHXVHG SODVWLF ERWWOHV ∆ÑOOHG ZLWK
bleach-treated water, providing light at minimal cost
to poor households without access to electricity in
the Philippines and elsewhere (Radjou, Prabhu and
Ahuja, 2012). Another example of frugal innovation is
MittiCool, a low-cost refrigerator made of sustainable
materials, which works without electricity, using

water evaporation as a cooler. It is easy to produce,
at a cost of $30‚Äì$50, and can keep food fresh for
two to three days. MittiCool has been supported by
the National Innovation Foundation of India (2009).
Several governments and development institutions
have used different policy tools to support pro-poor
and inclusive innovation, including seed-funding
VFKHPHV IRU VPDOO SURGXFHUV QHZ ∆ÑQDQFLDO VHUYLFHV
and infrastructure for the development of local
markets, and innovation in new products. There have
also been successful examples of inclusive public
procurement programmes to stimulate innovative
entrepreneurship among groups of population at
particular risk of exclusion or with limited involvement
in innovative activity, including women entrepreneurs,
for example, in the Dominican Republic.65 The
effectiveness of inclusive innovation programmes can
be enhanced by integrated design approaches that

in implementation (UNCTAD, 2014a).
Grass-roots innovation approaches seek to practise
innovation, in both technology and service provision, in
ways that include local communities in the knowledge,
processes and outcomes involved (box 4.2). This is
done primarily through the involvement of grass-roots
actors, such as civil society, social movements and
networks of academics, activists and practitioners
experimenting with alternative forms of knowledgecreation and innovation processes (Fressoli et al.,

Box 4.2 Grass-roots innovation: Examples
The maker movement, a popular contemporary innovation movement, has become a global driver of informal
experimentation with technologies such as software, microelectronics, robotics and digital fabrication. Its main aims are
to experiment with artefacts and modify them for novel purposes, and to create unrestricted access to technology. It links
traditional knowledge about carpentry, metallurgy and mechanics with new technologies such as software programming
and basic electronics. The Internet has enabled the spread of maker culture by connecting amateurs, practitioners and
experts worldwide, and fostering collaboration and learning (Anderson, 2012).

and farmers‚Äô groups. The technology is developed by users, fostering relationship-building in the community through the
process of learning to construct, use and modify the technology. Almost 590,000 water cisterns have been built since

Development agencies and mainstream science

of technological change and social development
originating in grass-roots innovation movements (Ely
et al., 2013; Fressoli et al., 2014). Policies to support
grass-roots innovation include funding programmes
for the acquisition of tools and for experimentation with
new technologies and capabilities. Policies may also
be aimed at building bridges between heterogeneous
informal grass-roots innovation initiatives and existing
research and development capabilities; and building
infrastructure such as repositories and innovation
platforms to foster the distribution, replication and
improvement of innovations and ideas from the
grass roots. Initiatives can also support international
networks to foster local grass-roots movements and
increase their visibility and legitimacy.
However, grass-roots innovation often thrives due to
its independence from bureaucratic procedures and
formal institutions. In supporting such innovation, it
is therefore important for mainstream institutions to
avoid imposing their own objectives.
6RFLDO LQQRYDWLRQ focuses on the creation and
diffusion of novel social practices and institutions,

as opposed to technologies (box 4.3). It generally
refers to innovations in social relationships,
practices and structures that are primarily aimed at
addressing social needs and improving human wellbeing (van der Have and Rubalcaba, 2016). Most
social innovations are bottom-up, initiated by the
entrepreneurial activities of civil society actors such
as cooperatives, associations and foundations. The
main driver is an ecosystem of networks and groups
of individuals bound together by a shared vision of

limits the potential for scaling up and the role of
policies, appropriate interventions may include grants
and managerial and technical support to community

In order to support the implementation of the
Sustainable
Development
Goals,
innovative
approaches such as those discussed in this section
must be considered in combination with innovation
driven by the private sector in a more traditional
sense. This is particularly relevant for Goals 8 and 9.
Evidence about the potential results of such a synergic
relationship between both modes of innovation
is discussed in Fu et al. (2014) and Fu (2018). The
following sections explore some policy approaches
that may prove useful in this regard.

platforms (such as Crowdfunder, Indiegogo and Kickstarter), though currently concentrated in the developed world, could
become an important tool for fundraising in developing countries. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, for example, websites
such as https://hamsaa.ir/ and http://ichallenge.ir/ (both accessed 25 March 2018) are platforms for crowdsourcing
solutions to both public and private needs. Peer-to-peer lending platforms such as Kiva allow people to lend money online
to low-income entrepreneurs and students in developing countries.
Several countries have implemented policies to support social innovations, to identify and foster innovations that appear
promising, especially in traditional areas of welfare and public policy, and to transfer, replicate and scale-up successful
models. In the United States, for example, the Social Innovation Fund provides grants and managerial and technical
support to community initiatives. The European Commission aims to encourage market uptake of social innovations

CHAPTER IV. FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES, EMERGING APPROACHES AND OPPORTUNITIES

C. SMART SPECIALIZATION:
INNOVATION AS
A STRATEGY FOR
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
This section explores the potential usefulness
for developing countries of smart specialization
strategies (S3). While the S3 approach, based on a
seminal policy paper (Foray et al., 2009), is closely
related to traditional vertical industrial policies, it
differs in making the experimental nature of such
policies explicit, systematizing and responding to
the information generated by positive and negative
results, which is itself viewed as an important product
of the strategy. S3 strategies are considered here
because of their primary focus on innovation and
technology for driving industrial policy measures,
whereas other approaches to industrial policy (for
example, those associated closely with Justin Lin
or Hidalgo and Haussmann) place less emphasis on
these policy aspects.66
The S3 approach is itself a large-scale experiment in
innovation policy, conducted within the framework
of the European regional cohesion programme
since 2011, and integrated into the European
Union‚Äôs reformed cohesion policy for 2014‚Äì2020.
European Union member States and regions67
have developed more than 120 S3s establishing
priorities for research and innovation investments
for 2014‚Äì2020, supported by more than ‚Ç¨ 65
billion in funding from the European Regional
Development Fund and national co-financing, with
advice on design and implementation available on
an online S3 platform68 (European Commission,
2017). Although initiated in advanced Western
European economies, the S3 approach has also
attracted much attention elsewhere, notably in
Argentina, Australia, Brazil, the Russian Federation,
Serbia, Tunisia and Ukraine.
66

See for example, UNCTAD (2014c, 2006), Lin (2012), Lin
and Treichel (2012), Hidalgo and Haussmann (2009) and
Cimoli et al. (2009).

While its primary focus is on regions, the S3 approach is

Smaller countries such as Slovenia and Estonia have
adopted national S3s, while city, subregional and
interregional S3s are also considered. The primary
consideration is consistency between the administrative
level of the S3 and the type of structural changes sought.

over time, aimed at transforming a region‚Äôs economic
structure. Transformative activities are collections of
innovation capacities and actions oriented towards
a particular structural change, which are developed
from one or more existing structures, supported by
extraregional capacities. Rather than encompassing
an entire sector, they may be limited to a subgroup of
companies, suppliers and research partners that are
prepared to embark on collective action to transform
their capacities.
Transformative activities seek to focus R&D projects,

foundation (Foray, 2015). Innovation is thus not
focused only on high tech and formal R&D, but widely
distributed across the whole spectrum of sectors and
invention processes. A transformative activity aimed
at the foundation of a new industry might be oriented
towards high tech start-ups and the formation and
attraction of specialized human capital. In many regions,
however, the primary consideration is not invention
at the technological frontier, but rather generating
the innovation complementarities in existing sectors
that ultimately represent the key to economy-wide
regional growth. Thus, depending on its objective, the
components of a transformative activity may include
training programmes, the formation of new managerial

processes, as well as technology adoption.

S3 as a vertical policy approach

S3 is a departure from the neutral or horizontal
policies, aimed at improving general conditions and

European political landscape in recent decades.69
It also goes beyond the regional innovation system
approach, focused on building regional institutional
frameworks for innovation, by abandoning the
principle of neutrality between sectors in favour of a
much higher degree of intentionality, centralization,
prioritization and commitment to new specialization.
This implies a different policy design.
The idea that regions should seek to discover and
choose, in detail, priority areas for R&D and innovation
long predates the era of smart specialization (Enos,
  ,W UH∆ÖHFWV ERWK GHIHQVLYH DQG SURDFWLYH
motivations: that priorities will be established by global

and that the knowledge and experience acquired from

the subsequent stages of product/process/market
design, production and distribution. Thus, the

which lies at the heart of S3.
It should be emphasized, however, that the logic of
smart specialization does not reduce the importance
of the fundamentals of STI policy discussed in
chapter III. Rather, it provides an additional option,
complementary to horizontal policies, for regions that
have the capacity to identify priorities and to develop
transformative activities effectively.

strategic priorities. This raises the issue of how to
minimize policy capture and avoid monopolization of
resources by a small number of actors. Two principles
emerge as important in this regard.
First, the selection of priorities should be carried
out, not at the level of the sector or of the individual
enterprise, but at the intermediate level of the
transformative activity ‚Äì not the footwear industry itself
or an individual footwear producer, for example, but

Vertical (also called ‚Äúselective‚Äù or ‚Äútargeted‚Äù) industrial
policies have been, and remain, widely used across
most developing and developed countries. They played
an important role, for example, in the industrialization
of the East Asian ‚Äútiger‚Äù economies (UNCTAD, 2014c;

important.
First, the interaction between human capital and R&D
needs to be taken into account in policy sequencing
‚Äì otherwise, inelastic short-term supply of specialized
human capital may result in higher R&D expenditure
LQ∆ÖDWLQJ WKH ZDJHV RI 5 ' SHUVRQQHO UDWKHU WKDQ
increasing innovation (Romer, ). Consequently, the
formation of specialized human capital and capabilities
needs to precede, or occur in parallel with, policies
that increase demand for R&D. In the Basque Country
of Spain, for example, the transformative activity
addressing modernization of the engineering and
mechanical industry includes new university training
programmes in parallel with conventional R&D support
(Navarro et al., 2011).
Second, transformative activities need to encompass
actions to facilitate the adoption of new technologies
and strengthen absorptive capacity, as well as their
development2WKHUZLVHWKHDFWLYLW\ZLOOUHPDLQOLPLWHG
to start-ups and fail to realize its transformative nature,
and may further widen the gap between dynamic and
non-dynamic sectors of the economy.
Third, it is important to avoid an excessive number of
poorly coordinated policy instruments, which is likely to
prove ineffectual and costly. The Tinbergen assignment

CHAPTER IV. FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES, EMERGING APPROACHES AND OPPORTUNITIES

of instruments needed to achieve a target. In general,
the number of instruments should correspond with the
number of externalities or market failures (Jaffe et al.,
2004). In the agri-food sector, for example, instruments
are needed to address knowledge externalities and
capital market imperfections that impede research and
start-ups; adoption, network and training externalities
in the traditional sector; and coordination failures at
the interface between the high-tech and traditional
VHFWRUV 7KLV VXJJHVWV DURXQG ∆ÑYH LQVWUXPHQWV 7KH
selection of the appropriate instruments ultimately falls
to the Government, which is thus ‚Äúdoomed to choose‚Äù
(Hausmann and Rodrik, 2006).

S3 as experimental policy

6SROLFLHVDUHE\QDWXUHH[SHULPHQWDOE\GH∆ÑQLWLRQ
some transformative activities will be successful, while
others will not be. This is inherent in the nature of
vertical industrial policies more generally, which are
not about ‚Äúpicking winners‚Äù but ‚Äúpicking possibles‚Äù
(UNCTAD, 2014d) ‚Äì identifying support activities
with the potential to succeed and to contribute
positively to economic transformation. This essentially
experimental nature means that vertical policies give
rise to much greater risks than horizontal policies, such
as economy-wide R&D tax credits, whose likely effects
can be anticipated on the basis of past experiments
and evaluations. This has important implications for
policy design.
First, HQWUHSUHQHXULDO GLVFRYHU\ (Kirzner, 1997)
plays a central role. This entails learning about the
development possibilities and structural effects
offered by each transformative activity as it unfolds,
through the successes, failures and unanticipated
effects of its elements. It operates at two levels: the
success or failure of individual projects, and overall
progress towards the targeted structural change. The
resulting learning about opportunities, constraints
and challenges should inform the development of
transformative activities. Integrating entrepreneurial
discovery in industrial policy design, as proposed by
Haussmann and Rodrik (2002), helps to reconcile the
logic of strategic choice and prioritization with that
of decentralized and entrepreneurial information and
initiatives, and to avoid centralized planning.
Second, ∆ÖH[LELOLW\ LV HVVHQWLDO 2QFH LGHQWL∆ÑHG
transformative activities and their components are not
unalterable, but should be adapted ‚Äì or if necessary
discontinued ‚Äì in the light of entrepreneurial discovery,

to-the-minute barometer of the activity to provide
immediate feedback as a basis for policy adjustment
(Feldman et al., 2014).
A third key principle is the PD[LPL]DWLRQ RI
LQIRUPDWLRQDO VSLOORYHUV created by the discovery
process. The social value of the entrepreneurial
discovery process lies in informing the whole system
about new opportunities, successes and failures in
R&D and innovation to generate desirable structural
changes. This is what distinguishes entrepreneurial
discoveries supported by public policy from those
PDGH E\ LQGLYLGXDO ∆ÑUPV 7KLV PHDQV UHTXLULQJ
companies supported in joining the entrepreneurial
discovery process to conform to appropriate
information rules, and ensuring that rewards for
entrepreneurial discovery are structured to maximize
spillovers to other participants and potential entrants
in the transformative activity (Rodrik, 2004).
(QWUHSUHQHXULDOGLVFRYHU\WKXVPHDQVSURYLGLQJ∆ÑUPV
with incentives to explore new opportunities within
the framework of a transformative activity, without
dictating the content or direction of their projects;
continuously evaluating progress, blockages and
surprises; ensuring the diffusion of information to
the industrial base concerned; and responding
appropriately with decisions on the continuation or
interruption of projects. These principles are being put
in place in some regions, notably the Basque Country
(Morgan, 2016).
The S3 approach is thus neither purely bottom-up
(in that priorities are ultimately chosen by the
government) nor purely top-down (by virtue of design
principles such as the entrepreneurial discovery
process and public‚Äìprivate interactions). Rather,
it is an intermediate process aimed at enhancing
entrepreneurial coordination, within a framework
structured by the government.

6.

Experience with S3 to date

It is too early to evaluate the impact of S3 on innovation,
productivity and growth, and systematic evaluations
cannot be expected for some years. However,
numerous case studies indicate some success in
enabling regions both to build capacities and to

91

HARNESSING FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

transform their economic structures (e.g. European
Commission, 2017; Agencia de Inova√ßao, 2015;
Karo et al., 2017). The basic problem of combining
centralized determination of targets and objectives
with decentralized information and entrepreneurial
processes appears to have been resolved reasonably
well in many cases, while the strategy design process
and commitment to entrepreneurial discovery
have helped to increase knowledge through selfassessment and the discovery of potential and
capacities (Kroll, 2016).
S3 has also contributed to two important shifts in
attitude. First, it has helped to instil in policymakers a
new policy mind-set of decentralization, public‚Äìprivate
interactions, self-discovery and prioritization. Second,
it has widened recognition that challenges to and

economic and social structures. By helping regions
to recognize their differences and translate them into
future competitive advantages, and providing tools
and processes to handle such heterogeneity, the S3
approach has the potential to yield better results than
the undifferentiated policy practices of the past.

D. PLATFORMS FOR
ECONOMIC DISCOVERY
1.

Technology, innovation and economic
discovery

The S3 approach, summarized in table 4.1, represents
a potentially important shift in policy thinking, and its
initial results appear promising. However, the process
is much more demanding in terms of policymaking
capability and monitoring competences than
horizontal policies focusing on overall capabilities
(Rodriguez Pose, et al., 2014; Karo et al., 2017;
Morgan, 2016), and will not succeed without the
necessary capabilities and commitment. This may
be problematic for developing countries with limited
organizational and implementation capacities. Within
FRXQWULHV WRR VXI∆ÑFLHQW VFDOH DQG DJJORPHUDWLRQ RI
actors are essential determinants of the productivity
of innovation activities, making a critical mass of
innovation actors important, and thus advantaging
larger systems such as urban centres.

An important challenge for cooperation policy in STI
is that innovations are much less readily transferrable
than technologies (UNCTAD, 2014a). An innovation is
not merely a new idea, but a new idea that is both
adopted and materialized in some kind of process,
product or service. Crucially, this involves a process
of economic discovery through experimentation in the
economy, which can only occur in the socioeconomic
context where the technology is to be used (Foray and
Phelps, 2011; Phelps, 2017). ‚ÄúThe economy‚Äù, in this
context, is not limited to the business sphere, but also
encompasses the social sector (social innovation) and
the household level (common innovation).

International cooperation and collaboration are
therefore critical to the wider success of the S3
approach. International development institutions
should seek to ensure diffusion of the knowledge
generated by European experiences, while managing
and leading efforts to promote transferability of
the concept to developing countries, keeping in
mind that policy experiences in innovation can

innovation. The former produces knowledge about
what does and does not work technically; the latter
produces knowledge about what works economically,
at what prices, and with what business models.
:KLOH LW UHTXLUHV VFLHQWL∆ÑF DQGRU WHFKQRORJLFDO
inputs, innovation is thus fundamentally an economic
concept. It entails translating these inputs into
products, processes and services, and discovering
whether the market (and the society) is likely to adopt
it, at what price, and through what kind of business
model. Since such economic knowledge can only be
produced where the innovation is to be adopted, it is
also indigenous. Innovations only become global (i.e.
new products or services are adopted globally) once
their economic value has been proven across many
economies.
Thus, technological revolutions, such as the current
digital transition, are not merely bundles of new
science and technologies, but above all explosions
of economic knowledge ‚Äì of start-up companies
producing new knowledge about what does and does
not work economically. But this discovery comes at
a cost. While some companies may revolutionize
industries by applying newly developed technologies
and business models, most will fail.
Clearly, this process ‚Äì of translating technological
knowledge into economic knowledge ‚Äì is not linear,
but characterized by important feedback effects.
Economic discovery often gives rise to a need for
further technical improvements in products and
processes; and many companies have their own R&D
capacities and/or relationships with research partners.
However, the economic laboratory is dominated by
H[SHUWVRQEXVLQHVVDQDO\VLV∆ÑQDQFHPDUNHWLQJHWF
while scientists and engineers play a supporting role.
This perspective has major implications for innovation
and cooperation policy. The concept of innovation

between the two ‚Äúlaboratories‚Äù. Consequently,
conventional indicators tend to measure science and
technology rather than innovation in an economic
sense, providing little information about the core of
innovation capacities. This skews innovation and
cooperation policy towards science and technology
rather than innovation itself, neglecting the major
challenge of supporting innovative entrepreneurs

Platforms for economic discovery as
a tool for innovation and cooperation
policy

The objectives of STI policy and international
cooperation are straightforward and well understood,
relating to science and technology resources, human
capital formation, public research organizations and
universities, etc. The objectives of innovation policy
and international cooperation to build innovation
capacities, however, are more complex. The framework
presented above highlights the importance of policies
to support economic discovery and experimentation,
including, for example, new business models, user
experiences, marketing, iterations and the relationship
between R&D and product experimentation. A key

to economic discovery and innovation, in light of the
information externalities and coordination failures that
characterize them (Rodrik, 2004; Sabel, 2012).
To address this need, this report proposes an
international cooperation effort focused on the
establishment (as proposed in UNCTAD, 2014a) of
local and regional platforms for economic discovery
(PEDs) to rectify market and coordination failures.
PEDs would operate by providing the capacities,
capabilities and services lacking in developing
countries to support local entrepreneurs in the
economic discovery process. This might include, for
example, supporting access to test markets, tailored

activities. Such thematic platforms might include, for
example:
(a) Clean solutions in wood energy production and
logistical solutions to wood harvesting in a context
of resource scarcity (e.g. in regions with a large or
emerging forest industry);

93

(b) Decentralized renewable energy production (e.g.
in regions with large rural areas and dispersed
populations);
(c) Smart nano- and micro-technological solutions
(e.g. in regions with an existing or emerging
mechanical engineering sector); or
(d) Interactive communications for education and
social media (to help young entrepreneurs in large
urban systems).
In contrast with R&D subsidies, there would be no need
to monitor and control access. Since the capabilities

REMHFWLYHV

A PED operates in part as a coordination mechanism
between the various capacities and resources present
in the local innovation system (chapter III), to counter its
OLPLWDWLRQVDQGGH∆ÑFLHQFLHVLQSURYLGLQJWKHFDSDELOLWLHV
and resources needed to materialize and test new
ideas. As well as assisting companies undertaking
economic discovery processes directly, it also
supports other actors that provide such assistance,
including local R&D organizations (in universities and
public research organizations), banks, specialized
consulting companies and public agencies dealing
with issues such as IPRs and trade.
PEDs can thus address two types of objectives. As
well as supporting potential innovators through the
provision of a range of services and resources, they
can strengthen local innovation systems by promoting

directly or identifying and mobilizing elements of the
innovation system to do so where appropriate.
While some of the services involved in the economic
discovery process can be provided remotely, PEDs
should be located inside the country concerned, to
generate opportunities for observation, interaction and
mutual learning. This is essential to the development
of a local innovation system capable of providing the
resources that local innovators need for economic
discovery (Feldman and Kogler, 2010).

Platforms for economic discovery
as an opportunity for international
cooperation

Support to STI policies and strengthening of
innovation capabilities tend not to be high priorities
for bilateral and multilateral development cooperation
actors. However, such support is essential to the
rapid productivity improvement and structural
economic change needed to achieve the Sustainable
Development Goals.
PEDs could be a very effective tool to support local
innovation and economic experimentation, to build
local capacities, and to generate economic knowledge
by promoting the materialization, improvement and
adoption of innovative ideas where local innovation
systems cannot provide all the capacities and

An obstacle to developing private sector venture
capital is the absence of active stock exchanges
that allow funds for future investment to be released
by liquidating existing investments through initial
public offerings (Black and Gilson, 1998). However,
this problem can be eased through access to initial
public offerings on foreign stock markets or regional
exchanges, or by establishing secondary exchanges
(or junior markets) for SME listings, which can also

Green bonds, pioneered by the European Investment
Bank in 2007 followed by the World Bank in 2008,
raise funds for projects to address climate change
and other environmental issues in sectors such
as renewable energy, low-carbon transport and
water. Such bonds have been issued by several
multilateral development banks, including the African
Development Bank‚Äôs Green Bond Programme, and
the Asian Development Bank‚Äôs Clean Energy Bonds.
Interest in green bonds is growing rapidly, particularly
in developing countries such as India and China, while
Mexico and Brazil issued green bonds in December
2016 (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2017).

INCUBATORS,
ACCELERATORS AND
TECHNOLOGY PARKS

Incubators, accelerators and technology parks can
play a useful role, complementary to PEDs, and have
been introduced by many developed and developing
countries as a means of promoting economic growth
and job creation. By bringing small technology
businesses into one location, close to universities
and research institutions, this is intended to promote
exchanges of ideas, knowledge and learning, while

facilitating access to skills, business services, mentors
and value chains.
However, the results of such approaches have often
been disappointing, and some applications have
been abject failures. In many cases, absorption
of the resulting innovation has been limited, the
start-ups generated have been disconnected from
local economies, and relatively few have become
sustainable businesses. It has been argued that the
impacts of such schemes have been exaggerated,
JLYLQJULVHWRXQUHDOLVWLFH[SHFWDWLRQVDQGqDQRYHU∆ÖRZ
of attention and resources that cannot translate into
‚Äòmagic‚Äô solutions to unemployment and other global
challenges‚Äù (Mulas, 2016).
These disappointing results underline the importance
of an enabling environment as the core of an effective
innovation system, as discussed in chapter III. UNCTAD

depends both on ‚Äúunderstanding and actively fostering
the dynamics that can create sustainable and competitive
start-ups over time‚Äù (Mulas, 2016), and on facilitating
links between companies inside the incubators and
dynamic companies outside them, without which they
remain enclaves with limited economic impact.

in Porto Alegre attracted Microsoft, Dell, HP and ThoughtWorks, while the nearby ‚ÄúTecnosinos‚Äù attracted SAP and HT
Micron. The relationship with the university, good transport links and a favourable environment for the workforce appear to
have been factors of attraction. The multinationals in the technology park are reported to have created an attractive address
at which local companies want to be co-located. The university and the attractive city and region motivated the presence
of international companies, which in turn attracted major local companies, initiating the development of an innovation
ecosystem pipeline to generate start-ups. A key factor is the dynamism of the university, which provides a talent pool for a
start-up culture and a basis for research relationships between businesses in the tech parks and the university.
A mix of major MNEs, local companies and small start-ups is needed for tech parks to thrive, and the two technology parks

The involvement of multiple sectors complicates
policy planning. While governments generally set
policy and establish goals, policymakers have

researchers. Research funded and/or conducted
primarily by business, whether local or international,
can be especially challenging in this regard. A further
complication is that most research is effectively invisible
to national agencies until its results are published.

The increasing globalization of research adds yet
a further dimension of complexity. International
connections among researchers affect the direction of
research and the distribution of tasks in ways that may
not be apparent to policymakers. It also makes the

centres of knowledge. The governance of national
resources within a global system is complicated by the
increasing mobility of researchers and by reliance on
data, samples and cases collected from around the
world and on equipment in distant places.
Global networks are inherently challenging to govern or
direct towards any set of goals; but understanding and
learning to use them to shift the agenda can have positive
outcomes for the Sustainable Development Goals.
The new context requires different policy approaches
from those used to promote and manage R&D in
the twentieth century, which treated science and
technology primarily as national assets. Four features
of policy are particularly relevant:
(a) Viewing knowledge as an abundant rather than a
scarce resource, sharing fully in collaborative R&D
and disseminating knowledge openly;
(b) Enhancing local and regional capacities to absorb
knowledge, focusing on building scalable teams
on key topics with local relevance;
(c) Storing information for sharing, access and
comment; and
(d) Ensuring adequate credit to those contributing
knowledge to shared resources.
Governments need to move beyond simply funding

to foster participation in global collaborations, to
guide them towards research of value to sustainable
development, and to maximize its development impact.
This requires an understanding of how such networks
are formed and organized, the norms and dynamics
that drive them, the motivations of those involved, and
the internal control mechanisms of sharing and rewards

Unlike organizations with a strict hierarchy of authority, where behaviour is directed and performance is rewarded,
networks operate by rules that reward reciprocity. Members of a common network exchange resources as the ‚Äúcost‚Äù

reputation gained by good citizenship. New members are included to the extent that they offer ‚Äúgoods‚Äù, and will be
excluded if they are seen as ‚Äúhoarding‚Äù goods.
Most network connections in science begin face-to-face at conferences or meetings. Being ‚Äúprepared to network‚Äù
means giving forethought to the ‚Äúgoods‚Äù that one has to offer to potential partners. Such goods include interesting
data, important research questions, time to work on a project, depth of knowledge in a subject, student collaborators,
access to unique resources, and funding. Networks can form as readily between more experienced and inexperienced
participants as between social equals, in part because unequal pairings may be highly complementary. Pairing between

providing examples of data-sharing protocols, and
crafting memoranda of understanding to facilitate inkind contributions and cross-border movements of
equipment, samples, etc. Bundling such elements
into project proposals can enhance the attractiveness
of collaborative activities.
The implications of global collaboration in research
transcend national boundaries. The international
community has adopted global goals; global research
has an essential role in their achievement; and the global
knowledge commons are fundamental to this research.
Realizing this potential requires national policies to be
complemented by global governance the process
RI VHHNLQJ WR PDQDJH RU LQ∆ÖXHQFH UHODWLRQVKLSV WKDW
transcend national frontiers, performing a role analogous
to that of governments at the national level, but without
sovereign authority. The United Nations Commission
on Science and Technology for Development has been
encouraged by the Economic and Social Council to act
as a forum for strategic planning and foresight about
critical trends in STI, and to strengthen and revitalize
global STI partnerships for sustainable development.76
It thus provides a global platform for coordination to
support more focused efforts on research collaboration.
This is particularly important considering the gaps in
UHVHDUFK FDSDELOLWLHV LGHQWL∆ÑHG LQ FKDSWHU ,, DQG WKHLU
implications for the ability of many countries to undertake
technological horizon scanning, foresight and risk

See Economic and Social Council resolution 2017/22.

However, there is no single organization with a
mandate for global governance of science, and
national governments remain the primary locus of STI
policy and investment. The recommendations in this
section should therefore be interpreted as applying to
intergovernmental organizations at the global level as
much as to national governments.
Aligning guidelines for national governments through
international organizations, possibly focusing on

support to capacity-building in developing countries,
especially LDCs, through international organizations,
multilateral and bilateral agencies and South‚ÄìSouth
cooperation, to increase their ability both to participate
in Sustainable Development Goals-oriented research
and to absorb and apply the knowledge it generates
effectively. International organizations could also help
to build on existing open access databases and other
online resources, both as an input to Sustainable
Development Goals-related research and as an outlet
for its results, particularly by taking a leadership role in
the establishment of quality measures and monitoring.

Fostering participation in global
research collaboration towards the
Sustainable Development Goals

Funding is a key method of guiding the direction
of research. Targeting research funding towards
Sustainable Development Goals-related projects can

in notices soliciting bids for funding of statements
about support for such collaborations. Requiring
involvement of researchers from relevant developing
countries in Sustainable Development Goals-related
research collaborations could help to ensure that
research addresses the problems such countries face,
DQGIXOO\UH∆ÖHFWVORFDOFRQWH[WVDVZHOODVKHOSLQJWR
build capacity. Use could also be made of surveys,
textual analysis and/or network analysis tools to
locate connections offering opportunities for fruitful
collaboration.
Connections among people are central to global
research collaborations, but such connections are
formed through an amorphous process of selforganization, which is not conducive to policy
intervention. Most collaborations begin through peerto-peer relationships established by personal contact
and networking ‚Äì for example, at conferences and
through research websites; institution‚Äìto‚Äìinstitution
or intergovernmental agreements have at most an
indirect role in this regard.
Convening international events related to particular
aspects of the Sustainable Development Goals,
bringing together leading global and local scientists,
thus helps to foster interpersonal contact among
researchers with relevant interests. Support for
travel and convening can also play an important role.
Augmenting research grants with supplementary
funding for travel and communications targeted
to collaborative projects including partners from
developing countries, a policy operated by the
United States National Science Foundation and by
the European Commission for more than 30 years,
can thus make a major contribution to fostering
global collaboration. Training abroad can also help
to strengthen international linkages more broadly ‚Äì
particularly where those concerned return to their
countries of origin, also increasing domestic capacity.

underlying dynamic pushing researchers towards
global collaboration appears to be enhanced
opportunities for recognition and reward. Cooperation

by accolades such as prizes and awards ‚Äì especially

lectures and named chairs. The opportunity to
participate in leading-edge research, particularly where
a breakthrough is anticipated, is a particular driver,

106 |

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2018

as are opportunities to collaborate with prominent
researchers.
Some of the science to address the Sustainable
Development Goals is already available, or research
is underway (Lubchenco, 2015). The relevance of
research can be enhanced by mapping existing
VFLHQWL∆ÑFNQRZOHGJHDQGFXUUHQWUHVHDUFKDJDLQVWORFDO
needs, to target research and avoid redundancy. This
involves connections with citizens as well as scientists,
e.g. through social media such as Zooniverse, to
EXLOG OLQNV EHWZHHQ H[LVWLQJ VFLHQWL∆ÑF ZRUN DQG
future needs. Scanning globally for technology and
ideas, bringing together local engineers and business
people, assistance to regional planning and building
communications options to gather ideas can also
make an important contribution.
Establishing national platforms for collaborators
on issues related to the Sustainable Development
Goals might also provide a means of nudging
networks towards relevant research, particularly if
such platforms provide enhanced functionality for
researchers, facilitate networking with others working
on related projects, and are linked to open access
online publications. Identifying particular local and
regional problems and framing them in such a way as
to attract international research attention may help to
foster locally relevant collaborations.

5.

Maximizing development impact

If global research collaboration is to contribute
effectively to development, the knowledge generated
must be integrated at the local level. This requires the
GHYHORSPHQWRIVXI∆ÑFLHQWDEVRUSWLYHFDSDFLW\WRUHWDLQ
knowledge locally and apply it to local and regional
problems. It is therefore important to ensure that the

the ‚Äúlocal loop‚Äù of research diffusion by distracting
efforts from teaching and cooperation.
Local planning is also needed to ensure that the
necessary capacity is available. This requires
assessing local resources and using gap analysis to
identify opportunities and determine where additional
investment is needed, by:
(a) Assessing technical know-how and human
resources, by examining colleges and technical
schools that are training engineers, the workforce

(b) Appraising institutions by subject area (e.g.
medical, environmental and material);
(c) Identifying and strengthening methods of formal
and informal communication; and
(d) Making local and informal knowledge available
through communications channels.
International support to capacity-building plays a
key role. Researchers and funders should commit to
EXLOGLQJ VFLHQWL∆ÑF FDSDFLW\ LQ GHYHORSLQJ FRXQWULHV
to help improve their ability to conduct, access,
verify and use the best science, and to ensure that
WKH\ FDQ FRQWULEXWH WR JOREDO VFLHQWL∆ÑF GHEDWHV
and develop locally appropriate solutions to global
problems.

H. CONCLUSIONS
Recent decades have seen a combination of
accelerating technological change with ever greater
potential and more far-reaching implications, and
progressively more comprehensive and ambitious
JOREDO JRDOV 7KHVH FKDQJHV KDYH EHHQ UH∆ÖHFWHG LQ
several new concepts and approaches of relevance to
harnessing STI for sustainable development.
The extraordinary ambition of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development means that full use will need
to be made of all the available tools if the Sustainable
Development Goals are to be achieved. Given the
central role of innovation in the structural economic
transformation that is indispensable for sustainable
development, STI must be an essential part of this
process.
Fundamental as it is, structural transformation cannot
be the only goal of STI policy for development in the
pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals. New
approaches to innovation, such as those described
in this report, which are in no small part enabled by
digital technologies, should support an aspiration in
STI policymakers to orient the direction of change and
innovation towards more inclusive and sustainable

outcomes. Most crucially, a concerted effort is needed
to build technological capabilities and to support
all forms of innovation ‚Äì technological and nontechnological, entrepreneurial, social, institutional ‚Äì in
developing countries. This is an effort that includes
the mobilization of stakeholders at the national
level, but that also requires the full realization at the
international level of the scale of the changes that
frontier technologies will introduce in human activity.
The unprecedented divides that could result create
an ethical imperative to ensure that no one is left
outside this emerging new world. The least developed
countries, in particular, should receive international
support to build the capabilities and create the enabling
environment for frontier technologies necessary to
deliver on their promise.
The Technology Facilitation Mechanism established
in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
could act as an open platform for stakeholders to
create awareness, connect innovators with those
confronted with development challenges that STI
can solve, promote policy learning and mobilize
the resources of the United Nations system. The
Technology Bank for the Least Developed Countries,
ZKLFK DGRSWHG LWV ∆ÑUVW RSHUDWLRQDO SODQV DW WKH HQG
of 2017, provides an instrument to channel much
needed resources to support LDCs‚Äô access to
knowledge and technologies.
UNCTAD and the UN Commission for Science
and Technology for Development, in addition to
supporting these processes and contributing to
relevant capacity building, have an international policy
role to play improving the understanding of the deep
and multidimensional implications of technology,
and contributing to international dialogues dealing
with the serious questions that frontier technologies
raise about issues such as ethics, the environment,
HFRQRPLFVWDELOLW\DQGVRFLDOFRKHVLRQ2QO\WKURXJK
such dialogues can useful answers be found to the
challenge of harnessing technology for the achievement
of sustainable and inclusive development.

Successful innovation requires access to technology to be translated, through economic discovery, into innovations
that are commercially successful or solve problems in non-commercial settings. Platforms for economic discovery
can help to achieve this, and could form a basis for international cooperation.
