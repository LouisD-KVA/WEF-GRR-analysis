Foreword
Policies which spur economic growth are imperative
for governments the world over. Sustained growth
improves living standards, creates new employment
opportunities and helps alleviate poverty. While not
a panacea, economic growth – if properly channeled
– can contribute to stability, security, health and environmental sustainability.
But can continuous growth be taken for granted? A
growing chorus of experts is asking this question, and
with good reason. The period following the Second
World War has seen the fastest global growth on record.
Yet since the global financial crisis of 2008, economic
growth has disappointed year after year. Can we safely
assume that faster growth will eventually resume, or
could low growth be the new normal?

A novel element of this year’s report is a series of case
studies that explore the concrete linkages between innovation, IP, and growth in six areas of breakthrough
innovation. Three case studies focus on historical innovations: airplanes, antibiotics and semiconductors. The
other three examine innovations that currently appear to
hold breakthrough potential: 3D printing, nanotechnology and robotics. All six case studies follow a common
approach, looking first at the innovation’s origin and its
contribution to growth; then at the ecosystem which
gave rise to the innovation; and finally at the role the
IP system plays within that ecosystem.

The report also considers the prospects for future
innovation-driven growth. Without claiming to foresee
the future, it reviews the various arguments that suggest
either a more optimistic or a more pessimistic outlook.

Executive Summary
Economic growth has been a powerful force for reducing poverty, creating jobs and improving general living
standards. However, it cannot be taken for granted.
Before the 18th century the world economy saw little
growth. Poverty was widespread and any substantial
improvement in living standards for more than the
privileged few was beyond imagining. Since then, the
world economy has grown at an unprecedented pace
– greatly improving the quality of life and generating
widespread material prosperity. Even so, some national economies have seen faster and more sustained
growth than others, leaving wide disparities in the
prosperity of nations today.
One central insight from scholarly research is that lasting economic growth relies on continuous technological
progress. Indeed, the last three centuries have seen a
series of innovative breakthroughs in different fields of
technology that have profoundly transformed productive activity and spurred the growth of new industries.
How did these breakthrough innovations come about
and how did they increase economic output? Answers
to these questions are important, as policymakers
continuously strive to improve the enabling environment
for future growth. Indeed, as the world economy still
reels some seven years on from the global financial
crisis, there is serious debate as to whether innovation
can continue to deliver rates of growth matching those
before the crisis.

In addition to reviewing historical patterns of growth
and conceptualizing the linkages between innovation
and growth, the report’s main analytical contribution
consists of six case studies of breakthrough innovations. In particular, it focuses on three historical
innovations and three innovations which currently
hold breakthrough potential (see table 1). Through
case studies, one can take account of the different
nature of innovative breakthroughs and the evolving
context in which innovation takes place. In addition,
even though many conclusions are specific to the six
cases and may not be generalizable, the commonalities and differences presented by the cases offer food
for thought on which policy approaches work best in
alternative circumstances.

Outside the group of frontier economies, growth performance has been mixed. While selected once-poor
economies – notably in East Asia – were able to catch
up with the frontier group, no general process of converging per capita incomes has taken place. As a result,
the inequality in the prosperity of nations has widened
since the 19th century.

equalizing force in the world’s income distribution
and has caused absolute poverty to decline

See figure 1.1

The figure’s lower panel divides the seven centuries
into three growth periods. The first period, up to the
early 19th century, saw only little and sporadic growth,
averaging around 0.2 percent per year. The onset of
the industrial revolution then led to a sharp increase
in the annual rate of growth, to 1.1 percent. Finally, in
the post-Second World War era, growth accelerated
further to 2.1 percent per year – implying a doubling of
income every 34 years. In light of centuries of history,
the growth performance since 1950 thus emerges as
both spectacular and exceptional.

Widening income inequality across economies does
not necessarily imply that the world has become a
more unequal place. The distribution of income among
citizens worldwide – which takes into account the
population size of different countries as well as income
inequality within countries – offers a more optimistic
picture. Studies focused on the last several decades
have shown that the fast growth of populous and initially poor Asian economies, notably China and India,
has been an equalizing force in the world’s income
distribution. In addition, using different poverty thresholds, these studies uniformly document a substantial
reduction in absolute poverty levels.

How innovation drives economic growth
Decades of scholarly research in economics have
established the central role that innovation plays in
driving long term growth. Yet quantifying the innovation
contribution – which innovations have accounted for
how much growth during which time period – is challenging. The infographic at the end of this report depicts
some of the most important innovative breakthroughs
over the past 200 years against the background of
the frontier growth path shown in figure 1. It is meant
as an illustration, and the selection of technologies
is subjective.
Despite the quantification challenge, the channels
through which innovation spurs growth are well understood conceptually.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Innovation prompts capital deepening…

Figure 2: Antibiotics had a profound
effect on human health

Firms invest in new capital equipment based on the
future income they expect those investments to generate. The introduction of new technologies can raise
investment returns and lead firms to undertake new
investments. Historically, the introduction of major
breakthrough technologies has often unleashed investment booms, driving expansions in economic output.
The semiconductor case study, for example, discusses
evidence that shows that as ICTs took off in the 1990s,
firms throughout the US economy rapidly increased
their ICT capital stock, especially when compared
with other fixed capital assets. In addition, intangible
asset investments – the establishment of new business
processes, databases and other knowledge-based
activities – have become an important component of
overall investments and are also linked to the introduction of new technologies.

…supports a growing, healthier and
better-educated labor force…
Innovation has been a key force behind the expansion
of the workforce. Advances in health technology have
prompted a dramatic increase in life expectancy. In
1800, average life expectancy at birth was below 40
years in all developed economies; by 2011 it had risen
above 75 years, with Japan seeing the highest average
of 83 years. Figure 2 – drawn from the antibiotics case
study – illustrates the dramatic reduction in mortality
since the arrival of the first antibiotic medicines in the
1930s.

Innovation has also been instrumental in facilitating
greater adult participation in the workforce. For example, the arrival of speedy mass transportation has
reduced geographical barriers in the labor market. It
has similarly promoted access to education. Advances
in educational technology, in turn, have widened and
deepened educational achievements, leading to a
better-educated labor force.

…raises the productivity of firms…
Innovation can affect the productivity of firms through
a variety of channels. Process and organizational innovations can increase the efficiency with which inputs
– especially labor – are converted into output. The resulting productivity enhancements free up resources that
can be used to expand output – in the same firm, in the
same sector, or elsewhere in the economy.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Product innovation can also have an important effect
on firm productivity, especially if it takes the form of
powerful new or improved intermediate inputs. The
case studies in this report offer numerous examples of
radical new products and services that have changed
the face of productive activity – including air transport,
computers, industrial robots and 3D printers.

…and transforms economic structures
Innovation is often at the root of profound structural
transformation. In the medium to long term, such structural transformation affects an economy’s productivity
through a variety of channels:

The diffusion of innovations matters…
For technological breakthroughs to spur economic
growth, they need to diffuse widely throughout the
economy. Firms need to learn how to use a new technology, undertake capital investments, reorganize business operations and train workers. Indeed, the arrival
of new technologies typically spurs complementary
organizational and business model innovations that,
in themselves, are responsible for major productivity gains. Competitive dynamics, access to finance,
standard-setting and technical regulations, among
other determinants, can shape the technology diffusion
path in important ways.

run, the redeployment of workers in growing sectors
of the economy represents one of the most important ways through which innovation can generate
output growth. In practice, technological progress
has prompted a substantial shift away from agriculture and industry toward the service sector. This has
largely reflected substantially faster historical rates
of productivity growth in agriculture and industry,
compared with labor-intensive services.

For economies to make productive use of technologies
developed abroad, they need to possess sufficient
absorptive capacity – including the human capital able
to understand and apply technology, organizational
and managerial know-how, and institutions that coordinate and mobilize resources for technology adoption.
In many cases, absorptive capacity also entails the
ability to undertake incremental technological and
organizational innovation in order to adapt technology
to local needs.

Ecosystems giving rise to
breakthrough innovation

• Linkages between the various innovation actors
mattered. They ranged from informal knowledge
exchanges, professional networks and worker
movements to formal university–industry licensing
frameworks and R&D collaborations. They promoted the sharing of knowledge among researchers and connected the upstream and downstream
activities that helped transform promising ideas into
commercial technologies.

world that are associated with each of the six breakthrough innovations. While not offering a perfect mirror of the innovation landscape, the resulting patent

…although China has emerged as an important
origin of patenting activity in more recent history
If one looks at more recent history, China emerges as
an important origin of patents in 3D printing, nanotechnology and robotics. In particular, looking at first patent
applications filed since 2005, Chinese applicants account for more than a quarter of first filings worldwide
in the case of 3D printing and robotics – the highest
share among all countries. In the case of nanotechnol-

ogy patent filings since 2005, Chinese applicants make
up close to 15 percent of fillings worldwide – the third
largest origin of patents.

Innovation today appears to be more closely
connected to science than in the past…
Another notable finding from the patent mapping is
that the science system and formal linkages between
scientific institutions and companies appear to be

more important today than in the past. Figure 6 depicts
the share of applicants from universities and public
research organizations (PROs) for the six innovations
studied in the report. It shows higher shares of academic patents for 3D printing, nanotechnology and
robotics, compared with the three historical cases.
Nanotechnology stands out, with academic applicants
accounting for around a quarter of patenting worldwide. Interestingly, the academic patenting share has
increased in most countries since nanotechnology took
off in the 1980s, suggesting that the scientific base of
nanotechnology innovation has become even more
important in more recent history.

of their innovative activities. In some cases – especially semiconductors – they did so extensively. Their
motivations for doing so varied, but available evidence
suggests that IP protection contributed at least partially
to R&D appropriation – thus indicating that IP rights
mattered for innovation incentives.

…and enables technology markets
The greater prominence of universities and PROs in
patent landscapes may partly reflect policy efforts
to better harness the results of scientific research for
commercial development. However, those policy efforts arguably recognize the critical role that upstream
research plays in downstream technological progress.

…while the share of academic patents
differs markedly across countries
While academic patenting has become more prominent
across most of the major patenting origins, there are
also notable differences. In the case of Japan, universities and PROs never account for more than 10 percent
of total first filings. By contrast, China generally shows
the highest shares of academic patenting, exceeding 70
percent for nanotechnology and 50 percent for robotics.
On the one hand, this may suggest more limited R&D
capacity in Chinese firms in the relevant technology
fields, which may imply a lower rate of technology
commercialization. On the other hand, as the historical
case studies illustrate, a strong scientific base may, in
the long term, spawn new firms and industries once
technological breakthroughs occur.

Equally important, the six case studies document how
innovation flourished as a result of implicit or explicit
knowledge-sharing arrangements. For example, the
first clubs of amateur airplane inventors in the 19th century operated not unlike the open-source communities
which today contribute to 3D printing and robotics research. In the case of semiconductors, cross-licensing
agreements were important for the commercialization
of new technologies and follow-on innovation. Today,
many firms engaging in 3D printing, nanotechnology
and robotics research have embraced open innovation
approaches. They recognize that they may be better
innovators by collaborating with others even if that
involves some sharing of proprietary knowledge.
In many cases, the IP system has facilitated the sharing
of knowledge, by encouraging disclosure and providing
a flexible tool for innovators to decide which technologies to share, with whom and on what terms. However,
the cases studies also illustrate the importance of social
norms in supporting knowledge sharing and the role
of government intervention to encourage knowledge
sharing when it is in the public interest.
While technology markets were already important for
the development of airplanes in the early 20th century,
they are bound to be more important today. Pushing
the technology frontier requires increasingly complex
technological challenges to be overcome. The more
prominent role of upstream scientific research is one
response to this challenge (see above). In addition, the
case studies suggest that firms increasingly specialize,
realizing that they may be both more innovative and
more efficient by focusing on selected research, development, manufacturing, or marketing tasks. By providing a flexible basis for licensing, IP enables specialization and is at the heart of modern technology markets.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

One possible concern about today’s innovation ecosystems is the large number of patent filings, which
may give rise to patent thickets that could stifle rather
than enable technology markets. In addition, there
are concerns that widespread patenting might inhibit
knowledge sharing. However, the evidence presented
in the 3D printing, nanotechnology and robotics case
studies suggests that so far, patent thicket concerns
have not materialized and the IP system appears to
have accommodated different knowledge-sharing
mechanisms. It is important to keep in mind, however,
that many of the technologies discussed in these case
studies are still at a relatively early stage of development and some have yet to see any commercialization.
There may well be greater conflicts surrounding IP in
the future.

Only a small share of first patent filings in the relevant
technological fields had equivalent patents in low- and
middle-income countries other than China. This suggests that patents have been neither helpful for technology dissemination to those countries when it has
occurred, nor harmful for dissemination when it has not
happened. It rather points to the presence or lack of
absorptive capacity as the main factor explaining the
extent of technology dissemination. It is important to
keep in mind, however, that this conclusion is based
on aggregate patent filing patterns; given the highly
skewed distribution of patent values, some individual
patents may well exert disproportionate influence in
certain technology fields. In addition, the conclusion
is specific to the six technologies at hand.

• Copyright is becoming increasingly relevant for
technological innovation. This first happened with
the inclusion of software within the domain of

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

…but doubts persist
Contrasting these optimistic perspectives, some economists have expressed doubt as to whether growth
at the frontier in the coming decades will match the
post-Second World War record. They put forward
several arguments:

Finally, some economists wonder whether today’s GDP
measurement framework misses the true impact of new
technology. This argument comes in two forms. One
is that the tools of statisticians increasingly fall short
of capturing quality improvements and new forms of
economic output. The other is that the very concept of
GDP is ill-suited to capture the societal welfare gains
associated with today’s innovation. In particular, many
new technologies are highly expensive to develop but,
once developed, relatively cheap to produce or can
even be replicated for free. As such, they contribute
little to economic output but may raise welfare disproportionately. However, other economists argue that
under-measurement of GDP is not a new phenomenon
and there is no convincing evidence that it is worse
today than it was in the past.

• Demographic shifts and other factors have pushed
advanced economies into a state of “secular stagnation”, whereby economies’ realized growth persistently falls short of its potential. While innovation
still contributes to future growth, persistently weak
growth performance may become self-fulfilling:
firms may shun investment opportunities created
by new technology, long spells of unemployment
may mean that workers lose skills or never acquire
them, and fewer firm startups and “scale-ups” may

A LOOK INSIDE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH ENGINE

The following discussion elaborates on these four stylized facts in turn.

Figure 1.1: Growth at the frontier
over seven centuries
Real GDP per capita, 1300-2000, logarithmic scale

Stylized fact #1
Growth at the frontier took off in the early 19th century
and accelerated in the post-Second World War era.
Studying growth performance going back centuries is
challenging. Advanced economies only started compiling national accounts – enabling the measurement of
gross domestic product (GDP) – in the first half of the
20th century. Most developing economies only did so
much later. Economic historians have estimated GDP
values for the time before official data became available, making use of historical production, wage, tax
and other data records. For selected economies, there
are thus estimates of economic output available going
back two and more centuries. These estimates are far
from perfect. As one moves into the distant past, their
margin of error is bound to increase. In addition, as
section 1.2 will further explain, comparing GDP values
across time raises difficult questions about how to account for changes in the nature and quality of goods
and services produced. In all likelihood, comparisons of
GDP values over the long run are bound to substantially
underestimate improvements in the material standard
of living, as they do not fully capture the benefits associated with the arrival of new technology.3
Notwithstanding these problems, the work of economic
historians is the only source of empirical information on
long-run growth performance and it thus bears careful
consideration. Relying on the most comprehensive
set of historical estimates available – those generated by the Maddison Project – figure 1.1 depicts the
evolution of GDP per capita at the frontier since 1300.4
The frontier is captured by the economy showing the
highest economic output per capita at a given point
in time. For the purpose of figure 1.1, these are taken
to be England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom
(UK) up to 1900, and the United States (US) thereafter.5

A LOOK INSIDE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH ENGINE

The figure’s lower panel divides the seven centuries into
three growth periods and shows trend lines depicting
average growth of per capita GDP during these periods.
The first period – labeled “merchant capitalism” following Kuznets’ (1967) original terminology – saw only little
and sporadic growth, averaging around 0.21 percent
per year.6 The onset of the industrial revolution then
led to a sharp increase in the annual rate of growth,
to 1.10 percent.7 To underline the significance of this
growth pickup, 0.21 percent annual growth implies
a doubling of income every 331 years, whereas 1.10
percent growth implies the same every 64 years. Finally,
in the post-Second World War era, growth accelerated
further to 2.08 percent per year – implying a doubling
of income every 34 years. In light of centuries of history,
the growth performance since 1950 thus emerges as
both spectacular and exceptional.

Stylized fact #2
Economic growth has led services to displace
agriculture as the main economic activity and
has prompted increased urbanization
In medieval societies, agriculture was the center of
economic activity. The onset of more rapid economic
growth in the early 19th century led to a gradual transformation of economic output, initially away from
agriculture and toward industry and services, and – at
a later stage – entirely toward services. Figure 1.2
illustrates this transformation for the US, looking at
the employment shares of the three main economic
sectors since the mid-19th century. In 1869, agriculture
accounted for close to half of total employment, with
industry and services accounting for around a quarter
each.8 In the 131 years that followed, agriculture lost its
dominance and by 2000 it accounted for a mere 2.4 of
total employment. The share of industry first expanded
to reach a peak of 34.4 percent in 1953, but then fell to
20.4 percent in 2000. The service sector has seen the
most dynamic growth. By 1934 it already accounted
for more than half of total employment, and by 2000
for more than three-quarters.
A similar picture emerges when looking at the valueadded share of each sector in GDP. In 2010, services
made up 73.6 percent of economic output in highincome countries, with industry accounting for 25.0
percent and agriculture 1.4 percent.9 In a nutshell,
economic growth has converted the agrarian societies of a few centuries ago into today’s servicesbased economies.

Notes: “Agriculture” includes agriculture, forestry and fishing;
“industry” includes manufacturing, mining and construction;
“services” includes transportation and public utilities, wholesale
trade, retail trade, finance, insurance, real estate and government
as well as the "services" category of the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA). Data for 1929 and earlier refer to the Kendrick
estimates, as explained in US Bureau of the Census (1975).

Broadberry et al (2011) attribute 14th-century
growth in GDP per capita to the population
decline associated with the Black Death. Similarly,
growth in the second half of the 17th century
coincided with a declining population.
Figure 1.1 follows Maddison (2001) in adopting 1820
as the year marking the transition from the “merchant
capitalism” era to the “industrial revolution” era.

9.

The choice of 1869 as the starting year in figure 1.1
simply reflects data availability. Historical studies
suggest that the structural shift toward industry
and services started much earlier. For example,
Broadberry et al (2011) estimate that the share of
agriculture in English GDP fell from 49.1 percent in
1381 to 26.8 percent in 1700, while the services share
rose from 23.1 to 34.0 percent over the same period.

post-Second World War period.16
Sustained growth at the frontier and the lack of convergence by non-frontier economies have led to sharp
differences in absolute income levels across the world.
To illustrate this point, consider the experience of
Germany and Ecuador. In 1870, Germany had a per
capita income of United States dollar (USD) 1,839
compared with Ecuador’s income of USD 411– a difference of USD 1,428. From 1870 to 2008, average annual
growth in both economies was largely the same, around
1.8 percent. As a result, Germany’s per capita income
increased to USD 20,801 in 2008 and Ecuador’s to USD
5,005. In turn, the absolute difference in income levels
increased elevenfold, to USD 15,796.17

In addition, initial differences in per capita incomes
have largely persisted over time. Eight of the ten richest economies in 1870 are still among the ten richest
economies of 2008. Only Hong Kong and Singapore
were able to break into the top ten.18 To be clear, most
economies outside the frontier group have also seen
sustained economic growth, promoting far better living standards for their citizens than in the 19th century.
However, growth patterns across the world have not
narrowed inequalities in the prosperity of nations; they
have widened them.

it does not consider changes in the distribution of

The most common “workhorse” that economists use
to isolate the sources of long-term growth is the socalled growth accounting framework, usually attributed
to the Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Solow.22
This framework decomposes output growth into two
components: first, a component attributable to the
accumulation of production factors – mainly capital
and labor, later expanded to include human capital;
and second, a component capturing an economy’s
overall productivity growth, also referred to as total
factor productivity (TFP) growth.

21. See, for example, Chen and Ravallion (2004).
22. See Solow (1956; 1957).

CHAPTER 1

A LOOK INSIDE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH ENGINE

The growth accounting framework goes some way
to explain why some nations have grown faster than
others.23 For example, empirical studies have pointed
to high rates of investment and the absorption of
surplus rural labor into the formal labor force as key
explanations for the rapid growth of several East Asian
economies over the past decades.24 However, in trying
to understand how technological innovation has driven
growth, the growth accounting framework faces two
important limitations. First, even though technological
innovation is often thought to be a key determinant of
TFP growth, it can also have profound effects on factor accumulation, as further explained below. Second,
empirical studies typically capture TFP growth as the
residual growth left after accounting for the influence
of production factors. As such, they cannot offer any
insight into the precise forces that lead economies to
become more productive.
Obtaining such causal insights is challenging.
Technological innovation has complex effects on the
behavior of firms and workers and the structure of
economies. Nonetheless, one can broadly distinguish
four transmission channels – as illustrated in figure 1.5.25
This section elaborates on these transmission channels.
Figure 1.5: Innovation spurs growth
through different channels

Firm productivity

Capital deepening
Firms invest in new capital equipment based on the
future income they expect those investments to generate. The introduction of new technologies can raise
investment returns and lead firms to undertake new
investments. Similarly, new technologies affect the
decisions of governments to invest in public goods,
especially the provision of an economy’s infrastructure. Indeed, neoclassical growth theory predicts that
without any technological progress, diminishing returns
on capital investment set in and economic growth
converges to zero.26
Historically, the introduction of major breakthrough
technologies has often unleashed investment booms,
driving expansions in economic output. For example,
the arrival of railway technology in the 19th century
prompted massive infrastructure investments that, in
themselves, drove sizeable output fluctuations.27 More
recently, as information and communication technologies (ICTs) took off in the 1990s, studies show that US
firms throughout the economy rapidly increased their
ICT capital stock, especially when compared with
other fixed capital assets.28 In addition, intangible asset investments – the establishment of new business
processes, databases and other knowledge-based
activities – have become an important component of
overall investments and are also linked to the introduction of new technologies.

for econometric evidence.
24. See Young (1995; 2003), although Nelson
and Pack (1999) argue that high rates of
investment were only possible because those
successful East Asian economies learned
how to use new technologies effectively.
25. Maddison (1997) offers a similar categorization.

Historically, technological innovation has been a key
force behind the expansion of the workforce. First
and foremost, advances in health technology have
prompted a dramatic increase in life expectancy. For
example, in 1800 average life expectancy at birth was
below 40 years in all developed economies; by 2011
it had risen above 75 years, with Japan seeing the
highest average of 83 years.29 By reducing the burden
of chronic disease and disability, technology has also
contributed to a progressively healthier – and thus
economically more productive – workforce.

CHAPTER 1

Innovation has been instrumental in facilitating greater
adult participation in the workforce. For example, the
introduction of refrigeration, indoor plumbing, the
washing machine, supermarkets and other innovations freed family members – especially women – from
routine household tasks, enabling them to enter into
formal employment. Similarly, the arrival of speedy
mass transportation reduced geographical barriers in
the labor market. These factors have also promoted
access to education, increasing the quality of the labor
force. Advances in educational technology, in turn, have
widened and deepened educational achievements,
further augmenting the economy’s human capital base.

Firm productivity growth
Innovation can affect the productivity of firms through
a variety of channels. Process innovations can increase
the efficiency with which inputs – especially labor – are
converted into output. Often, such efficiencies result
from the deployment of new capital equipment, as
described above. The resulting productivity enhancements free up resources that can be used to expand
output – in the same firm, in the same sector, or elsewhere in the economy. Similarly, process innovations
that lead firms to reap greater economies of scale
lead to greater output with the same level of capital
and labor input.

A LOOK INSIDE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH ENGINE

A second form of product innovation is the introduction
of new products that did not previously exist. Such
products could either be sufficiently distinct varieties
of existing products – for example, a new car model –
or more fundamental breakthroughs such as the first
tablet computer. Since the firm introducing the new
product did not produce it previously, one cannot
evaluate how such innovations directly affect the firm’s
productivity. As in the case of quality improvements,
correctly measuring the growth of economic output
when new products enter the marketplace can be
challenging (see box 1.1).
Ultimately, the productivity effects of new products
depend crucially on whether buyers of new products
are final consumers or other firms which use the
products as a production input. In the case of the
former, consumers of new products invariably adjust
their consumption basket, leading to changes in the
composition of output. How such changes affect
productivity is uncertain. However, since consumers
voluntarily purchase the newly available products, their
welfare is bound to increase.
New products that serve as intermediate inputs for
other firms may give rise to important productivity
gains.30 Indeed, the introduction of electricity, affordable long-distance travel, telecommunication, computing and many other goods and services has historically
led to substantial productivity gains in firms across a
wide range of sectors.

Product innovation has more varied effects on productivity. One form of such innovation is the quality upgrading of existing products – for example, the introduction
of more powerful computers, longer-lasting batteries Finally, just as process and product innovations can

CHAPTER 1

A LOOK INSIDE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH ENGINE

Box 1.1: Capturing new goods and services in GDP
statistics
Measuring economic growth relies on the efforts of statisticians to quantify overall economic output. Since one cannot
meaningfully add quantities of oranges and apples – let
alone quantities of tablet computers, taxi rides and doctor
visits – statistician rely on the market valuation of these
quantities. Multiplying quantity times price for each good
and service, and adding the resulting valuations together
yields an economy’s GDP.
Calculating so-called nominal GDP values for any given
year is relatively straightforward. However, difficulties arise
if one wants to track economic output over time. To begin
with, changes in nominal GDP may reflect changes in underlying quantities, changes in prices, or both. For example,
a high inflation rate might lead to a sizeable increase in
nominal GDP, even if quantities remain unchanged. For
this reason, statisticians have devised the concept of real
GDP, which measures the physical quantity of economic
output using the prices of a given base year.
However, an intricate problem arises from product innovation that prompts new goods and services to enter
the marketplace. If those new goods and services do not
relate to any previous ones, prices from a previous base
year are not available. The only way to include them in real
GDP calculations is to update the base year. But which
year to choose is not obvious. The prices of new goods
and services will often decline rapidly, and quantities grow
quickly, in the first years after their introduction; choosing
an early base year might then overstate real GDP growth.
For this and other reasons, statistical offices in many
countries have introduced so-called chain-weighted approaches to real GDP measurement, whereby the base
year is implicitly updated every year.

Chain-weighting and hedonic techniques are important tools to accommodate product innovation in GDP
measurement. However, they are not perfect.35 Above
all, they rely on the ability of statistical offices to quantify
and collect data on a large array of quality attributes of
goods and services. Even the best-resourced offices only
perform hedonic adjustments for a limited set of goods
and services. Moreover, certain quality gains do not easily
lend themselves to quantification – such as innovations
leading to improved safety, security, sustainability and
overall quality of life.
Finally, it is important to point out that real GDP growth
only partially captures the welfare gains associated with
product innovation. This is partly because of imperfect
measurement, as just described. More importantly, GDP
growth just seeks to measure how output evolves over
time, not how consumers – and society at large – value
any output expansion. While there are good reasons why
one would expect output and welfare to correlate, they
are fundamentally different concepts.
Sources: Landefeld and Parker (1997), Landefeld and
Grimm (2000) and United Nations (2009).

If new goods and services reflect quality improvements
on previously existing ones, prices from a previous base
year do exist.32 However, comparing the quantities of the
new goods and services to those of the old ones would
be misleading. For example, if quantities were expressed
in boxes of strawberries, one would naturally adjust for a
change in the weight of boxes from one year to the next.
Similarly, if one were to count boxes of computers, one
should adjust for the increase in the computing power of
each box from one year to the next.33 Statisticians have
devised methods for making such quality adjustments.
Using so-called matched-model and hedonic techniques,
one can estimate hypothetical price indices that capture
changes in the price of goods and services, holding their
quality characteristics constant. These price indices are
then used to deflate nominal GDP values, yielding a measure of real GDP that accounts for quality improvements.34

32. In practice, the distinction between a new good and
a good of superior quality can be ambiguous. For
example, new functionality in a product may be
considered a quality improvement; however, if the
new functionality is sufficiently important and leads
to new uses of the product, it may be regarded
as an entirely new product. This ambiguity further
complicates measurement efforts. See OECD (2001).
33. This example is taken from
Landefeld and Grimm (2000).

34. Another important measurement challenge is
which types of creative and innovative activities
of companies should be accounted for as
intermediate consumption and which as asset
investments. For example, the System of National
Accounts 2008 recognizes R&D spending and
software as fixed asset investments (see unstats.
un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna2008.asp). Other
intangible asset investments may follow in future.

criticisms, see Hulten (2003).

the latter article also points to heterogeneity within

sector arguably also reflects the rising demand for
services – including education, health, travel and
entertainment services – as economies grow richer.

Box 1.2: Quantifying the growth impact of past
innovations

It then rose to 0.04 percent (1830-50), 0.12 percent (1850-70)
and 0.14 (1870-1910). These estimates illustrate both the delayed
and long-lasting impact of the steam engine.

Studies seeking to quantify the growth impact of specific
innovations have mostly relied on the growth accounting
framework outlined in section 1.2. In particular, they capture
the growth contribution through two components: (i) capital
deepening measured by the growth of capital inputs associated with a particular innovation and (ii) TFP growth in the
sector that produces the goods underlying the innovation.
Two studies which have adopted this framework are Crafts
(2004) for the impact of steam technology on British economic
growth during the late 18th and 19th century, and Oliner and
Sichel (2003) for the impact of ICTs on US growth in the last
quarter of the 20th century. Table 1 presents their estimates,
which are expressed as annual percentage contributions to
labor productivity growth.
Crafts’ study captures capital deepening by the growth in
horsepower associated with steam technology. Although
James Watt’s steam engine was patented in 1769, Craft’s
estimates suggest that its contribution to labor productivity
growth was not higher than 0.02 percent per year until 1830.

Oliner and Sichel’s study measures capital deepening by the
growth of ICT capital – computer hardware, software and
communication equipment. Their estimates suggest a higher
overall contribution to growth than from steam technology,
especially in the second half of the 1990s. In addition, most
of the growth contribution is due to capital deepening – the
greater use of ICTs throughout the economy. As in the case
of the steam engine, the growth impact of ICTs took time to
materialize, though the delay is much shorter in comparison.
The above estimates are bound to underestimate the true
growth impetus from the new technologies. Above all, the
estimation approach only captures TFP growth in the technology-producing sectors. It ignores possible productivity
spillovers in other sectors of the economy. In the case of steam
technology, Crafts believes such spillovers may have been
significant after 1850. At the same time, cyclical effects may
bias the estimates presented in table 1 and may, in particular,
cause an overestimate of the ICT contribution in the second
half of the 1990s (Gordon, 2000).

Endogenous growth theory highlights the importance of intangible asset investments in knowledge-intensive industries.
However, measuring their amounts and comparing them to
tangible asset investments has always been challenging.
Company financial statements and national accounts have
traditionally treated intangible activities as intermediate inputs
rather than investment. Conventional measures of business
investment focus on tangible assets such as plant and equipment, buildings and vehicles.
To establish a more complete picture of business investment,
researchers have constructed a new measurement framework
that breaks intangible assets down into the following components (Corrado et al, 2012):

Estimates of intangible asset investments relying on this
framework are now available for a large number of advanced
economies (see figure 1.6). They consistently show that intangible assets account for sizeable shares of total business
investments – exceeding 50 percent in Denmark, Finland,
France, the Netherlands, the UK and the US.

A LOOK INSIDE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH ENGINE

Explaining why economies invest in innovation and
what implications those investments have for an economy’s growth path has been a fertile field in economics. Interestingly, neoclassical growth theory – which
was among the first attempts to formally model the
growth process – did not consider how technological
progress comes about; it merely demonstrated that
growth would come to a standstill without it. This
drawback provided the impetus for endogenous
growth theory, which explicitly incorporated incentives for innovation into models of economic growth.
In particular, in formal models of endogenous growth,
firms invest in R&D to generate future profits and
to avoid being overtaken by competitors, mainly by introducing new and better-quality products.
Competition between firms then generates a dynamic innovation race that leads to sustained increases in productivity. These models capture a
key characteristic of today’s knowledge-intensive
industries: firms invest in intangible assets – not
only R&D, but also design, software, workers’ skills
and organizational know-how – and they frequently launch new products that replace older ones.
Indeed, available data underscore the importance
of investments in intangible assets as a share of total
business investments (see box 1.3).
However, some economists have criticized endogenous
growth theory as too mechanistic.40 In particular, while
acknowledging that the fruits of innovative activity
are uncertain, endogenous growth models assume
that they fall within a predetermined probability distribution. However, many innovative breakthroughs
of far-reaching importance have been accidental in
nature – meaning that they do not fall within a range
of outcomes known in advance.
Motivated by such criticism, a second strand of the
growth literature – evolutionary growth theory – emphasizes the specific historical circumstances of innovative activity and the complexity of interrelationships, with causal mechanisms changing over time.41
In evolutionary growth theory, firms cannot foresee
all technological possibilities and resort to “rules of
thumb” when they engage in innovation. The path of
technological progress is determined by a selection
process in which market forces and other economic
institutions play a key role.
40. See Nelson and Winter (1982) for a key contribution
and Verspagen (2004) for a review of the literature.
41. See Verspagen (2004).

In the evolutionary approach, innovation takes place incrementally and the direction of change only becomes
clear over time. Despite occasional “eureka” moments
and drastic steps forward, even major historical breakthroughs took years and decades to develop, requiring
many incremental steps. In addition, their economywide impact relied on firms learning how to use a new
technology, undertaking capital investments, and
reorganizing business operations. Indeed, the arrival
of new technologies typically spurs organizational and
business model innovations that, in themselves, are responsible for major productivity gains. The infographic
at the end of this report lists just-in-time manufacturing
and the bar code as examples of major innovations
falling into this category.
Incremental innovation is also critical for the flourishing
of so-called general purpose technologies (GPTs).42
While there is no uniform definition, GPTs generally refer
to technologies that have a wide variety of uses and find
application in a large range of economic sectors, and
that exhibit strong complementarities with existing or
potential new technologies, providing fertile grounds for
follow-on innovation. Most treatments of GPTs include
the steam engine, railways, the motor vehicle, electricity
and ICTs as key examples.43 Historical studies of GPTs
have demonstrated their importance for stimulating
growth, but have also found that their growth stimulus
often occurs with a long delay – estimated, for example,
at 80 years for the steam engine (see box 1.2) and 40
years for electricity.44 Recent endogenous growth
research has linked the emergence and adoption of
GPTs to long-run cycles of economic growth, providing
an explanation for the growth spurts and slowdowns
observed throughout history. Interestingly, the prediction of growth cycles mirrors the concept of “long
waves” – also called Kondratiev waves – which feature
in early evolutionary approaches, especially the work
of Joseph Schumpeter.45

42. Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1995) coined the term
“GPT”, though it is similar to the concepts of “basic
innovation” and “technology paradigm” employed in
the evolutionary growth literature (Verspagen, 2004).
43. However, there is no consensus even on these
five technologies. For example, Crafts and
Mills (2004) raise doubts as to whether the
steam engine should be considered a GPT.
44. See Crafts (2004) for the steam engine
and David (1990) for electricity.
45. See Schumpeter (1939). In fact, it was Schumpeter
who coined the term Kondratiev wave, after the
Soviet economist Nikolai Kondratiev, who first drew
attention to long-run fluctuations in economic output.

Relying on international patent filing data, Eaton and
Kortum (1994) estimate that within developed economies, ideas are highly mobile; even for a large economy
like the US, they find that about half of productivity
growth derives from foreign technology. But how easily does technology really diffuse across economies,
especially to less developed ones?

46. See Verspagen (2004).

34

CHAPTER 1

A LOOK INSIDE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH ENGINE

On the other hand, Comin and Mestieri also look at
how intensively different economies have used new
technologies once they have been introduced. In
particular, they estimate long-run penetration rates
for the same set of technologies, and how differences
in those penetration rates have evolved over time. On
this measure, they find that more recent innovations
have seen a greater gap in use between developed
and developing economies (see right panel in figure
1.7). At first, this finding seems surprising, considering
for example the remarkably wide adoption of mobile
telephones and the Internet within most developing
economies. However, those technologies have found
even more uses in developed economies, and the use
gap compared with earlier technologies turns out to
be larger.47

However, a crucial element of successful technology
diffusion in these cases is that technology recipients
do not need to fully understand the technology in order to apply it. For many other technologies, such an
understanding may be necessary and their successful application may require substantial organizational
know-how as well as investments in complementary
equipment and infrastructure. Economists have thus
emphasized the critical role of absorptive capacity for
successful technology diffusion. Effective absorptive
capacity relies on human capital able to understand
and apply technology, organizational and managerial know-how, and institutions that coordinate and
mobilize resources for technology adoption. In many
cases, absorptive capacity also entails the ability to
undertake incremental technological and organizational
innovation in order to adapt technology to local needs.
Indeed, at the limit, the difference between absorptive
capacity and innovative capacity blurs.

Notwithstanding these general patterns, the extent of
diffusion differs greatly across technologies and recipient countries. To begin with, there are a variety of diffusion channels, notably international trade, foreign direct Some countries have been more successful at creating

CHAPTER 1

A LOOK INSIDE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH ENGINE

Survey evidence confirms that many firms regard IP
as important in securing returns on R&D investment.
However, its importance differs markedly across industries. In some industries – notably, pharmaceuticals
and chemicals – IP rights are central to firms’ business
models. In other industries, firms rely on alternative
mechanisms of profiting from R&D, notably by introducing products faster than competitors and generating consumer goodwill through branding. In fact, the
importance of branding highlights the indirect role that
another IP form, namely trademarks, plays in fostering
innovation. Through trademark protection, consumers have confidence that they are purchasing what
they intend to purchase – a prerequisite for effective
branding campaigns.

At the same time, patents may in certain circumstances
create a barrier for follow-on innovation. Sometimes,
the commercialization of an innovation requires use of
third-party proprietary technology. Other right holders
may refuse to license their technologies or may demand
royalties that render the innovation unprofitable – leading to so-called hold-up problems. Even where they
are willing to license, coordinating the participation
of a large number of right holders may be too costly.

Finally, the grant of exclusive IP rights affords firms
market power, viewed by economists as the ability to
set prices above marginal production costs. In many
cases, market power is limited by competition from
substitute technologies or products. However, for
radical innovations, market power may be substantial.
IP rights incentivize market forces to guide innovative The ability of companies to generate profits above

opportunities to pursue to be taken in a decentralized IP system. However, it also implies a distortion in the

CHAPTER 1

A LOOK INSIDE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH ENGINE

IP facilitates the functioning of technology markets in
several ways. In the absence of IP rights, firms would be
reluctant to disclose secret but easy-to-copy technologies to other firms when negotiating licensing contracts.
In addition, while intellectual assets can, in principle,
be transferred through private contracts independent
of any IP right, IP titles offer a delineation of these assets combined with an assurance of market exclusivity.
IP rights thus convey important information than can
assist the drawing up of contracts.60
Technology markets are also at the heart of so-called
open innovation strategies. In many industries, firms
face a trade-off between guarding and sharing knowledge. On the one hand, they need to earn a return
on their R&D investment, which calls for preventing
knowledge from leaking to competitors. On the other
hand, absolute protection of all ideas may not always
be in firms’ best interest. They may be better innovators by collaborating with others, even if that involves
some sharing of proprietary knowledge. In addition,
technology sharing may also help in developing nascent
markets for new products. IP rights are at the heart of
the trade-off between guarding and sharing knowledge.
They allow firms to flexibly control which technologies
to share, with whom and on what terms.
Yet another important function of technology markets is
to facilitate the commercialization of inventions coming
out of scientific laboratories. The commercial potential
of these inventions is often highly uncertain and they
require substantial further investment to turn them into
marketable technologies. Universities and PROs have
neither the resources nor the expertise to undertake
such investment. However, they can file patents on their
inventions and license or transfer them to firms that do.
Finally, IP rights affect how technologies diffuse within
and across countries. On the one hand, exclusive
rights, by their nature, may hinder the diffusion of new
technologies – at least in countries where those rights
have effect. On the other hand, IP rights may enable
technology diffusion, just as IP rights enable technology markets more generally. The ultimate role of IP
rights, then, depends on the nature of the technology
in question – in particular the degree to which it can
be reverse-engineered – and the absorptive capacity
of the recipient (see section 1.3).

60. For empirical evidence, see Gans et al (2008).

38

Trade secrets and worker mobility
An often-overlooked link between the IP system and
innovation performance is through the mobility of
knowledge workers. The diffusion of highly specialized
and non-codified knowledge often relies on workers
moving from one firm to another. However, to what
extent are such workers allowed to use the knowledge
they acquired as past employees, if such knowledge
is secret? The legal answer to this question lies in socalled non-compete clauses included in employment
contracts. These clauses restrict an employee from
using information learned during employment in subsequent business efforts, at least for a certain period.
However, the inclusion and content of non-compete
clauses is subject to regulation, with different jurisdictions adopting different approaches.61
Policymakers face a trade-off in setting the ground
rules for non-compete clauses. Allowing workers
substantial leeway to take knowledge from one firm
to another promotes the diffusion of knowledge, fueling the innovation system and promoting technology
adoption.62 At the same time, it may lead firms to forgo
innovative activities for fear that the fruits of these activities might in the future leak to a competitor. Empirical
evidence suggests that non-compete rules matter for
the degree of worker mobility, especially for inventors
with firm-specific skills and for those who specialize in
narrow technical fields.63 However, the economy-wide
importance of such rules is still not well understood.
They cover not only technological knowledge, but also
organizational know-how and business practices. Their
relevance is thus not limited to technology-intensive
firms and includes, for example, firms in the service
sector, which account for the predominant share of
economic output in high-income economies (see
section 1.1).

61. See Caenegem (2013).
62. Gilson (1999) argues that the non-enforcement
of post-employment non-compete clauses
in California has been a significant factor
driving innovation in Silicon Valley firms.

1.5 – Future prospects for
innovation-driven growth

The optimists’ case

The first stylized fact in section 1.1 characterized the
growth performance at the frontier after the Second
World War as both spectacular and exceptional. Yet
growth since the onset of the global financial crisis
in 2008 appears anything but spectacular. Figure 1.8
depicts the evolution of per capita GDP in high-income
countries since the mid-1980s. Before the crisis, growth
averaged 2.1 percent per year, matching the post-war
rate of frontier growth shown in figure 1.1. Not only did
the crisis prompt a sharp decline in economic output,
average growth since 2010 has fallen to 0.9 percent.
Does the financial crisis mark the beginning of a new
era of lower growth? Has the innovation-driven growth
engine lost steam? While only time will provide the
definitive answer, the last few years have seen lively
scholarly debate on what growth prospects the future
may hold. This final section synthesizes some of the key
arguments put forward. It first presents the optimists’
case that the recent growth decline is temporary and
faster growth will return, then moves on to the pessimists’ case why growth might be sustainably lower
in the years and decades to come.

Figure 1.8: The end of spectacular
post-Second World War growth?

The main reason why the growth decline may be temporary lies in the root cause of the crisis. In particular,
the crisis was unleashed by the bursting of a debtfinanced asset bubble that left the balance sheets of
firms and households in distress.64 The desire to repair
balance sheets through greater savings has prompted
a persistent shortfall of aggregate demand, leading
to wide gaps between actual output and potential
output. With interest rates having hit the zero lower
bound, central banks have had difficulty closing this
output gap through traditional monetary policy instruments. The post-financial crisis debt overhang has
thus imposed a persistent drag on economic growth
in developed economies.65
An optimist would submit that market forces will eventually eliminate persistent output gaps and economic
growth will return to its long-term path determined
by economies’ fundamental productive capacities.
Economic history has indeed seen prolonged downturns before, which caused scholars to predict the
end of growth. For example, John Maynard Keynes
observed in 1931: “We are suffering just now from a
bad attack of economic pessimism. […] The prevailing
world depression, the enormous anomaly of unemployment in a world full of wants […], blind us to what is
going on under the surface to the true interpretation
of the trend of things.”66

In today’s context, focusing on the long-run growth
trend shown in figure 1.1 – rather than the “aberration” associated with the financial crisis – still paints
an overwhelmingly positive outlook for future growth.
In addition, looking at the potential for innovation to

to be optimistic.

The pessimists’ case
The pessimists’ case starts with doubts about whether
market forces will be sufficient to eliminate the output
gaps left by the financial crisis. The length of the
economic downturn and the failure to restore full
employment in many developed economies suggests
that something fundamental has changed. These
doubts have given rise to theories about so-called
“secular stagnation” – a term introduced by economist
Lawrence Summers in 2013.73 A technical definition
of secular stagnation is that only negative real interest
rates would equate savings and investments with full
employment. In the presence of low inflation and a
zero lower bound on policy interest rates, output gaps
persist, generating subdued growth – also referred to
as “the new mediocre”.74
There is considerable debate among macroeconomists
regarding what may be behind secular stagnation.
Demographic shifts and changes in the structure of
financial markets have been cited as possible causes.
Interestingly, some economists have also mentioned
technology as an explanatory factor, arguing that the
latest wave of ICT innovation has required relatively
little investment.75

73. See Summers (2014).
74. The term “new mediocre” is attributed to IMF
Managing Director Christine Lagarde; see www.
imf.org/external/np/speeches/2014/100214.htm.
75. For a summary, see the collection of essays
edited by Teulings and Baldwin (2014).

42

Concerns about secular stagnation do not per se question the potential of innovation to contribute to future
growth. Nevertheless, persistent output gaps may
negatively affect the transmission channels through
which innovation generates growth. In particular, weak
overall demand may lead firms to shun investment opportunities created by new technology, long spells of
unemployment may lead workers to lose or not acquire
skills, and fewer firm startups and “scale-ups” may slow
the structural transformation of the economy.
Independent of secular stagnation concerns, the pessimists’ camp also casts fundamental doubt on the
potential for innovation to drive future growth. One
ground for such doubt is an observed decline in TFP
growth that started well before the onset of the crisis.
Chiefly, the US economy saw a marked pick-up of TFP
growth from 1995 to 2003, mainly attributed to ICTs
(see box 1.2); however, since then TFP growth has
been significantly slower.76 More generally, analysis
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) confirms that
potential output started to decline in the early 2000s
across all advanced economies, mainly accounted for
by a drop in TFP growth.77

76. See Fernald (2014).
77. See IMF (2015).

CHAPTER 1

A LOOK INSIDE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH ENGINE

Could it be that the growth contribution of ICTs has
been largely realized and, without any innovation of
comparable significance on the horizon, future growth
will disappoint? In a provocative article, economist
Robert Gordon makes precisely this case.78 He argues
that ICTs have seen faster adoption and follow-on innovation compared with previous GPTs, with key productivity benefits such as the replacement of tedious and
repetitive clerical labor by computer already occurring
in the 1970s and 1980s. More recent ICT innovations
have consisted of entertainment and communication
devices that are smaller and smarter, but which do not
radically spur economic productivity.

Finally, the claim that GDP statistics fail to capture the
true impact of innovation is hard to evaluate. The use
of hedonic and other techniques has improved GDP
measurement in those countries in which statistical offices are equipped to use them (see box 1.1). From this
view, the quality of today’s statistics should be better
than decades ago. It is undoubtedly the case that GDP
statistics do not capture the full welfare benefits new
innovations offer, but the key question is whether the
under-measurement problem is worse today than it
was in the past. There is no convincing evidence that
would suggest it is and establishing such evidence
may well be impossible.80

More generally, Gordon argues that it will be hard to
match the achievements of earlier innovations. For
example, the dramatic improvements in the speed of
travel, life expectancy and long-distance communication could only happen once, with future improvements
bound to be minor in comparison. Similarly, there is
much less scope for innovation to increase labor force
participation; if anything, demographic shifts in developed economies will lead to declining participation.
In addition, one may question the productivity of future
innovative activity. Pushing the knowledge frontier is
becoming progressively more difficult as the “lowhanging fruit” is plucked. In addition to real R&D expenditure, figure 1.9 shows trends in first patent filings
– the patent metric that comes closest to the concept
of a unique invention. Aside from China, since the
mid-2000s most countries have seen faster growth in
R&D expenditure than first patent filings, leading to a
falling R&D yield. One should not read too much into
these trends, as patent-filing trends may reflect shifts
in patenting strategies. However, contrary to the 1980s
and the second half of the 1990s, patenting trends do
not suggest an upturn in R&D productivity in more
recent history.79

78. See Gordon (2012).
79. See Fink et al (2015) for a more in-depth
discussion of long-term patent filing trends.
They identify greater internationalization as
one important shift in patenting strategies.

CHAPTER 2

HISTORICAL BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS

2.1 – Airplanes
“To invent an airplane is nothing.
To build one is something.
But to fly is everything.”
Otto Lilienthal,
German aviation pioneer
The airplane took off at the beginning of the 20th century, flying in the face of 19th-century predictions that
“heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible”.3 By
the end of the 20th century, air travel had become a
relatively common experience and air transport had
revolutionized global commerce. In consequence, the
world became a smaller place. The story of airplane
innovation is exceptionally rich, ranging from heroic
inventors sacrificing their life in their quest for glory to
brilliant engineering feats that were guided by trial and
error as well as the latest scientific thinking.4

2.1.1 – The development of the
commercial airplane and its
economic contribution
At the turn of the 20th century, US inventors Orville and
Wilbur Wright developed a wing warping and rudder
structure that would provide lateral stabilization to an
aircraft, and they filed a US patent on this invention
on March 23, 1903.5 The lateral stabilization provided
by the wing and rudder combination proved to be an
important breakthrough in the early years of airplane
development. It enabled the Wright brothers’ airplane,
the Flyer, to lift from a level surface and fly for 59
seconds over 260 meters. The Flyer was – arguably
– the first successful heavier-than-air machine.6 By
1905, Flyer III, a vastly improved version of their earlier
airplane design, could be easily steered to circle and
turn, and was able to fly for over 30 minutes at a time.7

By the time Wilbur Wright demonstrated Flyer III to the
public in 1908, there were several competing models. Alberto Santos-Dumont (1906) of Brazil and the
Frenchmen Gabriel Voisin (1907), Henri Farman (1909)
and Louis Blériot (1909) were among the many who
introduced successful aircraft, with varying degrees
of speed, range and structural reliability.8
But early aircraft designs like the Wright brothers’ were
by no means viable for passenger transport. They were
small, single-engine vehicles powered by crude piston
engines yielding 25-100 horsepower. Their operating
speed was about 40 miles per hour, the maximum flight
duration was two to three hours and they could only
carry two people.9
It would take almost a decade after the Wright brothers’
invention before an airplane could be considered an
alternative and viable mode of transportation.

Applying scientific knowledge to aviation
The Wright brothers and their contemporaries managed
to fly without knowing the scientific underpinnings to
why they could do so.
A second breakthrough in airplane development occurred when science provided the explanation of how
heavier-than-air craft could be airborne. In particular,
advances in mathematics and physics explained how
air circulated around an airfoil, and provided the crucial
factor in explaining and estimating how air affected the
lift and drag of an airplane.10

Description

Pioneers of aviation*
1866

Francis Wenham

Great Britain

Introduced the idea of superposed wings in a flying machine, patented in 1866. Illustrated
the importance of the high aspect ratio multiplane in his paper “Aerial locomotion”,
published in 1890. This design is the basis for biplanes, triplanes and multiplanes.

1870s

Alphonse Pénaud

France

First to construct a fixed-wing aircraft model that was relatively stable, namely
the twisted rubber band-powered model with dihedral wings and tilted rudder
fly. Also designed a full-scale aircraft fitted with a control system.

1890s

Otto Lilienthal

Germany

Conducted and recorded field experiments using gliders. His
gliding demonstrations inspired many to fly.

1890s

Lawrence Hargrave

Australia

Introduced a box kite-like design which added to aircraft’s stability. In 1893, he presented
his findings at the International Conference on Aerial Navigation in Chicago, US.

1890

Clément Ader

France

Took off unassisted in steam-powered aircraft Éole at Armainvilliers, and was airborne for
about 50 meters. First flight to take off unassisted, but plane was uncontrollable in air.

1903

Orville and Wilbur Wright

US

Developed wing warping and rudder structure to provide lateral
stabilization to aircraft. Filed for patent in 1903, granted in 1906.

Aerodynamic theories and their application to airframe construction
1904

Ludwig Prandtl

Germany

Theorized how vortices form in moving fluids. This along with the KuttaJoukowski theorem formed the basis for an aerodynamic theory of the airfoil
in 1917. It was later refined by his colleagues Albert Betz and Max Munk.

1910

Hugo Junkers

Germany

Filed for patent on “bodily design of airfoils” in 1910.

1911

Theodore von Kármán

Hungary

His vortex street theorem explained why an airflow separates from the airfoil
at a high angle of attack. Explained why airplanes would stall.

1913

Armand Deperdussin

Belgium

Received patent on the first attempt to design a single-shell or monocoque fuselage.

1918

Adolf Rohrbach

Germany

Introduced the stressed-skin structure into his design for a fourengine passenger aircraft, the Staaken E.4/20.

1925

Herbert Wagner

Germany

A colleague of Adolf Rohrbach, he developed a theoretical framework on
diagonal-tension fields to calculate stressed-skin design. His research optimized
the properties of stressed skins in aircraft fuselage and wings.

1927

Bennett M. Jones

USA

Conceptualized the ideal streamlined airplane which placed the weight of the plane on its
structure instead of just the wings. The aerodynamically optimized fuselage reduced both drag
on the airplane and its fuel consumption. This idea paved the way for profitable civil aviation.

1928

H.C.H. Townend

Great Britain

Suggested mounting a ring around a radial engine in order to avoid turbulence from the cylinders.

Jet engine development

1930

Frank Whittle

Great Britain

Patent filed on an early turbojet prototype, was not renewed in 1935 because of lack of funding.

1932

Ernst Heinkel

Germany

Presented an aerodynamically optimized airplane, HE 70. Engaged in aeroengine design and also subsidized von Ohain’s work on the jet engine.

1935

Increasing dependence on air transport
Improvements in airplane reliability and durability
helped to make air transport a viable mode of transportation, competing with surface transportation means
such as railway and ocean transport. It cut travel time
over long distances. By 1930, passengers were able
to travel between European cities like Berlin, London,
Paris and Vienna and return on the same day, making
air travel a strong rival to rail transport.

In addition, the introduction of the jet engine and higher
payload capacity led to a significant decrease in airplane operating costs. This in turn led to the introduction of “economy” class in 1958, and opened air travel
to a greater proportion of the population. The same
year that economy class was introduced, the number
of passengers traveling across the North Atlantic by
sea dropped drastically.13 Table 2.2 shows the improvements in airplane performance and passenger capacity
by airplane model and over time.
The decrease in costs also contributed to an increase
in the share of goods being transported by air: the
average revenue per ton-kilometer of shipped goods
dropped by 92 percent between 1955 and 2004.14

Finally, air travel helped connect remote areas to urban
areas. By the 1930s, small privately run airlines were
servicing the North-South Canadian routes. There were
scheduled air flights from the US, France and Germany
to cities in Central and South America. Passengers from
outside Europe and the US were increasingly relying
on the airplane as a viable mode of transportation (see
figure 2.1). Many European national airline flag carriers
were founded in the 1920s, and some of them linked
European cities with their colonies in parts of Asia, the
Middle East, Latin America and Oceania.15

By the mid-1970s, countries outside Europe and the US
were also purchasing airplanes for their own national

First, the heavy capital investment required to establish
a national airline flag carrier and build the necessary
infrastructure to support air travel, such as airport
complexes, runways, air traffic control and related
service activities, has made an important contribution to economic growth. A 2006 study published by
ICAO calculated that civil aviation directly contributed
370 billion United States dollars (USD) and approximately six million jobs to the world economy in 1998.16
Another study estimated that the air transport industry
accounted for between USD 11.3 billion and USD 410

regions in 2004.17

The airplane has had significant impact on economic
growth since its inception.

In addition, this investment has a multiplier effect, triggering many other economic activities that relate to
growth. The same ICAO report states, “[I]n the global
economy, every $100 of output produced and every 100
jobs generated by air transport trigger additional demand of some $325 and 610 jobs in other industries.”18

Second, the combination of reliable air travel, shorter
travel time and reduced cost has facilitated globalization. Both people and goods can travel longer distances
in less time, thus easing the movement of both goods
and services across borders. Between 1951 and 2004,
growth in goods transported by air averaged 11.7 percent, as against average growth of 4.4 percent in sea
shipment.19 In addition, tourism flourished.20
This greater reliance on air transport has in turn contributed to the reorganization of the manufacturing supply
chain and created new business models, all of which
exploit countries’ comparative advantages.

Third, governments’ interest in airplane development
grew as advances in aviation began to show promising
avenues of application, especially for national defense
purposes.

but this collaboration waned as the airplane industry
began to form.
Second, the complexity of airplane innovation grew as
advances in aviation progressed from the purely experimental application of basic mechanical engineering to
heavy reliance on scientific knowledge of air circulation,
and finally to today’s aircraft performance optimization
through the integration of complex subsystems involving electronics, hydraulics and material technology. At
each stage of the development of aviation, different
skills and expertise were needed for the introduction
of a successful product. In addition, as newer airplane
models integrated more and more systems, the innovation investment required became more expensive, and
the activity became associated with a higher degree of
uncertainty. In particular, the success of a new airplane
product depended on optimizing the design to integrate
complex systems, but how such systems will interact
is often difficult to predict.

21. As explained above, airplane designs of the 1930s
incorporated many incremental innovations that
increased aircraft performance and reliability.

The changing dynamic of collaboration
In the pioneer years of flying, circa 1890-1905, individuals rather than governments or institutions played a
critical role in advancing innovation in the field. These
inventors were hobbyists and flight enthusiasts motivated primarily by curiosity; some also sought fame,
but none – at least in the beginning – expected any
monetary gain.

Furthermore, the latest technical developments and
know-how were openly shared across the aviation
community, allowing experimenters to build on the
existing knowledge base.22 There were membershipbased clubs and societies on “aerial navigation” in
Berlin, London and Paris. Exhibitions and conferences
to showcase the latest developments in aeronautics
were organized, the earliest of which was held in 1868
at Crystal Palace in London by the Aeronautical Society
of Great Britain.

Indeed, many of them were relatively rich, having
made money in other areas before beginning their ex- By 1909, there were a total of 21 aviation periodicals

making this knowledge accessible to the public. He was
also the link that connected inventors to one another,
corresponding with them and offering his ideas. At
times, Chanute financed cash-strapped inventors to
help them pursue their experimental work.23

CHAPTER 2

HISTORICAL BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS

Before the Wright brothers’ invented their wing warp
design, they corresponded with and participated in
this community of flying enthusiasts. During this period,
government support was minimal.
As the dream of a flying machine started to become
reality, the collaborative nature of aviation innovation
waned.24 It started with the Wright brothers’ secrecy
about their invention until they received their patent
in 1906.25 Two years after that patent was granted by
the USPTO, Wilbur demonstrated their airplane model
in France.26
Investment started pouring into the airplane industry
from both the private and public sectors. Henri Deutsch
de la Meurthe, a pioneer in the European oil industry,
financed the development of automobile and airplane
research in France until his death in 1919. Hugo Junkers
funded his own aviation research, and even went so
far as to build two wind tunnel facilities for his private
research institute.
Airplane inventors such as the Wright brothers (1908),
Gabriel Voisin (1910) and Glenn Curtiss (1916) founded their own companies to profit from their efforts.
Between 1903 and 1913, approximately 200 airplane
prototypes were introduced, but only a handful were
manufactured.27 Most of them were sold for government use.

Several elements in Germany facilitated this technological superiority. First, almost all its airplane inventors were either scientists or engineers, and could
apply aerodynamic theories to produce sophisticated
aircraft.28 Even some of their pilots had engineering
degrees and were able to help in calculating, measuring and testing aircraft performance. Second, several
of these inventors were also university professors and
benefited from their close proximity to one another.
The idea for corrugated steel made with duralumin
came from Junkers’ colleague Hans Reissner while
both were professors at the Technical University of
Aachen. Third, advances in airplane design benefited
from Germany’s experience with the Zeppelin dirigible.
Both Claude Dornier and Adolf Rohrbach worked on the
Zeppelin before shifting to airplanes. The wind tunnels
designed by Prandtl in 1908 – to improve the shape of
Zeppelin’s aircraft – were used to test the Prandtl-BetzMunk airfoil theory up until the end of the First World
War. The results of these tests informed the design and
construction of airplanes in later years.
But as improvements in airplane design became more
scientific, the cost of innovating in the airplane industry
grew. Investment in large research and experimental
facilities like wind tunnels was required to test airplane
designs. In 1917, Gustave Eiffel constructed a wind tunnel capable of testing aircraft designs in Auteuil, France,
but a lack of funding for aviation research reduced its
potential and use.

Toward science-based innovation
The reliability and performance of airplanes improved
significantly as innovators started understanding how
a plane flies. Improvements in airplane design through
the application of aerodynamic theory to airframe
construction gave a technological edge to the country
that could innovate in this field – Germany – over others
such as the UK, France and the US.

24. This transition is not unique to the airplane industry.
25. The brothers had disclosed that they were successful
in flying in a letter to the French inventor Ferdinand
Ferber on October 9, 1905, and a French article
detailed their accomplishments based on their
US patent application. But the European aviation
community paid little attention to this announcement;
it was possibly an oversight (Gibbs-Smith, 2003).
26. The Wright brothers conducted a few
demonstrations in the US but failed to attract
interest from the federal government.
27. Zhegu (2007).

Soon, there was an increasing gap in the aviation
knowledge base among nations.29 Inventors in other
countries often lacked the skills or education needed
to imitate or improve on the science-based airplane
designs of their German rivals. For example, French
and British designers such the Short Brothers in 1922
eagerly copied the German duralumin airplane because
it was fashionable, but did not improve on it.

HISTORICAL BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS

Two nations’ innovation ecosystems and governments
stood out in facilitating airplane development: Germany
and the US.

Germany
Before, during and after the two World Wars, the
German government made strong efforts to speed up
the development and production of German warplanes.
First, it created and funded institutions that would
conduct, compile and disseminate the latest aviationrelated technological progress to German manufacturers.31 One of the beneficiaries of this promotion was the
aircraft manufacturer Anthony Fokker, who was the first
to implement the thick airfoils developed and analyzed
at the University of Göttingen during First World War.
The resulting planes had a higher climb rate and better
maneuverability than all Allied planes.32
Second, the government formed a war association
of aircraft producers which included all German aircraft manufacturers and innovators. All proprietary
technologies and know-how were shared among its
members, greatly benefiting those that were lagging
technologically.

US
During the First World War, the US airplane industry was
so technologically backward that most of the country’s
warplanes were of European design. To remedy this,
the government invested heavily to facilitate technology
transfer from Europe and develop its own aerodynamic
research capacity.
First, a federal research organization, NACA, was created in 1915 with the aim of conducting and funding
R&D in airframe and propulsion technologies for both
military and civilian use. It housed the first large wind
tunnel that could accommodate full-scale airframes,
built in 1927. A major improvement in airframe design,
the NACA cowl for radial air-cooled piston engines,
was developed there and later incorporated into the
Douglas DC-3 design.
Second, the government funded a significant share
of R&D investment for military airframes, engines and
related components through defense spending. By
contrast, industry financed less than 20 percent of R&D
investment in the period 1945-1982. Innovation in commercial aircraft engines benefited greatly from military
procurement and R&D spending. The development of
the first jet engine in the US was financed entirely by
the US military during the Second World War. In addition, although military R&D spending did not seek to
catalyze commercial aircraft innovation, technological
spillovers from military to civilian applications were an
important source of innovation in commercial aircraft.

Third, it encouraged small aircraft manufactures to form
joint ventures to facilitate the faster deployment of warplanes incorporating new technologies. For example,
the government initiated a joint venture between Fokker
and Junkers during the First World War in an attempt
to combine Fokker’s experience in mass production
with Junkers’ latest innovation.33
Third, the Manufacturer’s Aircraft Association (MAA)
was created in 1919 – under pressure from the US

HISTORICAL BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS

2.1.3 – Airplanes and the IP system
Most scholars studying the history of the airplane assign minimal importance to patents as instruments of
competitive or technical strategy. Clearly, based on
the circumstances of the time, government demand
for mass production of airplanes and intervention
in the airplane industry played a critical role in the
development of the industry. This demand reflected
the military importance of aircraft and made aviation
virtually unique among knowledge-intensive industries
of the 20th century. It is difficult to say whether – in a
counterfactual scenario – the advances in the airplane
market that occurred during turbulent times of war and
the threat of war would also have taken place under
more “normal” circumstances.

Inventors were also able to profit from licensing their inventions. Rohrbach, for example, licensed his stressedskin construction to British, Japanese and Italian
manufacturers up to the 1930s.37 The German ex-pilot
Lachmann and the British firm Handley Page sold their
slotted wing invention to governments to the tune of
approximately USD 3.75 million.38 Junkers was able to
partially support his R&D investment through royalty
license payments from English engineering firm William
Doxford and Sons on his thick airfoil invention.39 He also
received payments of approximately two million marks
from the German government for using his patented
airfoil invention during the First World War.40

In addition, patenting facilitated the dissemination
of proprietary technologies through licensing. Both

for patents on their inventions, and built their businesses based on them. The patents prevented others from
free-riding on the inventors’ investments and helped
sustain their competitiveness. For example, Junkers
prevented the importation of Ford Trimotor airplanes
into Germany on the grounds that the Ford design
infringed some elements of his proprietary technology.36

in the US – from 328 units in 1920 to 5,856 units in 1939,
of which 256 and 2,195 units were destined for military
use, respectively. But this increase in the number of USproduced aircraft also coincided with higher government spending on military as well as other initiatives to
induce the mass production of aircraft during wartime.

French and German patent offices in March 1904. The
German courts invalidated the Wright brothers’ patent
on the ground that they had compromised the prior
art by disclosing their invention to the public before
filing (Crouch, 2000). The French courts seemed in
favor of the brothers’ application but final decision
was delayed until after their patent had expired.

A 1988 study found that 121 aerospace-specific patents
were added to the patent pool in the period 1968-1972.44
This figure represented only 7.8 percent of all patents
in the general aerospace category for the same period, and while it probably understates the innovative
activities within the industry – patentable inventions in
aviation could be kept undisclosed for national interests – it suggests that the patent pool had little effect
in facilitating further innovation in airplane design. But
additional research on this is needed.

had the objective of helping the Allied forces manufacture
as many aircraft as needed. At the end of the war, each
patent reverted to its original owners, along with all rights
and privileges.
Source: Eubank (1952).

The Association of German Aircraft Producers
In Germany, attempts were made to create a patent
pool of aircraft producers during the First World War
through the Association of German Aircraft Producers.
This Association was established in 1917, in parallel with
the Auskunfts- und Verteilungsstelle für flugwissenschaftliche Arbeiten der Flugzeugmeisterei to facilitate
the sharing of aviation-related technologies among
German aircraft producers.45 Aircraft producers who
wanted to use the distribution office had to volunteer
their proprietary technologies to other members of
the Association.
The Association was supposed to regulate the patent
pool, but it was too weak. One of its flaws was that it
was unable to convince Junkers, one of Germany’s
airplane pioneers, to join and share his patents.
In 1933, the Nazi government coerced Junkers into
contributing his patents to the Association. From
then onward, all patents in the airplane field were
subject to compulsory licensing as deemed necessary. The German Air Ministry was designated the
sole authority for issuing regulations for licensing and
subsequent fees.46
While this patent pool was useful in sharing the latest
developments in aviation among German manufacturers in the First World War (see the German case study
in subsection 2.1.2), its effect on follow-on innovation
in Germany is more difficult to establish. After the
Second World War the Allied forces banned any aviation-related activities in Germany and confiscated all
aviation-related technical documents. Any proprietary
technology in aeronautics was made public and could
be used freely (see box 2.1).

2.2 – Antibiotics
“In 1931, humans could fly across oceans and
communicate instantaneously around the world.
They studied quantum physics and practiced
psychoanalysis, suffered mass advertising, got stuck in
traffic jams, talked on the phone, erected skyscrapers,
and worried about their weight. In Western nations
people were cynical and ironic, greedy and thrillhappy, in love with movies and jazz, and enamored of
all things new; they were, in most senses, thoroughly
modern. But in at least one important way, they had
advanced little more than prehistoric humans: They
were almost helpless in the face of bacterial infection.”
Thomas Hager
The Demon Under the Microscope, 2006

There is little doubt that sulfas, penicillin and streptomycin were among the major breakthrough innovations of
the 20th century. Their discovery was recognized with
Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine – to Gerhard
Domagk in 1939, to Alexander Fleming, Ernst Chain
and Howard Florey in 1945, and to Selman Waksman in
1952. Moreover, these breakthroughs also spawned a
range of follow on innovations, including semi-synthetic
penicillins, cephalosporins and an array of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

1930s – Sulfa drugs: the dawn of
the antibiotic revolution
The development of sulfa drugs was a response to the
tremendous toll that infections had on soldiers during
the First World War. Streptococcal infections, in particular, were responsible for many fatalities on all sides
during the war, as well as for many civilian diseases.50

By any reckoning, the discovery of antibiotics in the
1930s revolutionized health, clinical practice and industry.47 The development of antibiotics led to a sharp The first effective treatments against streptococcal

trade names, and by 1945, thousands of new sulfa
drug variants were available as well.52
Following the initial tests, the next challenge was to
produce penicillin on a large scale. In 1941, working
with Florey and Heatley, Andrew Moyer and other US
Department of Agriculture (USDA) scientists developed a medium for the mass production of penicillin.
One year later, the US government convinced firms
to become involved in the production. While this was
initially limited to a small number of firms, eventually
the US government would buy penicillin from any firm
with demonstrated capabilities. Several large US firms
became involved in the wartime penicillin effort, including Pfizer, Squibb and Merck. The 1940s wartime
effort was a great success, making the transition from
laboratory to mass production in an amazingly short
period of time and attaining productivity increases of
two orders of magnitude. From this time onward, companies involved in penicillin production used their newly
developed capabilities to explore other opportunities,
in particular the search for new antibiotics.

HISTORICAL BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS

The natural penicillins developed during the war and
shortly thereafter had some drawbacks, including
difficulty of administration, limited effect on certain
organisms, and growing resistance. In 1957, the organic chemist John Sheehan from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) developed the first pure
chemical synthesis of penicillin with the financial support of Bristol Laboratories. This process also synthesized the intermediate compound 6-APA. Around
the same time, Chain and scientists from the UK’s
Beecham Group found a way to isolate 6-APA from
the fermentation broth. The isolation of 6-APA made
possible the development of virtually any new penicillin structure that could be imagined.56 Soon there was
cooperation between Bristol and Beecham, because
Beecham required Sheehan’s method for making other
penicillins from 6-APA and Bristol’s manufacturing capability to scale up its own. This led to the production of
early semi-synthetic penicillins, including phenethicillin,
ampicillin and amoxicillin. Thanks to this technology,
these and many other firms developed several improved variants of penicillin which are still in use today.

1950-60s – Streptomycin and other
broad-spectrum antibiotics
Even before penicillin was successfully launched, other
scholars had a longstanding belief that soil bacteria
might be useful against other microorganisms.57 In 1939,
Merck signed a research agreement with soil chemist
Selman Waksman from Rutgers University, who was
already investigating a specific type of soil bacteria,
the actinomycetes. The agreement gave Waksman
the resources to screen soil samples and evaluate the
resulting antibiotics pharmacologically, plus access to
large-scale equipment for producing any promising
discoveries. In 1943, Albert Schatz – one of Waksman’s
students – found a bacterium from soil samples and
other sources that was effective against tuberculosis,
naming it streptomycin. After animal and human trials
in the following years, the drug was available in the
market by 1950.

56. Mann (2004).
57. Kingston (2004).

Streptomycin was significant for several reasons. First,
neither sulfa drugs nor penicillin had much of an effect on tuberculosis, which was still a major cause
of morbidity and mortality in the 1950s. Additionally,
streptomycin proved useful against many other diseases, among them typhoid fever, bubonic plague and
urinary tract infections. But perhaps most importantly,
the discovery of streptomycin concerned not only a new
medicine but also a new research tool that enabled
scientists to search soil samples and other natural
sources for antibiotics.58
Following streptomycin, other firms also began searching soil samples for antimicrobial activity. Some of the
early successes were chlortetracycline (1948), chloramphenicol (1948), oxytetracylcine (1950), and tetracycline
(1955).59 Another important early class of drugs was
the cephalosporins (1964), which were based on the
Italian scientist Giuseppe Brotzu’s discovery of the
Cephalosporium acremonium in a local sewer. Many of
these are notable for having a broader spectrum than
penicillin as well as other benefits. Still other classes
of antibacterials were developed in the years that
followed, such as nitroimidazoles, chloramphenicols,
quinolones, monobactams, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid
and imipenem-cilastatin.
In the aftermath of the antibiotics revolution, a new
pharmaceutical industry was constituted which innovated in many dimensions, including developing
new classes of drugs, creating new drugs effective
against different types of bacteria or with better side
effect profiles, and making improvements in the route
and ease of administration.

The economic contribution of antibiotics
There is little doubt that antibiotics have had a strong
positive impact on human health. Between 1937 and
1943, sulfa drugs led to sharp decreases in mortality
from a range of conditions, such as maternal mortality,
pneumonia and scarlet fever. 60 Overall life expectancy
in the US increased between 8 and 16 percent during
this period. The discovery of sulfa and penicillin caused
a marked drop in infectious disease mortality in the
US; death rates from various infectious diseases had
achieved their current level by 1960.61 There is also
evidence of sharp falls in tuberculosis and pneumonia mortality globally after the antibiotic revolution.62
Certainly, other factors also contributed to this decline,
including improved nutrition and public health among
others. Then again, antibiotics also facilitated other
forms of treatment – like surgery or cancer treatments –
and so aided progress against other diseases as well.63
In any case, the trend of declining mortality after the
antibiotic revolution for several infectious diseases
in different regions of the world is remarkable (see
figure 2.4).

As with many new technologies, diffusion patterns were
uneven. But the eventual global diffusion of these drugs
helped contribute to a convergence in life expectancy.64
Relatively soon after their discovery, the sulfa drugs
diffused broadly throughout Europe and the US. Both
the United Nations (UN) and the US government had
programs to distribute penicillin and streptomycin
globally. Similarly, the UN funded the building of new
plants, including in China, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Poland,
Yugoslavia and elsewhere.65
Generally speaking, it is difficult to place an exact
economic value on the benefits of new medical technologies, but the economic contribution of antibiotics
in the first half of the 20th century was surely substantial.
Some estimates suggests that the value of improvements in life expectancy during this time is of the same
order of magnitude as the welfare gains from per capita
GDP growth over the same period.66

HISTORICAL BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS

Appropriation of innovation through patents

In any case, some patents did protect the process for
mass-producing penicillin. In 1944, Moyer and Robert
Coghill filed for a patent for the “Method for production
of increased yields of penicillin”, which was granted in
1947 and assigned to USDA.85 Non-acknowledgement
of the British collaborators would eventually become
the source of controversy in the UK, where some British
researchers also alleged that the US researchers had
privatized a public discovery. In any case, the belief that
the UK had lost out on penicillin led British researchers
to be more inclined to patent other medical discoveries
later on.86 It is also worth noting that around the same
time, many UK and US firms – such as May & Baker,
Glaxo, Eli Lilly and Merck – also filed for patents related
to the process of producing penicillin.

One of the goals of the patent system is to promote
innovation by means of the appropriation of inventions.
This seems to have provided the necessary incentives
for Bayer to develop the sulfa drugs. On December
25, 1932, Bayer filed the first patent related to a sulfa
drug – entitled “Processes for the production of azo
compounds” – which was issued in 1935.82 Domagk
and other scientists at Bayer immediately began not
only to patent this compound, but also to discover and
patent all related ones that worked. By the 1960s, they
had filed more than 50 new patents related to sulfas.
This active patenting practice was already widespread
within the German chemical sector. Between 1905 and
1915, the German chemical company Hoechst filed
no fewer than 20 patents based on Ehrlich’s research. The importance of patents for incentivizing the developMost of these were process patents, as Germany – like ment of later antibiotics is more obvious. The search for

HISTORICAL BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS

The case of synthetic penicillin also reflects the changed
role of patents in the antibiotics industry. According to
Sheehan’s account, the prospect of patents for synthetic pencillins after the war was much more important to drug companies than it had been for natural
penicillins during the war. In 1957, Sheehan – who was
already listed as an inventor in more than 10 patent
applications relating to penicillin and streptomycin at
Merck – filed a patent in the US for synthetic penicillin.
In the same year, the Beecham Group filed a patent
application relating to synthetic penicillin in the UK,
which was granted in 1960.90 The Beecham Group
has stated that the original decision to expand drug
research into semi-synthetic penicillins and the basic
work that led to the discovery and development of the
new penicillins would not have taken place without the
incentives of patent protection.91

Trademarks – the other means of appropriation
Even without enforceable patents after the Institut
Pasteur’s discovery, Bayer still managed to make
significant revenues from sulfa drugs. Bayer secured
its competitive advantage using its first-in-class status,
brand name and strong sales. Brand recognition protected by trademarks proved to be a rewarding strategy
for Bayer in particular, and for the industry more generally.92 Bayer marketed its sulfa drugs first as Streptozon
and later as Prontosil, Prontylin and Prontalbin.
Much as the Germans had done with sulfa drugs, firms
began using brands aggressively to try to strengthen
and lengthen their market positions. This was particularly important when there was significant within-class
competition which exerted price pressure on early
antibiotics.93 By 1954, there were over 100 antibiotics marketed in the US under more than 600 trade
names, which evidently created much confusion for
physicians.94 Related to this, firms began investing in
marketing to doctors. Most major companies invested
heavily in expanding their sales forces. As a result,
marketing and sales became at least as important
as R&D for pharmaceutical companies. Firms spent
around one-third of their sales revenue on average on
marketing, but less than one-sixth on R&D activities.95

Disclosure, collaboration and diffusion
Another of the goals of a patent system is to promote
disclosure. Some accounts of the development of sulfa
indicate that Bayer had concerns about the effects of
publicizing the invention which led it to delay applying
for patent protection until other variants of sulfa had
been found. There was no way to protect the area forever, because its earlier work already suggested that
any number of azo-dye derivatives could be active as
medicines. Bayer could not patent them all, but delaying application gave it time to find and patent the best
of them.96 Following the issuance of the first patent,
Domagk published an article about the discovery and
Bayer released it more broadly for trials, including to
hospitals.97 However, given its concerns about reverse
engineering, Bayer apparently strove to prevent complete disclosure in the patents write-up. The publication of the main sulfa patent revealed how to replicate
Streptozon at least in vague terms.98 Regardless of
whether the source was the scientific publication or
the patent document, the disclosure eventually allowed
researchers from the Institut Pasteur to experiment and
identify sulfanilamide, an already-known molecule, as
the key ingredient. Disclosure and subsequent inventing around the existing patents certainly incentivized
the discovery, which made Bayer’s patents valueless.
Providing a framework for disclosure also facilitates
collaboration. By the pioneering researchers’ own
accounts, patents allowed academia and industry to
cooperate to produce early semi-synthetic penicillins. One of Sheehan’s motives for obtaining a patent
was to be able to collaborate more freely with Bristol
Laboratories.99 Similarly, patent protection allowed
Beecham to persuade Bristol to share their manufacturing know-how. Unfortunately, this collaborative
effort broke down eventually and there was a long legal
dispute about whether Sheehan or the Beecham Group
had priority to 6-APA. This dispute was settled in favor
of Sheehan in 1979. As already discussed, the research
collaboration between Rutgers and Merck leading to
streptomycin was also supported by patent rights.100

Waksman or Schatz deserved the credit for the
discovery and also the royalties. This ended in a US
court ruling in 1950 in favor of compensating Schatz.

CHAPTER 2

HISTORICAL BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS

One lesson from the breakthrough innovations is that
science, technology, law and firms’ strategies co-evolve.
This makes it very difficult to tease out the causal role
patents and other intellectual property rights have on
innovation. It is difficult to say how the development
of the breakthrough antibiotics would have played out
with weaker or stronger patents. However, it is much
clearer that the antibiotic revolution helped create the
modern patent-intensive pharmaceutical industry, by
creating capabilities and profits that generated subsequent innovation, and by shaping patent laws, patent
standards and firms’ patent strategies.
Streptomycin was one of the precedents that led to
changes in US patent law. Previously, a “flash of creative genius” was needed to establish patentability. This
standard would bar many antibiotic patents, which were
developed through well-known techniques. The Patent
Act of 1952 changed the “creative genius” requirement
to “non-obviousness”, which may have been more amenable to obtaining patents from routinized large-scale
R&D efforts.103 Other countries followed in enacting
non-obviousness or “inventive step” requirements, including Japan in 1959, Sweden in 1967, France in 1968
and the UK in 1968.104 The granting of a composition
of matter patent was an important precedent for the
pharmaceutical industry, as was the emergence of the
non-obviousness requirement.
Around the same time, other changes in US legislation
aimed to create an efficacy standard at the FDA to
ensure that new drugs worked and to eliminate patents
for “me too” and fixed-dose combination drugs.105 The
original bill of the Kefauver-Harris Amendment Act also
included provisions for compulsory licensing, essentially allowing market entry at three years in exchange
for reasonable royalties. Arguably, such amendments
to regulation had their roots in concerns about negative
effects of patent monopolies on antibiotics, but they
are commonly cited reasons why patent protection is
more important in pharmaceuticals than other sectors.
On the one hand, trials increase R&D costs significantly,
making the need for long patent terms to recoup investments. On the other hand, the need for trials makes
inventing around a patent harder: One can tweak a
molecule, but it is costly to introduce this changed
molecule to market, requiring expensive new trials.

103. Dutfield (2009) and Kingston (2004).
104. Kingston (2001).
105. Carpenter (2014).

Before the 1970s, academic institutions were reluctant
to become actively involved in patenting and licensing
activities, especially for health-related technologies.106
In almost all the discussed cases, academics were
somewhat nervous about patenting public health-related technologies. Academic institutions were similarly
reluctant. For instance, the assignee of Sheehan’s patent on synthetic penicillin was not MIT but the Research
Corporation – a third-party technology transfer agent
founded in 1912 – which handled academic patents
for many institutions in the post-war period. Not only
were academic institutions reluctant to get involved
in licensing patents; when they did so, as in the case
of streptomycin, they were inclined to adopt a broad
approach and favor increased competition. In the
US, academic institutions became less reluctant to
be involved in patenting and licensing medical inventions in the decades that followed. Through a range of
developments which culminated with the Bayh-Dole
Act of 1980, federal policy supported patenting and
exclusive licensing of the results of public medical research. Whether and how this focus on patenting and
licensing has influenced the other types of universityindustry interaction and channels of technology transfer
that were important for breakthrough innovations
remains unclear.107
As mentioned in subsection 2.2.1, there is growing
concern about antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.
Some argue that this will significantly impact incentives
to develop new antibiotics, prompting changes to the
institutional and regulatory framework related to the
pharmaceutical industry, including potentially to the
patent system.108 However, it is not yet clear how these
dynamics will play out.

A semiconductor is a material that can conduct electricity only under certain conditions. This property
makes it a good medium for the control of electrical

amplify and convert electrical current. Semiconductor
technology is at the origin of the development of the ICT
industry and today’s digital economy. The invention of
semiconductors led to the rapid rise of mainframes and
later personal computers (PCs), in turn giving rise to
the informatization of entire industries, and institutions
such as hospitals, schools, transport and homes.109

2.3.1 – The development of
semiconductors and their
economic contribution
The word “semiconducting” was used for the first time
by Alessandro Volta in 1782 as he experimented with
the electrical properties of materials. The technological breakthrough behind semiconductors depended
on a series of scientific discoveries and technological
inventions, and culminated in the invention of the microprocessor, which is at the heart of any PC or device
with processing power.

were also used as rectifiers to convert alternating current into direct current. The First World War provided a
strong stimulus to the development of new generations
of amplifiers and their mass production. The growing
volume of telephone traffic created additional demand
for amplifiers.112 After the war, amplifiers based on
vacuum tubes fostered the development of telephony,
radio and computers.
Vacuum tubes presented a number of technical issues,
however. The metal in the tubes burned out and they
were too big, unreliable and energy-consuming. During
the Second World War, the military forces, mainly in the
US, demanded large quantities of high-quality radar receivers. In the meantime, in the UK, military needs and
efforts at Bletchley Park led to the development of the
first electronic programmable computer, the Colossus.
Although vacuum tubes were more reliable and allowed
for more applications than previous technologies, their
deficiencies became increasingly evident with industrial
production, posing an important research challenge.

An important geographical shift in semiconductor
production has taken place during this period. In
1976, nearly 70 percent of shipments emanated from
the USA, 20 percent from Europe and 5 percent from
Japan. In 1990, the share of the US had fallen to about
30 percent while Japan had increased its share to 40
percent. Since then, the shares of the US, Europe and
Japan have all declined, with the broader Asia Pacific
region – essentially, Taiwan (Province of China) and the
Republic of Korea – accounting for close to 60 percent
of sales in 2015.
The use of ICTs and the Internet has transformed existing industries and created entirely new ones – including
in retail, distribution, energy, finance, transportation
and health; ICTs affect how people learn, travel, work
and interact socially.
Economists have worked to quantify the wider contribution of ICTs to economic growth (see section 1.2 and
box 1.2 in the previous chapter of this report). They
identify three growth channels that have emerged
over time.116

116. OECD (2004) and Van Ark and Inklaar (2005).

76

First, investment in ICTs contribute to overall capital
deepening.117 Second, technological progress in the
ICT industry spurs TFP growth in the ICT-producing
industries. The quality and speed of chips increase
steadily while their cost falls, increasing their diffusion
significantly.118 Third, similarly to other GPTs and taking
significant time, greater adoption of computers across
all sectors of the economy raises economy-wide total
factor productivity. Firms and transactions become
more efficient thanks to network effects too, as long
as ICT investments are paired with organizational and
process innovations.
Empirical studies confirm the existence of all three
growth channels, but with some caveats, in particular
as far as the third channel is concerned. There is consensus that since the mid-1990s the ICT-producing sector has made a considerable contribution to productivity
growth in several high-income countries.119 In the US,
the contribution of ICT to labor productivity growth was
already evident from the mid-1970s (see box 1.2). Indeed,
ICT investment continued to positively affect value-added growth up to the last economic crisis and beyond.120

HISTORICAL BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS

In addition, most studies conducted in the early 2000s
in the US and for some other high-income countries
demonstrate the strong effect of efficiency gains in
the ICT-using, as opposed to ICT-producing sectors,
in particular the service sector.121
These rewards from ICT investment have not yet been
reaped by all countries. A concern has been that the
ICT-driven productivity boost is not even as widely
shared in Europe or Japan as it is in the US.122 Some
studies also point out that the productivity impacts of
ICT capital deepening in high-income countries may
now have reached their climax (see section 1.5).123
Semiconductors have started to diffuse to emerging
economies, sometimes rapidly. As at 2015, China is
the biggest market for semiconductors, followed by
India, the Russian Federation and Brazil.124 Also, in
some low- and middle-income economies, ICTs have
already had important effects in making markets more
efficient, for example by creating new payment services
or spurring further innovation. Undoubtedly, this potential in developing economies is far from exhausted. In
terms of semiconductor production, economies such
as China, Malaysia, Taiwan (Province of China) and a
few other Asian economies host some of the largest
assembling and manufacturing activities. In terms of
semiconductor innovation – and a few exceptions aside,
including in China and some other Asian countries
and in Latin America, notably in Argentina, Brazil and
Costa Rica – most higher value-added activities such
as chip design still take place in high-income countries.

2.3.2 – The semiconductor
innovation ecosystem
The semiconductor innovation ecosystem evolved
considerably over time, reflecting in particular the move
from early-stage invention and first commercialization to mass production and diffusion. The innovation
system in each of the three main geographical regions,
namely the US, Europe and Japan, had a very distinct
structure, adding its specific contribution to innovation
and diffusion.
In the US, the Silicon Valley cluster created the conditions for specialized firms to emerge and coexist with
large established firms. In Japan, large firms – initially
building on technology licensed from the US – achieved
large-scale and cheaper production and introduced innovations at both the technological and organizational
levels. In Europe, a strong system of basic research, the
dominance of large firms – and industrial policy efforts
to create and maintain them – and a focus on consumer
markets allowed firms to gain a strong competitive
position in semiconductors for consumer industries.
All phases of semiconductor innovation, but in particular the early stage until the 1960s, relied heavily on
contributions in fundamental science and linkages to
public and university research. In addition, fast diffusion
of knowledge spurred global innovation.
Semiconductor innovation greatly benefited from government support and policy, in the form of demand for
and purchase of semiconductor devices, and industrial
and trade policy.

Early concentration in the US and
Europe and diffusion to Asia
Most of the innovation in semiconductors has taken
place in a few clusters. In the US, Silicon Valley in the
San Francisco Bay area has become synonymous
with ICT entrepreneurship, dynamism and innovation.
In Japan, Tokyo and the Osaka-Kobe region emerged
as important semiconductor clusters.125

The evolution of the semiconductor
innovation ecosystem

Vacuum tubes: large integrated firms
and strong need for basic research

The semiconductor innovation ecosystem evolved over
the different technological phases described in section
2.3.1. Table 2.4 summarizes its main characteristics.

Large integrated firms – mostly electrical and electronic
system companies such as Western Electric in the US,
Philips in the Netherlands, Siemens in Germany and
Nippon Electric Company (NEC) in Japan – were the
major producers of semiconductors and constituted a
stable oligopoly. US and European firms relied on their
strong research units and on research at universities.
At this time, the innovative efforts of Japanese firms
were driven by the absorption of foreign technologies.

being technologically less advanced. In continuity with
previous periods, large integrated firms dominated the
industry. In addition, firms focused on the consumer
market, especially calculators, and were reluctant to
move to silicon devices.

During this era, interactions between R&D and production were important for innovation. For instance, Texas
Instruments adopted an organizational structure that
fostered relations between different divisions. This was
one of the success factors of the company.131 Similarly,
in Fairchild Semiconductor the invention of the planar
transistor was the result of research efforts based on
an intuition by a foreman in the production division.132

In the US, Intel, the leader in the microprocessor
market, and most semiconductor firms focused on
design-intensive chips, yielding higher margins. Some
of these firms, such as Intel and Texas Instruments,
maintained their production facilities, evolving into
IDMs. Others, such as Qualcomm, chose the fabless

European firms adopted a strategy of acquisitions
of US firms and R&D collaborations with established
producers of microprocessors. This allowed them
to use the new technology in consumer electronics,
telecommunications and automotive applications.
Philips, Siemens and SGS-Thomson maintained their
commercial position in international consumer electronics markets and spun off specialized semiconductor
companies that became very successful later on.134

The critical role of government in financing
and stimulating research and innovation
Governments spurred the development of semiconductors through various mechanisms with pronounced
differences across countries.

In Europe, no military contracts were available, and
when support was available, little spillover to commercial applications materialized.137 Governments did
not devote the same financial resources to support the
development of the industry. Greater financial support
arrived much later, when European firms were trying
to catch up with US firms in microprocessors. The
research laboratories set up by governments were
keener on basic than applied research.138 Subsidies,
tariffs, non-tariff barriers and competition policies
supported national champions. Their limited scale of
operations, due to the fragmentation of the European
market, influenced the outcomes of these policies.139
In addition, national procurement, for example in telecommunications, further deepened the fragmentation
of the market.

HISTORICAL BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS

2.3.3 – Semiconductors
and the IP system
Through the various stages of innovation and commercialization, appropriation and IP strategies naturally
evolved. They were often specific to particular actors,
and varied significantly across countries too. A few
broad characterizations are possible, however.

Patents: From open to more
defensive patenting strategies?
Due to the high mobility of scientists in Silicon Valley
and the willingness of researchers to publish their inventions, secrecy was not considered a viable strategy in
the US. In the case of Japan, by contrast, employees
benefited from lifetime employment and rarely left their
company, keeping information internal. Trade secrecy
laws were rarely invoked.
Semiconductor innovation coincided with the intense
use of patents. All the phases discussed above witnessed numerous patent filings, most for inventions
that were critical for the further development of the
industry. Patent filings saw notable growth from the
early days (see figure 2.8). This strong use of patents
is striking as legally, the layout of semiconductors
is in principle not protectable via traditional patent
rights. Indeed, layouts of ICs were considered obvious variations of prior layouts, and not deserving of
patent protection.141 From a business perspective
too, the short commercial life of ICs also made other
forms of appropriation more appealing. Indeed, lead
time, first-mover advantage, design capabilities and a
good reputation were more important in this respect.142
Nevertheless, other elements of semiconductor technology were patentable. In particular, patents were used
to appropriate returns on technically complex structural
features of semiconductor devices and innovations in
semiconductor processing.

141. Hoeren (2015a).
142. Levin et al (1987) and Cohen et al (2000).

More importantly, patents were mostly used as an
effective means of sharing technology among key actors. In part due to business strategy and government
policy, patents rarely needed to be enforced. Firms
were aware that chip development requires access to
a multitude of overlapping inventions and rights held
by diverse parties.143 Firms directly or indirectly used
other parties’ inventions, either explicitly through flexible large-scale cross-licensing practices or implicitly
by ignoring others’ patent rights.144
Disclosure, the sharing of technology and the lack of
litigation facilitated cumulative innovation, and diffusion.
Patents also facilitated specialization and helped to
mobilize resources to cover the high R&D costs and
to finance startups.145 Indeed, the current build-up of
large patent portfolios to block competitors or to avert
the threat of litigation, is – by historical standards – a
newer phenomenon in the industry. The feared negative
effect on true innovation might also be more contained
than initially thought by some.146
It is helpful to distinguish the various phases of IP
strategy carefully.

Phase 1 (1900-1940): Individual academic
undertakings with patents
In the early 20th century various academic inventors
laid the foundations for the industry. Even at this early
stage, inventions were often also filed as patents as
well as being published as scientific papers. Yet these
patents were not used exclusively by the inventor. In
fact, they were mostly not commercially exploited at
all; rather, they contributed to the pool of knowledge.

Phase 2 (1940-1980): Patent equilibrium
and extensive cross-licensing
From the 1940s until the 1970s, the rapid rise of IP
coincided with innovation, not only in the US, but also
in Europe and Japan.147 Patent owners did not use
patents to keep technologies to themselves or fend
off competition. Patents were either cross-licensed
or deliberately not enforced.148 Startups used existing
semiconductor techniques for follow-on innovation.

In addition, the mobility of inventors and the creation
of startups were rampant, leading to further diffusion
of technologies. Indeed, in 1977 the US Federal Trade
Commission noted: “The fact that companies can
rapidly copy each other is very important. This rapid
copying is the result of the mobility of personnel from
firm to firm and the unwillingness of most firms to bring
trade secrets or patent infringement suits”.151

Internationally, patents were not used to fend off competition either. In fact, although Japan was quickly beRight holders had two reasons to abstain from enforc- coming the major semiconductor production location,

HISTORICAL BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS

Starting from that point, a lot of US and international
– mostly Japanese and European – companies licensed technology from Bell. The licensees were in
turn requested to make their patents available at a fair
price.154 Reverse engineering allowed all semiconductor
companies to check the interiors of circuits produced
by their competitors. The publication of the patent
applications alerted researchers to the work already
being done by others and also increased the respect
inventors had for each other’s work.
This open approach to patented technologies did not
stop at national borders. The early Japanese chip
companies all thrived on technology licensed from US
firms. When the cost of designing chips increased, US
and Japanese firms cooperated and cross-licensed
technology.155

Phase 3 (1980-1984): Initial closing-up as
result of industrial policy and trade wars,
and the creation of sui generis rights
The innovation and IP model described above began
to erode, mostly as a result of industrial policy and the
changing nature of technological leadership. In the
1980s, Japanese firms started to surpass US firms
in the quality of semiconductor chips. This raised
concerns in the US; accusations of IP infringement by
Japanese companies were raised. Moreover, Fairchild
and Texas Instruments were restricted from investing
further in Japan. Moreover, in Japan full patent rights
were not granted to Texas Instruments on its key integrated circuit patent until 1989 (although some limited
patent rights were approved in 1977), more than 25
years after its original filing.156
The US and Japanese governments interfered more
and more in the industry, both instituting preferential
treatment for national firms. Accusations of semiconductor counterfeiting arose; US and Japanese chip
firms started a patent war which lasted for a decade.
The liberal cross-border licensing policies came to
an end. This led to lobbying efforts to produce a sui
generis system protecting semiconductor mask design.
Corresponding laws were concluded nationally and
internationally, creating a new type of IP right. Yet this
ad hoc, technology-specific sui generis approach failed
to see any notable uptake or impact.

Phase 4 (1984 onward): Semiconductor patent
surge, defensive patenting and litigation
From the early 1980s onward, semiconductor patenting
and the propensity to patent accelerated to unforeseen levels in the US and abroad.157 According to the
literature, this increase in patenting and a change in
IP strategy was spurred by pro-patenting legislation in
the US, namely the creation of the Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) by the Federal Courts
Improvement Act of 1982, a further intensification of
the competitive nature of the semiconductor industry
and the increasing tendency to more actively seek
licensing revenues.158 In particular, Texas Instruments’
move to exploit its IP portfolio more and start earning
revenue from its competitors had a ripple effect.159 The
rise of a new business model in which chip design was
separated from chip production also played a role in
this change in patenting strategies; chip designers
earn revenues by selling IP licenses to manufacturers.
Furthermore, patents were also progressively used to
block potential entrants and competitors, and to pose
a barrier for follow-on innovation. A so-called patent
holdup situation arose, risking – by some accounts –
a slowdown in technological progress.160 According
to the literature and industry accounts, patents were
increasingly filed defensively, to avoid the risk of being
sued for patent infringement. The rate of litigation by US
semiconductor firms as enforcers of patents is shown
to have remained relatively stable over the past two
decades. In contrast, there was a documented rise in
active litigation by non-practicing entities.

157. As documented in Fink et al (2015), the steepest
increase in the ratio of first patents to R&D on
a global level also occurred in the “electrical
machinery, computer and audiovisual technology”
category, which includes semiconductors.

protection for semiconductors

As described above, in the 1980s a sui generis system
to protect semiconductor mask design was created,
but without ever achieving any notable use by innovation actors and inventors.

Interestingly, however, the sui generis system did not
experience significant uptake or have a real impact
in practice. First, as mentioned, the sui generis right
protected the mask of the chip. However, the function of
the IC is more valuable than its mask. Second, although
masks are complex and hard to copy, they can be easily
modified without damaging chips’ functionality. Hence,
masks would not be protected against altered masks
obtained, for example, through reverse engineering.
These technical aspects of the sui generis protection
lowered its appeal. In addition, due to the increasingly
short lifespan of chips, high production costs and
customization requirements, chip piracy became practically unaffordable. Consequently, hardly any litigation
to enforce mask work designs ever occurred and the
industry continued to rely on patents.

HISTORICAL BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS

Copyright to protect chip design:
Gaining in importance recently?
While initially deemed irrelevant, the use of copyright
to protect chip design has gained in importance more
recently. Copyright had always been considered for the
potential protection of chip designs, in particular in the
US. These attempts largely failed. For instance, the US
Copyright Office refused to register patterns on printed
circuit boards and semiconductor chips because no
separate artistic aspects had been demonstrated. The
pattern was simply deemed inseparable from the utilitarian function of the chip. In the end, the sui generis
approach outlined above was favored; copyright was
dropped as a possible means of appropriation.
Nonetheless, as new business models separating
chip design and manufacture have become ever more
central, industry experts suggest that copyright is now
an important tool for appropriating semiconductor
innovation. Specifically, the netlists – the graphical
descriptions of all the devices and the connections
between each device given by fabless firms to foundries, which may include text, software, libraries and
databases – are undoubtedly protected by copyright
law insofar as they include highly valuable and creative
text-format representations of chip designs.167

2.4 – Lessons learned
The three case studies presented in this chapter offer
diverse insights into how breakthrough innovations
have spurred growth and what role the IP system played
in the relevant innovation ecosystems. Many of the
insights are specific to the technologies and historical
context at hand and do not easily lend themselves to
generalization. Indeed, innovation in airplanes, semiconductors and antibiotics is still thriving today, and
the ecosystems underlying innovative activity in these
fields have evolved greatly.

HISTORICAL BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS

How did the three innovations disseminate and spur
growth in low- and middle-income countries? Although
the case studies do not offer any quantitative evidence,
it is interesting to note that the products due to the innovations – aircraft, antibiotic medicines and numerous
information technology products – saw relatively wide
adoption in developing economies. This adoption is
bound to have made important growth contributions.
By contrast, the manufacturing know-how associated
with these innovations did not spread as widely. While
some developing economies succeeded in creating
manufacturing capacity in these industries, the bulk of
production remains concentrated in a relatively small
number of countries to this day.

Notwithstanding this caveat, it is worth drawing some

168. The economic literature has formally explored
differences in firms’ innovation performance
in relation to their size during an industry
product life cycle (Klepper 1996).
169. These findings are broadly in line with studies of
the product life cycle of different industries. See,
for example, Klepper (1996) and Malerba (2002).

170. The importance of IP protection as a means of
appropriating returns on R&D investment is bound
to have differed across the three industries studied.
In particular, the production of semiconductors
and airplanes requires greater upfront capital
investment than the production of pharmaceuticals.
The higher market entry costs in the former
industries may have lessened firms’ reliance on IP
protection when competing in the marketplace.

89

CHAPTER 2

Third, the IP system itself adapted to the newly emerging technologies. At the outset, patent offices and
courts faced difficult questions about the patentability
of founding inventions. These questions concerned
whether those inventions were patentable under the
legal standards prevailing at the time and how broad
inventive claims could be. The first question arose in
the case of early-stage antibiotics and for the layout
of the semiconductor. The second question was at the
center of disputes around the Wright brothers’ seminal
patents, where courts in the US and Europe reached
different conclusions. The patent pooling arrangements
described above – in which governments played some
role – also served to calibrate the patent system to
best support the innovation ecosystems prevailing at
the time. Again, in the presence of many confounding
influences, and discounting the benefit of hindsight, it
is difficult to evaluate whether policymakers necessarily
got it right. Interestingly, the one more radical departure
from the traditional set of IP rights – the creation of a
new form of IP for layout designs of ICs – proved to
be a failure, in the sense that it was not much used. If
any lesson can be drawn from this experience, it is that
policymakers need to carefully consider the dynamic
nature of technology when reforming IP policies.
Finally, looking at global IP landscapes, available data
suggest that innovators in the three cases overwhelmingly sought patent protection in the high-income
countries where most of the innovation took place.
Only a small share of first patent filings in the relevant
technological fields had equivalents in low- and middleincome economies. Overall, this suggests that patents
were neither helpful for technology dissemination when
it did occur, nor harmful when it did not happen (see
also section 1.4). Rather, it points to the presence or
lack of absorptive capacity as the main factor explaining the extent of dissemination.

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

3.1 – 3D Printing
“The next episode of 3D printing will involve
printing entirely new kinds of materials.
Eventually we will print complete products
– circuits, motors, and batteries already
included. At that point, all bets are off.”
Hod Lipson,
Director of Cornell University’s
Creative Machines Lab
3D printing – known in the industry as additive manufacturing – refers to a set of manufacturing technologies
where 3D objects are created by adding successive
layers of material on top of one another, aided by specialized computer programs for both process control
and object design.
This section traces the development of 3D printing
and its economic contribution. It then describes the
ecosystem that has given rise to this innovation, paying
particular attention to factors that have been crucial
in advancing it. Finally it focuses on the role of the IP
system in the development of 3D printing and notes
some potential challenges that this innovation may
pose to that system.3

3.1.1 – The development of 3D printing
and its economic importance
In a general sense, the technological roots of 3D
printing date all the way back to the 19th century, to
photosculpture and topography works.
But it was not until the late 1960s that attempts began
to create three-dimensional objects using specialized
computer programs. One took place at the Battelle
Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, and the other
was by Wyn Kelly Swainson in Berkeley, California. A
decade later, the first functional 3D printing technique
was reported by a Japanese scientist, Hideo Kodama,
at the Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute.
Soon thereafter, different 3D printing processes appeared (see table 3.1). Each of these was based on a
different printing technique and there were also some
variations in the type of raw materials used for printing.

As a complement to the 3D printing process, a new
file format describing the surface geometry of 3D
objects was required. 3D Systems – the company that
introduced the first commercial 3D printer based on
stereolithography – also developed the first file format,
known as STL.4 This format evolved to become an
industry standard used until recently.
As this innovation gained wider acceptance in commercial manufacturing, a different market segment
emerged – personal 3D printing, also known as personal fabrication.
In the mid-2000s, researchers at universities such as
the University of Bath, the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT), Cornell University and Stanford
launched this market segment by looking into ways
that 3D printing could be made widely available. Their
goal was to develop 3D printers that were compact
and had general application.5
One of these projects, RepRap, was conceived to create an open-source 3D printer that would reproduce
itself. Its development, along with supporting products
and services, has significantly cut the cost of personal
3D printers, making them more accessible to interested
consumers.
RepRap has also created a flourishing ecosystem
of hardware manufacturers, software programmers
and service providers, all of them supporting the 3D
printer consumer market. Several of the personal 3D
printers available today are based on RepRap’s opensource software and hardware, and the technologies
they contain.
But not everyone can own a 3D printer or has the capability to build one; enter Fab Lab. Fab Lab is a project
started at MIT in 2001, led by Neil Gershenfeld, which
focuses on building low-cost, open-source fabrication
labs. The basic principle is to encourage users to create
what they need without having to negotiate licenses for
access to 3D printing systems. Fab Labs are essentially
laboratories equipped with industrial-grade fabrication
and electronics tools which operate with open-source
software and related programs developed at MIT.
Users may use these labs to create and print objects
that they want or need without having to purchase 3D
printing systems.

Growing commercial relevance
Since it first became commercially available, 3D printing
has had an impact on production processes in various
industries and sectors. It first found application as a
rapid prototyping process. Engineers and industrial
designers used it to accelerate their design and prototyping operations, saving both time and money.
Gradually, as newer 3D printing methods were introduced using new raw materials, it found application in
the production of components or even finished products in several industrial sectors, including aerospace
and aviation, automobiles, construction, industrial
design, medical products and defense. It has even
been applied to create consumer products such as
fashion, footwear, jewelry, glasses and food.
For firms in these industries, 3D printing allows the
production of a small number of goods at low cost.
This makes it attractive to those with small-series production.6

As for the personal 3D printing market segment, the
development of open-source 3D printing initiatives and
the expiry of related patents have lowered the cost of
printers, making them more accessible (see subsection
3.1.3 on the role of patents).8 Low-cost printers and
fabrication labs for personal use have facilitated the
diffusion of the technology across many communities
and helped meet their diverse needs.
For example, early Fab Labs in India, Ghana, northern
Norway and the inner city of Boston in the US have
allowed local innovators to make tools for measuring
milk safety and testing agricultural machines, blocks
to aid in local embroidery business, data tags to allow
cellular-based monitoring of herds, solar cells and
jewelry from scrap metal, respectively. Currently, there
are almost 550 Fab Labs around the world. They are
mainly localized in the US and Europe, but still there
are 23 Fab Labs in Africa, 58 in Asia and 54 in Latin
America and the Caribbean (see figure 3.1).

In many of these cases, 3D printing reduces both the
time and cost of production for companies. One consulting report estimates that the cost savings from using
3D printing to produce spare parts for maintenance,
repair and operation in the global aerospace market
could amount to USD 3.4 billion.7

Promising effect
The potential impact of 3D printing is significant. First,
it may play an increasingly important role not only
in rapid prototyping, but also in the production of
product components and finished products.9 For
example, it has been used in the medical sector to
produce custom-made sockets for hip replacements
and hearing-aid shells.10 By bypassing traditional
means of manufacturing, it could enable mass-scale
customization of products, reduce inventory costs and
optimize product design.
Second, it may lead to a world of decentralized manufacturing. As the creation of information about an object
is separated from its production through 3D printing,
traditional production channels – both supply and distribution channels – could be disrupted.11 Essentially,
objects could be created elsewhere but produced close
to the customer or even by the customer himself. This
could then lead to innovation in business models, where
efficient targeting of niche markets and integration of
customers into the value chain could be achieved.12

Third, 3D printing may have a profound impact in
geographical areas which are far from manufacturing
plants or even distribution channels. For these off-grid
communities, 3D printing enables the possibility of
manufacturing and fabricating replacement parts or
products that might otherwise have been difficult to
acquire. One potential application is in less developed
economies that may be cut off from normal distribution channels. 3D printing may allow them to acquire
products at lower cost by bypassing the traditional
manufacturing and distribution chains.13 And as has
been shown with the Fab Labs, it could enable locally
designed solutions for local problems, potentially bringing large benefits to these economies. Another, very
different off-grid community that might benefit from
3D printing is the International Space Station, where
replacement parts are very difficult to come by.
And lastly, as personal 3D printers become more
reliable and their design and marketing improve considerably, they have the potential to be attractive to
consumers by lowering both costs and environmental
impacts of printed products.14
Given the changes that 3D printing looks set to bring
about in manufacturing processes and distribution
channels, its increasing use is likely to affect local job
markets.15 For example, it may displace employment in
traditional manufacturing sectors by shifting job openings to places where there is demand for 3D printing.
But so far, no scholar has studied this effect.
Estimates of the growth and impact of 3D printing
vary widely. Industry observers forecast that the 3D
printing market will generate revenues of USD 20 billion by 2020.16 The financial impact of the technology
is estimated at between USD 230 and 550 billion per
year by 2025, with the largest impacts being on consumer (USD 100 to 300 billion), direct manufacturing
(USD 100 to 200 billion) and the creation of tools and
molds (USD 30 to 50 billion).17 But some projections
of market growth are considerably more cautious than
others (see table 3.2).

Whether
forecasts of the future impact of 3D printing
prove correct will depend on whether it can overcome
some technical challenges. For one thing, the cost of
industrial 3D printers is still high, ranging from USD
75,000 to 90,370; some industrial systems can cost
over USD 1 million.19 And while the price of personal
3D printers has dropped significantly from over USD
30,000 a few years ago to USD 1,000 today, they are
still unaffordable to many.20 In addition, suitable raw
material is considerably more expensive than many
raw materials used in traditional manufacturing processes. One specialized consulting firm estimates that
USD 528.8 million was spent on raw materials for 3D
printers in 2013.21

Furthermore, 3D printing remains a slow process, often
requiring many hours or days of printing to finish an
object.
Lastly, the extent to which this market grows will
depend on future ease of use, the adoption of the innovation beyond enthusiasts and hacker circles, and
many other business factors.

Box 3.1: Realizing the potential of 3D printing
depends on the development of complementary
products
A major factor influencing the wider application of 3D
printing is the development of complementary products,
namely raw materials and design software.
Early versions of 3D printers could only print plastic
materials, making it easy for traditional manufacturers to
dismiss the technology since its application was limited.22
But now, 3D printers can also print using ceramic materials, metal alloys, glass, paper, photopolymers and, to a
certain extent, living cells and food.
Until recently, the design software used to create digital
images for printing sufficed only for the application of rapid
prototyping in the engineering and industrial design fields
and the rapid manufacturing needs of certain industrial
manufacturers. Despite some improvement, it is still far
from being able to fully digitalize representation of images
as intricate as the human body and how it moves. Moreover,
printing advanced products such as a fully functioning
robot would require the development of more sophisticated
design software that could take into consideration factors
such as functionality in addition to object design.23
Further investment in these complementary products is
therefore required to facilitate the diffusion of this innovation across industrial sectors and across countries with
different income levels.

3.1.2 – The 3D printing
innovation ecosystem
Many factors and players have contributed to the
advance of 3D printing. Actors from the private and
public sectors, advances in complementary products that feed into 3D printing systems and growing
demand from both industry and private consumers
are some of the factors that have helped push this
innovation forward.

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

Describing the 3D printing
innovation landscape
Most of the patented 3D printing inventions are concentrated in the US, Germany, Japan and, more recently,
China.
Figure 3.2 shows the evolution of patent filings over the
years by applicants’ residence in the top six countries.
In the early 1980s, Japanese applicants were prolific in
filing for patents on their 3D printing inventions, but by
the 2000s they had been overtaken by US applications.
By 2010, Chinese applicants were filing for more 3D
printing applications – almost as many as the Japanese
and US applicants combined.

Figure 3.2: China, Germany, Japan and
the US account for roughly 80 percent
of all 3D printing patent filings

Universities are increasingly participating in this field –
albeit at a much lower share than firms. In fact, a couple
of the more important 3D printing processes originated
from MIT and the University of Texas System, particularly the University of Texas, Austin. To this day, these
two universities own considerable patent portfolios in
the field. However, these university patents are usually
licensed out to private firms for commercialization. For
example, the inkjet 3D printing technology developed
by MIT was licensed to several firms for their own application and commercialization.25
Figure 3.3: Firms file most 3D printing

In addition, most 3D printing patent applicants are firms
(see figure 3.3). This is not surprising given that many of
the early inventors in the field tend to establish their own
companies. Except for a handful of large players, these
firms tend to be small and medium-sized enterprises.24

Industrial 3D printing

Supporting development through
public and private initiatives

The industrial 3D printing market is mainly comprised
of small and medium enterprises, but two large system
manufacturers dominate the industry: Stratasys and 3D
Systems, both based in the US. These two firms were
among the few early movers in the market – introducing their own 3D printing processes, stereolithography
and fused deposition modeling, respectively – and they
are currently the top patent applicants in this industry,
as evidenced by the number of patents filed in table
3.3. Other important global players include Beijing
Tiertime of China, and EOS and Envisiontec, both
based in Germany.26

3D printing is a research-intensive industry. Several
rounds of improvements on early 3D printing processes
were required to develop a proper functioning process.27
This reliance on intensive R&D activities continues
today. Recently, a specialized 3D printing consulting
firm revealed that firms spent on average 19.1 percent
of their revenues in 2013 on R&D investments.28

26. However, Beijing Tiertime and Envisiontec do
not appear in the list of top 10 patent filers
in table 3.3. This reflects our search and
selection criteria based on the latest information
available (see also technical notes).

Various government initiatives have facilitated the development of 3D printing. In many instances these have
helped offset the risky R&D endeavor of investing in
this innovation. In the late 1980s, the Osaka Prefectural
Industrial Research Institute, a Japanese public research organization, licensed out its 3D printing invention to several Japanese companies to develop and
manufacture. These companies, including Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries and NTT Data Communication, continue to be significant participants in the industry to
this day.
More recently, large-scale government initiatives have
been established in the US, European Union and China,
to name a few. As well as general research funding
through various national science foundations in several
countries, there are also targeted 3D printing projects.
For example, both the US Department of Defense
and the US National Laboratories have been active
supporters of 3D printing research.29 Some of these
projects relate to energy, military and even outer space
applications.30 The EU set aside a total budget of EUR
225 million to fund 3D printing research for 2007-2013.
In China the government has made large strategic
investments in 3D printing technologies; these are
more important in advancing innovation than companydriven R&D.31 The heavy investment in 3D printing by
the Chinese government is reflected in the number
of patent applications filed by Chinese universities;
in some cases these filings exceed those of US and
European universities (see table 3.4 and figure 3.4).

30. The US Department of Energy’s ARPA-E has
recently funded a project to produce a 30 kW
induction motor using only 3D printing technologies
(Langnau, 2014, Oct. 6). NASA is investigating the
use of 3D printing technologies for the production of
replacement parts in outer space missions, and the
NASA Langley Research Center has been leading
a US government interagency 3D printing working
group since 2010 (Wohlers Associates, 2014).

Government initiatives also serve a second role – to
provide linkages between the different actors in the
ecosystem. Many of these initiatives bring together
researchers in academia and the private sector along
with manufacturers with the intention of diffusing the innovation throughout the economy. The US, for example,
has poured USD 50 million into a public-private partnership to bring 3D printing technologies into mainstream
manufacturing.32 This partnership brings together 50
companies, 28 universities and research labs and 16
other organizations. A similar initiative was recently announced by the Australian government that would bring
together 14 manufacturing firms, 16 local universities,
4 industry agencies, the Australian federal agency for
scientific research and the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser
Technology. One of the manufacturing firms involved
in the initiative is SLM Solutions GmbH, a German 3D
printing manufacturer.33
Moreover, there is also a push from the 3D printing
industry to facilitate the adoption of this innovation
into other industries. Efforts to standardize terms, processes, interfaces and manufacturing technologies are
currently underway in the US and Europe. One such
effort is the ASTM International Committee F42 on
Additive Manufacturing Technologies in the US, another
is the EU project Support Action for Standardization
in Additive Manufacturing (SASAM).

the “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation”

ASTM International – an international standards organization for materials, products, systems and services
– has also adopted a new standard file format for transferring information between design programs and 3D
printing systems. The new XML-based file format can
represent information about color, texture, material,
substructure and other properties of an object. In contrast, the de facto industry standard, STL, only enables
the representation of information about a surface mesh.

Personal 3D printing
Unlike the industrial 3D printing market, the personal 3D
printing market was created based on an infrastructure
that aims to keep the design and makeup of the innovation open to all by building on a collaborative and
sharing dynamic between innovators and users. This
has led to a distinct innovation ecosystem consisting
of open-source enthusiasts, hardware manufacturers,
software programmers, service providers, novel funding methods and user innovators.
Within this ecosystem, innovative advances can come
from consumers as well as the firms producing 3D
printers.34 Users can explore new applications for 3D
printers and the few that are sophisticated enough
may even be able to alter and improve upon existing
hardware and software. This user role in innovation
is an unusual feature of the ecosystem. RepRap, for
example, relies on roughly 25 core contributors and a
large support community to help advance the technology. Its contributors and community members include
enthusiasts, early adopters of emerging technologies,
hackers and academic researchers.35 And most of them
tend to be driven by personal needs, intrinsic motivation
and reputational goals rather than monetary gains.36
Moreover, the blurred distinction between producers
and users of personal 3D printing in originating innovation reinforces the importance of the community and
its linkages to the manufacturers. One important link
is through online platforms. In fact, the collaborative
nature of the personal 3D printing community might
not have been possible without advances in digital innovation.

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

In addition, specialized service providers that provide
support to the personal 3D printing community have
appeared. Some of these providers allow users to
share 3D design files through platforms like Thingiverse.
Others use centralized 3D printing services to print 3D
objects and have them shipped to the user, as in the
case of Shapeways. In 2012, Shapeways shipped one
million 3D-printed parts.38 And in 2014, the company
featured nearly 500,000 3D objects and 23,000 shop
owners and product designers from 133 different
countries.39
The proven success of this market is attracting established companies from related industries. Companies
such as Office Depot, Staples and UPS are currently
offering 3D printing services on a trial basis in a select
number of their stores.
And lastly, since innovators have refrained from using
patent protection to appropriate returns from most
of the technical advances in the personal 3D printing
market, new funding mechanisms were needed to
support the development in this area. Various personal
3D printing projects have benefited from crowdfunding
platforms such as Kickstarter. M3D raised USD 3.4
million, Formlabs USD 2.9 million and WobbleWorks
USD 2.3 million on Kickstarter for 3D printing-related
projects.40 Some of the crowdfunded projects may have
proven popular on Kickstarter because of the media
hype surrounding personal 3D printing technologies,
but they also demonstrate the ability of this community
to raise funds in novel ways.

3.1.3 – 3D printing and the IP system
A full 3D printing system will often touch upon various
IP rights: patent rights in 3D printing components, processes and raw printing material, trade secret protection of 3D printing manufacturing processes, copyright
protection of controlling software programs, design
protection of 3D object designs, copyright protection
of 3D object designs and trademark protection of the
3D printer product.

38. McKinsey Global Institute (2013).
39. Muzumdar (2014).
40. See www.kickstarter.com.

104

The combination of each of these IP rights has affected
the advancement of 3D printing innovation for both
the industrial and personal market segments, and is
likely to impact future innovation. It affects how early
innovators are able to appropriate returns on their R&D
investment as well as the diffusion of the innovation.

Enabling early developments
Early inventors of 3D printing technology seem to have
relied on the patent system to establish the novelty
of their invention, and to give them a foothold in the
market. Many of them started companies based on
their patented inventions, and later commercialized
them. Patents thus seem to have helped the inventors
secure their place in the market, and may have played
an important role in the development of the industry.
And while the industry has seen several mergers and
acquisitions, a few of the pioneering companies still
exist today.
Licensing also played an important role in diffusing
the 3D printing technologies from research institutes
to industries, among firms, even across continents.
Some licenses sought to promote commercialization
of the inventions, others to facilitate their use across
wider fields of industrial application.
How important patents may have been to prevent rivals
from imitating the technology is difficult to ascertain.
For one thing, 3D printing systems – both in the industrial and personal market segments – are relatively
difficult to reverse engineer.41 Even the raw materials,
which tend to be proprietary, are often produced by a
few specialized firms that control their supply, which
in turn may add to the cost of imitating any of these
printers.
Moreover, there have been many different 3D printing
technologies that use varying materials and processes
introduced since the first patent on 3D printing was
granted. Demand for each type of 3D printing technology varies according to the needs and types of
application. Therefore, they do not directly compete
with one another, and may not infringe on each other’s
proprietary technologies.

Nevertheless, there has been anecdotal evidence
suggesting that 3D printing companies are enforcing
their proprietary inventions in the industrial market
segment. These companies include some of the major
players in the market such as 3D Systems, DuPont,
EOS, Envisiontec and Stratasys.42
Figure 3.5 depicts the different jurisdictions in which
patent protection for a specific invention has been
sought. The US receives a significant portion of 3D
printing patent filings; over 60 percent of patents are
filed there. China and the rest of Europe also receive a
large share of patent filings, about 40-60 percent, while
middle-income countries such as Argentina, Brazil,
Malaysia and South Africa get less than 20 percent.
These figures suggest that patented 3D printing inventions are diffusing to middle-income countries, although
to a far lesser degree than the top four countries where
3D printing patents originate (China, Japan, Germany
and the US).
How does IP relate to the personal 3D printing market,
where the inventors tend to be driven by personal
needs, intrinsic motivation and reputational goals
rather than monetary gains? The short answer is that
IP is still relevant.
First, advances in personal 3D printing would not
have been possible without early developments in the
industrial market segment. Many of the technologies
used in personal 3D printing markets are proprietary
42. See Yen-Tzu and Hsin-Ning (2014).

technologies owned by companies operating in the
industrial segment. For example, RepRap and other
open-source 3D printing platforms are based on Scott
Crump’s fused deposition modeling technique; the
original patent expired in 2009. Another open-source
3D printer by the Fab@Home project is based on both
fused deposition modeling and Hull’s stereolithography
processes, for which both patents expired in 2004.
Expiry of these patents may be one of the reasons
why the personal 3D printing market took off. Second,
while the rise of open-source implementation of these
processes coincides with the expiry of related key
patents, future improvements on these inventions are
still protectable under various IP rights such as patents
and/or trade secrets. For example, MakerBot – founded
as an open-source personal 3D printing manufacturer
in 2009 – kept almost all of the design and make of its
Replicator 2 secret.43
Third, the open-source codes that users share rely on
copyright and its viral effect to facilitate this sharing by
keeping the software public.44
And finally, the design files created and uploaded by
individuals may be protected by copyright, and the 3D
printout’s aesthetic under industrial design, which the
individual may choose to protect and enforce.

Box 3.2: Restricting the use of the term “FDM” in the US
Fused deposition modelling, or FDM, is a technique invented by Scott Crump in the late 1980s. In 1989 Crump
was granted a patent on this process by the USPTO (US
Patent 5,121,329), and proceeded to commercialize the
process through Stratasys, a company he co-founded
with his wife, Lisa Crump.
About 15 years later, Adrian Bowyer started the open-source
RepRap project which would develop a self-replicating 3D
printer. This printer was built based on Crump’s proprietary
3D printing technique. Some argue that Bowyer chose this
process because it is relatively easy to build and satisfied
his ideals for an open-source, self-replicating 3D printer.
Others argued that it was timed to coincide with expiry
of the patent in 2009.45
Fast forward to today. Most open-source 3D printing
platforms are based on the RepRap source code and still
use Crump’s technique.
While the patent on this technique has expired, enabling
the manufacturers of these printers to enter the market
without having to negotiate a license with Stratasys or
face infringement risks, they may not refer to the printing
technique as “fused deposition modeling.” This is because
on January 28, 1991, Stratasys took out a trademark on
the term “FDM” (US trademark Serial Number 74133656),
thereby limiting its use by other manufacturers.46 Instead,
other manufacturers use the terms “fused filament fabrication,” “plastic jet printing,” or in general “thermoplastic
extrusion” to describe this particular 3D printing process.47

Rising tensions between the
two market segments
The distinction between the two market segments of
industrial versus personal 3D printing is gradually fading
as the personal segment of the market becomes more
commercially viable. For example, the industrial 3D
printing players are starting to pay more attention to the
personal market space. At the Consumer Electronics
Show held in January 2012, 3D Systems introduced
its version of the personal 3D printer, called the Cube.
Then, in June 2013, Stratasys released a press release
announcing a merger with MakerBot, one of the main
personal 3D printing companies.
Moreover, there are potential spillover benefits in the
industrial market when the personal segment thrives,
and vice versa.
45. See Freeman (2013).
46. The term “fused deposition modeling” is not
trademarked but Stratasys can rely on the
US common law trademark right whereby
the term is associated with the company,
thus precluding its use by others.
47. Banwatt (2013).

106

This tension is pronounced when business strategies
for the two market segments intersect, particularly
when the industrial players enter the personal market
space and the issue arises of open versus closed appropriability regimes.
The personal 3D printing ecosystem was built around
the open sharing philosophy, while its industrial counterparts relied – and continue to rely – on proprietary
knowledge and technologies to advance innovation.
Any further innovation in this area may involve opensource codes which may then be incorporated into
proprietary, closed, hardware.
There has been some negative feedback from the open
3D printing communities with regard to this tension.
And one way that the community has responded to
any effort to patent an invention that may have been
open-sourced is to participate in the debates concerning patent applications, for example through the
USPTO’s Peer to Patent initiative.48 But for now, it is
not clear how this will affect sharing within the personal
3D printing ecosystem.

Challenges to the IP system in the
personal 3D printing market
The personal 3D printing market segment raises new
challenges to the IP system, especially with regard
to how to enforce existing IP rights. Any person with
access to a 3D printer can print any object as long as
they have digital representations of that object. Thus,
exact replicas of designs that may be protected under
industrial design right or copyright may be easily reproduced and sold without the right holder’s permission.
This problem of infringement of an existing IP right is
compounded when multiple individuals participate in
producing and selling illegal copies for profit. Thus, personal 3D printing potentially raises issues of large-scale
infringement of existing IP rights by 3D printing users.
Underlying this challenge is the tension between what
is legal and what is enforceable in practice.

48. Clinic Staff (2013), Samuels (2013). On the
USPTO initiative, see Shapiro (2003).

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

Commercial nanoelectronics
Although many of the potential applications of carbon-based nanomaterial remain speculative, other
nanotechnology developments have already had a
significant market impact. Nanotechnology has led to
significant improvements in commercial electronics,
including improved transistors and magnetic memory.
For example, as of 2010 about 60 percent of the US
semiconductor market involved nanoscale features, for
a market value of about USD 90 billion.

Nanotechnology also has the potential to enhance
social welfare by addressing global sustainability
challenges. For example, there has been significant
progress in developing nanotechnology-based solutions for water treatment, desalination and reuse.
Nanotechnology researchers have improved food
safety and biosecurity, produced lightweight but strong
nanocomposites for building more fuel-efficient vehicles, created methods for separating carbon dioxide
from other gases, and dramatically improved the efficiency of plastic solar cells.

The steady shrinking of device size reflects the persistence of “Moore’s Law,” which describes the doubling
of the number of transistors on a chip every 18-24
months (see section 2.3). To shrink devices below 100
nanometers, researchers had to overcome significant
challenges. For example, they developed new materials
to provide necessary insulation of transistor gates from
leakage currents, and improved optical lithography
techniques to allow patterning of 30 nanometer features.
These advances depended on basic advances in nanofabrication and characterization, and continued scaling
is thought to require further fundamental advances,
perhaps involving carbon nanotubes or graphene.56

Quantifying the current economic contribution – let
alone the future economic growth potential – of all
developments in nanotechnology is challenging, if not
impossible. Aside from data availability constraints, it is
not clear how to assess the value of a nanotechnology
invention that is a small but fundamental component
of a product of process. For example, the size of
features in modern semiconductors is typically in the
nanoscale range, and the markets for semiconductors
and electronics as a whole are worth over USD 200
billion and USD 1 trillion, respectively.57 However, it is
unclear how much of these values should be attributed
to nanotechnology.

Nanotechnology’s economic contribution
and its growth potential

Another challenge is to decide which products and
services fall within the bounds of nanotechnology – as
pointed out at start of this section. Table 3.5 presents
different estimates of current nanotechnology-related
market size, illustrating how different definitions lead to
vastly different estimates. Nonetheless, one can glean
from these figures that nanotechnology has already left
some mark on economic activity.

Nanotechnology has already had an impact on a vast
range of technological fields. Some observers believe
that nanomanufacturing has the potential to transform
economies as profoundly as innovations such as electricity, computers and the Internet. There are potential
applications across a wide range of sectors, from
improved battery-powered vehicles to more targeted
medical therapies to nanotube-enhanced road paving
with remote sensing capabilities. In principle, given its
broad nature, nanotechnology has the potential to spur
growth through all the channels identified in section 1.2.

In which ecosystem does nanotechnology flourish? As
a first step, it is useful to look at the patent landscape
for nanotechnology. While not offering a perfect mirror of the innovation landscape, patent data provide
rich information about some of the key innovation actors – especially those involved in the development of
technology with commercial potential. To complement
this picture, the discussion will then describe some of
the main public support programs for nanotechnology
R&D, present information about the main R&D actors
and explore how knowledge flows through the nanotechnology innovation ecosystem.

Based on the patent mapping developed for this report,
figure 3.6 depicts the number of first patent filings
worldwide in the nanotechnology space from 1970 to
2011.58 First patent filings are the statistical measure
closest to the concept of unique inventions. The figure
illustrates the fast growth in nanotechnology patenting;
since 1995, patenting has grown by an average of 11.8
percent per year. The three areas of nanotechnology
innovation discussed in the previous subsection accounted for most of the patenting activity throughout
this period. Interestingly, though, patenting in those areas reached a peak in 2004 and other nanotechnology
applications have since seen rapid patenting growth.

58. The latest available data are for 2011, as patent
applications are only published with a delay. See the
technical notes to this report for a description of the
methodology used to map nanotechnology patents.

Figure 3.7 shows the same patent filings as figure 3.6,
but offers a breakdown by origin of the patent applicant.
It shows increasing geographical diversity. Up to the
late 1990s, US and Japanese residents accounted for
most nanotechnology patent filings, but since then
other origins have gained in importance. Particularly
noteworthy is the rise of patenting from the Republic
of Korea in the early 2000s and, even more recently,
from China. Interestingly, while innovators from the
Republic of Korea have filed patents for nanomaterials
and nanoelectronics, those from China have focused
almost entirely on nanotechnology applications outside
the three areas discussed in the previous subsection.59
Since the mid-2000s, US and Japanese patenting activity in nanotechnology has not only declined relative to
other origins, but also fallen in absolute terms.

59. In particular, 69 percent of nanotechnology
patents of Chinese origin filed between 1995 and
2011 fall into the “other” category, compared
with 37 percent for Japan, 44 percent for the
Republic of Korea and 38 percent for the US.

Figure 3.8 offers a full global overview of nanotechnology patenting activity. In addition to the countries mentioned above, several other middle-income countries
– notably Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa – show
some level of patenting, even if overall numbers are
substantially below those of the main patenting origins.
Finally, it is interesting to ask how important academic
patenting is in the nanotechnology field. Figure 3.9
depicts the contribution of different applicant types
to overall patenting since 1970. Reflecting nanotechnology’s scientific origins, one might have expected
the share of company patents to increase over time.
However, the opposite is the case. The share of academic patenting rose from 8.6 percent in 1980 to 16.1
percent in 2000, and reached 40.5 percent in 2011 – the
highest academic patenting share among the breakthrough innovations discussed in this report. However,
there are marked differences across origins. While
rising in most countries, the share of academic patenting has averaged 8.2 percent for Japanese applicants,
19.3 percent for German applicants, 26.9 percent for
US applicants, 35.6 percent for Korean applicants
and 73.0 percent for Chinese applicants.60 Indeed, the
dominance of academic applicants in Chinese patent
filings largely explains the marked increase in the global
academic patenting share since the mid-2000s (see
figure 3.9). It may also explain the different technological focus of Chinese filings discussed above.
60. These shares refer to all first patent
filings between 1990 and 2011.

112

Governments support innovation in nanotechnology
through a variety of mechanisms, including direct R&D
spending using grants and procurement contracts,
innovation prizes and R&D tax incentives. Quantifying
the importance of these mechanisms is not straightforward. Available data sources often do not report
the nanotechnology-specific portion of public support
programs, especially for technology-neutral programs
such as R&D tax credits. Varying definitions of nanotechnology and the fact that some programs operate
at the state level further complicate the quantification
task. Bearing these limitations in mind, available data
point to the following:
• Most nanotechnology-specific public support has
come in the form of direct grants, both for basic
research and for early-stage commercialization.
Over 60 countries created national nanotechnology R&D programs between 2001 and 2004. The
first and largest such program is the US National
Nanotechnology Initiative, which has provided
nearly USD 20 billion in support since 2000 through
different federal agencies.61
• Estimates suggest that global government spending on nanotechnology R&D reached USD 7.9 billion
in 2012, led by the US and the EU with about USD
2.1 billion in spending each.62 Next were Japan with
USD 1.3 billion, Russia with USD 974 million and
China and the Republic of Korea with just under
USD 500 million each. Other middle-income countries seeing substantial government spending on
nanotechnology include Brazil and India.
• R&D tax incentives are more difficult to estimate
but no less important, as tens of billions of USD
are spent each year on such incentives worldwide – from which nanotechnology R&D is bound
to benefit.63
• Innovation prizes are not a major policy tool in the
nanotechnology space. However, there are private
non-profit prizes and proposals for a federal nanotechnology prize in the US.64

Commission. See Lux Research Inc. (2014).

Nanotechnology R&D actors
The nanotechnology innovation ecosystem comprises
diverse actors, including government laboratories,
universities and other nonprofit research institutions,
large businesses and small start-ups. There are also
venture capitalists and other intermediaries that have
emerged to help facilitate capital and knowledge flows
among these actors.

As described above, governments themselves are
critical actors in the nanotechnology ecosystem. They
perform a significant amount of R&D through national
laboratories and state-supported universities. Private
universities and other nonprofit research institutes are
also major players, typically operating through government grants. Because much university research is published, one way to identify the leading nanotechnology
research organizations is to look at total publications.
Table 3.6 does so, relying on publication counts in Web
of Science – one of the most comprehensive databases
indexing scientific publications.65 For comparison
purposes, it also presents the number of patents first
filed by those organizations. The institutions with the
largest number of nanotechnology publications are
the Chinese and Russian Academies of Sciences, the
Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France,
and three Japanese universities. All top-20 scientific
institutions also file patents for nanotechnology inventions. However, publication and patenting outputs do
not show a clear correlation – likely reflecting differences in institutional strategies and patenting policies.

65. The methodologies for mapping nanotechnology
publications and patents differ (see Chen et al
(2013), and technical notes). However, the two
metrics should still be broadly comparable.

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

Linkages and knowledge flows
What mechanisms link the various nanotechnology innovation actors, and how does knowledge flow among
them? Formal license agreements are important, but
a substantial amount of transfer occurs through more
informal channels. One study on the US nanotechnology industry concluded that “[t]he most widespread
mechanism for technology transfer is publications
and presentations of technical findings at conferences, workshops, tutorials, webinars, and the like.”68
Professional and academic societies play an important
role in facilitating these interactions.
Nanotechnology innovation sometimes follows an orderly progression from academic research to corporate
development to a marketed product, but “nonlinear”
paths are also common. VC can be a bridge between
academia and industry, but global VC investment in
nanotechnology was only USD 580 million in 2012,
which is just three percent of the overall funding of
USD 7.9 billion from governments plus USD 10 billion
from corporations.69 In other words, governments and
cash-rich firms play a more critical role in facilitating
nanotechnology development.
One important way in which governments facilitate
technology transfer is by supplying essential nanotechnology infrastructure that a variety of actors can
use. Nanotechnology R&D tends to be highly capital
intensive, with research often requiring clean rooms
that house expensive fabrication and measurement
tools such as the specialized microscopes described in
subsection 3.2.1. For example, the US National Science
Foundation has funded 14 facilities at US universities,
making up the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure
Network.70 Members of the network have provided support for nanoscale fabrication and characterization for
all qualified users, including corporations.

69. See Lux Research Inc. (2014).
70. See www.nnin.org/about-us, which will be
replaced by the National Nanotechnology
Coordinated Infrastructure.

Governments also use direct grants to help transfer
technologies from academia to industry, funding business startups that seek to commercialize nanotechnology. Relevant programs exist, for example, in the US,
Germany, France and China.71 This direct funding helps
mitigate the market entry risk of new business ventures
and improves their commercial viability.
Large companies, in turn, have been active in helping
commercialize nanotechnology products, including by
funding academic research and by collaborating with
smaller firms. One study of global nanotechnology innovation concluded that in general, “[l]arge firms play
a fundamental role in co-producing and transferring
knowledge in nanotechnology by acting as a node
of high centrality directly linking the industry’s copatenting network with public research.”72
Different sets of channels exist for knowledge flows
between countries, including for the diffusion of nanotechnology to low- and middle-income countries.
Nanotechnology applications of particular interest to
poorer economies include energy storage, agricultural
productivity enhancements, water treatment and health
technologies. Some 60 countries are active in nanotechnology R&D and a diverse set of countries have
hosted and participated in nanotechnology conferences. International diffusion occurs through formal
collaboration agreements, such as the International
Center for Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials
consortium involving US and Mexican universities.
Nanotechnology also diffuses through skilled migration.
For example, nanoscientists in the US are overwhelmingly foreign born, and countries such as China and
India have pursued “reverse brain drain” policies to
spur the return migration of their nationals. The role
of FDI in facilitating nanotechnology diffusion is less
clear. For example, one study found that while China
has been a popular destination for FDI in general,
provinces with greater FDI do not appear to generate
more nanotechnology patents; rather, nanotechnology
development in China seems to be driven by publicsector investment.73

3.2.3 – Nanotechnology
and the IP system

The strategic use of patents also has an important bearing on the extent to which nanotechnology innovators
seek patent protection beyond their home markets.

Finally, it offers a brief perspective on the role of trade Except for China, Turkey and several Eastern European
secrets in nanotechnology innovation.74
countries, the destination share of low- and middleincome countries lies below 5 percent.76

Patenting strategies
As described in Chapter 1, the importance of patents in
appropriating returns on R&D investment varies across
sectors. In some sectors – notably pharmaceuticals
and chemicals – patents play a central role in giving
companies a competitive edge. In others – notably
many ICT industries – lead time, branding and other
mechanisms are crucial. While patents may still play an
important appropriation role in such sectors – at least
for certain key technologies – companies file patents
partly to ensure their freedom to operate and to license
their technologies to others.
No evidence is available to shed light on the role of
patents in appropriating R&D investment specifically
related to nanotechnology. However, given the crosscutting nature of nanotechnology innovation, it is likely
that no general pattern exists, with the role of patents
depending on the sector of application. For example,
nanotechnology patents relating to biotechnology and
chemistry may well play a more important appropriation
role than nanoelectronics patents.

74. Trademarks are important for protecting an
innovator’s first-mover advantage and there are
questions about whether the use of “nano” as a prefix
should be regulated under trademark deceptiveness
doctrines. In addition, creative nanoscale art
may raise questions of copyright law. However,
these IP forms are not further discussed here.

116

Several suggestive conclusions emerge from the global
patent landscape. First, even though many nanotechnology applications have global reach, innovators
mainly seek patent protection in a limited number of
high-income countries. On the one hand, this indicates
that companies have other means of appropriating
R&D investment, as described above. On the other
hand, it suggests that innovators do not see a big risk
of their technology being imitated in countries with
more limited technological capacity. Second, from the
viewpoint of most low- and middle-income countries,
patent ownership is unlikely to pose a major barrier
to technology dissemination.77 At the same time, the
limited interest in patenting indicates that there may be
other obstacles to greater adoption of nanotechnologies in those countries.

75. This figure refers to nanotechnology
patents filed since 1995.
76. The relatively high destination shares of Turkey
and Eastern European countries – which are all
members of the European Patent Convention
(EPC) – likely reflects patent applications at the
EPO, many of which are unlikely to result in a
national validation in the countries in question.
77. Two caveats are in order here. First, while overall
destination shares are low, it could be that applicants
seek protection for the most commercially
important patents in low- and middle-income
countries. Second, the PATSTAT database
underlying figure 3.10 does not cover all low- and
middle-income countries, thus underestimating
the destination share of those countries.

Disclosure through patents
Although disclosure has been a central feature of the
patent system since its inception, evidence on how it
contributes to knowledge dissemination and followon innovation is limited. In fact, some scholars doubt
that scientists read patents, which are often seen as
legalistic documents written by lawyers. However, a
study surveying nanotechnology researchers found
that a substantial number of them do find useful technical information in patents.78 Out of 211 researchers
– primarily located in the US – 64 percent reported
that they have read patents, and 60 percent of those
reading patents for scientific rather than legal reasons
said they found useful technical information in them.
Respondents reported that patents can show “how a
particular device works”; they can “put the ideas and
research in context and offer […] some plausible views
as to” the respondents’ own research; and they can
keep researchers “from going down a road that has
already been traveled.”

While this survey points to the value of patent disclosures, it also shows that the disclosure function of
patents could be improved. In particular, 36 percent of
respondents have never read patents, and 40 percent
of those reading for technical information did not find
anything useful. The four main complaints were that
patents are confusingly written; that they are unreliable
since, unlike scientific journal articles, they do not face
critical review; that they duplicate journal articles; and
that they are out of date. In addition, 62 percent of patent readers thought the patent they read did not provide
sufficient disclosure for a nanotechnology researcher
to recreate the invention without additional information.
Accordingly, the study makes several recommendations to improve the disclosure function of nanotechnology patents: existing disclosure requirements should
be more strictly enforced; patents should be published
earlier – especially for patentees that have little need
for secrecy; access to the patent literature should be
improved through search and annotation tools; and
incentives to cite patents in scientific publications
should be created.

CHAPTER 3

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

Cumulative innovation and patent thickets

Scope of patentability

Like most innovative activity, nanotechnology innovation is cumulative in nature, with new inventions typically
building on past ones. This raises the question whether
patent rights may slow or even forestall cumulative
innovation – a concern raised for a number of other
technologies.79

New technologies often raise questions about what
type of inventive claims should qualify for patent protection. International law generally requires patents
to be available on “any inventions […] in all fields of
technology”.85 However, it allows exceptions that might
cover some nanotechnology inventions, including for
medical diagnostic methods and for inventions that
could endanger health or the environment. Additionally,
some countries have introduced certain limits that
may exclude certain nanotechnology developments
from patentability.

One legal study of nanotechnology patenting argues
that nanotechnology differs from many other important
fields of invention over the past century in that many of
the foundational inventions have been patented at the
outset.80 Other commentators have raised concerns
about the potential existence of nanotechnology patent thickets.81 To the extent that patent landscapes are
overly fragmented and overlapping, they may impede
innovation as the transaction costs of bargaining rise
and the risk of holdup effects increases. One study
attributes overlapping patent rights to patent offices
struggling to deal with this new interdisciplinary technology, which does not fit neatly into existing patent
classification systems.82 However, despite these concerns and the fast growth of patenting since the 1990s
(see figure 3.6), there is little evidence of actual patent
thicket problems so far. This may be because the
nanotechnology products market remains too young
for such problems to surface, or it may be a sign that
nanotechnology licensing markets have been more
efficient than predicted.83
In addition, while there has been some nanotechnology patent litigation in key jurisdictions such as the
US, nothing stands out about nanotechnology patent
litigation as compared with patent litigation more
generally. Similarly, evidence suggests that nanotechnology patenting may have problems such as slow
time to grant and large numbers of difficult-to-search
applications, but these are problems affecting the
patent system as a whole, not problems specific to
nanotechnology patenting.84

79. See WIPO (2011) for a more in-depth discussion of
how patents affect cumulative innovation processes.
80. See Lemley (2005). He argues that airplanes
(between 1903 and 1917) and the radio (between
1912 and 1929) were the last emerging technologies
for which the basic ideas were patented.

(2007) and Sylvester and Bowman (2011).

Importantly, the US Supreme Court has recently decided that any “product of nature” such as genomic
DNA as well as any “law of nature” such as a method
for calibrating the proper dosage of a drug may be
excluded from patentability.86 These decisions raise
questions about the validity of many nanotechnology
patents in the US.87 Many nanomaterials exist in nature;
for example, carbon-based nanoparticles are produced
by common candle flames, and graphene is produced
simply by writing with a pencil. There do not appear
to have been any challenges yet to nanotechnology
patents in light of the Supreme Court’s decision, but
this could become a concern for patentees.
Other scholars have raised questions about the lack
of novelty of certain nanotechnology inventions in
relation to the prior art and about a lack of inventive
step if inventions merely change the size of existing
technologies.88 However, there is no evidence that
these concerns have become a significant barrier to
patentability in practice.

of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

Trade secrets
Because many nanotechnology inventions are difficult
to reverse engineer, innovators may prefer to keep them
secret rather than apply for a patent. Indeed, evidence
suggests that nanotechnology process innovations are
particularly likely to be protected by trade secrets.89
In addition, among nanomaterials producers, those
focused on ceramic nanomaterials, nanostructured
metals and catalysts are more likely to rely on trade
secrets. Accordingly, just looking at nanotechnology
patents gives an incomplete and possibly biased picture of the nanotechnology landscape.
As shown in figure 3.9, much nanotechnology research
takes place at universities, which have little incentive
to keep their inventions secret. However, for many
companies, trade secrets are an important strategy to
appropriate R&D investment. Significant trade secret
litigation in the US suggests that this form of IP protection is important. For example, in 2000 Nanogen sued
a former employee for trade secret misappropriation,
arguing that the patent applications he had filed on
nanotechnology biochips disclosed trade secrets
owned by Nanogen. The settlement payment amounted
to an estimated USD 11 million. In another case, Agilent
Technologies was awarded damages of USD 4.5 million
after suing former employees for misappropriation of
trade secrets related to liquid chromatography using
nanoscale particles.90
As in other areas of innovation, trade secret policy must
balance providing incentives to companies to invest
in R&D with not overly restricting the dissemination
of technological knowledge. One key question in this
context is to what degree employees of innovating
companies can carry their knowledge to competitors.
As argued in subsection 3.2.2, labor mobility may
be one important vehicle through which specialized
knowledge associated with nanotechnology innovation disseminates throughout the economy. However,
this is again not a nanotechnology-specific concern.
As this section has explained, the nanotechnology
innovation ecosystem is in many ways a microcosm
of the full innovation ecosystem, and the role of the IP
system with regard to nanotechnology appears similar
to its role in general.

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

3.3 – Robotics
“At bottom, robotics is about us. It is the discipline
of emulating our lives, of wondering how we work.”
Rod Grupen,
Director of the Laboratory for Perceptual
Robotics, University of Massachusetts Amherst
Robotics is the field of technology which drives the development of robots for application in areas as diverse
as car factories, construction sites, schools, hospitals
and private homes. Industrial robot arms have been in
use for industrial automation in automotive and other
manufacturing businesses for more than three or four
decades. But various strands of existing and newer
research fields, such as AI and sensing, have been
combined in more recent years to produce autonomous
“advanced” robots with more widespread potential use
across the economy and society. 91

3.3.1 – The development of robotics
and its economic importance

The history of robotics: robotic arms
for industrial automation
Robots, in their most basic form, are not new. The
history of robotics started in ancient Greek with automatons, essentially non-electronic moving machines
which displayed moving objects. The invention of
simple automatons continually evolved henceforth, but
robots in their current form took off with the process of
industrialization, to perform repetitive tasks.
In the more recent history of industrial robots, a few
key inventions in two areas stand out as having led to
the first incarnation of robots for industrial automation.93
First, control systems allowing humans or computers to
control and steer robots from a distance, and second,
mechanical manipulation systems such as robotic arms
or legs to move or grab objects.
With regard to remote control systems, the 1898 invention of a remote-controlled boat which was patented
and demonstrated to the public in a park in New York
proved central.94

As for mechanical manipulation systems, the first industrial robot was developed in 1937 in the form of a small
crane. The development of robotic legs and arms was
furthered by W.G. Walter, who built the first autonomous
robot in the late 1940s.95 The breakthrough enabling
the development of the robotics industry, however,
was when George Devol invented and patented the
first automatically operated programmable robotic
arm in the mid-1950s.96 Devol then partnered with

for instance, was developed at the Case Institute of
Technology, Case Western Reserve University, US. In
1969, researchers at Stanford University invented the
so-called Programmable Universal Manipulation Arm,
Encyclopedia Britannica defines a robot as “any automatically operated machine that replaces human
effort.” According to the International Federation of
Robotics (IFR), “[a] robot is an actuated mechanism
programmable in two or more axes with a degree of
autonomy, moving within its environment, to perform
intended tasks”.92

allowing for more sophisticated control for assembly
and automation.98 One of these researchers, Victor
Scheinman, started Vicarm Inc. to manufacture the
arm, which proved fundamental to the development of
the robotics industry; he ultimately sold the company
to Unimation in 1977.
Largely based on the work of the aforementioned
inventors and firms, the first commercial robots were
deployed on General Motors’ assembly lines in the USA
in 1961.99 The first industrial robot in Europe, a Unimate,
was installed in Sweden in 1967. In 1969, the company
Trallfa of Norway offered the first commercial painting
robot. In 1973, ABB Robotics and KUKA Robotics
brought their first robots to market. Since then, the
functionality and control of robotic mechanical parts
have been continually improved by the robotics industry.
Approximately a decade after Devol filed his patent,
Japanese companies began to develop and produce
their own robots pursuant to a license agreement
with Unimation. By 1970, robotic manufacturing had
proliferated throughout the automotive industry in
the US and Japan. By the late 1980s, Japan – led by
the robotics divisions of Fanuc, Matsushita Electric
Industrial Company, Mitsubishi Group and Honda Motor
Company – was the world leader in the manufacture
and use of industrial robots.
Parallel key inventions in the area of packaging robots
– for instance, the Delta packaging robot developed at
the Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne, yielding 28 patents – modernized the packaging industry.

Toward autonomous systems built on
artificial intelligence and connectivity
In the journey toward more capable robots, researchers have since worked on increasing autonomy and
improving interaction between humans and robots.
New materials and innovations in various fields outside
the robotics area such as artificial intelligence (AI),
mechatronics, navigation, sensing, object recognition
and information processing are the core technological
developments furthering robotics today.100 The research
has become more interdisciplinary.
In particular, innovation in software and AI will be key
technologies for next-generation robots. This matters
to help robots maneuver and circumvent obstacles.
The seminal breakthrough in developing algorithms
instrumental for robotic path planning took place in
the mid-1980s.101 Algorithms are increasingly central to how robots take more complex decisions, for
instance, how home or service robots simulate emotions. Researchers are currently working on software
that will mimic the human brain, honing language and
decision-making skills.
Based on improved connectivity, sensors and processing power, robots are becoming increasingly
data-driven, and linked over more intelligent networks.
As such, innovation is increasingly about software
and hardware integration and thus the delivery of socalled integrated robotic and intelligent operational
systems. On the application level, the development of
autonomous vehicles and drones is seen as an extension of robotics.

University in Japan laid the foundation for follow-on The economic contribution of robotics

impact on how manufacturing takes place. Since the
start of industrial automation in the 1970s, the uptake
of robots in manufacturing has increased significantly.
The industrial robot market was estimated to be worth
USD 29 billion in 2014, including the cost of software,
peripherals and systems engineering (see table 3.8).

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

A novel robotics field is the production and use of
service robots in areas outside of manufacturing. This
category includes robots intended for “professional
use” in agriculture, mining, transport – including the
large field of unmanned aerial and land vehicles, space
and sea exploration, unmanned surveillance - health,
education and other fields.103
The total number of professional service robots reached
USD 3.6 billion in 2014, projected to lead the growth of
upcoming robotic use.104 The largest markets are Japan,
the Republic of Korea, the US and Europe. The sectors leading their use are defense, logistics and health.
Surgical robot device markets, at USD 3.2 billion in
2014, are anticipated to reach USD 20 billion by 2021.105
In addition, robotics in personal and domestic applications, another novel robotics field, has experienced
strong global growth with relatively few mass-market
products, for example floor-cleaning robots, mowers,
robots for education and assistive robots for the elderly.106 With small to non-existent sales volumes even in
2012 and 2013, the sale of these robot types took off
exponentially in 2014 and onwards.
A few consultancy reports have emphasized the wide
range of savings generated through advanced robotics
in healthcare, manufacturing and services, producing
high estimates of the benefits to economic growth.107
But quantifying the productivity-enhancing contribution
of robots in definite terms is challenging.
Robots can increase labor productivity, reduce production cost and improve product quality. In the service sector
in particular, robots can also enable entirely new business
models. Service robots provide assistance to disabled
people, mow lawns, but are also increasingly deployed
in service industries such as restaurants or hospitals.
In terms of welfare, robots help humans to avoid strenuous or dangerous work. They also have the potential to
contribute solutions to social challenges such as caring
for the aging population or achieving environmentally
friendly transportation.

104. IFR (2014b).
105. Wintergreen Research Inc. (2015).
106. IFR (2014b).
107. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that the
application of advanced robotics could generate
a potential economic boost of USD 1.7 trillion to
USD 4.5 trillion a year by 2025, including more
than up to USD 2.6 trillion in value from healthcare
uses (McKinsey Global Institute, 2013).

In part, the economic gains of robots are directly
linked to substituting – and thus automating – part of
the currently employed workforce.108 On the one hand,
more productive labor helps keep manufacturing firms
competitive, avoiding their relocation abroad and creating higher-wage jobs. On the other hand, the use of
robots is certain to eliminate both low-skilled but also
some types of higher-skilled jobs hitherto unaffected
by automation. On balance, the employment effect of
robotics is currently uncertain, however.
In terms of overall economic benefits, another question
is whether robotic innovation has diffused to low- and
middle-income countries already with meaningful
impacts. The installed base of robots outside a few
high-income economies and a few exceptions such
as China is still limited, including in countries such as
Brazil or India, but in particular also in less developed
economies. It is expected, though, that firms involved
in manufacturing and assembly activities for global
or local supply chains will need to upgrade their use
of robots, including some in middle-income or even
low-income economies that have so far competed on
cheap labor alone. Robots are also gaining ground
in low-income countries to address quality issues in
local manufacturing.

3.3.2 – The robotics
innovation ecosystem
As it evolves from the era of industrial automation to
the use of advanced robotics across the economy,
the present-day robotics innovation system can be
characterized by a few key traits.

Concentration in key countries and narrow
robotics clusters with strong linkages
Robotics innovation mainly takes place within a few
countries and clusters.109 These clusters thrive on the
interface between public and private research, with
firms commercializing the resulting innovation.

CHAPTER 3

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

An analysis of robotics company databases shows that
robotics clusters are mainly located in the US, Europe
– in particular Germany, France and to some extent the
UK – and Japan, but increasingly also in the Republic
of Korea and China.110 Relative to GDP or population size, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Israel, the
Netherlands, Norway, the Russian Federation, Spain,
the UK, Sweden and Switzerland stand out as economies with a big presence of innovative robotics firms.
This picture of inventive activity concentrated in a few
nations, also now broadening to include Asian innovative nations, is also mirrored by patent data. Figure 3.12
depicts the number of first patent filings worldwide in
the robotics space between 1960 and 2012. It shows
the importance of US and European and later Japanese
inventors at the outset, the emergence of the Republic
of Korea in the early 2000s and more recently China.111
While the share of Chinese patents in total robotics
patents in 2000 was only one percent, that figure had
risen to 25 percent by 2011. The Republic of Korea’s
share stood at 16 percent in 2011. Japan’s share fell
from 56 percent in 2000 to 21 percent in 2011.
Within these few countries, robotics clusters are concentrated around specific cities or regions – and often
around top universities in the field. For example, in the
US, Boston, Silicon Valley and Pittsburgh are generally
regarded as the three main robotics clusters. In Europe,
the Île-de France region in France (particularly for
civil drones), Munich in Germany, Odense in Denmark,
Zurich in Switzerland and Robotdalen in Sweden are
prominent, among others. In Asia, Bucheon in Korea,
Osaka and Nagoya in Japan and Shanghai and Liaoning
Province in China are key robotics clusters.
Some companies that excel in robotics innovation
are located outside these clusters. They are usually
established large companies in the automotive sector,
or increasingly also Internet companies, that are wellestablished in their own field. They have the financial
means and the skills to hire robotics experts and to
use knowledge developed elsewhere, also often by
acquiring newer firms.

patents and France with over 1,500. Other countries
such as Australia, Brazil, a number of Eastern European
countries, the Russian Federation and South Africa
also show newer robotics patenting activity, although
on a low level.
Indeed, in terms of robotics innovation and company
startups, the majority of activity is in high-income
countries, except for China again. China has seen a
strong surge of robotics patents and hosts some of
the fastest-growing robotics companies such as DJI
(Drone Company), and new industrial robot manufacturers such as Siasun and Estun which are driving down
the cost of robots.

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

The substantial role of government in
orchestrating and funding innovation
Governments and their institutions have played a large
role in supporting robotics innovation. The standard set
of technology-neutral government innovation policies
has strongly supported robotics innovation, in particular
through supply-side policies taking the form of research
funding or support for business R&D.
Beyond important research funding and standard
innovation support measures, a few specific support
measures deserve mention:
Creation of special research institutions or research networks: Examples include the Swiss
National Centre of Competence in Research Robotics,
which federated research labs, and the Korea Robot
Industry Promotion Institute, set up to promote technology transfer.

Regulations and standards: Finally, regulations
created by governments, in the form of standards,
testing and security regulations, impact the diffusion
of robotics technology.
In addition to the above, many high-income countries
and China have announced special robotics action
plans in recent years (see table 3.9). Mostly, these plans
announce specific monetary investments in support of
robotics research and innovation, including improving
robotics education and technology transfer.

The increasing role of patents; their valuable
function and potential challenges
Two forms of IP protection play a particularly important
role in helping firms appropriate return on their investments in R&D: patents and to a lesser extent industrial
designs protecting the ornamental features of a robot.
Key robotics inventions were frequently patented by
their original – often academic – inventor, who often
also started a corresponding company or actively
transferred the IP to existing manufacturing firms.
As a result, robotics patents increased strongly in the
late 1980s, as broad-based automation of factories
flourished and robotics research was ramped up (see
figure 3.12). Then, after relatively flat patenting activity
between the 1980s and 2000, the shift to more advanced robotics has given another boost to robotics
patenting which continues to this day.

Automotive and electronics companies are still the largest filers of patents relating to robotics (see table 3.10),
but new actors are emerging from different countries
and sectors such as medical technologies. These firms’
robotics patent portfolios are growing in size, as firms
grow them organically or purchase companies with a
stock of granted patents.

It is challenging to understand the various factors
leading firms in the field of robotics to file for patents,
given the current evidence base. No large-scale survey
of robotics firms or other solid quantitative work exists that would shed light on this question. Providing
a definitive answer on the impacts of robotics patents
on follow-on innovation via disclosure, licensing and
IP-based collaboration is also difficult.

It is also hard to argue that patent protection is preventing market entry or restricting robotics innovation
more generally by limiting access to technology. The
available evidence shows little or no litigation occurring
in the field of robotics. Indeed, most of the disputes
over robotics IP in the past 10 years have involved just
one company, iRobot.116

The importance of particular patents for robotics innovation is hard to verify too. Currently, no patents have
been flagged as standard-essential; no known patent

in particular, patents are a tool to seek investment or a
means of protecting their IP assets defensively against
other, often larger, companies.
However, a number of findings emerge from the views
of industry experts, including both lawyers and roboticists.114

In terms of the impacts of the patent system on innovation, at present the innovation system appears relatively
fertile.115 Collaboration – including university–industry
interaction – is strong, and there is extensive crossfertilization of research. Patents seemingly help support
the specialization of firms, which is important for the
evolution of the robotics innovation system.

Robotics platforms and the coexistence
of IP and open source
As described in section 3.3.2, robotics platforms used
in universities and businesses are increasingly central
to robotics innovation. Increasingly, too, they are open
platforms, often based on open-source software such
as the Robot Operation System (ROS). These opensource robotics platforms invite third parties to use
and/or improve existing content without the formal
negotiation or registration of IP rights. Instead, software
or designs are distributed under Creative Commons
or GNU General Public License, a free software license. This allows for rapid prototyping and flexible
experimentation.

CHAPTER 3

The idea is simple. Actors distinguish between two
levels of innovation. On the one hand, there is the collaborative development of robotics software, platforms
and innovation. Such innovation may be substantial,
but it is essentially precompetitive because the fields
of use are relatively basic and do not serve to differentiate products. Actors therefore apply cooperative
open-source approaches to obtain common robotics
platforms, as this allows them to share the substantial
up-front investment, avoid duplication of effort and
perfect existing approaches.

In general, it will be interesting to see how well the
robotics innovation system can preserve its current

aspects of IP where the commercial stakes are higher

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

The role of being first-to-market,
reputation and strong brands
Being first to market, a strong after-sales service, reputation and brand have all been critical in past robotics
innovation, and they remain so today – all the more so
as the industry moves out of factories and into applications with direct consumer contact.
In the case of industrial automation, only a few trusted
operators able to produce a large number of reliable
robots and to service them dependably were in demand by automotive companies. Initially, Unimation
dominated the supply of industrial robots; later, large
firms such as Fanuc held sway.

Furthermore, the source code and software that run
a robot will often be protected by copyright. Indeed,
the most common example where robotics companies
seek copyright protection is for software code that is
believed to be unique and original. In practice, robotics companies typically use copyright enforcement to
prevent others from copying, or simply accessing, their
computer code.128 Aside from disputes among companies, and despite the fact that national legislation often
provides for reverse engineering exceptions, copyright
legislation has also been invoked when an amateur
scientist decrypts and changes software code.129

3.4 – Lessons learned
The case studies of 3D printing, nanotechnology and
robotics offer diverse insights into the nature and
ecosystem of three current innovations with breakthrough potential. As in chapter 2, many of the insights
are specific to the technologies at hand, cautioning
against drawing general conclusions. Nonetheless, it is
worthwhile pointing to commonalities and differences
between the three cases, which this final section seeks
to do. It follows the structure of the cases studies, first
focusing on the innovations’ growth contribution, then
on their ecosystems and finally on the role of IP.

Growth contribution
The three innovations discussed in this chapter have
already left a mark on economic activity. Industrial
robots started to automatize certain manufacturing
activities long ago and nanotechnology already features in numerous electronic devices. How large is
the potential for these two technologies as well as 3D
printing to drive future growth?
There would seem to be substantial scope for these
innovations to improve productivity in manufacturing.
However, given the relatively small size of the manufacturing sector in most economies (see section 1.1), the
resulting overall economic growth contribution may well
be small. A more substantial growth effect may stem
from new products resulting from these innovations that
find application throughout the economy – especially
in the service sector. In addition, as the case studies
demonstrated, the growing use of 3D printers and intelligent robots may prompt the reorganization of supply
chains, possibly with important efficiency gains. History
suggests that various forms of complementary innovation, new business models and the development of new
skills would all be required to realize the implied growth
potential. In addition, the diffusion of these innovations
will depend on the competitive dynamics, access to
finance, standard-setting and technical regulations,
among other determinants.

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

As described in section 1.5, some economists worry
that today’s new technologies do not generate a large
demand for new investment – possibly contributing to
the low interest rate environment in many advanced
economies. Worries have most commonly been expressed in relation to ICTs, and it is difficult to assess
how 3D printing, nanotechnology and robotics fare in
this respect.131 One could argue that none of these three
technologies requires new capital-intensive infrastructure comparable to earlier GPTs such as the railway,
cars, electricity, or telecommunications. However,
much will depend on the shape, capability and range
of use of the innovations. New powerful technologies
that find wide application throughout the economy may
well generate significant investment demand, including
demand for intangible capital.
Much uncertainty also exists as to how the three technologies will disseminate to developing economies. To
the extent that technologies such as 3D printing and robotics generate savings by reducing labor inputs, there
may be less of an incentive to adopt them in economies
in which labor costs are still relatively low. However,
such incentives are bound to differ across industries
and countries, and depending on how capital-intensive
new technologies turn out to be. In addition, certain
applications of the three innovations may well address
special needs of developing economies. For example,
3D printers may have special uses in remote areas
cut off from traditional distribution channels. Similarly,
nanotechnology holds promise in improving food safety,
biosecurity and environmental sustainability. If such
promise is to be fulfilled, history suggests that it will
be important for low- and middle-income countries
to develop the necessary absorptive capacity to take
advantage of any technological opportunity that arises.

CHAPTER 3

Innovation ecosystems

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

In addition, while most public and private R&D remains
concentrated in a relatively small number of economies,
the set of innovating economies has widened over the
past decade to include several East Asian economies.
Given the size of its economy, the recent rise of China
as a source of significant R&D investment is particularly
noteworthy. The three case studies presented in this
chapter show that Chinese entities actively innovate in
the fields of 3D printing, nanotechnology and robotics.
Interestingly, data on patent filings suggest that China’s
innovation landscape differs in one important way from
other R&D-intensive economies: universities and PROs
account for a substantially higher share of patenting in
China than in most other economies, reaching as high
as 80 percent for nanotechnology. This may suggest
more limited R&D capacity in Chinese firms, which
may imply a lower rate of technology commercialization. At the same time, as the historical cases have
shown, a strong scientific base may, in the long term,
spawn new firms and industries once technological
breakthroughs occur.

Interestingly, the ecosystems in which the three innovations flourish show many similarities with the historical
ones presented in chapter 2. Government funding
has been crucial to advance the scientific knowledge
frontier, laying the ground for companies to explore
commercial opportunities. Governments have also
played a role in moving promising technology from
the research lab to the marketplace, especially by
creating market demand. However, this role appears
to have been more important for robotics than for 3D
printing and nanotechnology, largely reflecting the use
of robotics for national defense purposes. Competitive
market forces have, in turn, been instrumental in providing incentives for private R&D, the adaption of
new technologies for large-scale production and the
development of products to meet the needs of different consumers. In addition, as in the historical cases,
the ecosystem for the current innovations has seen
increased specialization over time, partly in response
to increasingly complex technological challenges and
partly to focus on specific applications of technology. The role of IP
However, there are also important differences. To begin
with, the science system and formal linkages between
scientific institutions and companies appear to be more
important today than they were in the past. For example,
the share of university patenting varies between 15 and
40 percent among the three technologies studied in this
chapter. This may partly reflect policy efforts to better
harness the results of scientific research for commercial
development. However, those policy efforts arguably
recognize the critical role that upstream research plays
in enabling downstream technological progress.

Looking at the role of the IP system, again there appear
to be both commonalities with and differences from
the historical cases outlined in chapter 2. To begin
with, just like their historical counterparts, innovators
in 3D printing, nanotechnology and robotics have
relied intensively on the patent system to protect the
fruits of their research activities. While one must bear
in mind the absence of truly counterfactual evidence,
the three case studies suggest that the patent system
has played a useful role in appropriating returns on R&D
investment, promoting follow-on innovation through
technology disclosure and facilitating specialization.
Notwithstanding the large number of patent filings, and
concerns expressed by some observers about possible
patent thickets, the number of conflicts surrounding IP
rights appears to be relatively small. In the case of 3D
printing and robotics, open-source communities have
flourished alongside more proprietary approaches to
knowledge management. Overall, the IP system appears to have accommodated and supported different
knowledge-sharing mechanisms. At the same time, as
with the early inventor clubs in the case of airplanes,
social norms appear to be important in regulating
knowledge sharing within different innovation communities today.

134

CHAPTER 3

It is important to keep in mind, however, that many of
the technologies discussed in this chapter are still at
a relatively early stage of development and some have
yet to see any commercialization. Once the commercial
stakes become higher, history suggests that there may
well be greater conflicts surrounding IP. Policymakers
are thus well advised to ensure a continued balance
in the IP system that incentivizes knowledge creation
without unduly constraining follow-on innovation. As in
the historical cases, courts may at some point confront
far-reaching questions about the patentability of newly
emerging technology. Such questions have already
arisen, for example, in relation to the patentability of
nanotechnology products that exist as a product of
nature or the patentability of robotics software.
Another commonality with the historical cases concerns the patent landscapes in low- and middle-income
countries. Although international commercial ties are
stronger than they were a century ago, innovators in
the three cases have overwhelmingly sought patent
protection in the high-income countries where the bulk
of 3D printing, nanotechnology and robotics innovation
takes place. Only a small share of first patent filings
in the relevant technological fields had equivalents in
low- and middle-income economies. At face value, this
distribution of IP filings again suggests that technology
dissemination will be determined mainly by the degree
of absorptive capacity of recipient economies.

INNOVATIONS WITH FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL

Finally, the three case studies have brought to light
several new considerations that are bound to shape IP
policy in the future. These include the following:
• Copyright is becoming increasingly relevant for
technological innovation. This first happened with
the inclusion of software in the domain of copyrightable subject matter. As software has become
an integral feature of many new technologies – including 3D printers and robots – so has the role
of copyright widened. In addition, copyright can
protect any kind of digital expression, including 3D
object designs and the design of computer chips.132
It is as yet unclear whether this trend just signifies
a shift in the use of different IP forms or whether it
raises fundamentally new policy challenges.
• The emergence of low-cost 3D printing has the
potential to enable the easy reproduction of any
object that may be protected by industrial design
and possibly other IP rights. Will this development
render the enforcement of those rights more difficult
– as the digital revolution did for copyright protection
of books, music, movies and other creative works?
Such a scenario may still be far off and there are
important differences between 3D printing and
digital content copying. Nonetheless, as the discussion in section 3.1.3 argues, the experience from
the digital content industry holds valuable lessons
on how best to manage such a scenario.
• Trade secrets have always been an important –
even if not highly visible – form of IP protection.
Although the three case studies offer only suggestive evidence, there are reasons to believe that trade
secret policy has become more important. This is
mainly because the mobility of knowledge workers
has increased.133 Despite the easy availability of
codified knowledge, people remain crucial to put
such knowledge to effective use. Regulating how
knowledge can flow with people thus shapes both
innovation and technology dissemination outcomes.

in the protection of chip designs.

Technical Notes
Country Income Groups
This Report uses the World Bank income classification
of 2014 to refer to particular country groups. The classification is based on gross national income per capita
and establishes the following four groups: low-income
economies (USD 1,045 or less); lower middle-income
economies (USD 1,046 to USD 4,125); upper middleincome economies (USD 4,126 to USD 12,736); and
high-income economies (USD 12,736 or more).
More information on this classification is available at http://
data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications.

Patent Mappings
The case studies in chapters 2 and 3 rely on mappings
of patents developed especially for this report. The
patent data for these mappings come from the WIPO
Statistics Database and the EPO Worldwide Patent
Statistical Database (PATSTAT, April 2015). Key methodological elements underlying the mapping exercise
include the following:

Unit of analysis
The main unit of analysis is the first filing of a given
invention.134 In consequence, the date of reference
for patent counts is the date of first filing. For some
historical records – for example, those older than 1930
for USPTO documents – the application date is missing. In such cases, the date of the earliest subsequent
filing or the grant date of the first filing has been used.
The origin of the invention is attributed to the first applicant of the first filing; whenever this information was
missing an imputation strategy has been applied, as
described further below.
The only departure from this approach occurs when
analyzing the share of patent families requesting protection in each patent office (see figures 2.6, 3.5, 3.10
and 3.14). In this case, an extended patent family definition – known as the INPADOC patent family – has
been used instead of the one relying on first filings. In
addition, only patent families with at least one granted
application have been considered for this analysis, and
the date of reference is the earliest filing within the
same extended family. The main rationale for using
the extended patent family definition and imposing at
134. Mappings include data on utility
models whenever available.

142

least one granted patent within the family is to mitigate
any underestimation issuing from complex subsequent
filing structures, such as continuations and divisionals,
and from small patent families of lower quality such as
those filed in only one country and either rejected or
withdrawn before examination.

Imputing country of origin
When information about the first applicant’s country of
residence in the first filing was missing, the following
sequence was adopted: (i) extract country information from the applicant’s address; (ii) extract country
information from the applicant’s name (see further
below); (iii) make use of the information from matched
corporations (as described further below); (iv) rely on
the most frequent first applicant’s country of residence
within the same patent family (using the extended patent family definition); (v) rely on the most frequent first
inventor’s country of residence within the same patent
family (again, using the extended patent family definition); and (vi) for some remaining historical records,
consider the IP office of first filing as a proxy for origin.

Cleaning applicant names and
assigning applicant types
Applicants have been categorized in three broad categories: (a) Companies, which includes mostly private
companies and corporations, but also state-owned
companies; (b) Academia and public sector, which includes public and private universities (and their trustees
and board of regents), public research organizations,
and other government institutions such as ministries,
state departments and related entities; (c) Individuals,
which includes individual first applicants who may or
not be affiliated with companies, academia or other
entities. A further category, (d) Not available, includes
all unclassified first applicants.
In order to assign broad type categories to each first
applicant, a series of automated steps were performed
for each of the six innovation fields underlying the case
studies, to clean and harmonize applicant names. The
results of this automated process were cross-checked
manually – particularly for the top applicants of each
type – prompting revision of the strategy and adjustment of parameters in several iterations.
The starting point was the original information about
the first applicant’s name from the first filing. When this
name was missing, the most frequent first applicant’s



TECHNICAL NOTES

name within the same patent family using the extended
definition was considered. This list of improved first
applicants’ names was automatically parsed in several
iterations in order to: (i) harmonize case; (ii) remove
symbols and other redundant information (such as
stop words and acronyms); (iii) remove geographical
references (used to improve information on applicants’
country of residence); and (iv) obtain any valuable
information on applicant names meeting criteria to
be considered as (a) companies or (b) academia and
public sector types.
Subsequently, a fuzzy string search was performed –
using Stata’s matchit command135 – in order to detect
alternative spellings and misspellings in applicant
names, and the types were propagated accordingly. In
addition, the results of corporation consolidation (see
below) also permitted recovery of some unclassified
applicant names as companies. Finally, the category
individuals was imputed only to remaining unclassified
records when they either appeared as inventors in the
same patent or were flagged as individuals in the WIPO
Statistics Database for patent families containing a
PCT application. Analysis of the unclassified records
indicates that most of them have missing applicant
names in PATSTAT. Most of these missing names refer
to original patent documents not in Latin characters
and without subsequent patent filings.

The 3D printing mapping is based on the seminal
work by the UKIPO136 combining CPC and IPC symbols – for example, B29C 67/005 and B22F – with text
terms sought in titles and abstracts, such as additive
manufacturing, fuse deposition model, selective laser
sintering and stereolithography.
The airplane mapping is based on existing lists of
patents compiled in seminal work by Meyer (2010)
and Short (2015), and public documents on the MAA
patent pool and the Curtiss-Wright patent portfolio.137
These patents made it possible to determine and assess the most relevant IPC and CPC symbols, namely
B64C and B64B.
The antibiotics mapping is based on a novel combination of CPC and IPC symbols – for example, A61K 31/18,
A61K 31/43 and A61K 31/7036 – with an extensive list
of text terms searched for in titles and abstracts, such
as sulfa drug, penicillin and streptomycin, among many
others. The list of terms was compiled from the WHO
ATC/DDD Index 2015, the Merck Index (15th edition) and
the FDA’s Orange Book, among other sources.
The nanotechnology strategy is based on the IPC and
CPC symbols B82Y and Y10S 977, including lower
levels of these. The distinction between research tools,
nano-electronics and nano-materials exploits these
lower levels.

Consolidation of applicants
The rankings provided for the three current innovations
presented in chapter 3 consolidate the patent filings
of different first applicants. Manual examination and
consolidation was performed for the most frequent
applicants in each innovation case study. Applicants
sharing a common ultimate owner were consolidated
into one. In the case of the top 30 companies for each
innovation, the ownership profiles in the BvD Ownership
Database were used. Only subsidiaries that were
directly or indirectly majority owned were taken into
account in the consolidation.

Mapping strategies
The patent mapping strategy for each of the six innovations is based on existing evidence and experts’
suggestions. Each strategy was tested against existing
alternative sources whenever possible.
135. Available at the Statistical Software Components
(SSC) archive and from the WIPO website.

The robotics strategy is adapted from the seminal work
by the UKIPO138 combining CPC and IPC symbols – for
example, B25J 9/16 and Y10S 901/00 – with text terms
searched for in titles and abstracts, such as robot
and robotics.
The semiconductor mapping is based on the IPC and
CPC symbol H01L, including all lower levels.
