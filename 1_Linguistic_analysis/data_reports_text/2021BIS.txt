BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

A bumpy pandexit

Introduction
It is now over a year since the Covid-19 pandemic struck out of the blue, plunging the
global economy into a historically deep recession. An acute health crisis turned into
an overwhelming economic crisis, as policymakers adopted stringent containment
measures to save lives. This was a recession in response to an insidious invisible enemy.
A timely, forceful and concerted policy drive prevented the worst. Working
together, monetary, fiscal and prudential authorities managed to stabilise the
financial system and cushion the blow. They put the patient in a state of suspended
animation.
But as last year’s Annual Economic Report (AER) went to press, uncertainty still
reigned: what would happen next? There was hardly any precedent to serve as a
benchmark. No recent pandemic was remotely as damaging as the current one.
And the Spanish flu outbreak was too distant and too different. Many central banks
suspended publishing forecasts, turning to tentative scenarios instead.
Where do we stand today? We know much more about the enemy and we are
better equipped to fight it. We know much more about how the economy responds
and how far it can adjust. The patient is in much better health but has not yet fully
recovered. Some parts of the body are in better shape than others. What is clear is
that the recovery will be uneven and the long-term consequences material. “Pandexit”
will be bumpy and leave a costly and long-lasting legacy.
How has the global economy fared during the past year? What are the
prospects and risks? What are the policy challenges?
While central banks were tackling the consequences of the pandemic, other
important issues continued to draw attention. Questions pertaining to the
relationship between monetary policy and inequality moved to the centre of public
discourse. In addition, discussion and analysis of central bank digital currencies
(CBDCs) became livelier than ever.
What follows elaborates on these issues.

A surprisingly strong but very uneven recovery
Starting in the second half of 2020, the global economy rebounded more strongly
than anticipated. Private consumption was the main engine of growth. As Covid-19
broke out, there had been widespread concerns about “scarring effects” on
consumers’ spending. It had been feared that lingering risk aversion and contagion
worries would hold it back. In the event, these fears proved unfounded. The craving
for normality prevailed. Whenever containment measures were relaxed in contactintensive services, demand returned swiftly. In addition, as consumers adapted, a
further shift to e-commerce limited the restrictions’ fallout.
At the same time, rates of change should not be confused with levels. For the
year as a whole, GDP still declined by some 3.4%. To be sure, at the time of writing
world GDP has more or less returned to its pre-crisis level. But this masks a clear
divide between China, where GDP is now well above its pre-crisis level, and the rest
of the world, where it is still generally some way below. This is even true for the

United States, which has experienced some of the strongest growth rates. If
anything, the overall picture for the labour market is somewhat weaker.
Moreover, the recovery has been very uneven across countries and sectors,
mainly reflecting the evolution of the pandemic and hence the stringency of
containment measures. The euro area has lagged behind the other large jurisdictions.
And, as a group, emerging market economies (EMEs) – China aside – have fared
worst. In particular, EMEs relying heavily on international tourism were badly hit.
Manufacturing has rebounded strongly; and so has trade in goods, confounding
previous expectations. Residential construction has followed suit, in part on the
back of solid housing demand. By contrast, services have done considerably worse,
given lingering mobility restrictions.
In no small measure, the recovery owes its strength to policy.
Fiscal support has been critical. Transfers, loans and guarantees have shielded
firms and households, giving them precious oxygen to recover. Indeed, in many
countries, personal disposable income actually rose – in some countries, such as
the United States, at the strongest pace in decades. Saving rates increased
substantially – the “excess savings” phenomenon. Widespread furlough schemes
bolstered firms’ bottom lines and shored up employment. Government loans and
guarantees kept funding flowing.
Monetary policy has also played an important part. An extraordinarily
accommodative stance underpinned exceptionally easy financial conditions. These
were supported later in the period by positive news about vaccines and, initially at
least, anticipations of the boost to the economy from fiscal stimulus in the United
States.
Indeed, the period saw further signs of frothiness and aggressive risk-taking.
Credit spreads narrowed to the lower part of historical ranges. Equity valuations
reached new heights. Activity in corporate funding markets was frenetic. Various
forms of equity financing surged, and the credit spigots remained wide open for
low credit-quality firms. A strong appetite for risk underpinned buoyancy across all
asset classes, including real estate, commodities and cryptocurrencies. Retail
investors played a disproportionate role – a typical sign of overstretched valuations.
At the same time, as the year wore on bond yields started to creep up and
then rose more strongly in early 2021, afterwards pulling back only slightly. This
reflected a combination of strong US fiscal expansion and accommodative monetary
policy, which boosted term premia in anticipation of a flood of government paper
and raised expectations that inflation would return.
At the time of writing, the outlook for inflation is one of the big questions
keeping financial markets on tenterhooks. Inflation has already increased in a number
of EMEs: higher commodity and food prices alongside currency depreciations have
given it a push. Moreover, the supply of many intermediate goods is failing to keep up
with demand, generating bottlenecks. But the real question is whether the significant
rise in inflation already seen in the United States – where it has recently substantially
exceeded the target – will be temporary or longer-lasting. This could have major
implications not just for financial markets, but for the global economy more broadly.

Near-term prospects
How could the global economy evolve from here? What could “pandexit” look like?
The degree of uncertainty about the future may not be as high as a year ago,
but the fog has not fully lifted. The pandemic is not yet over, the global vaccination
campaign is uneven and new contagion waves may still come. Nor has the
pandemic’s economic legacy fully come to light.

of fiscal policy, notably that of the huge US stimulus; the path of consumption,
which has rebounded surprisingly strongly so far; and the size of firms’ potential
credit losses, as the much feared wave of insolvencies has not yet materialised.
Given the uncertainties involved, and before turning to policy, it is worth
considering three plausible scenarios: the central one embodied in current
consensus forecasts, one in which inflation proves stronger than expected and
financial market conditions tighten, and one in which the global recovery falters
and the economy fails to recover. Of course, various combinations are also possible.
The future will not be so tidy, and individual countries will experience different
permutations. Even so, together the scenarios provide a useful range of plausible
outcomes that helps clarify the challenges policymakers face.
The central scenario sees a comparatively smooth recovery. The pandemic is
steadily brought under control. Consumption sustains the expansion. Corporate
sector losses remain limited, and sectoral reallocation proceeds smoothly. In the
main jurisdictions, inflation rises towards targets and any increase beyond them is
temporary. Financial conditions do not tighten significantly. Even in this scenario,
however, significant cross-country differences remain. The world entered the crisis
suddenly and as one; countries will “pandexit” at their own speed and in their own
way. In particular, growth in many EMEs lags behind, even as some see more
persistent inflation.
The second scenario is one where, on the back of stronger growth, inflation
exceeds expectations and financial conditions tighten. Markets anticipate a quicker
and possibly more intense monetary policy tightening. This is consistent with a larger
impact of fiscal policy on demand and a bigger reversal in saving rates than assumed
in the central scenario, possibly supported by better news on the pandemic front.
How plausible is this scenario? To be sure, the longer-term forces holding
inflation down are still with us, notably globalisation and technological advances:
these have weakened the pricing power of both labour and firms. Moreover, the
responsiveness of inflation to pressures on productive capacity has been extremely
low for well over a decade now. That said, non-linearities cannot be ruled out. And
even if any increase in inflation ultimately proves temporary, financial market
participants could overreact, anticipating more sustained inflation. Either way, the
tightening could be substantial, as participants could be caught wrong-footed and
be forced to unwind their positions. The prolonged aggressive risk-taking that has
prevailed in markets for so long increases the probability of such an outcome.
Recent localised stress, such as the Archegos failure and the losses it has inflicted
on banks, could turn out to be the proverbial canary in the coalmine. A key question
concerns the resilience of non-bank financial intermediation, especially in the
context of hidden leverage and liquidity mismatches.
The third scenario, in which the recovery stalls, is more plausible if the
pandemic proves harder to control. Successive waves of more virulent Covid strains
could be impervious to vaccines, leading to tighter containment measures. Fiscal
multipliers and the deployment of excess savings could fall short of expectations.
In particular, the feared wave of firms’ insolvencies could materialise – another
big question mark clouding the outlook. Estimates of likely credit losses embodied
in the central scenario suggest that they would be manageable. Importantly, the
debt in the most affected sectors accounts for a relatively small fraction of the total.
But this conclusion hinges on policy support being there for as long as necessary.
In this alternative scenario, firms’ losses could be larger, possibly on a par with those
during the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). In turn, banks could feel the strain. In fact,
some of them have taken back part of the provisions made earlier in 2020, indicating
that they could be caught by surprise.

Policy challenges
This range of possible outcomes raises near-term challenges for the calibration of
policy. But sooner or later the pandemic will end, leaving in its wake issues that may
well be more daunting and enduring. Consider each set of challenges in turn.

Near-term challenges
The near-term scenarios and corresponding uncertainty call for policy adjustments.
If inflation surprised on the upside and financial conditions tightened, central
banks would be severely tested. Especially in the United States, which would be
critical in this scenario, a tug of war between financial markets and the central bank
would probably ensue. Depending on views concerning the path of inflation and
inflation expectations, the central bank would have to choose between being
extremely patient, on the one hand, and adjusting the stance sooner than
anticipated, on the other. It would be difficult to avoid bouts of high volatility and
tension in markets.
In this case, the tightening of financial conditions would have broader
repercussions. Here, EMEs would be most vulnerable. While benefiting from stronger
economic growth and hence buoyant trade, they would face tighter global financial
conditions. Depending on economic and financial structures, the weaker among
them could run out of room for policy manoeuvre: financial markets could force an
abrupt policy tightening. Should the US dollar also appreciate, the pressure would
mount further. Other advanced economies in which inflation has been hovering
persistently below target could actually welcome higher inflation. This would be so
unless financial conditions tightened in an unwarranted fashion or inflation rose
excessively, in part responding also to domestic demand pressures.
Should the recovery stall, the policy challenge would be similar to the one
faced so far. Countries’ room for policy manoeuvre would be tested further. Those
where monetary policy and, in particular, fiscal policy have been stretched most
would face the more serious difficulties. A number of EMEs would be on the front
line. Granted, global financial conditions would probably remain supportive since
monetary policy in AEs would remain accommodative. Even so, some economies
might still exhaust policy headroom. Again, financial markets could force a
premature tightening, in some cases possibly requiring external assistance.
This range of outcomes suggests that policy needs to be calibrated in a
sufficiently flexible and prudent way in order to accommodate the resulting
uncertainty. Caution is especially important where the policy room for manoeuvre
is more limited.
Fiscal policymakers will continue to face the question of when and how far to
withdraw stimulus. That said, it is critical that their measures become more targeted.
This would help retain precious policy space. It would also facilitate the required
reallocation of resources to address the pandemic-induced changes in demand
patterns, with some sectors or delivery channels (e-commerce) gaining at the
expense of others.
Flexibility will also be at a premium for monetary policy. As inflation concerns
persist, communication will be tested to the fullest. Central banks face a delicate
balancing act. On the one hand, they need to reassure markets of their continued
willingness to support the economy as necessary. On the other, they also need to
reassure them of their anti-inflation credentials and prepare the ground for
normalisation. Given the uncertainties involved, it would be important to make sure
that financial markets focus on the conditional elements of forward guidance rather
than giving weight to the calendar signals that reflect central bank expectations.

This is not straightforward: by their very nature, financial market participants’
attention gravitates towards the less ambiguous fixed points in time.
Prudential policy will face a twofold task. Supervisors will need to encourage
banks to support the economy, but not at the expense of weakening their resilience.
Accurate pricing of credit risks is essential, without taking public support of firms
for granted. At the same time, absent adjustments in monetary policy, the
deployment of macroprudential tools could help address the build-up of
vulnerabilities, which are in part linked to the persistence of exceptionally easy
monetary conditions. Such tools could be especially useful when aimed at the
housing market – a market that has been unusually buoyant for recessionary
conditions and whose downturns have been a catalyst for major economic
weakness on many occasions in the past.
One limitation prudential policy will face is that the current toolkit is not well
suited to addressing the build-up of vulnerabilities among non-bank financial
intermediaries, such as asset managers and leveraged funds. It is these players that
were at the epicentre of the tremors in March 2020 and among which the most
recent signs of stress have emerged. Work is under way in the international
community to tackle some of the structural vulnerabilities in this area, such as
hidden leverage and maturity mismatches. In the near term, the challenge will be
to monitor developments closely and to make sure that the core of the financial
system, notably banks and central counterparties, remains resilient against possible
shocks.

Longer-term challenges
Policy support is still essential to nurse economies back to health. But once the
Covid pandemic is left behind and the economy has fully recovered, policymakers
will face a key long-term challenge: how to rebuild safety margins for both fiscal
and monetary policy. An economy that operates with thin safety margins is
vulnerable to both unexpected events and future recessions, which will inevitably
come. Those margins have been narrowing over time. Rebuilding them means
gradually re-normalising policy.
Unprecedented initial conditions globally set the stage. On the one hand,
government debt-to-GDP ratios are already on a par with or even higher than
their World War II peaks. On the other hand, nominal interest rates have never
been so low since records began. In real terms, they have been negative for even
longer than during the exceptional Great Inflation era. Likewise, central bank
balance sheets have only rarely reached similar heights relative to GDP, and then
only during wars. With interest rates so exceptionally low, debt service costs are at
post-war troughs – no doubt historical ones, too. The debt burden has never felt
so light.
Thus, normalising policy will not be easy.
This is true if one considers each policy in isolation. The post-GFC experience
has highlighted the difficulties in normalising monetary policy when structural
factors keep inflation low and act as headwinds. Admittedly, for fiscal policy the
task is facilitated by the fact that the growth rate of the economy has exceeded the
extraordinarily low interest rates for quite some time now: all else equal, this
reduces the debt-to-GDP ratio over time. Even so, it would not be prudent to rely
on such a configuration going forward. “All else” is not equal. The reassurance of
low rates, given political imperatives, could encourage governments to increase
debt further. And in some cases it could raise concerns about sustainability, which
would lift risk premia and possibly cause broader stress. Indeed, successful
reductions in debt-to-GDP ratios have generally required running fiscal surpluses.

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

xiii

The fact that normalising policy is a joint task complicates matters. It means
that at times along this long path, fiscal and monetary policies would be working at
cross-purposes. Fiscal policy would act as a drag on the economy, putting pressure
on monetary policy to remain easy. Raising interest rates would increase the
government’s borrowing costs, magnifying the required fiscal consolidation. For
instance, should interest rates return to the levels prevailing in the mid-1990s, when
inflation had already been conquered, median service costs would exceed the
previous wartime peaks.
In fact, large-scale central bank government bond purchases increase the
sensitivity of government net servicing costs. From the perspective of the
consolidated public sector balance sheet, they amount to a debt management
operation. It is as if the government had retired long-term debt and replaced it
with overnight debt – banks’ excess reserves with the central bank. In the large
advanced economy jurisdictions, this means that some 15–45% of all the sovereign
debt is de facto overnight.
This suggests that, along the normalisation path, tensions may well arise
between the two policies. As a result, the risk of fiscal dominance is material. Hence
the importance of institutional arrangements that safeguard the central bank’s
ability to deliver on its mandate. Preserving central bank independence will be
critical, otherwise the central bank’s credibility and, with it, the ability to achieve its
objectives could be undermined. It was precisely this credibility that allowed central
banks to take forceful action during the GFC and the Covid-19 crisis.
Above all, this analysis indicates that raising sustainable long-term growth is
essential. It is the only way of improving the trade-offs along the normalisation
path, by facilitating fiscal consolidation at positive real interest rates. No well
functioning economy should operate with real interest rates that remain negative
for too long: capital is misallocated and growth impaired. As described in more
detail in previous AERs, raising long-term growth requires structural policies
designed to deliver a vibrant, flexible and competitive economy. Growth-friendly
fiscal policy could also play a useful role. This calls for a shift in the composition of
expenditures towards carefully chosen and well executed investments, ultimately
financed through efficient taxation.

The distributional footprint of monetary policy
The pandemic and the preceding prolonged phase of exceptionally low interest
rates and large-scale asset purchases have not only complicated the normalisation
task. They have also given rise to the perception that monetary policy has been
exacerbating income and wealth inequality.
It is well known that monetary policy decisions inevitably have some
distributional consequences. The reason is that changes in interest rates influence
economic activity through changes in incomes, balance sheets and asset prices. For
instance, lower interest rates redistribute income and wealth from creditors to
debtors, from tenants to homeowners – often from the young to the old – and
from depositors to equity investors. But any such effects are short-run and need to
be put into perspective.
There is a broad consensus that trends in inequality are fundamentally driven
by structural factors. Over the past couple of decades, in particular, the impact of
globalisation and technology has been amply documented. Hence the critical role
of structural policies, ranging from education, health and competition to, more
generally, policies fostering equal opportunities – so that the relatively poor of
today can be the well-off of tomorrow. Hence also the role of fiscal policy, notably

xiv

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

through redistribution policies: post-tax measures of inequality are uniformly lower
than pre-tax ones. On top of the fact that the shape of the income distribution is
not a monetary phenomenon, monetary policy simply does not have adequate
tools. Nevertheless, wearing their non-monetary hats, central banks can make a
significant contribution. Depending on their statutory responsibilities, they can do
so by fostering financial development, broadening financial inclusion, protecting
against unfair financial practices and promoting low-cost payment services.
What monetary policy can do to contribute to a more equitable society is seek
to deliver macroeconomic stability. The two major macroeconomic forces that
generate inequality over business fluctuations are inflation, rightly regarded as an
insidious regressive tax, and recessions, which disproportionately hurt the poor
through unemployment. Delivering price and macroeconomic stability – which, in
turn, also requires financial stability – is precisely what monetary policy mandates
are all about.
Fulfilling these mandates may at times require measures that, in the short run,
have unwelcome consequences for inequality in order to secure precious long-run
gains. Bringing inflation down can cause recessions. Recovering from deep recessions
may require interest rates to be kept low for long periods. This is essential to bolster
employment and hence avoid a much larger cost in terms of income inequality. But,
by the same token, it may also increase wealth inequality by boosting the prices of
assets held disproportionately by the better off, notably equities – although this
outcome is not a given, as it depends in particular on who owns housing. This
short-run cost is highly visible; the larger gains in terms of lower unemployment
and lower income inequality are far less so.
At the same time, changes in the nature of the business cycle since the early
1980s have complicated monetary policy’s task. Until then, recessions tended to follow
a tightening of monetary policy to bring inflation under control. Since then – Covid
aside – they have reflected the reversal of a preceding financial boom. Such “financial
recessions” tend to be deeper and longer, especially if a financial crisis breaks out,
and the recovery is much more drawn out: their costs in terms of inequality are
much higher. Key reasons for the change include the smaller responsiveness of
inflation to economic slack, better anchored inflation expectations and financial
liberalisation.
The change in the nature of the business cycle has given rise to tougher
intertemporal trade-offs. On the one hand, central banks have been able to raise
employment further during expansions without generating inflation: this reduces
inequality during that phase. On the other hand, accommodative policy of this kind
can contribute to the build-up of financial imbalances, which can sow the seeds of
subsequent costly financial recessions. Not only do these widen income inequality
by more than other recessions, they also require lower interest rates for longer to
nurse the economy back to health. As a result, the possible short-run negative
impact of lower rates on wealth inequality can become more prominent.
This suggests that a more balanced policy mix is necessary to improve the
trade-offs. This means macroprudential policies, to strengthen the financial system’s
resilience and restrain the financial booms; microprudential policies, to strengthen
banks so that they can withstand the bust and support credit; and fiscal policies, to
act as a backstop in case a financial crisis breaks out and to support the recovery.
These are the key ingredients of a holistic macro-financial stability framework,
better suited to address the nature of today’s business fluctuations and, as a
consequence, their impact on inequality.
But the bottom line is clear: if we want a better, longer-lasting income
distribution, continued structural reforms are unavoidable.

Central bank digital currencies
Trust in the currency underpins the monetary system. As the central bank provides
the ultimate unit of account, that trust is grounded in confidence in the central
bank itself. This principle has been the fixed point of the monetary system even as it
has undergone rapid transformation with changes in the digital landscape.
Last year’s AER set out the principled case for how CBDCs can be a means
towards fulfilling the central bank’s core mission in the payment system. This year’s
report takes a significant step towards putting this big idea into practice by laying
out the design choices for CBDCs and assessing their economic implications for
users, financial institutions and the central bank itself.
The overriding criterion when evaluating a change to something as central as
the monetary system should be whether it serves the public interest. CBDCs
enhance the central bank’s traditional roles in the payment system: ensuring the
finality of payments; providing liquidity and acting as the lender of last resort; and
ensuring that central bank money is “neutral”, ie provided with a commitment to
competitive fairness on an equal basis to all commercial parties.
Several conclusions follow from these considerations.
First, CBDCs are best designed as part of a two-tier system where the central
bank and the private sector focus on what they do best: the central bank on
operating the core of the system by ensuring sound money, liquidity and overall
security; the private sector by innovating and using its creativity and ingenuity to
serve customers better. CBDCs should therefore be designed to delegate most
operational tasks and consumer-facing activities to commercial banks and non-bank
payment service providers. By preserving the two-tier system, the central bank keeps
its financial system footprint small, just as cash does today. Central bank money can
then retain its core attribute of neutrality.
Second, the most promising design is an account-based CBDC, rooted in an
efficient digital identity scheme for users. In this way, CBDCs can meet the
challenges raised by the huge volume of personal data collected as an input into
business activity. They can be designed to balance the need for data privacy on the
one hand and safeguards for the payment system against illicit activities on the
other. Secure identification is also required to promote equal access for everybody.
Striking the right balance is key to protecting users against data hoarding and
abuses of personal data while preserving the system’s integrity against money
laundering and financial crime.
Third, CBDCs address another imperative arising from the centrality of data in
the digital economy – that of preserving an innovation-friendly level playing field.
Network effects make the payment system prone to concentration as well as to the
emergence of data silos and the accumulation of market power arising from the
exclusive use of data. The same technology that encourages a virtuous circle of
greater access, lower costs and better services could equally induce a vicious circle
of data silos, market power and anti-competitive practices.
For this reason, it is important that CBDCs be part of an open platform. Open
platforms build on technical standards such as application programming interfaces
(APIs) and on data governance frameworks that grant control of data to users. They
are most conducive to a virtuous circle of greater access, lower costs and innovation.
To be sure, these characteristics are not unique to CBDCs. They also feature in
the latest generation of retail fast payment systems – systems that provide near
real-time settlement for users. But CBDCs have the additional feature of extending
the unique attributes of central bank money to the general public. CBDCs allow direct
settlement on the central bank’s balance sheet, without the need for intermediary
credit. And they maintain a tangible link with the central bank in the same way that

xvi

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

cash does – a salient marker of the trust in sound money itself – even as the use of
cash dwindles owing to the increasing adoption of digital payment technologies.
Last but not least, the judicious simplification of the monetary architecture
afforded by CBDCs holds the promise of improving cross-border payments. While
improvements might also be made by adjusting current systems, starting with a clean
slate, unburdened by legacy systems, could yield considerable benefits. So-called
multi-CBDC (mCBDC) arrangements, which join up CBDCs across borders, are a case
in point. The greatest potential for improvement is offered by an mCBDC system
that features a jointly operated payment system hosting multiple CBDCs.
A possible concern is that a foreign jurisdiction’s CBDC could magnify the risk
of currency substitution. This is the threat that a foreign CBDC might make inroads
into domestic payments as domestic prices and contracts become increasingly
denominated in it. However, an account-based CBDC builds in safeguards against
such an encroachment. The comparison between a CBDC and foreign bank notes
circulating in the black market is not a good one in that the issuing central bank
would need to recognise any non-domestic CBDC user as a member of the user
network. Robust legal tender provisions that promote the use of the national
currency in domestic payments would also help. Above all, no payment system
exists separately from the underlying economic transactions. International currencies
have developed as a result of the transactional needs of their users. A currency is
unlikely to achieve international status merely because it is in digital form.
CBDCs are an idea whose time has come. They present an opportunity to
design a technologically advanced representation of central bank money, one
which preserves the core features of finality, liquidity and integrity that only the
central bank can provide. If properly designed, CBDCs could form the backbone of
a highly efficient new digital payment system by enabling broad access and
providing strong data governance and privacy standards.

I. Covid and beyond

Key takeaways
•

The global recession was deep, but ended sooner than expected, aided by considerable policy
support. The recovery has been uneven; some countries and sectors returned to pre-pandemic
growth paths, while others lagged. Meanwhile, financial conditions have remained exceptionally
accommodative.

•

The next stage of the pandemic will involve different, but no less formidable, challenges. As the
rollout of vaccines and improved treatments help countries manage the pandemic, its enduring
consequences for economic reallocation and work practices will become increasingly apparent.

•

Upside and downside risks to growth loom large. Enormous fiscal stimulus and the drawdown of
accumulated household savings could deliver stronger growth and higher inflation; but growth
could disappoint and business credit losses mount if the virus is not controlled.

•

In the near term, diverging economic conditions could pose policy challenges for emerging market
economies. Further out, a key task will be to lay a solid foundation for the recovery to allow for policy
normalisation and to manage any tensions that might arise between fiscal and monetary policy.

The battle against the Covid-19 pandemic shaped economic and financial
developments over the past 12 months. In most countries, the recovery from the
first wave of the virus was stronger, and the financial consequences less persistent,
than initially feared. But with the virus continuing to spread, the recovery has been
markedly uneven across countries and sectors. Ample policy support has shielded
firms from the worst consequences of the downturn, helping to ease financial
conditions but also supporting buoyant asset prices, which in some cases have
been hard to justify given economic conditions.
In the coming year, it seems likely that many countries will gradually bring the
virus under control. This will usher in a new phase of the pandemic involving
different, but no less formidable, challenges. While the ebb and flow of infections
will continue to influence economic conditions, the frequency and severity of
lockdowns should ease. Instead, issues such as potential corporate credit losses and
capital and labour reallocation will come to the fore. In advanced economies (AEs),
fiscal stimulus should facilitate the financial and economic transition and hasten the
recovery. But less policy support is likely in most emerging market economies
(EMEs). While EMEs will benefit from increased export demand as the recovery in
AEs consolidates, they could also face additional headwinds should global financial
conditions tighten. The whole world entered the crisis suddenly and as one; the exit
is proving slower and staggered.
In the near term, the need to assist firms and households affected by the
pandemic will remain a key policy objective. The nature of policy assistance needs
to evolve, however, as broad-based support measures give way to more targeted
programmes. Differences across countries in the strength and timing of the recovery
could lead to a divergence in policy settings and pose a challenge for policymakers
in countries where growth is lagging. Meanwhile, it will be important for

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

1

policymakers to keep long-term objectives in mind. Key among these is ensuring
a solid foundation for sustainable growth to allow policy to be normalised, and
reaffirming clear boundaries between monetary and fiscal policies.
This chapter reviews economic and financial conditions over the past year. It
then discusses the key economic and financial challenges that are likely to arise in
the next stage of the pandemic and lays out scenarios for how they might evolve.
Finally, it elaborates on the near- and long-term policy challenges.

The year in retrospect
An incomplete recovery
Many of the key forces that shaped economic developments over the past 12
months were already apparent a year ago.1 At the time of last year’s Annual
Economic Report, the world was in the midst of a historically large and synchronised
recession. Unprecedented joint monetary and fiscal policy support had been
deployed, although it was unclear how effective it would be or how long it could
be sustained.2 There was widespread anticipation of scarring to broad swathes of
the economy including firms, households and global trade. There were concerns
about the lingering impact of insolvencies, persistent shifts in consumption patterns
and shrinking global value chains. Some vaccines were already being developed,
but their effectiveness was unproven. The duration of the pandemic was also highly
uncertain; early estimates ranged from a single wave lasting a few months to a
much more prolonged process.

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

The recession was certainly deep, but the rebound was stronger than forecasters
had predicted. The second quarter of 2020 saw the biggest quarterly contraction in
global economic activity since the Second World War. However, for the year as a
whole, the GDP drop amounted to only 3.4% – a dire outcome in any normal year, but
considerably better than projected at the height of the crisis (Graph I.1, first panel).
Macroeconomic policy support, which was even more extensive than anticipated,
limited the fallout. After acting decisively to pre-empt severe disruptions to credit
intermediation and preserve market functioning at the onset of the pandemic, in
the period under review central banks provided further stimulus to aid the
recovery.3 In AEs they maintained, and in some cases expanded, asset purchase
programmes (Graph I.1, second panel). Some also made greater use of forward
guidance, in the case of the Federal Reserve as part of a revised monetary policy
framework. In EMEs, central bank actions reflected varying economic forces. Some
EME central banks lowered policy rates further; others, such as those of Brazil and
Turkey, tightened in early 2021 in response to rising inflation (third panel). Several
EME central banks also launched asset purchase programmes for the first time,
generally to stabilise markets. In time, most EME central banks were able to weather
the furious storm of March and April 2020.
Unprecedented and timely global fiscal stimulus further supported demand,
breaking patterns that had become well established in previous recessions. Particularly
in AEs, fiscal expansion continued after the initial pandemic shock (Graph I.1, fourth
panel). In a number of countries, the packages amounted to more than 10% of GDP.
In AEs, household income greatly benefited from fiscal transfers, expanded
unemployment benefits and furlough schemes. In a number of cases, household
disposable income actually rose in 2020 – sometimes exceptionally fast (Graph I.2,
left-hand panel). For firms, government debt guarantees, debt moratoriums and

other direct support measures helped ensure ample credit supply, counterbalancing
a dramatic fall in revenue (centre panel).
Partly as a result, the anticipated wave of corporate insolvencies did not
materialise. In fact, business bankruptcies fell in many countries. This coincided with
a significant break in the previously close relationship between bankruptcies and
economic activity (Graph I.2, right-hand panel).4
The impact of the crisis on households was less persistent than initially feared.
When lockdowns eased in many countries in the third quarter of 2020, spending
made up much of its lost ground (Graph I.3, left-hand panel). The lingering weakness
in some forms of consumption, notably recreation services, probably reflected
constraints rather than enduring shifts in consumer preferences. Indeed, in countries
that saw only a single large infection wave, spending on services such as restaurants
returned close to pre-pandemic levels (centre panel). At the same time, the pandemic
reinforced previous trends in consumption patterns. In particular, the shift to online
retailing gathered pace, regardless of whether countries experienced multiple waves
of infection. These changes in consumer behaviour also helped insulate economic
activity from containment measures. As a result, lockdowns led to much smaller
declines in economic activity in early 2021 than they had earlier in the pandemic.5
Concerns that the pandemic would deal a lasting blow to global economic
integration also proved overly pessimistic. Goods trade rebounded strongly after
contracting by nearly 20% early in the first half of 2020 when supply disruptions
had wreaked havoc on production networks (Graph I.3, right-hand panel). When
supply pressures reappeared in early 2021, they reflected robust demand for goods
such as electronic equipment and motor vehicles rather than disruptions to global
value chains (GVCs). Services trade, however, did not recover. Cross-border tourism
was hard hit, with international air travel declining by 74% in 2020.6
Banks weathered the recession surprisingly well. Most had entered the
pandemic with relatively strong balance sheets, in large part owing to post-Great

Financial Crisis (GFC) regulatory reforms. Low insolvency rates meant that the hit to
asset quality was contained relative to the sharp drop in GDP. Indeed, bank
capitalisation increased in many countries in 2020, in part due to restrictions on
shareholder payouts and greater flexibility in classifying loans and applying
regulations (Graph I.4, left-hand panel). After declining early in the pandemic
because of increased provisions against expected losses, bank profitability
recovered in the United States and some smaller AEs, although it remained low in
Europe and Japan (centre panel). The number of banks with negative rating
outlooks also remained elevated, particularly in Europe and EMEs outside Asia. This
reflected the uncertain outlook for corporate insolvencies as well as the persistent
challenges to bank profitability from low interest rates and competition from
technology firms (right-hand panel).
Although the recession turned out to be less severe than initially feared, the
recovery has been incomplete. GDP has remained well below pre-pandemic
expectations, which admittedly were unusually strong given the length of the
previous economic expansion (Graph I.5, left-hand panel). Labour market conditions
have deteriorated markedly since the start of the pandemic. And higher
unemployment rates tell only part of the story (centre panel). Labour force
participation rates have declined substantially in some countries. In Europe, where
furlough and part-time work schemes averted large rises in unemployment, the
deterioration is visible in shorter working hours. In some countries, enrolment in
these schemes – intended initially as a temporary measure – has remained well
above pre-pandemic levels (right-hand panel).
The pace and extent of the recovery differed markedly across countries. China,
the first economy to enter recession, rebounded quickly. It grew by 2.3% in 2020,
on the back of strong business fixed investment and export demand. In turn, China’s
economic recovery lifted growth in some East Asian EMEs through GVCs. Meanwhile,
in the United States a consumption-led bounceback in the second half of the year,

supported by a residential construction boom and strong growth in information
technology investment, limited the contraction in 2020 to 3.5%. In both China and
the United States, the vigorous growth momentum extended into 2021.
In other countries, however, the initial recovery lost steam. In the euro area, in
particular, economic activity declined by 6.6% in 2020 and contracted further in the
first quarter of 2021, as new waves of infection led to renewed lockdowns. Growth
also slowed in other AEs that experienced multiple infection waves (Graph I.6, first
panel).
EMEs in Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia faced particularly challenging
conditions. In many of these countries, the structure of economic activity is less
suited to remote working and social distancing, constraining their ability to contain
the virus, which at times overwhelmed local health services. Early in the crisis,
expansionary policy, in some countries alongside remittances, cushioned the initial
drop in activity. However, there was little additional fiscal stimulus from mid-2020,
in most cases reflecting diminished policy space.
The recovery was also uneven at a sectoral level due to the pattern of
containment measures. In most countries, sectors such as manufacturing and
construction bounced back rapidly after lockdowns were relaxed (Graph I.6, second
panel). By contrast, customer-facing service industries lagged badly. Unsurprisingly,
these typically labour-intensive low-wage sectors saw by far the largest job losses
(third panel).7 In EMEs, the informal sector suffered most (fourth panel).
The disinflationary effects of the pandemic continued through 2020 (Graph I.7,
first panel). Lower aggregate demand, weaker labour markets and firms’ costcutting more than offset supply constraints. Slower price increases early in the
pandemic in service industries, such as transport and recreation, were only partly
offset by stronger ones in the durable goods sector, which actually saw higher

demand during lockdowns (second panel). Low inflation in China also reverberated
through other economies due to the country’s large role in global trade.
As the period under review progressed, however, supply pressures strengthened
substantially and inflation picked up. After declining early in the pandemic, PPI
inflation trended firmly upwards in several economies, most notably China,
paralleling a steady recovery in commodity prices (Graph I.7, third and fourth
panels). In conjunction with exchange rate depreciations, this led to higher inflation
in a number of large EMEs. Inflation also rose in most AEs and in some cases
exceeded central bank targets. As well as higher commodity prices, a rebound in
the prices of items such as airfares and hotels, which had fallen sharply early in the
pandemic, contributed to increased inflation in these countries.

Exceptionally accommodative financial conditions
The economic recovery went hand in hand with exceptionally accommodative
financial conditions. Expectations that very easy monetary policy settings would be
sustained, together with unprecedented fiscal expansions that improved economic
prospects and supported corporate solvency, were instrumental in reducing
business funding costs and compressing risk premia. While public interventions
sustained asset valuations, risky assets appeared expensive even after accounting
for the level of interest rates. Starting in early 2021, rapidly improving economic
forecasts led to a sharp rise in sovereign yields in AEs that then spilled over to EME
yields. On balance, however, financial conditions remained very supportive from a
historical perspective, including in most EMEs.

With accommodative policies in place, businesses were able to access finance
on very favourable terms. Credit spreads were compressed through mid-2021, even
for low-rated firms, falling well below historical averages (Graph I.8, first panel).
Following a sharp increase in mid-2020, not least thanks to central banks’ asset
purchases and liquidity facilities, corporate bond issuance remained exceptionally
buoyant into the first quarter of 2021, even reaching record highs in the US highyield segment (second panel). The prices of funds investing in loans to small risky
firms also soared in late 2020, exceeding pre-pandemic levels in early 2021.
Strong risk appetite sustained valuations in equity and real estate markets. Even
after accounting for the very low level of interest rates, stocks appeared expensive in
the United States and China, although less so in other markets (Graph I.8, third panel).
Positive sentiment was also apparent in the steep increase in capital raised through
initial public offerings and special purpose acquisition companies, which echoed the
rush to public markets seen in the late 1990s tech boom. While commercial real estate
(CRE) prices had fallen markedly early in the pandemic, proxies for risk premia
remained low. In the United States, the difference between CRE rental yields (also
known as capitalisation rates) and Treasury yields – often interpreted as a valuation
measure – was at the same level in the first quarter of 2021 as it had been in late
2019, even for the pandemic-hit retail sector (fourth panel). Moreover, although office
building valuations fell, they remained well above post-GFC lows. In the meantime,
and unusually for a recession, house prices rose sharply in many countries (Box I.A).
Positive vaccine news and an unprecedented fiscal expansion underpinned
buoyant sentiment in equity markets. Global stock prices started rising in
November 2020 on favourable vaccine trial results, even though they remained

sensitive to the evolution of infection rates and delays in vaccine availability. In
conjunction with very accommodative monetary policy, an extraordinary increase
in government expenditure, especially in the United States, provided crucial support
to risky assets in 2021 (Graph I.9, first panel). As US fiscal legislation neared its
approval, volatility rose alongside higher sovereign yields in late February. The rise
in EME equities also lost steam at this time on concerns of negative spillovers from
higher AE yields. Chinese stocks experienced particularly large losses, which they had
yet to recoup by June, partly due to policy efforts aimed at curbing credit growth.
As the period unfolded, sovereign yields started to rise. The brightening economic
outlook, sustained by positive vaccine news, fiscal expansion and continued monetary
accommodation, bolstered a “reflation trade”. At first, the steady increase in US bond
yields reflected higher market-based inflation expectations (Box I.B). Subsequently,
forecasts of buoyant US economic growth, supported by exceptional US fiscal
stimulus and a tilt towards longer-dated sovereign issuance, lifted long-term yields
(Graph I.9, second panel). The reflation trade appeared to ease somewhat in April,
even as macroeconomic forecasts improved. Reportedly, increased demand from
international investors was partly responsible. Indeed, by the end of March 2021 US
Treasury yields hedged into euro and yen had risen to the highest levels in years,
becoming particularly attractive to investors from those jurisdictions.

House prices soar during the Covid-19 pandemic

House prices soared in many countries over the past year (Graph I.A, left-hand panel). Although a rise in
house prices during a recession is not unprecedented, partly because accommodative monetary policy meant
to stimulate the economy also supports asset prices, recent increases have been unusually large. In AEs, house
prices rose by 8% on average in 2020, with growth accelerating further in the first few months of 2021. In
EMEs, prices rose by around 5% on average in 2020. Rising house prices can contribute to a build-up of
household vulnerabilities. As such, understanding why house prices rise is important when evaluating possible
risks ahead.

Two factors seem to be behind the rise in house prices. The first is the pandemic itself. After contracting
significantly as economies locked down in early 2020, the number of housing transactions surged towards the
end of the year and into 2021. As well as pent-up demand, the increase in housing turnover seems to reflect
changes in housing preferences as lockdowns and working from home caused households to reassess
commuting costs. Because housing supply is relatively inelastic in the short run, demand-induced increases
in housing turnover typically go hand in hand with rising house prices. The second factor is interest rates,
which declined early in the pandemic. Not only do lower interest rates make it cheaper to service a home
loan, they also raise the present value of future housing services, which increases the value of home ownership
relative to renting.
Soaring house prices give rise to intertemporal trade-offs. They can bolster consumption in the near term
and are an important part of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, but they also raise downside risks
in the medium term, particularly if accompanied by a pickup in credit growth. In addition, rising house
prices tend to go hand in hand with increased residential construction, which is associated with lower
aggregate productivity growth. Graph I.A, centre panel, illustrates the medium-term consequences of higher
house prices. The red line shows the distribution of expected annual GDP growth over a seven-year window
when house price growth is at its long-run mean for a panel of AEs. The blue line shows the same distribution

10

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

when house price growth is two standard deviations above its long-run mean. The bulk of the blue line lies to
the left of the red line, indicating that faster house price growth is associated with an increased probability of
below-trend GDP growth in the medium term.
Moreover, there is evidence that, since the start of the pandemic, house prices have risen by more than
fundamental drivers, such as borrowing costs and rents, would imply. Based on their historical relationship to
rents and interest rates, house prices would have been expected to rise in many countries since the start of
2020, but in most cases by less than the actual increase observed (Graph I.A, right-hand panel). Growth in
rents – a key component in the cost of housing services – slowed in most countries over the past year. But
mortgage interest rates and long-term bond yields – the relevant interest rates for discounting housing
services – declined, at least until early 2021. This apparent divergence between house prices and their
fundamental determinants could make them more vulnerable to larger corrections in the future, especially if
financial conditions become less accommodative.
 Indeed, US house prices have grown fastest outside major metropolitan areas since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic,
reversing long-run trends over preceding decades. See A Gupta, V Mittal, J Peeters and S Van Niuwerburgh, “Flattening the
curve: pandemic-induced revaluation of urban real estate”, NBER Working Papers, no 28675, April 2021.     See K Hort,

January 2000.     For a summary of the empirical estimates of housing wealth effects, see Figure 5 in D May, G Nodari
and D Rees, “Wealth and consumption in Australia”, The Australian Economic Review, vol 53, no 1, February 2020.     See
C Borio, E Kharroubi, C Upper and F Zampolli, “Labour reallocation and productivity dynamics: financial causes, real
consequences”, BIS Working Papers, no 534, December 2015.

The reflation trade in AEs spilled over to EMEs. Starting in February 2021, local
currency EME yields jumped (Graph I.9, second panel). Improving growth expectations
in AEs had positive effects on EMEs thanks to rising exports and commodity prices.
In many EMEs, however, higher AE yields exacerbated vulnerabilities stemming
from a combination of slow vaccination rates, rising contagion rates, surging public
debt levels and structural economic weakness that preceded the pandemic. The
difficult predicament EMEs faced was visible in the depreciation of their currencies
relative to the US dollar in the first quarter of 2021, which was unusual given
soaring commodity prices (third panel).
That said, financial conditions in EMEs generally tightened only moderately
and remained accommodative on balance (Graph I.9, fourth panel). The tightening
effect of higher long-term yields was partly offset by advancing equities. China was
an exception and saw financial conditions tighten noticeably, not least due to its
domestic policy stance that aimed at containing credit growth. The tightening took
place despite buoyant bond fund flows driven by a search for yield and portfolio
rebalancing after Chinese bonds were included in international indices.

The next stage of the pandemic
A key goal of policy in the past year was to hold the fabric of the economy together
until a path out of the pandemic came into view. While policymakers could do little
about the lockdowns’ direct impact, wide-ranging policy support limited the fallout.
In many countries, support measures were so extensive that the lasting consequences
of the pandemic, including shifts in the composition of economic activity, have
scarcely begun to be addressed. In this respect, the experience of the past year
illustrates the limits as well as the power of stabilisation policy.
The pandemic is now entering a new stage. While the spread of the virus will
still constrain economic activity, a wider set of forces will start to shape outcomes.
Among the most significant are US fiscal policy, which could have global consequences
through trade and financial spillovers, and the behaviour of households, whose

“excess savings”, if released, could provide a significant impetus to the recovery.
The strength of these forces will help determine whether the wave of business
insolvencies that failed to materialise last year eventually occurs. Corporate credit
losses would, in turn, feed back into broader economic conditions through business
investment and the health of the financial sector. Meanwhile, the pandemic’s effects
on corporate reallocation will become clearer.
How will the global economy evolve as these forces play out over the next year
or so? A natural starting point is the central scenario embedded in current
economic forecasts and financial market prices, and the corresponding assumptions
and policy expectations. However, given the exceptional combination and scale of
the forces at work as well as surrounding uncertainty, it is worth exploring how
economic conditions could differ if the assumptions behind the central forecast are
not realised. Accordingly, what follows contrasts the relatively benign central
scenario with two plausible and more challenging alternatives. The range of
outcomes provides insights into the considerations that could inform policy.

The central scenario
The central scenario, as embodied in Consensus Forecasts, is for the economic
recovery to continue, albeit at varying speeds across countries (Graph I.10, lefthand and centre panels). The pickup in growth should go hand in hand with better
labour market conditions. As slack diminishes, inflation is projected to move closer

Box I.B

What can we learn from market-based inflation expectations?

Inflation break-even rates are often used as timely measures of market-based expectations of future inflation.
Break-evens are defined as the spread between the yields on nominal and inflation-indexed government
bonds. These measures reflect three elements: first, the inflation rate that investors expect will be realised over
the maturity of the bonds; second, the compensation for the inflation risk that investors require when holding
nominal bonds; and third, the effect of demand/supply imbalances, such as those due to dealer balance sheet
capacity.
This box addresses two questions. First, given that expected inflation is only one of their drivers, how
informative are break-evens about future realised inflation? Second, what can short-term movements in
break-evens tell us about the factors behind rising inflation expectations in late 2020 and early 2021? The first
main finding is that break-evens predict near-term inflation well. The second is that, in the context of the
Federal Reserve’s new monetary policy framework adopted in August 2020, break-evens in several countries
appear to have been significantly and durably influenced by positive vaccine news as well as by US fiscal
expansion.
Break-evens compare favourably with other predictors of inflation. This takeaway is based on data from
the United States over the sample period 2005–20 and on the link between monthly averages of daily fiveyear break-even rates and future realised inflation. In order to maximise available data, the analysis uses
inflation measured during the following year rather than over the subsequent five years. The evidence
indicates that break-evens co-move more strongly with future inflation than other common predictors, as
reflected in the larger coefficient from regressions of realised inflation on lagged break-evens (Graph I.B, first
panel, red bars). During tranquil times, ie excluding the GFC and the Covid-19 pandemic from the sample, the
co-movement is weaker (fourth bar vs fourth dot), but even then break-evens have a larger predictive
coefficient than survey forecasts of market economists (second dot vs fourth dot). This pattern implies that
break-evens can be especially informative during volatile periods, when conditions evolve quickly and market
prices respond rapidly to new information.

Starting in the third quarter of 2020, market-based inflation expectations reacted strongly to news about
vaccines and fiscal expansion in the United States. In the wake of higher and sustained volatility earlier in the
year following the initial pandemic shock, break-evens remained relatively stable in mid-2020 in a number of
AEs and EMEs. As early trial results indicated substantial vaccine efficacy, break-evens started to climb rapidly
across jurisdictions, with the exception of those for the United Kingdom (Graph I.B, second panel). Underscoring
the expected global spillovers from US fiscal deficits, break-evens for Germany and the United Kingdom rose
more rapidly after political changes raised prospects of a large fiscal package in early January 2021.
The spread between 10-year and five-year break-evens points to expectations of a short-run bout of
inflation from the US fiscal impulse. This spread is typically positive, possibly because longer investment horizons
carry more uncertainty and higher inflation risk premia (Graph I.B, right-hand panel). Market participants
interpreted the results of US Senate runoff elections in Georgia in early 2021 as raising the likelihood of a very
large fiscal expansion under the new US administration, which indeed took place a few weeks later.
Immediately after the election results, the break-even spread fell more quickly and turned negative, indicating
that investors expected fiscal policy to boost medium-run inflation above long-term levels.

to central bank targets, and in some cases exceed them (right-hand panel). However,
with the exception of a few EMEs, inflation overshoots are seen as temporary.
Accommodative fiscal and monetary policy are envisaged to underpin the
recovery. Considerable fiscal stimulus remains to be deployed, on top of measures
introduced last year, particularly in the United States. Monetary policy is also
expected to remain highly expansionary in AEs, where a number of central banks
have committed to maintaining their current stance until inflation reaches, or in some
cases exceeds, its target. As a result, any tightening in global financial conditions is
seen as moderate. However, policy rates could rise in some EMEs to dampen inflation.
Progress in controlling the virus is expected to vary across countries,
contributing to the highly uneven recovery. In some AEs, the rollout of vaccines has

Charting a path to “pandexit”

Vaccine rollouts could pave the way for the removal of most remaining constraints on economic activity. Yet
vaccination rates remain low in many parts of the world. Until substantial progress is made, many countries,
particularly EMEs, remain vulnerable to further waves of infection. Although vaccine production is accelerating,
supply looks set to be constrained for some time. This highlights the value of alternative “pandexit” strategies,
such as improved treatments and more targeted prevention methods. This box evaluates these strategies and
quantifies their possible effects on economic activity.
To assess the economic implications of different health strategies, a framework is needed that captures
the interactions between epidemiology and economics. One such analysis employs a two-bloc framework
that can flexibly accommodate a variety of epidemiological scenarios across many countries. The first bloc
describes how mobility affects the evolution of the pandemic, based on the susceptible-exposed-infectiousremoved (SEIR) model of infectious disease transmission. The second bloc captures how society adjusts
mobility to balance health and economic considerations. Changes in mobility can in turn be mapped into
GDP based on the historical relationship between the two variables. The model produces real-time estimates
of infection and fatality rates, reflecting changes in the characteristics of the virus (eg the emergence of new
variants) and improved treatments, which can be used to project the economic and health implications of
current trends. In addition, the model can quantify how advances in vaccination or the emergence of virus
variants alter the achievable combination of health and economic outcomes.
The analysis points to significant gains from vaccine rollouts. If the pace of vaccination slows to a third of
its currently forecasted rate, the implied drag of the virus on output during 2021 could be one and a half
times as large for the median country as is currently assumed. Slower progress with vaccinations also leaves
countries more exposed to a resurgence in infections. Indeed, for many EMEs further waves of infections pose
a greater risk than the emergence of vaccine-resistant virus variants because they are less protected by
Pandexit

(Graph I.C, left-hand panel)). In contrast, for countries with high vaccination rates, the emergence
of vaccine-resistant variants poses the greater risk.

With vaccines in short supply in the near term and potentially less effective against future virus strains, a
complementary pandexit strategy may be to develop better therapeutic practices. The substantial decline in
fatality rates since the start of the outbreak (Graph I.C, centre panel) points to the valuable role of improved
treatment. At the same time, significant gaps in fatality rates remain between AEs and EMEs, suggesting
potential gains for the latter group. In principle, if the virus were less harmful it would be possible to ease
constraints even if much of the population was unvaccinated.
Model simulations lend some support to improved treatment as a useful complement to vaccination. But
for treatment to make a material difference, it would need to deliver a large and rapid reduction in fatality
rates. The right-hand panel of Graph I.C illustrates the implications for mobility restrictions in selected
countries of two alternatives to the central scenario. In the first, only a third of vaccinations planned for 2021
actually occur, and current treatment practices remain in place. This results in a decline in mobility of over
10% in some countries to contain the spread of the virus to a socially acceptable level. In the second, the
slower vaccine rollout proceeds alongside improvements in treatment that halve the virus fatality rate. This
reduces, and in some cases entirely offsets, the impact of lower vaccination rates on mobility. Achieving
such large improvements in treatment would require significant resources to mobilise and scale proven
technologies and develop new ones. But, if effective, the cost of doing so would probably be much smaller
than that of repeated lockdowns.
From a global perspective, increased vaccination and improved treatment should clearly go hand in
hand. International spillovers, not considered in the analysis, provide a compelling case for global vaccination
and an equitable distribution of vaccines across countries. The presence of infections in any part of the world
weighs on global economic activity via trade and supply chains, leaving open the possibility that new variants
will undo the progress achieved in vaccination. Widespread vaccination reduces this risk. At the same time,
improved treatments would reduce the appeal of “vaccine nationalism”, increasing the political feasibility of a
more equal distribution of vaccines focused on the most at-risk groups. Improved treatments would also
reduce the economic and health consequences of the emergence of vaccine-resistant variants. As a global
challenge, ending the pandemic will require a coordinated effort, including a coherent global vaccination
strategy.

government-mandated containment measures as well as individual actions to reduce the risk of infection.     The current
guideline recommends different combinations of anti-viral medicines tailored to the severity and stages of illnesses, a
protocol that is still evolving. See www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov.     The final scenario assumes that the fatality
rate will converge to the steady state value of 0.5%, about five times larger than that of the regular flu. The central scenario
assumes a constant fatality rate at the latest available value.     For example, the REGN-COV2 treatment contract costs

already drastically reduced infections and mortality rates, raising hopes of a
relatively smooth and early “pandexit”. Achieving similar gains in countries with
lower vaccination rates would require further improvements in treatment methods
and more targeted prevention strategies (Box I.C). Thus, the short-term prospects
for containing the virus are less bright for many EMEs, particularly outside East Asia.

Alternative scenario 1: higher inflation and tighter financial conditions
In this alternative scenario, inflation in a number of countries exceeds current
expectations by enough to bring forward the expected start of monetary policy
normalisation and prompt an unexpected and substantial tightening of global financial
conditions. Naturally, this scenario involves stronger growth than currently projected.
And it is more plausible if the pandemic is tamed more quickly than envisaged.
One reason why growth might surprise on the upside is that fiscal policy could
turn out to be more stimulatory than expected. From a global perspective, the
impact of the large US stimulus package passed in March 2021 is key, given its size
and the United States’ influence on economic and financial conditions globally.
Additional fiscal stimulus, should it occur, would reinforce these effects.

16

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

For the United States, the fiscal boost to GDP depends largely on how
households respond. Estimates of fiscal multipliers – ie the overall increase in GDP
from a $1 increase in stimulus – are imprecise. That said, they are generally thought
to be lower for broad-based transfer payments – a large share of the most recent
US fiscal package – than for spending targeted at financially constrained households,
and to be larger when monetary policy is accommodative.8 To fix ideas, the middleof-the-road multiplier estimates that inform the central scenario (eg 0.3 for transfers
and 1.5 for direct expenditures) imply a boost to the level of US GDP of between
1 and 2% in each of the next two years (Table I.1). But if the multipliers turn out to
be closer to the upper end of the range of the estimates, the fiscal impulse could
be more than twice as large. Faster growth in the United States will, in turn, boost
export demand elsewhere.
A second possible reason for surprisingly strong growth is that household
saving rates in AEs, which increased sharply in 2020, could fall back more quickly
than expected. The resulting push to consumption would reinforce the more
stimulatory fiscal policy. A trigger for a faster reduction in saving rates could be
early control of the pandemic, which would lower uncertainty and cut precautionary
saving. Improved labour market conditions and rising house prices could also boost
confidence and encourage households to draw down their savings more quickly.
Additional saving in 2020 in some AEs was equivalent to over 5% of pre-crisis GDP.
Thus, even a small drawdown could materially lift global economic activity
(Graph I.11, left-hand panel).
The impact on inflation is harder to assess. There are grounds to believe that any
further increase would be limited and temporary. The relationship between inflation
and slack has weakened in recent decades: empirical estimates suggest that even
very tight economic conditions would prompt only a modest rise (Graph I.11, righthand panel). Inflation expectations are also better anchored, so that the “secondround” effects of an initial rise in inflation are typically small.9 Moreover, many of the
structural factors that have been exerting downward pressure on inflation for a long
time and have further dampened second-round effects are still at play. Foremost
among these are the globalisation of product and labour markets and technological
change, which have reduced the pricing power of labour and many firms.10 The
pandemic-induced growth of e-commerce has worked in the same direction.
That said, given the strength of the forces at play in the scenario, one cannot
rule out a larger and more sustained increase in inflation. The relationship between

inflation and economic slack – the Phillips curve – could turn out to be non-linear,
meaning that inflationary pressures rise substantially when spare capacity is
sufficiently small.11 Such an outcome would be more likely in this scenario, as the
pickup in growth would be synchronous across many countries, so that capacity
would come under stronger pressure at the global level. Inflation expectations
could also become less well anchored. Already this year, financial market measures
of inflation expectations rose quickly in a number of countries as prospects for the
US fiscal stimulus firmed (Box I.B).12 Should this foreshadow a more general
unmooring, eg so that inflation became as “backward-looking” as prior to 1990, a
given reduction in economic slack would deliver twice as much inflation as more
recent estimates imply. This would be true even if the response of inflation to
economic slack remained low (Graph I.11, right-hand panel).
Even a temporary rise in inflation could deliver a sizeable financial tightening,
especially given stretched financial markets. This would be more likely if uncertainty
about central banks’ response caused financial markets to bring forward the
anticipated start of policy normalisation. Such a scenario could lead to a rapid and
disorderly unwinding of positions taken on the assumption of persistently easy
monetary conditions.
This scenario would play out differently across the world. Jurisdictions where
inflation has persistently been below target would welcome its rise as long as
financial conditions there did not tighten excessively. By contrast, a tightening
could be particularly challenging for EMEs, which are seeing a slower recovery than
most AEs. The financial tightening in those economies would be all the more severe
should the US dollar appreciate – a likely outcome given that the US economy
would be the main source of the growth surprise.

18

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

Alternative scenario 2: the recovery stalls, business insolvencies rise
In this scenario, the recovery stalls. As growth slows, business insolvencies, which
were remarkably low in 2020 given the state of the global economy, start to rise
substantially. The resulting corporate loan losses weaken the financial position of
banks, sapping their lending capacity.
An adverse turn in the pandemic is an obvious trigger for this scenario. A
particular risk comes from the emergence and spread of new vaccine-resistant virus
strains from countries with high infection rates and slow progress in vaccination
(Graph I.12, left-hand panel). Modifying vaccines to cope with these strains would
take time, and renewed lockdowns could be required. Based on the historical
relationship between infection rates, lockdowns and GDP, the emergence of a
vaccine-resistant virus strain could lower GDP by between 1.5% and 3.5% in the
second half of 2021, with regions where vaccination has progressed most
experiencing the biggest hit to growth (right-hand panel).
Consumption would naturally be lower in this scenario. Renewed lockdowns,
weaker labour market conditions and possibly a rise in precautionary saving
because of heightened uncertainty would all take their toll.
The boost to growth from fiscal policy could be smaller as well. Subdued
consumption would translate into less spending out of fiscal transfers. In the United
States, for example, the fiscal impulse would be only half as large as in the central
scenario if fiscal multipliers turned out to be near the bottom of the range of
estimates. In some countries, investors could start to question fiscal sustainability,
which would lower growth further.
But it is the business sector that would feel the brunt of the damage. Even in
the central scenario, credit losses would probably pick up in pandemic-affected
sectors from the extremely low 2020 levels (Graph I.13, left-hand panel). In some
industries, such as bricks-and-mortar retailing and commercial property, persistent
shifts in customer behaviour and work practices could exacerbate losses (Box I.D).

That said, so long as the recovery retains some momentum, credit losses seem to
be manageable (Box I.E). A renewed downturn, however, would put further pressure
on business finances (Graph I.13, centre panel). Corporate balance sheets are more
exposed than at the start of the pandemic because of a substantial increase in
borrowing, particularly by the least profitable firms (right-hand panel). While ample
credit supply helped compensate for rising losses in the early stages of the pandemic
and some firms have built sizeable cash reserves, it is unclear whether additional
credit would be forthcoming should economic conditions worsen once again.
The adverse effects of rising corporate insolvencies would be magnified
through their impact on banks and other financial institutions. Recent stress tests
suggest that most banks hold sufficient capital to meet their regulatory requirements
even in the face of a severe downturn, at least in AEs.13 However, they also point to
a significant hit to capital buffers, which could constrain the supply of credit to
healthy firms and dampen business investment. Low bank profitability in an
environment of low-for-long interest rates heightens the challenges and could
hinder banks’ ability to build buffers and raise new capital.14
Even if an upsurge in insolvencies does not materialise, firms will have to
contend with increased repayment obligations due to the large rise in borrowing
early in the pandemic. The value of debt repayments due in the next two years has
increased significantly since the start of the pandemic in many AEs and some large
EMEs. In some countries it exceeds 50% of firms’ net income (Graph I.14, left-hand

Aggregate implications of an uneven sectoral recovery

Like the recession that preceded it, the recovery from the Covid pandemic has been uneven across sectors.
Some, such as manufacturing and construction, rebounded quickly after lockdowns eased. But many
customer-facing service industries still face constraints. International tourism and business travel, for example,
may take years to recover completely.
Uneven recoveries can pose challenges for macroeconomic policy. This is especially true when the
unevenness reflects constraints that place a cap on activity in some sectors – such as the need to restrict
personal interactions to limit the spread of a virus. Traditional stimulus policies, which aim to boost aggregate
activity, are less effective. Public support measures aimed at maintaining productive capacity in constrained
sectors are costly, hard to target and difficult to sustain for long. Moreover, these policies cannot support
activity forever and may delay necessary adjustments when sectors facing permanent reductions in demand
need to downsize. Conversely, policies fostering reallocation from constrained sectors to expanding ones
need time to bear fruit, making interim support critical.
As a result, recoveries from uneven recessions are often particularly slow. Estimates in a sample of
advanced economies indicate that, in the three years after the start of a “balanced” recession, ie one that
hits all sectors equally, employment typically falls by about 3.5 percentage points (Graph I.D, left-hand
panel). The employment drop is almost three times larger (about 10 percentage points) after a severely
unbalanced recession.

There are signs that the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic could confirm this pattern, at least in
countries where progress with vaccinations is slow, delaying the relaxation of containment measures. Estimates
from a multi-sector macroeconomic model indicate that current constraints on customer service industries
could lower potential output in large AEs by up to 2% of GDP. The effects should loom even larger in small
open economies more reliant on industries such as tourism. Indeed, countries where customer service industries

end of 2021 (Graph I.D, centre panel).
Uneven recessions may also have far-reaching financial consequences. Because insolvencies tend to rise
more than proportionally with falling revenues, a downturn that reflects large contractions in a few sectors
should be expected to lead to larger credit losses than a more evenly spread one. According to one study,
estimates of pandemic-induced business credit losses that account for differences in economic conditions
across sectors can be up to 50% larger than those based on aggregate economic conditions alone (Graph I.D,
right-hand panel).

panel). If debts cannot be rolled over, meeting these repayments will require firms
to find ways to lower their costs or cut back on capital investment.15
Constrained financial institutions and highly indebted firms could also delay
the required reallocation of resources. Such a reallocation would be more pressing
in this scenario, given the persistent changes in consumer behaviour and increased
risk of “zombie” firms linked to the sustained downturn. Another factor potentially
holding back resource reallocation is blanket business support programmes. Over

Covid-19 and the corporate credit loss outlook

Box I.E

Corporate credit losses from the Covid-19 pandemic could increase as containment measures persist, new
consumption patterns and business practices accelerate the downsizing of specific sectors, and the exhaustion
of liquidity buffers pushes some firms into insolvency. These losses will need to be absorbed, either by the
financial system or by taxpayers. Yet there is considerable uncertainty about their future evolution. Much will
depend on the strength of the economic recovery, whether financial conditions remain accommodative and
on the extent and duration of government support.
This box examines the outlook for corporate credit losses through the lens of two approaches. The first is
top-down and based on sectoral-level analysis. This approach estimates credit loss rates (ie losses as a share
of total debt) at a sectoral level for the G7 countries, China and Australia. It applies existing estimates of the
sensitivity of credit losses to GDP to economic projections from a multi-sector macroeconomic model. The
model’s aggregate GDP projections are similar to the “central scenario” discussed in the main text, while the
sectoral projections account for the uneven effects of the pandemic on different economic sectors. The analysis
then uses data on bonds and bank loans by sector to map credit loss rates into total credit losses by country.
The second approach is bottom-up and based on firm-level data for nine AEs and nine EMEs. The
analysis involves three steps. First, a “shadow rating” is assigned to each firm based on historical patterns and
firm-level financial statement data for 2020 to measure its inherent credit quality. Second, a default rate is
assigned for each rating which depends on projected economic and financial conditions. Finally, firm-level
default probabilities are multiplied by loss-given-default (LGD) estimates, which vary by country, sector and
debt type, to compute credit losses. The specific firms covered in this analysis tend to enjoy better than
average credit quality, as they are primarily large firms that have published financial results for 2020. As a
result, this approach projects lower expected credit losses than the top-down one, which implicitly captures
the credit losses of all firms. However, even if based on a less representative sample, the bottom-up approach
can still shed light on the yearly change in credit losses and provide a comparison with experiences in previous
recessions.
The top-down approach suggests that credit losses could increase in 2021 relative to recent years.
Conditional on the model-based GDP projections, the approach estimates that credit loss rates for bonds
could peak at 1.9% in 2021, up from 0.5% in 2019 (Graph I.E, left-hand panel). Despite the substantial increases
for some countries and sectors, aggregate credit loss rates would rise by less than during the GFC, when loss
rates on non-financial corporate bond debt reached 2.9%.
The bottom-up baseline scenario presents a more optimistic outlook. Credit losses are projected to
actually decline in 2021 if the analysis is based on credit ratings estimated with end-2020 balance sheets, on
analysts’ cash flow forecasts for 2021, on current financial conditions and on Consensus 2021 GDP growth
forecasts (ie similar to the economic projections in the top-down analysis; see Graph I.E, centre and righthand panels, solid red and blue lines). Relative to their GFC peaks, projected credit losses in EMEs are higher
than in AEs, reflecting much larger GDP declines in many EMEs during the pandemic.
The bottom-up analysis, however, highlights the significant uncertainty around 2021 credit loss projections.
Much will depend on the duration and effectiveness of government support measures. Government support
reduces projected credit losses in three ways. First, by lowering default probabilities within each rating bucket
owing to the widespread provision of debt moratoriums and loan guarantees. Second, by influencing the
analysts’ cash flow forecasts used to assign firms to rating buckets. This influence can be both direct (eg furlough
schemes providing a boost to firm cash flows) and indirect (eg by raising aggregate GDP growth). Finally, by
flattering the firms’ end-2020 balance sheets. This translates into higher “shadow ratings” and lower projected
credit losses than might be warranted based on firms’ fundamentals alone.
Given the uncertainty about how much government support measures will suppress defaults, it is worth
considering a range of possibilities. The shaded fans in Graph I.E, centre and right-hand panels, show the
range of credit losses that could occur based on annual default rates over the past 25 years. To compute the
range, default rates for each rating bucket in a given year are applied to the estimated ratings based on 2021
cash flow forecasts and end-2020 balance sheet variables. The top and bottom of the range represent the
highest and lowest estimated credit losses produced by this method.
The baseline credit loss projection sits at the lower end of the range based on historical default probabilities.
This suggests that forecast earnings, and the macroeconomic projections on which they are based, are quite
optimistic about the efficacy of government support measures. By contrast, the upper bound of the projected
loss range implies an increase in non-financial corporate credit losses to roughly the same level as in the GFC
for AEs, and twice as high as in that episode for EMEs. Such a scenario is consistent with a continuation of
strained 2020 cash flows and a default incidence per rating bucket at the levels experienced during the GFC
(dotted line in Graph I.E, centre and right-hand panels).

Thus, credit losses could increase sharply if economic conditions deteriorate or government support
measures are less effective than anticipated. Large losses could also arise if the degree of sectoral reallocation
induced by the pandemic – implicitly captured in our analysis by sectoral GDP projections and analysts’
earnings forecasts – turns out to be larger than these approaches assume.

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

the past year, countries with larger credit guarantee schemes have seen less
reallocation of credit across firms (Graph I.14, centre panel). Larger guarantee
schemes have also gone hand in hand with less labour reallocation across firms
(right-hand panel). If they constrain resource reallocation to more productive firms,
these developments could hold back growth prospects even after lockdowns ease
and consumption growth recovers.
This scenario would be more challenging in many respects than the previous
one, particularly for EMEs. While global financial conditions would probably remain
supportive, policy space in these economies would be stretched if weaker domestic
economies and pre-existing vulnerabilities heightened international investors’ risk
aversion.

General considerations
The scenarios described above point to a number of considerations. First, it is
important to limit the spread of Covid-19 globally. Large virus outbreaks are
associated with the most adverse economic outcomes, particularly if the solvency of
financial institutions comes into question. This speaks to the value of international
cooperation in the provision of vaccines and support to health systems when they
come under pressure. Second, for some countries economic and financial turbulence
could arise despite strong global economic growth. This highlights the need for
policymakers to monitor emerging risks closely. Finally, for most countries the legacy
of the pandemic will probably be felt long after the virus is brought under control.
Corporate and private debt levels will remain high for years to come, and reallocation
of capital and labour has barely started. Policymakers will need to take account of
these developments when planning their response to evolving economic conditions.

Macroeconomic policy challenges
In the near term, the key macroeconomic policy task is to support the economy
through the recovery. The specific policy configuration will depend on the path of
economic activity, taking into account the uncertainties involved. In contrast to the
early phase of the crisis, large differences in economic conditions across countries
will call for a more differentiated approach, which will challenge countries where
economic conditions are weaker.
In the longer term, there are two policy prerogatives. The first is to gradually
normalise, once conditions allow, to regain space for both monetary and fiscal
policy. The second is to manage the relationship between the two policies in an
environment in which their implementation would be less interdependent than
during the early stages of the pandemic.

Near-term challenges
In the central scenario, the policy challenges would be a natural evolution of those
faced over the past year.16 Although the economic recovery has proved stronger
than expected, constraints on certain activities persist, and considerable uncertainty
surrounds the evolution of the pandemic and its long-term legacy. As a result,
following a risk management approach, authorities will need to continue to provide
the necessary support while facilitating the required reallocation of resources, even
while its extent and precise contours remain unclear. Ensuring that the inevitable
policy adjustments in the light of evolving economic conditions are not misinterpreted
poses a complex communication challenge.

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

The recovery, together with the need to preserve precious policy space,
suggests that fiscal policy will need to become more targeted. Indeed, in some
countries blanket stimulus is already being phased out. In Canada, for example,
broad-based wage subsidies have been replaced with hiring subsidies reserved for
firms whose revenues have yet to fully recover. As the crisis transitions from its
liquidity to its solvency phase, governments are also adjusting policies to better
distinguish viable from non-viable businesses in order to facilitate restructuring. In
Singapore, for instance, firms are now obliged to resume principal repayments on
loans covered by debt moratoriums and give banks more information about their
viability.17 At the same time, the high degree of uncertainty rewards flexibility.
Trade-offs arise here too. Experience suggests that quickly addressing the debt
overhang and cutting any sectoral excess capacity supports sounder recoveries
than a gradual approach.18 That said, a surge in firm closures could overwhelm
countries’ restructuring capacity.
Monetary policy will also need to remain accommodative but, as the recovery
progresses, central banks will face a delicate communication challenge. On the one
hand, there is the need to provide sufficient reassurance to avoid a market-driven
pre-emptive tightening of financial conditions. On the other, emphasising policy
predictability poses the risk of constraining central banks, making them unable to
adjust promptly if the economy surprises on the upside. In the trade-off, the
potential side effects of prolonged and extraordinary monetary accommodation
would play a role. Indeed, the continued exceptionally easy financial conditions and
unusual buoyancy of house prices have already raised some concerns. In recent
months, central banks in Australia, Canada and Switzerland, among others, have
highlighted the risks from soaring house prices in statements accompanying their
monetary policy decisions, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has been tasked
with considering the impact of its decisions on house prices when setting
policy.19 Central banks have tried to address this dilemma by modifying their
forward guidance, playing down the calendar-based aspects and emphasising its
dependence on economic conditions.20
Some central banks, however, may have little choice but to tighten. Already in
2021, higher inflation has prompted central banks in Brazil, Russia and Turkey to
hike interest rates. Should commodity prices continue to rise or global bond yields
resume their climb, other EME central banks could feel compelled to follow suit
(Box I.F). That said, not all EMEs are equally exposed to developments abroad. In
some East Asian countries, subdued inflation and ample foreign exchange reserves
could give central banks more scope to keep policy settings tailored to domestic
economic conditions.
Prudential policy faces two challenges. The first is ensuring that banks are
sufficiently well capitalised to absorb potential losses. Risks remain, although to
date banks have predicated their provisioning decisions on a smooth central
scenario, with some banks actually reducing loss provisions in the second half of
2020.21 Hence the active use of heightened monitoring to ensure that banks
recognise all impairments and price credit risks correctly. Authorities have also used
stress tests to gauge the financial system’s sensitivity to tough scenarios, such as a
renewed wave of strict lockdowns. The second challenge is helping to contain the
build-up of financial imbalances, particularly in housing markets. For instance, in
recent months prudential authorities in Canada, the Netherlands and New Zealand
have introduced macroprudential measures aimed at cooling the housing market,
including tighter loan-to-value limits and higher floors on the interest rates banks
use to evaluate mortgage affordability.
One limitation prudential policy will face in addressing the build-up of
vulnerabilities is that the current toolkit is not fully fit for purpose. The prudential

Tighter global financial conditions and EMEs

The strong economic recovery in many AEs and China is a mixed blessing for other EMEs. On the one hand,
faster global growth increases demand for EME exports and tends to lift commodity prices, benefiting their
exporters. On the other hand, stronger growth in AEs is typically accompanied by tighter global financial
conditions. Indeed, long-term bond yields have risen substantially in many countries in 2021, although
broader measures of financial conditions have so far remained exceptionally accommodative. This confluence
raises three related questions. First, does the cause of higher US bond yields matter for the tightening of
global financial conditions? Second, how vulnerable are EMEs to such a tightening? And third, what could
policymakers do to manage the fallout?
Rising US long-term bond yields have often preceded tighter financial conditions in EMEs, but the
intensity of the impact varies greatly across episodes. Some, such as those beginning in February 1994 and
May 2013 (known as the “taper tantrum”) coincided with capital outflows, a sharp rise in funding costs and
lower equity prices (Graph I.F.1, left-hand and centre panels). The taper tantrum also prompted large exchange
rate depreciations in several EMEs (right-hand panel). Exchange rates did not initially respond as much in
1994, in part because many EMEs had exchange rate pegs. However, several EMEs experienced large devaluations
a few months later, most notably Mexico, which received assistance from international organisations to cope
with the resulting financial crisis. By contrast, some other episodes of rising US bond yields were much more
benign. For example, the gradual increase in US long-term bond yields that began in April 1999 was associated
with stable bond spreads and rising equity prices in EMEs. While exchange rates depreciated in some EMEs in
that episode, they appreciated in others.

Financial market expectations of monetary policy in the United States are key in determining whether a
rise in US yields generates disruptive spillovers. Both the 1994 episode and the taper tantrum involved a
sharp financial market reassessment of the likely pace of US monetary policy tightening. In contrast, the rise in
yields in 1999 seemed to largely reflect gradually evolving expectations of higher US inflation on the back of a
long expansion rather than large US monetary policy surprises.
Besides US monetary policy, factors related to the composition of capital inflows influence whether
higher US bond yields will trigger a financial tightening in EMEs. US yield increases that occur after a period of

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

27

trend EME currency appreciations and sizeable capital inflows, typically on the back of strong risk-taking, are
more often associated with tighter financial conditions. A larger amount of foreign currency debt and greater
participation of foreign investors in local currency sovereign debt markets also tends to exacerbate the effect
of rising US yields on EME financial conditions.
In addition to debt composition, investor perceptions of the fundamentals and creditworthiness of EMEs
can be important determinants of the severity of the hit to EMEs as a group and individually. By some
measures, EMEs look to be better placed than in the past. Foreign exchange reserves are generally higher and
current account balances more favourable than in previous episodes of rising US bond yields (Graph I.F.2, lefthand panel). Bank credit ratings are also somewhat higher on average than in previous episodes, albeit with a
wide dispersion (centre panel). Despite generally low interest rates, private sector debt service ratios are, on
average, at a similar level to the past and could rise rapidly if funding costs increased. Many EMEs also have
more resilient institutional settings. In particular, improved monetary policy frameworks have made for better
anchored inflation expectations, moderating exchange rate pass-through into consumer prices. These
factors should reduce the likelihood and size of capital outflows in response to tightening financial conditions.

However, by other measures, in particular related to fiscal positions, EMEs look more vulnerable than in
past episodes. To cushion the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, many EMEs are running large fiscal deficits,
public and external debt levels in relation to GDP have generally increased, and credit ratings have deteriorated,
at least for local currency debt (Graph I.F.2, right-hand panel). Historically, these vulnerabilities have coincided
with greater investor retrenchments.
Of course, there are again significant differences today across countries along these dimensions. Some
may be more resilient because of, say, more robust financial sectors or less dependence on external financing;
others may be more vulnerable, either because of international investors’ perceptions about the stability of
policy frameworks or because fiscal deficits are not counterbalanced by expectations of strong growth
potential over the medium term. There is evidence that international investors have become more attuned
over time to these and other cross-country differences in vulnerabilities.
If global financial conditions tighten, EME policymakers will have to respond, for which they can draw on
their experience and pragmatism in deploying a broad set of tools. Foreign exchange intervention, which is
relatively nimble, can serve as a first line of defence against undue currency volatility resulting from swings in

28

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

capital flows. In addition to operating in spot markets, providing protection against exchange rate swings for
lenders and domestic investors can help compensate for thin hedging markets. At the same time, foreign
exchange reserves are finite and in some cases may be insufficient to cope with a severe financial tightening.
Meanwhile, a number of monetary policy instruments can be used to stabilise financial markets and influence
domestic financial conditions. Although lowering interest rates is the standard monetary response to
worsening economic conditions, EME central banks are often constrained from doing so when financial
conditions tighten as it can hasten capital outflows. At such times, balance sheet operations can offer an extra
degree of freedom for central banks as they formulate their response. The use of asset purchases in particular
can provide support for local currency bond markets, which have become more important in many EMEs.
Refinancing operations for financial institutions are another option for shoring up market functioning,
supporting the flow of credit and offsetting a tightening of financial conditions. Where macroprudential
regulations have previously been used to strengthen the resilience of financial institutions, these can be eased.
However, macroprudential policies are ill-suited to dealing with a sudden worsening of conditions, given their
long implementation and transmission lags.
The exact mix of tools and their sequencing will depend on country-specific features and economic
circumstances. For example, some central banks in countries with a history of fiscal dominance and high
inflation are prohibited from purchasing government securities. Or they may face tight limits on such
purchases or simply be reluctant to do so. The nature of vulnerabilities is also key. The need for foreign
exchange intervention, for example, will be determined in large part by the prevalence of unhedged foreign
exchange exposures, which can reside in a variety of sectors. Similarly, the benefits of asset purchases depend
importantly on the degree of foreign participation in local currency bond markets as well as the ability of local
financial institutions to step in and absorb any selling pressure. Determining the most appropriate mix and
sequence of tools to deploy promptly during periods of heightened financial market stress is a key practical
challenge.

tools at the command of authorities do not cover many non-bank financial
institutions.22 The post-GFC financial reforms targeted primarily banks, insurance
companies and market infrastructures, in particular central counterparties (CCPs),
but large swathes of the financial system have not seen significant reforms. The
asset management industry – the territory of both leveraged and unleveraged
players – is the most notable example. It is these institutions that were at the
epicentre of the tremors in March 2020 and among which the most recent signs of
stress have emerged, including in the cryptocurrency segments.23 A prolonged
period of aggressive risk-taking suggests that substantial leverage and liquidity
mismatches may hide below the surface. Work is under way in the international
community to tackle some of the structural vulnerabilities in this area.24 In the near
term, the challenge will be to monitor developments closely and to make sure that
the core of the financial system, notably banks and CCPs, remains resilient.
In the first alternative scenario, where growth and inflation exceed expectations
and financial conditions tighten, policies may need to be recalibrated. Fiscal
authorities could afford to phase out accommodation more quickly, although there is
considerable inertia built in to some of the announced initiatives. Prudential policy,
meanwhile, could ensure that prudential buffers return to pre-crisis levels faster.

Monetary policy would face the trickiest challenges. A tightening of financial
conditions in response to an inflation surprise – most likely in the United States – would
put central banks in a delicate position. If a central bank disagreed with the market
assessment, it could remain committed to a more accommodative stance and
attempt to shape expectations of the economic outlook and its reaction function.
This would not necessarily be a smooth process, and bouts of market volatility
would be likely so long as investors continued to doubt the central bank’s economic
projections or commitment to its stated policy trajectory. Communication would be
tested even more than in the central scenario. The final outcome would depend on
the actual inflation trajectory and the speed with which market expectations adapt.
Spillovers to the rest of the world would raise different issues. Where higher
inflation would be welcome given past undershoots of targets, central banks could
afford to remain patient. By contrast, more EME central banks than in the central
scenario would be under pressure to tighten, especially where currencies dropped
and fuelled inflation above tolerable levels. This would further widen the divergence
in economic conditions around the world.
In the second alternative scenario, where growth disappoints, even more
accommodative policies may be called for. In hindsight, many economies entered the
pandemic with more room to provide policy accommodation than had previously
been realised, in the case of EMEs facilitated by monetary and financial easing in
AEs. However, providing additional stimulus could test policy space in a number of
countries. Some may need to reintroduce emergency measures used early last year,
such as liquidity provision to financial institutions and support for corporate bond
markets, particularly if financial markets seized up. Additional support for businesses
may be also required. Again, EMEs would be particularly vulnerable, not least
because they have already depleted much of their conventional policy space and
the use of unconventional measures there is subject to more constraints – of an
economic and political economy nature – than in AEs.
This scenario would also exacerbate the intertemporal trade-offs. By prolonging
the duration of exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, it would risk further
stoking imbalances in asset prices, particularly in housing markets. A further narrowing
of interest rate margins would challenge bank profitability and make it more
difficult to rebuild capital. The combination of weak banks, easy financial conditions
and low business profitability could see the emergence of more zombie firms,
leaving a legacy of lower productivity growth.

Longer-term challenges
Peering further into the future, once the pandemic is left behind and the economy
is restored to health, a key challenge will be to reorient policy back towards longerterm objectives. This will involve fostering a sustainable path to stronger growth
while at the same time gradually normalising monetary and fiscal policies and
dealing effectively with any tension that might arise between the two along that
path. In doing so, policymakers will have to contend with the legacy of the pandemic,
including much higher public debt, lower interest rates and larger central bank
balance sheets.
Normalising monetary and fiscal policy over the longer term would provide
safety margins to cope with both unexpected and unwelcome developments, such
as the current pandemic and inevitable future recessions. The starting point is
unprecedented. On the one hand, fiscal expansion has pushed government debtto-GDP ratios to levels on a par with, or higher than, those in the aftermath of World
War II (Graph I.15, left-hand panel). On the other hand, according to historical
records, nominal interest rates have never been so low (right-hand panel). In fact,

they are so low that, despite the exceptionally high debt ratios, debt service costs
are at historical troughs. The debt burden has never felt so light.
Policy normalisation cannot be taken for granted. The years leading up to the
Covid-19 pandemic illustrate the challenges. Pre-pandemic, few central banks had
managed to raise policy interest rates from the levels prevailing in the immediate
aftermath of the GFC, even in countries that saw a long economic expansion and
low unemployment rates. In many AEs, central bank balance sheets grew further, to
peacetime highs. Public debt levels generally rose too, before the pandemic pushed
them higher still.
One reason why normalisation is so hard is because it involves intertemporal
trade-offs. The costs of normalisation, such as generally lower growth and higher
unemployment, are immediate and concrete. Its benefits, such as having more
room to combat economic downturns, are less tangible and accrue only in the future.
Paradoxically, these difficulties are felt most keenly in AEs, where policymakers have
greater freedom to delay normalisation to avoid its contractionary effects. In EMEs,
where financial markets are typically less tolerant of narrowing policy headroom,
the greater risk may be a premature tightening despite a weak economy.
A second reason reflects economic conditions. Ideally, faster growth and a
pickup in inflation would support normalisation. But generating sustained inflation
has proved surprisingly difficult, especially in AEs, where it has remained stubbornly
below targets. While the large fiscal stimulus programmes under way in a number
of countries could boost inflation in the years ahead, the evidence indicates that
this is more likely in EMEs (Box I.G). Normalisation could be easier for central banks
that pay greater attention to output and financial imbalances and that are more
willing to tolerate inflation shortfalls providing that longer-run expectations remain
anchored. Even so, if inflation fails to pick up, there is a limit to how far central
banks can normalise without threatening the credibility of their current inflation
objectives. How much inflation will rise on a sustainable basis remains an open

Fiscal inflation?

The policy response to Covid-19 has strengthened the nexus between fiscal and monetary policy. In the early
stages of the crisis this involved close cooperation between the two policies to stabilise financial markets and
cushion the impact of the pandemic on households and firms. This, however, has contributed to record-high
public debt and deficits, rising central bank holdings of public debt and a high sensitivity of government debt
service burdens to monetary policy. Some observers have also expressed concern that the historically large
increase in deficits could lead to resurgent inflation. The inflationary consequences of the US fiscal stimulus
are currently a subject of debate. In addition, fiscal vulnerabilities have been prominent in a number of
historical episodes of high inflation and macroeconomic instability, especially in EMEs.
Graph I.G shows evidence that the relationship between an increase in fiscal deficits and the distribution
of future inflation outcomes has been considerably stronger in EMEs than in AEs. The underlying “inflation at
risk” model relates the one-year-ahead distribution of possible inflation outcomes to the change in fiscal
deficits, as well as to output growth, current inflation, the change in the exchange rate and the oil price, and a
dummy variable for sovereign debt crises. The estimates, based on a sample that includes a number of
high-inflation episodes, suggest that a one standard deviation increase in EME fiscal deficits raises inflation by
5.5 percentage points at the median of the distribution (first panel); this effect is more than 10 times larger
than that for AEs (second panel). The evidence is consistent with other findings in the literature. In particular,
a number of studies find that deficits have larger effects on inflation in countries with higher inflation rates or
during periods of higher inflation globally.

Fiscal-monetary policy interactions affect the strength of the deficit-inflation link. Reflecting the importance
of the monetary regime, the third panel suggests that an increase in deficits leads to a smaller increase in
future inflation in inflation targeting regimes. A one standard deviation increase in EME fiscal deficits is

32

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

estimated to raise future inflation by around 0.8 percentage points when a central bank pursues inflation
targeting, and by 6.5 percentage points when another monetary policy regime is in place (Graph I.G, third panel).
Given the prevalence of price stability-oriented monetary policy frameworks in EMEs in recent years – for
example, over two thirds of G20 EMEs now pursue inflation targeting – inflation risks from higher deficits are
probably much more muted than in the past.
Exchange rate dynamics could partly account for the observed differences between AEs and EMEs. A
fiscal expansion could lead to a loss of investor confidence, especially if a country is perceived to have little or
no fiscal space. As sovereign risk rises, pressure for the exchange rate to depreciate may build and inflation
expectations may start to drift away from target. Such effects could be especially relevant in EMEs as they
generally have less perceived fiscal space and their inflation is more sensitive to exchange rate movements.
Indeed, empirical estimates suggest that in EMEs a rise in fiscal deficits increases the probability of larger
exchange rate depreciations (Graph I.G, fourth panel, bars). By contrast, higher deficits do not appear to affect
exchange rates in an economically or statistically significant way in AEs (dots).
In conclusion, higher deficits can translate into higher inflation pressures, with the effects likely to vary
significantly across economies. Relevant factors include the extent of fiscal space, the credibility of monetary
policy and the degree to which inflation expectations are anchored – often working in close interaction with
exchange rates.

deficits also generally have an economically larger effect on the right-hand tail of the inflation distribution, implying that
they raise upside inflation risks in particular. However, the differences in the effects along the distribution are generally not
statistically significant.     See eg L Catao and M Terrones, “Fiscal deficits and inflation”, Journal of Monetary Economics,

question, not least because the longer-term effects of the pandemic on structural
forces such as globalisation and technology have yet to play out.
A third reason is that postponing normalisation beyond a certain point may
actually make it harder. Keeping monetary policy accommodative to support fiscal
consolidation could encourage a further build-up of financial imbalances in the
private sector. Given the exceptionally low service burdens, it could also induce
further increases in government debt. In both cases, the economy’s sensitivity to
higher interest rates would rise.
The joint need to normalise monetary and fiscal policies poses specific
challenges. Along the path, normalisation in one area could complicate normalisation
in the other. Fiscal consolidation would act as a drag on economic activity and
inflation, hindering prospects for monetary policy normalisation. Conversely, given
increased debt burdens, higher interest rates would increase the size of the required
fiscal adjustment. In fact, the interest sensitivity of service costs is already very high.
For example, should interest rates return to the levels prevailing in the mid-1990s,
when inflation had already been conquered, median service costs would exceed
the previous wartime peaks (Graph I.15, right-hand panel).
From this perspective, large-scale central bank purchases of government debt
can heighten the interest rate sensitivity of borrowing costs. Considering the
consolidated public sector balance sheet, these operations retire long-term
government debt from the market and replace it with overnight debt – interest-

bearing central bank reserves. Indeed, despite the general tendency for governments
to issue at longer maturities, central bank purchases have shortened the effective
maturity of public debt. Where central banks have used such purchases more
extensively, some 15–45% of public debt in the large AE jurisdictions is in effect
overnight.25
One cause for optimism concerning fiscal policy normalisation prospects is that
interest rates have been generally below growth rates for some time. Such a
favourable configuration sets a ceiling on the ratio of debt to GDP for a given fiscal
deficit and means that the ratio will start to decline when deficits are sufficiently
small. It can also facilitate an increase in the average duration of public debt,
lowering rollover risk in countries where fiscal sustainability is a concern. And
indeed, interest rate-growth differentials are very favourable from a longer-term
perspective (Graph I.16, left-hand panel), in part because real interest rates have
been negative for an exceptionally long time.
However, the history of successful episodes of consolidation raises a note of
caution. Successful debt-to-GDP reductions have relied exclusively on a favourable
interest rate-growth differential only in a small fraction (22%) of cases. Primary
surpluses alone have hardly ever succeeded (only 15% of cases), particularly when
public debt is high (Graph I.16, centre panel). Instead, a combination of surpluses
and favourable interest rate-growth differentials has generally been necessary (64%
of cases). Such a combination naturally also increases the speed of adjustment, by

some 50% (right-hand panel). Thus, the window of opportunity provided by
favourable interest rate-growth differentials should not be missed.
The fact that, along the normalisation path, the objectives of fiscal and monetary
policy could give rise to tensions raises the spectre of fiscal dominance.26 Fiscal
dominance denotes a situation in which monetary policy is unable to tighten as a
result of fiscal constraints. The mechanism operates through the sensitivity of debt
service costs to higher interest rates.
Fiscal dominance can arise for two reasons: economic conditions and political
economy pressures. In the case of fiscal dominance related to economic conditions,
higher interest rates cause major economic damage, forcing the central bank to
refrain from tightening even when it would otherwise be desirable to do so. An
archetypal example in EMEs is when the higher interest rates necessary to counter
inflation undermine the government’s creditworthiness, triggering a disruptive
capital outflow, a sharp currency depreciation and even higher inflation. In the case
of political economy pressures, the government forces the central bank to deviate
from its objectives in order to limit the rise in its borrowing costs. All this suggests
that the risk of fiscal dominance depends on institutional and economic factors,
and is generally higher where the creditworthiness of the sovereign is weaker.
The remedies for fiscal dominance depend on the type. Addressing political
economy pressures puts a premium on strong institutional arrangements to
buttress the central bank’s autonomy. But when the origin is purely economic
constraints, even an independent central bank may have little choice but to keep
interest rates low. In this case, the only remedy is fiscal consolidation.
Given the scale of the challenges involved, a key imperative is to adopt policies
that strengthen sustainable growth without seeking to achieve it simply through
easy monetary policy or fiscal stimulus. Structural reforms that promote a vibrant,
flexible and competitive economy are essential. At the current juncture, those
facilitating a reallocation of resources in the light of the pandemic-induced changes
in demand patterns have a specific role to play. In addition, besides a supportive
tax regime, the allocation of government expenditure matters. The necessary large
increases in government transfers to households and firms during the pandemic
seem to have come at the cost of lower public investment. Shifting the composition
of spending back towards investment as economic conditions improve would
provide welcome support. That said, as history indicates, the political economy
obstacles to the implementation of growth-friendly policies should not be
underestimated.

Securing a durable recovery
After the travails of the past 18 months, global economic activity is expanding
vigorously. But, as this chapter has emphasised, the recovery has been very uneven,
with its speed and extent varying substantially across countries and sectors. Even in
the central scenario, countries’ economic conditions could diverge further in the
coming year, given differences in vaccination rates and policy stimulus. The more
challenging scenarios described above would exacerbate these differences, with
many EMEs being among the most vulnerable. The recovery’s unevenness also
heightens the near-term policy challenges, particularly in countries where tighter
global financial conditions could go hand in hand with sluggish domestic recoveries.
In addition to meeting these near-term challenges, securing a durable recovery
will require addressing the more enduring consequences of the pandemic. A
sustainable expansion cannot rely on policy stimulus alone. Even if the sectoral
composition of economic activity reverts to its pre-pandemic pattern as constraints

ease, changes such as the unprecedented adoption of remote work and expansion
of online retailing are unlikely to be fully reversed. How these developments play
out will have widespread implications, including for individual firms, asset classes
(not least commercial property) and financial services, such as the digitisation of
payments (Chapter III). In some sectors, pandemic-induced shifts in business
practices could accelerate innovation and investment. Policymakers can encourage
this process, with a leading example being incentives to adopt green energy, as
included in several countries’ fiscal recovery packages.
While presenting new opportunities, the pandemic-induced structural changes
will not benefit everyone. As the economic landscape evolves, some firms will close
and some workers will lose their jobs. This process could pose a number of social
challenges, including by raising inequality. Many branches of economic policy have
a role to play in addressing them, including monetary policy (Chapter II).

II. The distributional footprint of monetary policy

Key takeaways
•

The long-term rise in economic inequality since the 1980s is largely due to structural factors, well
outside the reach of monetary policy, and is best addressed by fiscal and structural policies.

•

Monetary policy can most effectively contribute to a more equitable society by fulfilling its
mandate, which addresses two key factors causing inequality at shorter horizons. This requires
keeping inflation low and limiting the incidence and duration of macroeconomic and financial
instability, which disproportionately hurt the poor.

•

Central banks can also help mitigate economic inequality wearing their “non-monetary hats”,
notably as prudential authorities, promoters of financial development and inclusion, and guardians
of payment systems.

The distribution of income and wealth, or economic opportunities more broadly, has
gained prominence in policy debates over the past decades. Heightened awareness
of these issues owes in large part to a broad-based increase in economic inequality,
a trend that the uneven impact of the Covid-19 recession has exacerbated.
The growing focus on rising inequality in the central banking community,
however, is more recent and dates back to the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). In its
aftermath, central banks have deployed policies featuring exceptionally low interest
rates and extensive use of balance sheets to support economic activity and lower
unemployment. Such measures have fuelled concerns that central banks’ actions,
by boosting asset prices, have benefited mostly the rich, shining the spotlight on
the distributional footprint of monetary policy.
Central bankers’ greater attention to inequality concerns is reflected in the
growing references to “inequality” in their public speeches (Graph II.1, left-hand
panel). An analysis of the context in which inequality is mentioned suggests that
central banks acknowledge the challenges posed by rising income and wealth
inequality and stress the relevance of policies, including their own, in addressing
distributional considerations (right-hand panel).
This chapter reviews the relation between economic inequality and the
formulation and conduct of monetary policy. The trends of rising inequality since
the 1980s are due to structural factors, well outside the reach of monetary policy.
That said, inequality influences the transmission mechanism of monetary policy
and, in turn, is affected by monetary policy over shorter time spans. The two main
causes of inequality at business cycle frequency are high inflation and recessions,
which disproportionately hurt the disadvantaged in society. Addressing these
factors is precisely what central bank mandates call for. Therefore, the most effective
way monetary policy can contribute to a more equitable society is to pursue its
mandated objectives. This means keeping inflation low and limiting the incidence
and duration of macroeconomic and financial instability. This task, however, has
become increasingly complex over time due to a change in the nature of the
business cycle: with inflation low and stable, as well as less responsive to economic
slack, financial factors have come to play a bigger role in amplifying business cycle

fluctuations. This has given rise to intertemporal trade-offs between near-term
price stability, on the one hand, and financial and hence macroeconomic stability in
the longer term – trade-offs that, by the same token, also apply to the impact of
monetary policy on inequality. To better address these trade-offs, a more balanced
mix of prudential, fiscal and structural policies is called for as part of a holistic
macro-financial stability framework.
At the same time, central banks can also help tackle inequality wearing their
“non-monetary hats”. These include, in particular, their responsibilities as prudential
authorities, promoters of financial development and inclusion, and guardians of
payment systems.
This chapter is organised as follows. The first section briefly summarises longterm trends in inequality and their structural causes. The second examines how
inequality increases in the absence of price and macroeconomic, including financial,
stability – the goals enshrined in monetary policy mandates. The third delves more
deeply into the two-way relationship between inequality and the conduct of
monetary policy and highlights how changes in the nature of the business cycle
have given rise to short-run trade-offs between central banks’ main objectives. The
fourth considers the critical role of other policies in both complementing monetary
policy in stabilising the economy and tackling the structural causes of inequality.
The final section concludes.

poverty rates had declined globally, and especially so in EMEs (Graph II.2, left-hand
panel). These countries also saw their median income catch up with that of
advanced economies (AEs). As a result, inequality across countries declined.
At the same time, the within-country distribution of pre-tax and pre-transfer
income1 increasingly became more concentrated at the top. Standard measures of
within-country income inequality, such as the Gini coefficient or the share of
income accruing to the top 10% of earners, have trended up globally from the
1980s (Graph II.2, centre panel).2 Wealth inequality, in contrast, started from higher
levels globally and increased more visibly in EMEs than in AEs (right-hand panel).
Yet looking more closely at the top of the wealth distribution reveals a marked
increase in the concentration of wealth also in some AEs (Box II.A).
The opposing trends in poverty and income inequality within countries reflect
the different concepts they represent. Poverty quantifies the distance of current
income from a certain threshold.3 Inequality captures differences in income (or
wealth) levels across segments of the population. As such, inequality can increase
even if all households benefit from economic growth, if they do so to a varying
extent. Conversely, absent economic growth, a society can be more equal but
remain or become poor.

Box II.A

A taxonomy of inequality

The concept of economic inequality relates to a distribution of valuable “resources” (eg income, wealth or
more generally opportunities) within a given population. As such, inequality is inherently a relative concept
and is not synonymous with welfare. Nevertheless, economic inequality has important implications for social
cohesion and has been studied for centuries.
By far the most widely studied forms of economic inequality concern income and wealth. Wealth
inequality arises from cumulative income flows and from valuation effects on the existing stock of wealth. This
complicates the comparison of income and wealth inequality. Conceptually, measures of wealth should include
the (discounted) value of future income from human and financial wealth. Financial wealth is relatively easily
measured through the price of assets traded on markets, although there is inevitable arbitrariness when
valuing non-liquid assets such as housing or non-traded equities (eg ownership of small and medium-sized
enterprises). Measuring human wealth is even more challenging, as there are no obvious proxies for the
discounted present value of income from labour. For this reason, measures of wealth inequality generally omit
human wealth altogether – as is also the case in this chapter. Income inequality, by contrast, is generally easier
to measure, as data on income flows are routinely collected by tax authorities and surveys.
Measuring inequality typically involves summarising the heterogeneity in the distribution of the variable
of interest in a single number. Popular approaches involve looking at the share of income or wealth accruing to
different percentiles of the population, eg the top 10% or 1%, as well as taking ratios of top and bottom percentiles,
eg the top 20% over the bottom 20%. Other measures instead seek to be more comprehensive and summarise the
entire distribution by means of indices, such as the one bearing the name of Italian statistician Corrado Restricted
Gini.
Different measures may yield different results, depending on which part of the distribution they focus on.

More refined measures can reflect alternative facets of economic inequality and help governments better
calibrate their policies. For instance, in most jurisdictions, the increase in overall income inequality over the
past four decades has been largely due to a rise in the share of income accruing to the top 10% of earners,
coupled with a mild decline in the share of income going to the bottom 10% (Graph II.A, left-hand panel).
Similarly, decomposing the top 10% of the income distribution itself (top 10% to top 1%; top 1% to top 0.1%;
and top 0.1%) reveals interesting patterns (centre panel). While for most EMEs income gains were fairly broadbased and shared across the three top percentiles, the bulk of the increase in income inequality in some major
AEs (the United States, United Kingdom, France and Canada) is accounted for by the top 1% and even the top
0.1%; in fact in Canada, households in the top 10% of the income distribution – though not those in the top
1% – actually saw a small decline in their share of aggregate income over the past four decades.
Wealth inequality has always been quite high and relatively more stable than income inequality, especially
in AEs. For the set of countries for which data are available, the increase in wealth concentration over the past
30–40 years appears to reflect mainly the increase in the share of the very rich, the top 0.1%. In France and
the United States, those in the top 10% excluding the top 1% of the wealth distribution have actually seen
their share of aggregate wealth decline, to the advantage of the top 1% (Graph II.A, right-hand panel).

Technological progress has increased the productivity of highly skilled workers

played an important role. Empirical evidence suggests that over the past three
decades, an increase in total factor productivity growth – a proxy for the impact of
technology on the production process – has been associated with an increase in
the Gini index of income inequality (Graph II.3, left-hand panel).

Particularly in AEs, delocalisation-induced job losses in the manufacturing sectors
have probably pushed lower-skilled workers towards lower value-added jobs, often
in the service sectors. Empirical evidence confirms the link: globalisation goes hand
in hand with rising within-country income inequality (Graph II.3, right-hand panel).
Globalisation and technological progress have naturally reinforced each other.5
Together, they have also given rise to the emergence of large “winner takes all”
industries in some sectors, thereby further increasing profits and the income share
of capital at the expense of that of labour.6
That said, the ultimate impact of these forces on pre-tax inequality is policydependent (see below).7 The benefits and opportunities that technological progress
and globalisation bring could be shared more equally with the help of adequate
education and training. For example, technological progress and globalisation
boost the demand for highly skilled workers and polarise income distribution by
increasing skill premia. Hence policies that raise the supply of skilled workers can
mitigate the impact on inequality.8
Covid-19 has further exacerbated inequality due to its uneven impact and is
likely to have left a significant longer-term imprint given its specific nature. The
pandemic has disproportionately hit the services sector, which employs more lowskilled and low-income workers (see also Chapter I). Moreover, it has given further
impetus to e‑commerce and technological adoption more broadly, including in
working arrangements. These demand-induced effects may be lasting ones,
resulting in an impact that goes way beyond that of a standard recession.

Inequality and monetary policy mandates
Long-term structural factors such as globalisation and technology shape the
environment in which monetary policy operates, but are clearly outside its
influence. That said, monetary policy plays a key role in shaping other determinants
of inequality at shorter horizons. Two forms of macroeconomic instability – falling
squarely within monetary policy mandates9 – are especially important in this
context, as they disproportionately penalise the weaker segments of the
population. One is high and volatile inflation, which has been particularly
important in many EMEs and is frequently coupled with meagre growth. The other
is recessions, particularly when accompanied by financial instability and crises,
which increase their depth and duration.10 How do these two forces, over which
monetary policy has a substantial influence, affect inequality more specifically?
Consider each in turn.

Inequality and inflation
In most AEs and in several EMEs, inflation has been low and stable over the past
several decades. Yet it would be imprudent to forget the costs of high and runaway
inflation. It is well understood that uncontrolled inflation leads to a significant
misallocation of resources and numerous inefficiencies and hence to overall lower
economic growth.11 While high and runaway inflation, such as that experienced by
many AEs in the 1970s, can hamper growth, hyperinflation of the likes of Germany
in the 1920s or Latin America in the 1980s can wreak economic havoc and in the
process destroy public trust in governments and institutions.
The impact of inflation on inequality has been widely studied. Inflation shifts
income and wealth away from those who are least aware of it, or least able to
protect against it. These segments of the population often coincide with lowerincome groups, which explains why inflation has often been portrayed as a most

44

regressive form of tax. The “inflation tax” takes its toll through the erosion of the
value of financial assets and contracts fixed in nominal terms.
As regards wealth distribution, the financial assets that are most vulnerable to
inflation are cash and bank accounts – the typical savings vehicles held by the
poorest segments of the population. This is mostly because the poorest have access
only to limited investment options to protect their savings. By contrast, not only
can richer households avail themselves of more sophisticated inflation hedges; they
may also be able to easily transfer their assets abroad, thus shielding their wealth
from depreciations of the domestic currency.
As regards income distribution, wages and pensions – the main sources of
income for a large majority of households and even more so for the poorest half of
the population – are typically fixed in nominal terms and hence vulnerable to
inflation. Indexation mechanisms, such as those adopted in many AEs in the 1970s,
are no panacea: they may fail to keep pace as inflation accelerates (Graph II.4, lefthand panel); and they may themselves fuel and entrench inflation further.
The impact of inflation on income inequality depends on how high the inflation
rate is. In particular, the erosion of real wages (Graph II.4, right-hand panel) is very
small for an inflation rate of 5% (or less) per year, but becomes sizeable when
inflation steps up to 20% – even when wages are adjusted at a quarterly frequency.
The cost of 20% inflation is about 2% of annual earnings when there are quarterly
wage adjustments, but jumps to 8.5% when wages are adjusted only once a year.
The impact on wages is the most sizeable effect of inflation on the bottom of the
income distribution; only a tiny share of the overall loss is due to the erosion of
cash savings for the poor, given their relatively small holdings.

look at the cross-country evolution of the income Gini index around 34 “conquests
of inflation” during the past 30 years. In the cases involving EMEs, the median
income Gini index declined by two points in the seven to eight years after central
banks reduced annual inflation below 5% on a sustained basis (Graph II.5, left-hand
panel). The benefits of lower inflation in the form of a more equal income
distribution may partly reflect that it brings an overall improvement in the business
environment, thereby boosting economic growth.12
By contrast, other countries that did not sustainably reduce inflation or whose
inflation was already below 5% – the non-event countries – experienced a mild
increase in inequality. That said, for AEs which sustainably reduced inflation to
below 5%, the relationship between inflation and income inequality is similar to
that for the group of countries that did not attain such a reduction, suggesting that
other factors have prevailed in pushing up inequality.
Exchange rate fluctuations are an important factor strengthening the link
between inflation and income inequality in EMEs. Naturally, high inflation rates do
not bode well for the stability of the domestic currency. In turn, exchange rate
depreciations pass through domestic prices more strongly than in AEs, which fuels
and entrenches inflation. The frequency of large currency depreciations clearly
increases with the level of inflation (Graph II.5, right-hand panel). This, in turn, raises
the risk of outright crises, which increase unemployment and inequality.

Inequality and recessions
Recessions are particularly harmful for the most disadvantaged because
unemployment tends to hit unskilled workers harder and for longer. The experience
4
BIS XX Annual Report
during the Covid-19 pandemic is a case in point: low-income earners were the first
to be laid off (Graph II.6, left-hand panel) and often faced significant difficulties

46

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

when trying to re‑enter the labour market (centre panel).13 Even when successful,
unskilled workers might be forced to accept jobs paying lower salaries and offering
fewer advancement opportunities compared with their pre-recession jobs.
The impact of weak economic activity on income inequality, while initially
small, tends to grow over time (Graph II.6, right-hand panel). A stylised exercise
illustrates this by tracing out the effect of an increase in unemployment, as typically
experienced during recessions. Estimates point to an only slight increase in income
inequality in the short run that then rises substantially over time.
While recessions tend to increase inequality, inequality, in turn, can intensify
the depth and duration of recessions. As a result, recessions and inequality can
reinforce each other over business cycle fluctuations. Aggregate demand shortfalls
during downturns appear to be larger when the income distribution is more
polarised, ie when the top earners account for a larger share of total income at the
expense of the bottom earners. As noted above, low-income workers are typically
the first to be laid off and hence see their incomes disproportionately curtailed. As
much evidence confirms, the propensity to consume is higher for households with
low income. Hence, if those at the bottom of the distribution lose their income in a
downturn, a sharper contraction in aggregate consumption follows.

Estimated declines in real per capita private consumption during a recession at the specified percentile of income inequality. Recessions
are defined as a year of negative real GDP growth, and the share of income of the top 10% is taken as the indicator of income inequality.

consumption growth is regressed on its lag, a recession dummy, the share of income held by the top 10% and the interaction between the
latter two variables. Based on 1981–2019 data for 91 countries. Financial recessions are recessions that were associated with sovereign debt,
banking or currency crises. For further details, see E Kohlscheen, M Lombardi and E Zakrajšek, “Income inequality and the depth of economic

for more than a quarter of the variation in state-level consumption growth during
the GFC. This is so even after filtering out the impact of the increases in state-level
unemployment rates and declines in house prices.
There is also evidence that financial recessions, even if they do not coincide
with financial crises, are deeper and longer, and hence more costly in terms of
inequality (Graph II.8). One way of seeing this is by considering recessions preceded
by relatively high debt service ratios – a proxy for overindebtedness. The estimates
suggest that eight quarters after the start of the recession, the average output drop
is 2.5% larger and unemployment is 12% higher in financial recessions than in
normal ones.
Inequality may not just amplify recessions; more subtly, it may also sow the
seeds for them. For instance, it has been argued that higher inequality in the
United States may have contributed to the build-up of housing debt. This was
particularly the case for households with stagnating and less steady income, who
were enticed into subprime borrowing. In turn, this higher leverage of households
played a key amplifying role in the GFC, the archetypical “financial recession”. The
reasoning is that low-income households have a larger need to borrow (eg to buy
houses). If credit supply becomes more ample, this could encourage them to
become overindebted. Down the road, an overburdened household sector can
then trigger, or at least amplify, phases of weak economic activity. This impact is
larger whenever the banking system comes under stress. Indeed, some observers
have argued that this mechanism contributed to the subprime crisis that sparked
15
off the GFC.

Inequality and the conduct of monetary policy
Inequality influences the conduct of monetary policy and, in turn, the conduct of
monetary policy influences inequality over the business cycle. On the one hand, the
distribution of income and wealth shapes monetary policy’s impact on and
transmission to economic activity as well as the broader political and social context
in which the central bank operates. On the other hand, monetary policy can
influence inequality: it can do so directly in the near term, through changes in
stance; and above all indirectly, over the business cycle, by seeking to keep inflation
under control and to limit recessions and hence unemployment.

The impact of inequality on the transmission of monetary policy

6

Beyond a certain point, inequality across households may weaken the transmission
of monetary policy. Households at the bottom and at the very top of the income
distribution exhibit low sensitivity of consumption to changes in interest rates: the
former may be unable to take advantage of easier credit conditions due to tight
borrowing constraints, while the latter have a low propensity to increase their
already high consumption.16 By contrast, households at the bottom of the income
distribution have higher marginal propensity to consume, and hence are more
sensitive to changes in their disposable income.
Empirical evidence suggests that inequality tends to dampen the transmission
of monetary policy (Graph II.9). Across countries and time, consumption responds
less to an unanticipated monetary policy easing when income inequality is greater –
here measured by the share of income accruing to the top 10% of earners. Two

(PVAR) featuring CPI inflation, real GDP growth and the short-term policy interest rate is estimated for AEs using quarterly data from Q1 1999
to Q4 2019. Based on this PVAR, economy-specific monetary policy shocks are identified as quarterly innovations to policy interest rates that
are orthogonal to those to economic growth and inflation. In this stage, the euro area is considered as a group. In the second step, we
aggregate the quarterly monetary policy shocks to annual frequency for 21 AEs and estimate a local projection equation, where the logarithm

theoretical findings in the recent academic literature, which highlight the importance
of household characteristics as a determinant of the transmission of monetary policy
to economic activity (Box II.B).
More broadly, inequality may influence central bank decisions by shaping the
political economy environment. Growing inequality can make the public less
receptive to central bank actions perceived to increase it. This can constrain the
central bank’s choices and eventually hamper its ability to achieve its mandated
goals. For example, out of concerns about the impact of higher asset prices on
wealth inequality, the central bank could come under criticism for keeping interest
rates very low for long periods as it tries to engineer the needed recovery in the
wake of a financial recession.

Monetary policy stance and inequality
Changes in the stance of monetary policy inevitably have some short-run
distributional effects. Every time the central bank adjusts interest rates, changes its
lending terms or purchases assets, distributional consequences follow. For example,
any such adjustment redistributes interest income between debtors and creditors
and influences asset prices, which reallocate income and wealth in the population
depending on holdings (see Box II.C for a detailed analysis of this point). But the
more important influence of monetary policy on inequality is through its impact on
inflation, employment and economic activity. These are the main macroeconomic
factors that shape inequality over the business cycle.
This also means that central bank mandates are fully consistent with tackling
the influence of the factors that can raise inequality over that horizon. While
mandates have evolved over time, these days they are primarily interpreted as

Heterogeneity and distribution in macroeconomic models

Box II.B

The growing focus on inequality in the economic debate has gone hand in hand with a change of perspective
in macroeconomic modelling. Recent research has moved away from macroeconomic models based on a
single representative agent and has focused instead on frameworks that incorporate heterogeneity in skills or
wealth among households. This has allowed researchers to explore how inequality shapes macroeconomic
outcomes and how macroeconomic shocks and stabilisation policies affect it. In these models – known as
heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) models – several traditional policy prescriptions change when
household heterogeneity is taken into account.
In traditional representative agent New Keynesian (RANK) models, monetary policy operates almost
exclusively through a direct “real interest rate channel”: changes in the policy rate affect the real interest rate
and induce households to reallocate consumption and saving over time. For instance, lower rates encourage
them to bring consumption forward, reducing saving rates today. Yet empirical evidence shows that the
response of consumption to monetary policy is mainly due to the indirect impact arising from an increase in
employment and wages.
In RANK models, the impact of these indirect effects on consumption is small because the representative
agent is generally assumed to be able to smooth consumption over time and is therefore not highly responsive
to temporary income changes.
In HANK models, the direct impact from the “real interest rate channel” is small because a sizeable share
of agents – especially those at the very bottom of the distribution – have negligible wealth. These agents’
consumption reacts little to changes in interest rates but is instead highly sensitive to changes in labour
income (“labour income channel”). In addition, agents at the top of the wealth distribution hold equity and
hence benefit from asset price increases (“equity price channel”) in response to an expansionary monetary
policy.
Overall, the transmission of a monetary policy expansion can be weaker in HANK models than in RANK
models. This depends on the distribution of income and wealth, and on other household characteristics that
affect the relative strength of the different channels. The impact will be smaller in HANK if the “labour income
channel” and the “equity price channel” are not strong enough to offset the weaker “real interest rate channel”.
In HANK models distributional factors also shape the optimal policy design: the main objective remains
low and stable inflation, but the relative weight on unemployment in central banks’ strategy is higher.
Considering inequality, a larger weight on unemployment stabilisation benefits the majority of households, as
a more aggressive reaction to unemployment lowers earnings risk and precautionary savings by the employed
and unemployed households at low and medium wealth deciles.

terms of output and employment. And although financial stability need not be
mentioned explicitly, it is naturally subsumed under the objective of smoothing
fluctuations: just as price stability, financial stability is a necessary condition for
output and employment to grow sustainably over time. This is true regardless of
whether financial instability is interpreted narrowly – as banking or financial crises
– or more broadly – as the amplification of business cycles and recessions induced
by financial factors.17
Once high inflation or recessions materialise, the needed monetary response
may have an undesirable short-run impact on inequality, in order to secure the
long-term gains. Hence the importance of avoiding inflation and recessions in the
first place.

Bringing inflation under control will generally call for a monetary policy
tightening, which can induce recessions and hence increase income inequality. In
AEs, a clear example is the “Volcker shock” of the early 1980s in the United States,
which set the basis for the conquest of inflation. In EMEs, the episodes are more
common and severe. For instance, the Central Bank of Brazil had to raise the policy
rate by more than 10 percentage points between 2001 and 2003 to rein in a surge
in inflation.
Similarly, sustaining a recovery in the aftermath of a severe economic recession
requires keeping interest rates low for longer, especially if they are constrained by
the effective lower bound.18 For example, had monetary policy refrained from
deploying all necessary tools to keep borrowing costs low in the aftermath of the
GFC and the Covid-19 pandemic, the recessions would have been deeper and
longer. This, in turn, would have exposed the most disadvantaged to longer

Box II.C

The impact of interest rates on wealth inequality

With interest rates remaining very low for long periods post-GFC, their impact on inequality has come into
focus. Interest rates influence wealth inequality primarily through their effect on asset prices – a key channel
in the monetary transmission mechanism. For instance, low interest rates and quantitative easing boost asset
prices. Low rates in general increase them by raising the present value of future income streams from those

and by encouraging borrowing for their acquisition. Central bank asset purchases, in addition, directly

The effect of central banks’ asset purchases and low-for-long interest rates on wealth inequality depends
critically on who owns houses, bonds and equities. This varies a great deal across countries (Graph II.C, centre
panel). In general, home ownership tends to be far more dispersed in the population than equity ownership,
which tends to be concentrated at the top of the income distribution. More people therefore experience
wealth gains due to rising house prices. Depending on how much house prices rise relative to equity and the
weights of these assets in households’ portfolios, the net effect of lower interest rates can actually lead to a
decrease in some wealth inequality measures, such as the Gini index. If, however, only the wealthiest segment
of the population owns houses and equity, wealth inequality will tend to rise as a result of lower interest
rates. In fact, in the United States, France and Germany, post-GFC large-scale asset purchases have not
coincided with a noticeable rise in wealth inequality among the top 10%, or even among the top 1% (righthand panel). Of course, surging house prices would still have distributional implications between owners and
tenants, typically favouring the old at the expense of the young and possibly raising concerns about home
affordability.
In interpreting these results, it is worth bearing in mind that wealth inequality is harder to measure than
income inequality (see Box II.A), and data are inevitably patchier. Firm conclusions on the evolution of wealth
inequality over short horizons are therefore much harder to draw.

easing in the euro area”, ECB Working Paper Series, no 2190, October 2018.     See also D Domanski, M Scatigna and A

where home ownership is widespread. In addition, they document that the ECB’s OMT announcements disproportionately

unemployment spells and worsened income inequality.19 That said, while low
interest rates mitigate income inequality substantially, their impact on asset prices,
especially equities, may have the side effect of increasing wealth inequality in the
near term. This outcome, however, is not a given and may be overturned for certain
measures of inequality if home ownership is concentrated in the middle of the
wealth distribution (Box II.C).
Trade-offs between actions aimed at achieving monetary policy objectives over
different horizons have always been present. But changes in the nature of the
business cycle since the mid-1980s have complicated the monetary policy task of
keeping the economy on an even keel and exacerbated those trade-offs. As a result,
the impact on inequality has also become more complex. The root cause has been
a shift from recessions mainly induced by a monetary policy tightening to keep
inflation under control to recessions in which financial factors play a key role in
amplifying business cycle fluctuations, ie the financial recessions noted above.20
The shift is illustrated in Graph II.10, which covers a sample of AEs. Until the
mid-1980s, in response to a rise in inflation (left-hand panel), the central bank
would tighten policy considerably in the lead-up to the recession (centre panel),
while nothing much would happen to credit – here measured by the deviation of
the credit-to-GDP ratio (right-hand panel) from its long-term trend. Since the mid1980s, by contrast, with inflation lower and more stable, monetary policy has not
tightened much, but a major expansion of credit has given way to a subsequent
sharp contraction, inducing a stronger and more prolonged monetary easing. This
explains why measures of the financial cycle, or those of “froth” in credit markets,
have become more useful for predicting turns in the business cycle. For instance,
debt service ratios that are well above historical averages are a drag on GDP growth
and signal a likely recession ahead.21
Two factors have contributed to this fundamental change in the nature of
business cycle fluctuations. On the one hand, central banks have largely tamed
inflation. Delivering low and stable inflation has cemented central banks’ inflation-

fighting credentials, helped anchor expectations and, in the process, contributed to
making inflation less sensitive to pressures arising from tight economic conditions
– the so-called flattening of the Phillips curve.22 Structural factors, notably
globalisation and technology, have strengthened these developments. On the other
hand, financial liberalisation, both within and across national borders, has increased
the scope for financial factors to influence household and business spending.23 The
self-reinforcing interaction between funding conditions, risk-taking and asset prices
lies at the heart of the corresponding amplification mechanisms.24 As just one
example, a significant share of households’ borrowing, particularly in AEs, now
takes place using housing as collateral; as a result, house price fluctuations have
much larger reverberations in the economy as a whole.25
This has given rise to a more complex intertemporal policy trade-off, reflected
also in the relationship between monetary policy and inequality.
On the one hand, low and stable inflation, well anchored expectations and a
flatter Phillips curve have provided central banks with greater leeway to be
accommodative and let the labour market tighten. A dynamic and inclusive labour
market may also limit scarring effects in the short and medium run. By the same
token, it reduces income inequality. Such an accommodative policy stance is all the
more justified where there are concerns that inflation is persistently below target,
as in most AEs over the last decade, where unemployment remains high26 and
limited policy space makes the economy more vulnerable to deeper recessions.
These conditions help explain why labour markets are playing a prominent role in
several recent reviews of monetary policy strategies and frameworks in AEs (Box II.D).
On the other hand, pursuing such a strategy is not without risks. Protracted
periods of easy monetary conditions can support the employment and income of
the most disadvantaged, but may contribute to the slow build-up of financial
imbalances, sowing the seeds of financial recessions further down the road.27 And

Labour markets and the reviews of monetary policy frameworks

Box II.D

Against the backdrop of the changing nature of business cycles, and capitalising on the lessons learnt since
the GFC, several central banks in major AEs recently launched reviews of their monetary policy frameworks.
The aim was to assess the adequacy of strategies and monetary policy instruments to achieve the mandated
objectives. The Federal Reserve was the first, launching its review in 2019 and completing it in August 2020.
The ECB and the Bank of Canada have also embarked on similar reviews, which are planned to be concluded
in the second half of 2021.
Labour markets have played a prominent role in these reviews – especially in the case of the Federal
Reserve. To be sure, the Fed’s reading of labour markets had been evolving for quite some time. For
example, in a 2016 speech, Chair Yellen argued that running the economy at “high-pressure” could be a
powerful tool to reverse the labour market hysteresis – a surge in unemployment coupled with a drop in
participation rates – that followed the GFC. In the wake of such considerations, the strategy review
downplayed the concept of the “natural” rate of unemployment – ie the level above which the labour market
is overheated and inflation should increase. Such a “natural” rate of unemployment cannot be observed
directly and needs to be estimated using various econometric techniques. Many approaches actually rely on
the empirical relationship of unemployment and inflation, which has weakened over time.
In a context in which the natural rate of unemployment plays little role, inflation takes centre stage as a
gauge of economic overheating. To the extent that inflation remains low, central banks can afford to let labour
markets tighten. Due to the flattening of the Phillips curve, tighter labour markets may produce limited price
pressures, so that inflation may well remain below target. To strengthen the commitment to delivering
inflation at target, the review has led to the adoption of a flexible form of average inflation targeting.
Following a period of below-target inflation, the central bank commits to keep an easier stance for longer,
while it waits for the backward-looking average of actual inflation to reach the target. This may require
inflation to “overshoot” the target by an amount and a duration that depends on the previously experienced
undershooting. An accommodative monetary policy, in turn, will stimulate demand and output, to the point
of enticing the discouraged workers back into the labour force. This should have a positive effect on potential
output and further sustain inflation.
The Fed’s new strategy is intended to bring benefits in terms of a more equitable income distribution.
A tight labour market can facilitate the inclusion in the labour force of the most disadvantaged segments of
the population, lifting them out of poverty and marginalisation. Hence, on top of boosting potential growth,
a wider labour force participation and more employment opportunities should dampen income inequality by
boosting the income of the poorest.
The current review of the monetary policy framework at the Bank of Canada shares with the Fed’s review
a broader set of criteria than in the past against which to evaluate possible alternative frameworks. In
particular, those criteria now also include the impact on the distribution of income and wealth. The European
Central Bank is also analysing a wide range of topics, many of which have important links to inequality. These
include employment, digitalisation, globalisation, productivity, innovation and technological progress.
Moreover, in early 2020, the ECB held a series of events with the general public to gather suggestions. A
notable one was that the ECB should consider a direct way for its policies to have an impact on people, rather
than through banks and financial institutions.
 This is also because, at the time of writing, the strategy reviews in other central banks were already ongoing, so the
information available was more limited.     See J Yellen, “Macroeconomic research after the crisis“, speech at the 60th
annual economic conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, 14 October 2016.     This reasoning is
consistent with the “plucking” theory of the business cycle in which employment, rather than hovering around a certain
equilibrium level, is capped by a certain maximum level. According to this theory, the Phillips curve has a non-linear shape,
so that inflation pressures only kick in in the proximity of the maximum attainable level of employment. See S Dupraz,
E Nakamura and J Steinsson, “A plucking model of business cycles”, NBER Working Papers, no 26351, October 2019.     See,
for example, M Daly, “Is the Federal Reserve contributing to economic inequality?”, speech at UC Irvine, 16 October 2020.

Workshop, 26 August 2020.     See C Lagarde, “The monetary policy strategy review: some preliminary considerations”,

The trickier nature of the intertemporal trade-offs linked to the nature of the
business cycle has complicated monetary policy’s task of fulfilling its objectives. It
has become harder to reconcile price with financial, and hence macroeconomic,
stability in the near term. As a result, the consequences for inequality have also
become larger. Monetary policy cannot adequately handle these intertemporal
trade-offs on its own. As discussed next in more detail, they call for a more balanced
policy approach in which other policies, notably prudential, fiscal and structural,
also play a role.

Beyond monetary policy
The previous analysis indicates that the best contribution monetary policy can
make to a more equitable distribution of income and wealth is to deliver on its
mandate – seeking to ensure macroeconomic stability, for which price and financial
stability are prerequisites. By keeping the economy on an even keel, central banks
facilitate sustainable growth. The benefits of doing so are first-order.
It would be unrealistic, and indeed counterproductive, to gear monetary policy
more squarely towards tackling inequality. Monetary tools, by their very nature, act
primarily on cyclical developments. That is why they are well suited to achieving
macroeconomic stabilisation objectives. By contrast, a meaningful impact on slowmoving inequality trends would entail sustained application of the tools in
particular ways. This would curtail the flexibility of monetary policy to stabilise the
economy, potentially undermining the effectiveness of the monetary regime itself.
This would be very costly, not least because the macroeconomic stability that those
regimes can deliver is precisely what is most conducive to equitable income and
wealth distributions.
With monetary policy playing a supportive role, other policies are, therefore,
critical. Three types of policy deserve attention: those that complement monetary
policy in delivering macroeconomic stability in the different phases of the business
cycle; those that address structural inequality; and those that central banks can
deploy in fulfilment of their non-monetary policy responsibilities.

Macroeconomic stability
While monetary policy plays a key role in promoting macroeconomic stability, it
cannot deliver it on its own. This is true regardless of the nature of the business
cycle. It is well known, for instance, that fiscal sustainability is a prerequisite for
macroeconomic stability, and that it can be especially constraining in EMEs
(Chapter I). But changes in the nature of the business cycle have brought the limits
of what monetary policy can do into starker relief. In order to better understand the
need for complementary policies, consider a stylised business cycle associated with
a financial recession.
During the expansionary phase of the business cycle, even if monetary policy
keeps inflation in check, vulnerabilities may build up in the financial system as the
financial cycle gathers momentum. This is because credit and asset prices can grow
rapidly boosted by high risk-taking, so that balance sheets may become overstretched.
Macroprudential measures can play a key role here. They can seek to slow down
the financial expansion and restrain risk-taking, especially in the sectors deemed to
pose the bigger risks to the financial system (Chapter I).
The role of microprudential policies, which are structural in nature and not
aimed at smoothing the financial cycle per se, becomes evident once the recession
sets in. Adequate microprudential safeguards must be in place so that the banking

56

system is resilient going into the downturn and can better support the economy.
This is precisely what the post-GFC major international prudential reforms –
notably Basel III – did pre-Covid. The reforms allowed banks to avoid deleveraging
and to better support credit, thereby cushioning the blow to the economy
(Chapter I).
That said, if the financial imbalances are large enough, the prudential
safeguards may not be sufficient to prevent more widespread and intense financial
stress. At this point, monetary policy enters crisis management mode, with central
banks acting as lenders and, increasingly, as market-makers of last resort.28 This may
make central banks the target of criticism for favouring “Wall Street” at the expense
of “Main Street”. But this is a false dichotomy, as such actions are necessary to
prevent greater damage. A collapse of the financial system would curtail credit to
business and households and spawn a deep recession, at great cost in terms of
unemployment and income inequality. Also on this front, however, central banks
cannot succeed on their own: fiscal backstops are essential to stabilise banks, the
overall financial system and thereby the economy. In addition, government
intervention to help repair balance sheets is critical to resolve the crisis and set the
basis for a healthy recovery.
As financial conditions stabilise, the challenge becomes nursing the recovery
and battling the headwinds of a debt overhang. Monetary policy accommodation
can help mitigate the recession and speed up the recovery, but a balanced mix of
monetary, fiscal and structural policies is called for to prevent central banks from
becoming “the only game in town”. Fiscal policy can ease the burden on central
banks and attenuate the impact of recessions on inequality. Automatic stabilisers
are useful but may need to be complemented with discretionary measures. For
example, thanks to sizeable income transfers, personal disposable income in most
countries has actually grown faster (or declined less) than wage income during the
pandemic (Chapter I, Graph I.2, left-hand panel). At the same time, it is essential
that fiscal policy be run prudently to prevent it from becoming a source of
macroeconomic instability. Imprudent fiscal policies can raise risk premia, fuel
currency depreciation and eventually destabilise the economy, not least by
generating full-blown financial crises. Structural policies are also important in this
context, as they are the sole engine of sustainable longer-term growth, which
cannot rely on persistent fiscal and monetary stimulus.

Structural inequality
Addressing the structural trends in inequality is first and foremost a task for
governments. They can avail themselves of a better and broader set of tools to
tackle inequality, ranging from taxation to transfers as well as to policies aimed at
improving education, property rights, health, competition and trade, among others.
Moreover, politically, governments bear the responsibility for achieving a desirable
distribution of resources.
Fiscal policy is best suited to offset the distributional impact of long‑term real
factors. Government spending and support programmes, such as unemployment
benefits and retraining, can help the most disadvantaged cope with adverse
structural forces. More generally, tax and transfer systems can be calibrated and
targeted to redistribute income and wealth across different segments of the
population (Box II.E). In AEs, such policies have indeed contributed to mitigating
income inequality. Measures of income inequality based on the Gini coefficient are
typically much higher pre- than post-taxes and transfers (Graph II.11, left-hand
panel). The difference is more limited in EMEs (right-hand panel), one possible
reason being the lower share of direct taxes in those jurisdictions.

Mitigating inequality also requires well designed growth-promoting structural
policies. There is a range of relevant measures.
First and foremost, policies designed to improve access to, and the quality of,
education and on-the-job learning are crucial to keep pace with rapid technological
change. Such policies do not just raise output by increasing human capital and
productivity; they also help level the playing field and reduce inequality by
providing access to better-paid job opportunities.29
Labour market and competition policies sustain growth and also help tackle
the challenges brought about by technological change and changes in the
composition of demand in favour of high-skilled jobs. Easing re-entry of the longterm unemployed, typically the less skilled, into labour markets can reduce the
income gap vis-à-vis higher-skilled workers. And labour market regulation can
ensure minimum standards for wages and unemployment benefits, rebalancing
bargaining power.
Trade openness can also contribute, especially for lower-income countries
benefiting from the extra foreign demand. But it needs to be combined with proper
compensation, retraining and reallocation policies for those who are displaced.30
Evidence indicates that, absent redistribution policies, the removal of tariffs on
agricultural and manufacturing goods increases aggregate output at the cost of an
initial rise in income inequality.31

Central banks’ non-monetary hats
Central banks can also contribute to a more equitable society wearing their “nonmonetary hats”. These are functions attributed to them by statute beyond their
monetary policy mandate.

stability-related functions for inequality, including micro- and macroprudential

Fiscal policy and inequality

Governments can affect inequality using a number of different fiscal policy tools. On the revenue side, they
can influence the income distribution by changing income taxes. Progressive taxation, which imposes higher
tax rates on higher-income households, can reduce after-tax income inequality. Similarly, taxes on wealth or
inheritance can reduce after-tax wealth inequality. On the expenditure side, governments can direct public
transfers towards specific segments of the population to affect their disposable income and hence inequality.
For instance, unemployment insurance can significantly limit the impact of recessions on inequality by
sustaining the income of workers who lose their job. Public transfers also tend to reduce inequality since they
usually aim to ensure minimum living standards, thereby disproportionately benefiting the poor. Restricted

Tax progressivity is estimated for each country-year pair by regressing average tax rates on log-personal income. Personal income levels
are defined as multiples of current GDP per capita, starting from 4% and ending at 400% with increments of 4 percentage points, making 100
hypothetical income levels for each country and year. Country sample: 27 AEs and eight EMEs. See D Duncan and K Sabirianova Peter, “Unequal

Inequality Database (WIID); BIS calculations.

Cross-country evidence confirms that a higher degree of tax progressivity is associated with lower
inequality, particularly at the top of the income distribution (Graph II.E, centre panel). A reduction in tax
progressivity of the same order of magnitude as observed over the past two decades is associated with an
increase of about 11 percentage points in the share of income of the top 10% of earners relative to the
median income earners.
For their part, public transfers help reduce inequality at the bottom of the distribution. Cross-country
evidence shows that increases in public transfers as a share of GDP are associated with lower inequality in the

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

59

bottom half of the income distribution (Graph II.E, right-hand panel). This empirical regularity probably reflects
changes in public transfers disproportionately benefiting the poor, especially as transfers tend to increase
more steeply during recessions. Accordingly, increases in transfers have little impact at the top of the income
distribution.
The variety of fiscal policy tools available to governments gives them significant scope to address inequality
arising from different segments of the income distribution, and nudge it towards the desired outcome.

literacy and education; and overseeing payment systems.32 The extent to which
central banks can contribute to fighting inequality performing these tasks naturally
depends on their statutory responsibilities, which vary substantially across countries,
and, importantly, on the range and effectiveness of the tools at their disposal.
The beneficial impact of these policies on inequality is multifaceted. Fostering
financial development can widen the menu of options to hedge and diversify risks,
enhancing investment opportunities and mitigating poverty and income
inequality.33 Promoting financial inclusion by providing safe savings vehicles or
smooth payment infrastructures expands financial market access for the most
disadvantaged, particularly in poorer countries.34 Financial services consumer
protection shields the poor and more vulnerable from predatory lending35 and,
together with financial literacy and education, from excessive risk-taking.
Spearheading efforts to develop safe, smooth and competitive payment systems
not only underpins financial stability; it also helps reduce overall costs, not least for
cross-border remittances.

Conclusion
Inequality is largely the result of long-term structural forces that are independent
of monetary policy. Over the past few decades, globalisation and technology have
played a prominent role. Policies that foster more equal opportunities or
redistribute income are best suited to counteract the impact of long-term forces on
income and wealth inequality. Structural policies, including those targeted to
education, health and competition, give the relatively poor of today the instruments
to become the well-off of tomorrow, promoting social mobility and equitable
growth. Fiscal policies, notably through redistribution, help correct the uneven
distribution of the aggregate gains from growth.
Monetary policy does not have adequate tools to offset the long-term
distributional consequences of evolving structural factors. Nevertheless, depending
on statutory responsibilities, central banks can make a significant contribution by
wearing their “non-monetary hats”, to an extent that depends on the tools available.
Promoting financial development, inclusion and literacy, protecting against unfair
financial practices, and furthering low-cost payment services all contribute to a
more equitable society.
This is not to say that monetary policy cannot foster a more equitable society;
far from it. Monetary policy can make an important contribution by keeping the
economy on an even keel in fulfilment of its mandate, ie by tackling macroeconomic,
including financial, instability. Macroeconomic instability can have a first-order

impact on inequality over business cycle fluctuations. The two major forms of
instability are high inflation, which disproportionately erodes income of households
at the bottom of the distribution, and recessions, which hurt the poor through
unemployment spells.
Changes in the nature of the business cycle over the recent decades have
complicated monetary policy’s ability to counteract macroeconomic instability and
its impact on inequality. To be sure, inflation has largely been conquered – a major
achievement. But financial factors have come to the fore as a key force amplifying
business cycle fluctuations. Financial recessions tend to be deeper and longer,
especially if a financial crisis breaks out, and therefore much more costly in terms of
inequality. Moreover, they require the central bank to keep interest rates low for
longer to nurture a recovery: by boosting asset prices, especially those of equities,
this may raise wealth inequality in the short run even as it delivers substantial benefits
by bolstering employment and reducing income inequality. The intertemporal
trade-offs that arise pose a key challenge. With inflation less responsive to economic
slack, the central bank can keep the monetary policy stance easier for longer. This
brings more people into the labour force, supports employment and reduces
inequality. But it may also contribute to a slow build-up of financial imbalances that
sow the seeds of costlier financial recessions down the road.
In order to better address these trade-offs, a more balanced policy approach is
needed. Prudential, fiscal and structural policies are important in this context, as
part of a comprehensive macro-financial stability framework.

The significant interplay between inflation and income inequality in EMEs probably reflects the
importance of the informal sector, as workers relying mostly on cash payments are particularly
exposed to inflation. In AEs, by contrast, greater participation in banking services and higher
financial literacy may enable more inflation hedging opportunities.

Beyond the cyclical evolution of interest rates, there is a deeper question about the long-term
drivers of the fall in real interest rates since the 1980s. Clearly, the real rates consistent with stable
inflation and output at potential have declined – what is commonly referred to as r-star or the
natural rate of interest. There is a large body of evidence indicating that the main forces at work
have been of a structural nature, including factors such as demographics, long-term growth, a
growing wedge between the required return on capital and the risk-free rate, the relative price

an accommodative policy could provide short-term support to the economy at the price of
heightened macroeconomic instability when the time to normalise comes.

III. CBDCs: an opportunity for the monetary system

Key takeaways
•

Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) offer in digital form the unique advantages of central bank
money: settlement finality, liquidity and integrity. They are an advanced representation of money
for the digital economy.

•

Digital money should be designed with the public interest in mind. Like the latest generation of instant
retail payment systems, retail CBDCs could ensure open payment platforms and a competitive level
playing field that is conducive to innovation.

•

The ultimate benefits of adopting a new payment technology will depend on the competitive structure
of the underlying payment system and data governance arrangements. The same technology that
can encourage a virtuous circle of greater access, lower costs and better services might equally
induce a vicious circle of data silos, market power and anti-competitive practices. CBDCs and open
platforms are the most conducive to a virtuous circle.

•

CBDCs built on digital identification could improve cross-border payments, and limit the risks of
currency substitution. Multi-CBDC arrangements could surmount the hurdles of sharing digital IDs
across borders, but will require international cooperation.

Introduction
Digital innovation has wrought far-reaching changes in all sectors of the economy.
Alongside a broader trend towards greater digitalisation, a wave of innovation in
consumer payments has placed money and payment services at the vanguard of
this development. An essential by-product of the digital economy is the huge
volume of personal data that are collected and processed as an input into business
activity. This raises issues of data governance, consumer protection and anticompetitive practices arising from data silos.
This chapter examines how central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can
contribute to an open, safe and competitive monetary system that supports
innovation and serves the public interest. CBDCs are a form of digital money,
denominated in the national unit of account, which is a direct liability of the central
bank.1 CBDCs can be designed for use either among financial intermediaries only
(ie wholesale CBDCs), or by the wider economy (ie retail CBDCs).
The chapter sets out the unique features of CBDCs, asking what their issuance
would mean for users, financial intermediaries, central banks and the international
monetary system. It presents the design choices and the associated implications for
data governance and privacy in the digital economy. The chapter also outlines how
CBDCs compare with the latest generation of retail fast payment systems (FPS, see
glossary).2
To set the stage, the first section discusses the public interest case for digital
money. The second section lays out the unique properties of CBDCs as an advanced
representation of central bank money, focusing on their role as a means of payment

and comparing them with cash and the latest generation of retail FPS. The third
section discusses the appropriate division of labour between the central bank and
the private sector in payments and financial intermediation, and the associated
CBDC design considerations. The fourth section explores the principles behind
design choices on digital identification and user privacy. The fifth section discusses
the international dimension of CBDCs, including the opportunities for improving
cross-border payments and the role of international cooperation.

Money in the digital era
Throughout the long arc of history, money and its institutional foundations have
evolved in parallel with the technology available. Many recent payment innovations
have built on improvements to underlying infrastructures that have been many
years in the making. Central banks around the world have instituted real-time gross
settlement (RTGS) systems over the past decades. A growing number of jurisdictions
(over 55 at the time of writing)3 have introduced retail FPS, which allow instant
settlement of payments between households and businesses around the clock. FPS
also support a vibrant ecosystem of private bank and non-bank payment service
providers (PSPs, see glossary). Examples of FPS include TIPS in the euro area, the
Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in India, PIX in Brazil, CoDi in Mexico and the
FedNow proposal in the United States, among many others. These developments
show how innovation can thrive on the basis of sound money provided by central
banks.
Yet further-reaching changes to the existing monetary system are burgeoning.
Demands on retail payments are changing, with fewer cash transactions and a
shift towards digital payments, in particular since the start of the Covid-19
pandemic (Graph III.1, left-hand and centre panels). In addition to incremental
improvements, many central banks are actively engaged in work on CBDCs as an
advanced representation of central bank money for the digital economy. CBDCs
may give further impetus to innovations that promote the efficiency, convenience
and safety of the payment system. While CBDC projects and pilots have been
under way since 2014, efforts have recently shifted into higher gear (Graph III.1,
right-hand panel).
The overriding criterion when evaluating a change to something as central as
the monetary system should be whether it serves the public interest. Here, the
public interest should be taken broadly to encompass not only the economic
benefits flowing from a competitive market structure, but also the quality of
governance arrangements and basic rights, such as the right to data privacy.
It is in this context that the exploration of CBDCs provides an opportunity to
review and reaffirm the public interest case for digital money. The monetary system
is a public good that permeates people’s everyday lives and underpins the economy.
Technological development in money and payments could bring wide benefits, but
the ultimate consequences for the well-being of individuals in society depend on
the market structure and governance arrangements that underpin it. The same
technology could encourage either a virtuous circle of equal access, greater
competition and innovation, or it could foment a vicious circle of entrenched
market power and data concentration. The outcome will depend on the rules
governing the payment system and whether these will result in open payment
platforms and a competitive level playing field.
Central bank interest in CBDCs comes at a critical time. Several recent
developments have placed a number of potential innovations involving digital
currencies high on the agenda. The first of these is the growing attention received

by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies; the second is the debate on stablecoins; and
the third is the entry of large technology firms (big techs) into payment services
and financial services more generally.
By now, it is clear that cryptocurrencies are speculative assets rather than
money, and in many cases are used to facilitate money laundering, ransomware
attacks and other financial crimes.4 Bitcoin in particular has few redeeming public
interest attributes when also considering its wasteful energy footprint.5
Stablecoins attempt to import credibility by being backed by real currencies.
As such, these are only as good as the governance behind the promise of the
backing.6 They also have the potential to fragment the liquidity of the monetary
system and detract from the role of money as a coordination device. In any case, to
the extent that the purported backing involves conventional money, stablecoins are
ultimately only an appendage to the conventional monetary system and not a
game changer.
Perhaps the most significant recent development has been the entry of big
techs into financial services. Their business model rests on the direct interactions of
users, as well as the data that are an essential by-product of these interactions. As
big techs make inroads into financial services, the user data in their existing
businesses in e-commerce, messaging, social media or search give them a
competitive edge through strong network effects. The more users flock to a
particular platform, the more attractive it is for a new user to join that same
network, leading to a “data-network-activities” or “DNA” loop (see glossary).

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

67

However, the network effects that underpin big techs can be a mixed blessing
for users. On the one hand, the DNA loop can create a virtuous circle, driving
greater financial inclusion, better services and lower costs. On the other, it impels
the market for payments towards further concentration. For example in China, just
two big techs jointly account for 94% of the mobile payments market.7 Authorities
have recently addressed concerns about anti-competitive practices that exclude
competitors in associated digital services such as e-commerce and social media.8
This concentration of market power is a reason why authorities in some economies
are increasingly turning to an entity-based approach to regulating big techs, as a
complement to the existing activities-based approach.9
Entrenchment of market power may potentially exacerbate the high costs of
payment services, still one of the most stubborn shortcomings of the existing
payment system. An example is the high merchant fees associated with credit and
debit card payments. Despite decades of ever-accelerating technological progress,
which has drastically reduced the price of communication equipment and
bandwidth, the cost of conventional digital payment options such as credit and
debit cards remains high, and still exceeds that of cash (Graph III.2, left-hand panel).
In some regions, revenues deriving from credit card fees are more than 1% of GDP
(right-hand panel).
These costs are not immediately visible to consumers. Charges are usually
levied on the merchants, who are often not allowed to pass these fees directly on
to the consumer. However, the ultimate incidence of these costs depends on what
share of the merchant fees are passed on to the consumer indirectly through higher
prices. As is well known in the economics of indirect taxation, the individuals who
ultimately bear the incidence of a tax may not be those who are formally required
to pay that tax.10 The concern is that when big tech firms enter the payments

market, their access to user data from associated digital business lines may allow
them to achieve a dominant position, leading to fees that are even higher than
those charged by credit and debit card companies currently. Merchant fees as high
as 4% have been reported in some cases.11
Related to the persistently high cost of some digital payment options is the
lack of universal access to digital payment services. Access to bank and non-bank
transaction accounts has improved dramatically over the past several decades, in
particular in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs).12 Yet in many
countries, a large share of adults still have no access to digital payment options.
Even in advanced economies, some users lack payment cards and smartphones to
make digital payments, participate in e-commerce and receive transfers (such as
government-to-person payments). For instance, in the United States, over 5% of
households were unbanked in 2019, and 14% of adults did not use a payment card
in 2017. In France, in 2017, 13% of adults did not own a mobile phone.13 Lowerincome individuals, the homeless, migrants and other vulnerable groups are most
likely to rely on cash. Due in part to market power and low expected margins, private
PSPs often do not cater sufficiently to these groups. Remedies may necessitate
public policy support as digital payments become more dominant.
The availability of massive amounts of user data gives rise to another important
issue – that of data governance. Access to data confers competitive advantages
that may entrench market power. Beyond the economic consequences, ensuring
privacy against unjustified intrusion by both commercial and government actors
has the attributes of a basic right. For these reasons, the issue of data governance
has emerged as a key public policy concern. When US consumers were asked in a
representative survey whom they trust with safeguarding their personal data, the
respondents reported that they trust big techs the least (Graph III.3, left-hand
panel). They have far more trust in traditional financial institutions, followed by

abuse of data emerges as an important element. A later section of this chapter
discusses data governance issues more fully.

Digital money as a central bank public good
The foundation of the monetary system is trust in the currency. As the central bank
provides the ultimate unit of account, that trust is grounded on confidence in the
central bank itself. Like the legal system and other foundational state functions, the
trust engendered by the central bank has the attributes of a public good. Such
“central bank public goods” underpin the monetary system.14
Central banks are accountable public institutions that play a pivotal role in
payment systems, both wholesale and retail. They supply the ultimate means of
payment for banks (bank reserves), and a highly convenient and visible one for the
public (cash). Moreover, in their roles as operators, overseers and catalysts, they
pursue key public interest objectives in the payments sphere: safety, integrity,
efficiency and access (see glossary).
The central bank plays four key roles in pursuit of these objectives. The first is
to provide the unit of account in the monetary system. From that basic promise, all
other promises in the economy follow.
Second, central banks provide the means for ensuring the finality of wholesale
payments by using their own balance sheets as the ultimate means of settlement,
as also reflected in legal concepts of finality (see glossary). The central bank is the
trusted intermediary that debits the account of the payer and credits the account
of the payee. Once the accounts are debited and credited in this way, the payment
is final and irrevocable.
The third function is to ensure that the payment system works smoothly. To this
end, the central bank provides sufficient settlement liquidity so that no logjams will
impede the workings of the payment system, where a payment is delayed because
the sender is waiting for incoming funds. At times of stress, the central bank’s role
in liquidity provision takes on a more urgent form as the lender of last resort.
The central bank’s fourth role is to oversee the payment system’s integrity,
while upholding a competitive level playing field. As overseer, the central bank
imposes requirements on the participants so that they support the functioning of
the payment system as a whole. Many central banks also have a role in the
supervision and regulation of commercial banks, which are the core participants of
the payment system. Prudential regulation and supervision reinforce the system.
Further, in performing this role, central bank money is “neutral”, ie provided on an
equal basis to all commercial parties with a commitment to competitive fairness.
Central bank digital currencies should be viewed in the context of these
functions of the central bank in the monetary system. Wholesale CBDCs are for use
by regulated financial institutions. They build on the current two-tier structure,
which places the central bank at the foundation of the payment system while
assigning customer-facing activities to PSPs. The central bank grants accounts to
commercial banks and other PSPs, and domestic payments are settled on the
central bank’s balance sheet. Wholesale CBDCs are intended for the settlement of
interbank transfers and related wholesale transactions, for example to settle
payments between financial institutions. They could encompass digital assets or
cross-border payments. Wholesale CBDCs and central bank reserves operate in a
very similar way. Settlement is made by debiting the account of the bank that has
net obligations to the rest of the system and crediting the account of the bank that

70

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

has a net claim on the system. An additional benefit of settlement in wholesale
CBDCs is to allow for new forms of the conditionality of payments, requiring that a
payment only settles on condition of delivery of another payment or delivery of an
asset. Such conditional payment instructions could enhance the delivery-versuspayment mechanism in RTGS systems (see Box III.A).

Project Helvetia – exploring the use of wholesale CBDCs

Box III.A

Wholesale CBDCs are intended for the settlement of interbank transfers and related wholesale transactions.
They serve the same purpose as reserves held at the central bank but with additional functionality. One
example is the conditionality of payments, whereby a payment only settles if certain conditions are met. This
could encompass a broad variety of conditional payment instructions, going far beyond today’s deliveryversus-payment mechanism in real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems. In effect, wholesale CBDCs could
make central bank money programmable, to support automation and mitigate risks. Further, wholesale
CBDCs would be implemented on new technology stacks. This clean-slate approach would let wholesale CBDC
systems be designed with international standards in mind to support interoperability.
State-of-the-art approaches in this domain are exemplified by Project Helvetia – a joint experiment by
the BIS Innovation Hub Swiss Centre, SIX Group AG and the Swiss National Bank. This project demonstrates
the feasibility of settling digital assets in central bank money. Two proofs-of-concept (PoCs) were compared:
(i) issuing a novel wholesale CBDC (Graph III.A, top panel) and (ii) building a link between the new SIX Digital
Exchange (SDX) platform and the existing RTGS central bank payment system, Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC)
(bottom panel). Both PoCs were found to be functionally feasible, and transfers were shown to be legally
robust and final. Each PoC presents different practical and operational benefits and challenges.

Compared with wholesale CBDCs, a more far-reaching innovation is the
introduction of retail CBDCs. Retail CBDCs modify the conventional two-tier monetary
system in that they make central bank digital money available to the general public,
just as cash is available to the general public as a direct claim on the central bank.
One attribute of retail CBDCs is that they do not entail any credit risk for
payment system participants, as they are a direct claim on the central bank
(Graph III.4). A retail CBDC is akin to a digital form of cash, the provision of which
is a core responsibility of central banks. Other forms of digital retail money
represent a claim on an intermediary. Such intermediaries could experience
illiquidity due to temporary lack of funds or even insolvency, which could also lead
to payment outages. While such risks are already substantially reduced through
collateralisation and other safeguards in most cases, retail CBDCs would put an
end to any residual risk.
Retail CBDCs come in two variants (Graph III.5). One option makes for a cashlike design, allowing for so-called token-based access and anonymity in payments.
This option would give individual users access to the CBDC based on a passwordlike digital signature using private-public key cryptography, without requiring
personal identification. The other approach is built on verifying users’ identity
(“account-based access”) and would be rooted in a digital identity scheme.15 This
second approach is more compatible with the monitoring of illicit activity in a
payment system, and would not rule out preserving privacy: personal transaction
data could be shielded from commercial parties and even from public authorities
by appropriately designing the payment authentication process. These issues are
intimately tied to broader policy debates on data governance and privacy, which
we return to in a later section.
From the public interest perspective, the crucial issue for the payment system
is how the introduction of retail CBDCs will affect data governance, the competitive
landscape of the PSPs and the industrial organisation of the broader payments
industry. In this connection, the experience of jurisdictions with a long history of
operating retail FPS provides some useful lessons. Central banks can enhance the
functioning of the monetary system by facilitating the entry of new players to foster
private sector innovation in payment services. These goals could be achieved by
creating open payment platforms that promote competition and innovation,

In today’s financial system, digital fiat money is available only to regulated financial institutions, in the form of reserves accounts held by
commercial banks at the central bank. Wholesale CBDCs would similarly be restricted to financial institutions. Retail CBDCs in contrast are
available to the general economy. Account-based retail CBDCs would be tied to an identification scheme and all users would need to identify
themselves. Token-based retail CBDCs would be accessed via password-like digital signatures and could be accessed anonymously.

competition and better services.16
Rules and standards that promote good data governance are among the key
elements in establishing and maintaining open markets and a competitive level
playing field. These can yield concrete economic benefits. The 2020 BIS Annual
Economic Report drew a contrast between “walled gardens”, where users are served
in a closed proprietary network, and a public town square in which buyers and
sellers can meet without artificial barriers. In return for access to all buyers, the
sellers must stick to the standards set by the public authorities with a view to
promoting the virtuous circle of greater participation and better services.
The analogy with the payment system is that the market stallholders in the
public town square are like PSPs, each offering basic payment functionality with
their particular bundle of services, such as banking, e-commerce, messaging and
social media. Just as the market stallholders must stick to the standards laid down
by the town authorities, these PSPs must adhere to various technical standards
and data access requirements. These include technical standards such as
application programming interfaces (APIs) that impose a common format for data
exchange from service providers (see Box III.B). Together with data governance
frameworks that assign ownership of data to users, these standards ensure
interoperability of the services between PSPs so that they can work seamlessly for
the user. Two instances of APIs are account information services (AIS) and payment
initiation services (PIS). AIS allow users to “port” data on their transactions from

one provider to another. For instance, a user who has accounts with two different
banks can open the app of one bank to check the balances in the other. PIS allow
a user to operate the app of one PSP to make an outgoing payment from the
account of another.

Box III.B

APIs and the industrial organisation of payments

An application programming interface (API, see glossary) acts as a digital communication interface between
service providers and their users. In its simplest form, a modern payment API first takes a request from an
authorised user (eg a user who wants to send a friend money through a mobile banking app). It then sends
the request to a server to obtain information (eg the friend’s bank account details or the sender’s account
balance). Finally, it reports the retrieved information back to the user (the money has been sent).
APIs ensure the secure exchange of data and instructions between parties in digital interactions. Through
encryption, they allow only the parties directly involved in a transaction to access the information transmitted.
They accomplish this by ensuring proper authentication (verifying the credentials of the parties involved, eg
from a digital ID, as discussed further in a later section) and authorisation (which specifies the resources a user
is authorised to access or modify). Crucially, APIs can be set up to transmit only data relevant to a specific
transaction. For example, a bank may provide an API that allows other banks to request the full name of the
holder of a specific account, based on the account number provided. But this API will not allow the querying
bank to retrieve the account holder’s home address or transaction history. Insofar as APIs provide strong
security features, they can add an additional layer of security to interactions.
A key benefit of APIs is that they enable interoperability between different providers and simplify
transactions. For example, many large financial institutions or big techs possess valuable consumer data, eg
on payment transactions. By allowing other market participants to access and analyse data in order to develop
and improve their products, APIs ensure a level playing field. This promotes competition and delivers benefits
to consumers. An example is “open banking”, which allows third-party financial service providers to access
transaction and other financial data from traditional financial institutions through APIs. For example, a fintech
could use banks’ transaction data to assess credit risk and offer a loan at lower, more transparent rates than
those offered by traditional financial institutions.
Payment APIs may offer software that allows organisations to create interoperable digital payment
services to connect customers, merchants, banks and other financial providers. Examples include Mojaloop,
an open source system, and the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) in India. For example, to send money to
another user via an API, all that is required from the sender’s perspective is the unique phone number of the
recipient. Behind the scenes, the payment process follows three general steps (Graph III.B). In the first step,
the phone number provided is used to identify and authenticate the unique recipient, as well as their bank
connection, account details etc. The second step is agreement, in which the recipient’s bank (or financial
services provider) needs to agree to the transaction on the customer’s behalf. During this second step, it is
verified that the transaction satisfies rules and regulations (eg sufficient funds and compliance with know
your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
standards). Once there is agreement, in a third step funds are transferred and made available to the recipient
immediately. In all steps, cryptography ensures that the transaction is non-repudiable and that information is
shared securely.

APIs thus securely connect otherwise separate bank and non-bank payment service providers, benefiting
consumers through cheaper services. Such APIs are a key enabler of interoperability between payment
systems – relevant for both FPS and CBDC-based systems.
 See Mojaloop Foundation, “Open Source Software for Payment Interoperability”, accessed 11 May 2021; and D D’Silva,
Z Filková, F Packer and S Tiwari, “The design of digital financial infrastructure: lessons from India”, BIS Papers, no 106,
December 2019. “Moja” is Swahili for “one”, to underscore the aim of achieving interoperability in a single system.

Much as the local authorities preside over their town’s marketplace, a central
bank can provide the payment system with access to its settlement accounts. In the
case of a retail FPS, the balance sheet of the central bank is, metaphorically
speaking, a public space where the sellers of the payment services all interact. The
central bank is best placed to play this role, as it issues the economy’s unit of
account and ensures ultimate finality (see glossary) of payments through settlement
on its balance sheet. The central bank can also promote innovation in this bustling
payments marketplace, where the network effects can be channelled towards
achieving a virtuous circle of greater participation, lower costs and better services.
Whether retail CBDCs will play a similarly beneficial role will depend on the
way that CBDCs frame the interaction between PSPs and their ancillary services. In
a general sense, the public good nature of both CBDCs and retail FPS can be seen
as resting on an open payment system around the interoperability of the services
offered by PSPs. Table III.1 compares cash, retail CBDCs and FPS along dimensions
relevant for users and public policy. Several similarities, but also differences,
emerge.
Well designed CBDCs and FPS have a number of features in common. They
both enable competing providers to offer new services through a range of
interfaces – including in principle via prepaid cards and other dedicated access
devices, as well as services that run on feature phones. Such arrangements not only
allow for lower costs to users, but also afford universal access, and could thus
promote financial inclusion.
Moreover, as the issuers of CBDCs and operators or overseers of FPS, central
banks can lay the groundwork for assuring privacy and the responsible use of data
in payments. The key is to ensure that governance for digital identity is appropriately
designed. For both CBDC and FPS, such designs can incorporate features that
support the smooth functioning of payment services without yielding control over
data to private PSPs, as discussed above in the context of APIs. An open system that
gives users control over their data can harness the DNA loop, breaking down the
silos and associated market power of incumbent private firms with exclusive control
over user data.
Although CBDCs and FPS have many characteristics in common, one difference
is that CBDCs extend the unique features and benefits of today’s digital central
bank money directly to the general public.17 In a CBDC, a payment only involves
transferring a direct claim on the central bank from one end user to another. Funds
do not pass over the balance sheet of an intermediary, and transactions are settled
directly in central bank money, on the central bank’s balance sheet and in real time.
By contrast, in an FPS the retail payee receives final funds immediately, but the
underlying wholesale settlement between PSPs may be deferred.18 This delay
implies a short-term loan between parties, together with underlying credit risk on
those exposures (Graph III.6): the payee’s bank credits its account in real time, while
it has an account payable vis-à-vis the payer’s bank. In an FPS with deferred
settlement, credit exposures between banks accumulate during the delay, for

example over weekends. This exposure may be fully or partially collateralised – an
institutional safeguard designed by the central bank.
Nevertheless, a CBDC allows for a more direct form of settlement, eliminating
the need for intermediary credit and hence simplifying the architecture of the
monetary system. An example of the potential benefits, to be discussed in a later
section, is the potential to address the high costs and inefficiencies of international
payments by extending these virtues of greater simplicity to the cross-border case.
At a more basic level, CBDCs could provide a tangible link between the general
public and the central bank in the same way that cash does, as a salient marker of
the trust in sound money itself. This might be seen as part of the social contract

between the central bank and the public. CBDCs would continue to provide such a
tangible connection even if cash use were to dwindle.
Ultimately, whether a jurisdiction chooses to introduce CBDCs, FPS or other
systems will depend on the efficiency of their legacy payment systems, economic
development, legal frameworks and user preferences, as well as their aims. Based
on the results of a recent survey, payments safety and financial stability
considerations (also in the light of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins) tend to weigh
more heavily in advanced economies. In EMDEs, financial inclusion is a more
important consideration.19 Irrespective of the aims, an important point is that the
underlying economics concerning the competitive landscape and data governance
turn out to be the pivotal factors. These are shaped by the central bank itself.

CBDC architectures and the financial system
Vital to the success of a retail CBDC is an appropriate division of labour between
the central bank and the private sector. CBDCs potentially strike a new balance
between central bank and private money.20 They will be part of an ecosystem with a
range of private PSPs that enhances efficiency without impairing central banks’
monetary policy and financial stability missions. Central banks and PSPs could
continue to work together in a complementary way, with each doing what they do
best: the central bank providing the foundational infrastructure of the monetary
system and the private PSPs using their creativity, infrastructure and ingenuity to
serve customers.
Indeed, there are good arguments against a one-tier system fully operated by
the central bank, ie a direct CBDC (Graph III.7, top panel).21 Direct CBDCs would imply
a large shift of operational tasks (and costs) associated with user-facing activities

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

Retail CBDC architectures and central bank-private sector cooperation

Graph III.7

In the direct CBDC model (top panel), the central bank handles all payments in real time and thus keeps a record of all retail holdings. A hybrid
CBDC architecture (middle panel) incorporates a two-tier structure with direct claims on the central bank, while real-time payments are
handled by intermediaries. However, the central bank periodically updates and retains a copy of all retail CBDC holdings. By contrast, an
intermediated CBDC architecture runs a wholesale ledger (bottom panel). In this architecture, PSPs would need to be closely supervised to
ensure at all times that the wholesale holdings they communicate to the central bank indeed add up to the sum of all retail accounts.

no 948, June 2021.

from the private sector to the central bank. These include account opening, account
maintenance and enforcement of AML/CFT rules, as well as day-to-day customer
service. Such a shift would detract from the role of the central bank as a relatively
lean and focused public institution at the helm of economic policy.
Equally important is the long-term impact on innovation. Banks, fintechs and big
techs are best placed to use their expertise and creativity to lead innovative initiatives,
and integrate payment services with consumer platforms and other financial
products. Central banks should actively promote such innovations, not hinder them.
Most fundamentally, a payment system in which the central bank has a
large footprint would imply that it could quickly find itself assuming a financial

78

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

intermediation function that private sector intermediaries are better suited to
perform. If central banks were to take on too great a share of bank liabilities, they
might find themselves taking over bank assets too.22
For these reasons, CBDCs are best designed as part of a two-tier system, where
the central bank and the private sector each play their respective role. A logical
step in their design is to delegate the majority of operational tasks and consumerfacing activities to commercial banks and non-bank PSPs that provide retail services
on a competitive level playing field. Meanwhile, the central bank can focus on
operating the core of the system. It guarantees the stability of value, ensures the
elasticity of the aggregate supply of money and oversees the system’s overall
security.
However, as households and firms hold direct claims on the central bank in a
retail CBDC, some operational involvement of the central bank is inevitable. Exactly
where the line is drawn between the respective roles of the central bank and private
PSPs depends on data governance and the capacity for regulation of PSPs.
One possibility is an operational architecture in which the private sector
onboards all clients, is responsible for enforcing AML/CFT regulations and ongoing
due diligence, and conducts all retail payments in real time. However, the central
bank also records retail balances. This “hybrid” CBDC architecture (Graph III.7,
centre panel) allows the central bank to act as a backstop to the payment system.
Should a PSP fail, the central bank has the necessary information – the balances of
the PSP’s clients – allowing it to substitute for the PSP and guarantee a working
payment system. The e-CNY, the CBDC issued by the People’s Bank of China and
currently in a trial phase, exemplifies such a hybrid design.23
An alternative model is one in which the central bank does not record retail
transactions, but only the wholesale balances of individual PSPs (Graph III.7, bottom
panel). The detailed records of retail transactions are maintained by the PSP. The
benefits of such an “intermediated” CBDC architecture would be a diminished need
for centralised data collection and perhaps better data security due to the
decentralised nature of record-keeping – aspects that have been discussed in
several advanced economies.24 By reducing the concentration of data, such designs
could also enhance privacy (see next section). The downside is that additional
safeguards and prudential standards would be necessary, as PSPs would need to be
supervised to ensure at all times that the wholesale holdings they communicate to
the central bank accurately reflect the retail holdings of their clients.
An important aspect of any technical system for a CBDC is that it embodies a
digital ledger recording who has paid what to whom and when. The ledger
effectively serves as the memory of all transactions in the economy.25 The idea that
money embodies the economy’s memory means that a key design choice is
whether a CBDC should rely on a trusted central authority to maintain the
transactions ledger, or whether it is based on a decentralised governance system. In
both a hybrid and an intermediated architecture, the central bank can choose to
run the infrastructure to support record-keeping, messaging and related tasks, or
delegate these tasks to a private sector provider.
Assessing the merits of each approach is an area of ongoing research. These
studies also cover novel forms of decentralisation enabled via distributed ledger
technology (DLT, see glossary). So-called permissioned DLT is envisioned in many
current CBDC prototypes. In the process of updating the ledger of payment records,
such permissioned DLT systems borrow concepts from decentralised cryptocurrencies,
but remedy the problems due to illicit activity by allowing validation only by a
network of vetted or permissioned validators.
Permissioned DLT designs may have economic potential in financial markets
and payments due to enhanced robustness and the potentially lower cost of

achieving good governance, as compared with systems with a central intermediary.
However, such resilience does not come for free, as an effective decentralised
design that ensures the right incentives of the different validators is costly to
maintain. On balance, a trusted centralised design may often be superior, as it
depends less on aligning the incentives of multiple private parties.26
These design choices will also have a bearing on the industrial organisation of
the market for payments. They will determine the requirements for data governance
and privacy, as well as the resultant DNA loop and market structure.
In the hybrid CBDC model, the central bank would have access to the full
record of CBDC transactions. This would lead to a competitive level playing field
among private PSPs, but comes at the expense of a greater concentration of data in
the hands of the central bank itself. Additional data governance requirements may
be needed in such cases, as we discuss below.
An intermediated CBDC model would have economic consequences that are
similar to those of today’s retail FPS. These are based on an open architecture in
which PSPs retain an important role in protecting customer data. In such systems,
APIs ensure interoperability and data access between PSPs (see Box III.B above),
thereby avoiding closed networks and walled gardens. Instead, PSPs would operate
customer wallets as a custodian, rather than holding deposit liabilities vis-à-vis the
users of the payment system. This would simplify the settlement process. Further, a
level playing field ensures that network effects would facilitate a virtuous cycle of
greater user participation and lower costs through competition and private sector
innovation.
However, any CBDC architecture faces issues of data governance. The risks of
data breaches would put an additional onus on the institutional and legal
safeguards for data protection. This consideration also applies to today’s
conventional payment system, in which PSPs store customer data. Yet data privacy
and cyber resilience take on added importance in a system with a CBDC, especially
on the part of the issuing central bank. To address these concerns, CBDC designs
can incorporate varying degrees of anonymity, as discussed in the next section.
In addition to these operational considerations, the broader impact on financial
intermediation activity is an important consideration in assessing the economic
impact of CBDCs. Just like cash, CBDCs can be designed to maximise usefulness in
payments, without giving rise to large inflows onto the central bank’s balance sheet.
The design of CBDCs should further mitigate the systemic implications for financial
intermediation, by ensuring that commercial banks can continue to serve as
intermediaries between savers and borrowers. While cash offers safety and
convenience in payments, it is not widely used as store of value. Today, consumers’
holdings of cash for payment purposes are in fact minimal in comparison with sight
deposits at commercial banks (Graph III.8).
Central banks have ample scope to ensure the smooth functioning of
intermediation activities and possess the tools to achieve this objective (Table III.2).
One option is to remunerate CBDC holdings at a lower interest rate than that on
commercial bank deposits.27 Just as cash holdings offer no remuneration, a central
bank could pay zero interest, or in principle a negative interest rate. For CBDCs tied
to an identity scheme (ie account-based CBDCs), any potential encroachment on
private intermediaries could be further mitigated via caps that restrict the amount
of CBDC held by households and businesses. Another option might combine caps
and an interest rate policy, with CBDC balances below a given level earning a zero
or low interest rate and balances above that level earning a negative interest rate.
One caveat with hard caps is that households or firms that have reached their cap
could not accept incoming payments, resulting in a broken payment process. To
ensure that households and firms can accept incoming payments at all times, any

funds in excess of a cap could be transferred automatically to a linked commercial
bank deposit account – the so-called overflow approach.28 Caps, overflows and
remuneration policies would not only limit the impact of a CBDC on credit
intermediation in normal times, but they could also mitigate potential runs into the
CBDC during market turmoil. Central banks might devise various ways of deterring
“digital runs” from commercial banks to CBDCs in times of stress.29
On top of these considerations, an economic design which limits a CBDC’s
footprint would also ensure that its issuance does not impair the monetary policy
transmission process. Instead, interest-bearing CBDCs would give central banks an
additional instrument for steering real activity and inflation.30 If changes to the
policy rate were directly passed through to CBDC remuneration, monetary
transmission could be strengthened. There has also been discussion about the use
of CBDCs to stimulate aggregate demand through direct transfers to the public.
Rather than the use of the CBDC per se, the key challenge for such transfers is to
identify recipients and their accounts.31 In any case, as CBDCs would coexist with
cash, users would have access to either instrument, and it is unlikely that deeply
negative interest rates would prevail, or that CBDC would materially change the
effective lower bound on monetary policy rates.
Overall, a two-tiered architecture emerges as the most promising direction for
the design of the overall payment system, in which central banks provide the
foundations while leaving consumer-facing tasks to the private sector. In such a
system, PSPs can continue to generate revenue from fees as well as benefiting
from an expanded customer base through the provision of CBDC wallets and
additional embedded digital services. A CBDC grounded in such a two-tiered
system also ensures that commercial banks can maintain their vital function of
intermediating funds in the economy. Both hybrid and intermediated models give
central banks design options for sound data governance and high privacy
standards. In either system, CBDCs could be supported by policy tools so that any
unintended ramifications for the financial system and monetary policy could be
mitigated.

Identification and privacy in CBDC design
Effective identification is crucial to every payment system. It guarantees the system’s
safety and integrity, by preventing fraud and bolstering efforts to counter money
laundering and other illicit activities. Sound identification is further required to
ensure equal access for all users.
To ensure access and integrity in today’s financial system, bank and non-bank
PSPs verify identity. When customers open an account, PSPs often demand physical
documents, eg passports or driving licenses. For cash, small transactions are
anonymous and largely unregulated for practical reasons, but identity checks apply
to high-value payments. Despite these measures, identity fraud is a key concern in
the digital economy.32 These considerations suggest that a token-based CBDC
which comes with full anonymity could facilitate illegal activity, and is therefore
unlikely to serve the public interest.33
Identification at some level is hence central in the design of CBDCs. This calls
for a CBDC that is account-based and ultimately tied to a digital identity, but with
safeguards on data privacy as additional features. A digital identity scheme, which
could combine information from a variety of sources to circumvent the need for
paper-based documentation, will thus play an important role in such an accountbased design. By drawing on information from national registries and from other
public and private sources, such as education certificates, tax and benefits records,
property registries etc, a digital ID serves to establish individual identities online.34
It opens up access to a range of digital services, for example when opening a
transaction account or online shopping, and protects against fraud and identity
theft.
Assuming that CBDCs are to be account-based, an important question is who
should verify the identity of an individual seeking to join the network of CBDC

users, and how this verification should be done. Digital ID schemes have already
emerged in several countries, but their specific designs and the relative roles of the
public and private sector differ substantially (Graph III.9).
At one end of the spectrum are systems that rely exclusively on private parties
to verify identity. Big techs such as Google or Facebook, and Alibaba or Tencent in
China have developed their own digital IDs that are required for many of their
services, including payment apps (panel 1). In some cases, consortiums of private
firms provide a harmonised ID that works across multiple providers (panel 2). For
example, yes® will allow customers of Germany’s savings and cooperative banks to
use their online banking details as a digital ID. The main drawback of purely private
IDs is that they are limited to the specific network for which they are designed, and
hence may lead to silos and limited interoperability with other services.
Some countries follow models based on public-private partnership. In one
variant, market-driven collaboration is guided by principles set out by the
authorities (panel 3). For instance, a consortium of banks in Sweden developed the
BankID solution, which allows users to authenticate themselves for payments and
government services. Similar solutions are offered in Denmark, Finland and Norway.
Proceeding one step further are systems in which the private and official sector
develop a common governance framework and strive for interoperability between
their services, as seen in France or the Netherlands (panel 4). Government-led
solutions represent the furthest-reaching model (panel 5). These allow administrative

databases to be linked up, further enhancing the functionality and usefulness of
digital ID. For example, Estonia provides every citizen with a digital identity that
allows access to all of the country’s e-services. In Singapore, the SingPass platform
provides a digital identity linked to individuals’ biometrics (facial recognition and
fingerprints). The Kenyan Huduma Namba system brings together information from
various sources and allows access to a range of public services.
In an alternative, nascent model of digital ID, an individual has ownership and
control over their credentials. These can be selectively shared with counterparties,
who can verify that the credentials belong to a valid issuer. In such a “federated”
model, different attributes of each person are recorded and issued by different
entities. A federated digital ID (see glossary) could potentially allow for identification
alongside decentralised storage of data.
Any identification framework requires a high standard of cyber security. PSPs
have been frequently targeted by cyber attacks, both before and during the
Covid-19 pandemic (Graph III.10, left-hand panel). The rising incidence of major
data breaches in recent years, in particular at financial institutions (right-hand
panel), underscores the possibility that data or funds may be stolen. Such risks
would be similar for CBDC payment services.
These risks underline that, while identification (based on a unique digital ID) is
crucial for the safety of the payment system and transactions in a CBDC, there is a
countervailing imperative to protect the privacy and safety of users. Beyond theft,
the combination of transaction, geolocation, social media and search data raises
concerns about data abuse and even personal safety. As such, protecting an
individual’s privacy from both commercial providers and governments has the
attributes of a basic right. In this light, preventing the erosion of privacy warrants a
cautious approach to digital identity.
Consequently, it is most useful to implement anonymity with respect to specific
parties, such as PSPs, businesses or public agencies. CBDC designs can allow for

privacy by separating payment services from control over the resulting data. Like
some FPS, CBDCs could give users control over their payments data, which they
need only share with PSPs or third parties as they decide (eg to support a credit
application or other services). This can protect against data hoarding and abuse of
personal data by commercial parties. Such designs can also prevent access by the
central bank and other public authorities, while still allowing access by law
enforcement authorities in exceptional cases – similar to today’s bank secrecy laws.
In addition to the issue of who can access data, governance issues need to be
addressed with respect to who holds the data. Concentration of data in the hands
of a single entity puts an additional premium on the institutional and legal
safeguards for data protection.
In recognition of these data governance issues, some CBDC designs aim to
safeguard anonymity through additional overlays, even for account-based CBDCs.
One proposal is to ensure the anonymity of small-value transactions by issuing
vouchers which are maintained by a separate data registrar that issues them up to
some limit in the user’s name. Another approach, considered in the case of China’s
e-CNY, is to shield the identity of the user by designating the user’s public key,
which is issued by the mobile phone operator, as the digital ID. The central bank
would not have access to the underlying personal details.35
Overall, these developments suggest that the most promising way of providing
central bank money in the digital age is an account-based CBDC built on digital ID
with official sector involvement. Digital ID could prove more efficient than physical
documents, opening up many ways of supporting digital services in general. One size
would not fit all in the choice of digital identification systems, as different societies
will have different needs and preferences. A recent referendum in Switzerland
illustrates this. While voters did not object to a digital ID in general, they rejected
the proposal for one provided by the private sector.36 The foundational, public
good nature of digital ID suggests that the public sector has an important role to
play in providing or regulating such systems.

The international dimension of CBDC issuance
The globalisation of economic activity has required a commensurate evolution of
cross-border online services. The massive growth of travel and remittances has led
to rising demand for cross-border retail payment services.37 International tourism
expenditures, for instance, have doubled over the past 15 years, while the number
of parcels shipped across borders has more than tripled. In just one decade, global
remittances rose by two thirds, to $720 billion in 2019 (Graph III.11, left-hand panel).
Yet payment services do not work seamlessly across borders, as they are at times
slow, expensive, opaque and cumbersome to use.
CBDCs could pave the way for innovations that improve international payments.
They can make use of the fact that retail users have direct claims on central bank
money to simplify the monetary architecture.38 However, design features matter for
their overall impact in the cross-border context and whether CBDCs will serve the
broader public interest. One potential concern is that the use of CBDCs across
borders might exacerbate the risk of currency substitution, whereby a foreign
digital currency displaces the domestic currency to the detriment of financial
stability and monetary sovereignty. Indeed, a number of central banks see currency
substitution – along with tax avoidance and more volatile exchange rates – as a key
risk that they are addressing in their work on CBDCs (Graph III.11, centre panel).39
Such concerns around potential harmful spillovers associated with currency
substitution are not new. So-called dollarisation refers to the domestic use of a

foreign currency in daily transactions and financial contracts, as well as the
associated macroeconomic implications. Dollarisation, a long-running theme in
international finance, is widespread in some economies.
However, the effective design of CBDCs based on digital ID and implemented
as an account-based system can be expected to largely eliminate such risks. The
potential for a foreign CBDC to make deep inroads into the domestic market, or to
take off as a “dominant” global currency, is likely to be limited. For example, for
China’s account-based e-CNY to circulate widely in another jurisdiction, both the
issuing central bank (the People’s Bank of China), and to a large extent also the
central bank of the receiving jurisdiction would need to accept this situation. The
issuing central bank would need to recognise a foreign user’s digital ID as that of a
bona fide member of the CBDC network. The idea of paper currency circulating in
the black market is thus an inaccurate analogy to how a CBDC would operate. In
this sense, CBDCs have attributes that are very different to those of cash, even
though both are direct claims on the central bank.
More broadly, it is important to bear in mind the dictum that the payment
system does not exist in a vacuum. Payments mirror underlying economic
transactions. The existence of a payment need reflects the economic transaction
between the payer and the payee, for instance, a tourist from China who is shopping
at a department store in a foreign holiday destination. Since issuing central banks
would retain control over cross-border usage, they could restrict non-residents’

86

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

access to their currency to certain permitted transactions only. This might reduce
the risk of volatile flows and currency substitution in recipient economies. Such
restrictions would resemble existing rules governing how non-residents can open a
bank account outside their home country.
Not only issuing, but also recipient economies have policy tools to address the
concerns of digital currency substitution. In particular, robust legal tender provisions
can ensure that the use of the national currency is favoured in domestic payments.
For these reasons, the risks of currency substitution from cross-border use of
CBDCs may be limited and could be addressed largely through international
monetary cooperation. The widespread international use of some currencies stems
from other factors, such as the depth, efficiency and openness of a country’s
financial markets, trust in a currency’s long-run value and confidence in the
institutional and legal infrastructure. For instance, dollarisation is typically higher in
countries with historically high inflation (Graph III.11, right-hand panel). A foreign
currency is unlikely to gain a domestic foothold just because it is digital.
The cross-border use of account-based CBDCs will require international
cooperation. One challenge relates to the use of digital ID information outside the
originating country. The issuing authority or user may not be willing to provide this
information to countries that may have different data protection regulations. ID
systems may be not fully interoperable. Indeed, even within a jurisdiction, ID
documents may be issued by several different public authorities, sometimes with
limited coordination between them. As a supranational digital ID would require
unprecedented concentration of an individual’s information, it would be politically
fraught. However, a supranational digital ID scheme would not be necessary for
cross-border cooperation on CBDCs.
Instead, international efforts towards mutually recognising national ID credentials
are a more promising approach. A G20 roadmap for cross-border payments has
given impetus to cooperative efforts in several directions, complementing the
standard-setting efforts among central banks in the BIS Committee for Payments
and Market Infrastructures.40 One building block involves fostering KYC and sharing
information on identity across borders. Another involves reviewing the interaction
between data frameworks and cross-border payments, and yet another involves
factoring an international dimension into CBDC design.41
Such cooperation could form the basis for robust payment arrangements that
tackle today’s challenges head-on. Of particular promise are multi-CBDC (mCBDC)
arrangements that join up CBDCs to interoperate across borders. These arrangements
focus on coordinating national CBDC designs with consistent access frameworks
and interlinkages to make cross-currency and cross-border payments more efficient.
In this way, they represent an alternative to private sector global stablecoin projects.42
mCBDC arrangements would allow central banks to mitigate many of today’s
frictions by starting from a “clean slate”, unburdened by legacy arrangements.
There are three potential models. First, they could enhance compatibility for CBDCs
via similar regulatory frameworks, market practices and messaging formats
(Graph III.12, top panel). Second, they could interlink CBDC systems (middle panel),
for example via technical interfaces that process end user-to-end user transactions
across currency areas without going through any middlemen.
The greatest potential for improvement is offered by the third model, a single
mCBDC system that features a jointly operated payment system hosting multiple
CBDCs (bottom panel). FX settlements would be payment-versus-payment (PvP) by
default, rather than requiring routeing or settlement instructions through a specific
entity acting as an interface. Facilitating access and compatibility through such a
system could benefit users through improved efficiency, lower costs and wider use
of cross-border payments.

Model 1 enhances compatibility for CBDCs via similar regulatory frameworks, market practices, messaging formats and data requirements.
Model 2 involves interlinked CBDC systems. This could build on enhanced compatibility while offering additional safety, via PvP settlement.
Further, common clearing mechanisms – potentially operated by central banks acting as super-correspondents in cross-currency settings –
could enhance efficiency, especially when they are linked with FX trading. Model 3 involves a jointly operated mCBDC payment system hosting
multiple CBDCs. All FX settlements would be PvP by default, rather than requiring routeing or settlement instructions through a specific entity
acting as an interface. Trading venues could also be integrated into an mCBDC system, to reduce complexity, fragmentation and concentration.

The potential benefits of these arrangements increase with the degree of
harmonisation and technical alignment. Each would require increasingly intertwined
identification schemes, but in all cases, ID would remain at a national level.
Enhanced compatibility (model 1) might require some coordination of digital ID

88

BIS Annual Economic Report 2021

schemes across payment areas, such that the same necessary information could
be used in each case to comply with AML/CFT requirements. Interlinked CBDCs
(model 2) would have to rely on some common cross-border standard for identity
schemes. An example is an approach that maps heterogeneous schemes to a shared
template. Single mCBDC systems (model 3) could be built on similar standards. Yet
even in this model, with a single, jointly operated mCBDC system, a single ID system
would not be needed; it would be sufficient for participating jurisdictions to
recognise one another’s IDs. Making the most out of CBDCs in cross-currency
transactions thus requires international cooperation.
Central banks around the world have embarked on developing mCBDC
arrangements in close collaboration to foster more efficient cross-border payments.
A prime example is the “mCBDC Bridge” project of the BIS Innovation Hub and its
partner central banks in China, Hong Kong SAR, Thailand and the United Arab
Emirates (model 3). This project explores how CBDCs could help to reduce costs,
increase transparency and tackle regulatory complexities in payments.
A broader stocktake of central bank research and design efforts finds that, out
of 47 public retail CBDC projects, 11 feature a cross-border dimension (Graph III.13,
left-hand panel). Responses to a survey of major central banks highlight that about
one in four is considering incorporating features to enhance cross-border and crosscurrency settlement in future CBDC designs (centre panel). Among the central banks
that do, all three mCBDC arrangements are being considered. While a single mCBDC
(model 3) provides the most benefits from a technological perspective, the preferred
choice at present is the interlinking mCBDC arrangement (model 2) – possibly
reflecting the reduced need for cooperation. Additionally, some central banks are
also considering taking on an operational role in FX conversion (right-hand panel).

Current and planned cross-border CBDC projects show that the future of the
international financial system rests on upgrading it for the digital age. Different
mCBDC arrangements might contribute towards this goal, but their detailed
architecture will depend on the specific features of domestic CBDC systems. Even
though payment system design is primarily a domestic choice, new technologies
and models of cooperation will make it feasible to overcome the challenges faced
by previous projects to interlink payment systems across borders.

Conclusion
Central banks stand at the centre of a rapid transformation of the financial sector
and the payment system. Innovations such as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and the
walled garden ecosystems of big techs all tend to work against the public good
element that underpins the payment system. The DNA loop, which should encourage
a virtuous circle of greater access, lower costs and better services, is also capable of
fomenting a vicious circle of entrenched market power and data concentration. The
eventual outcome will depend not only on technology but on the underlying
market structure and data governance framework.
Central banks around the world are working to safeguard public trust in money
and payments during this period of upheaval. To shape the payment system of the
future, they are fully engaged in the development of retail and wholesale CBDCs,
alongside other innovations to enhance conventional payment systems. The aim of
all these efforts is to foster innovation that serves the public interest.
CBDCs represent a unique opportunity to design a technologically advanced
representation of central bank money, one that offers the unique features of finality,
liquidity and integrity. Such currencies could form the backbone of a highly efficient
new digital payment system by enabling broad access and providing strong data
governance and privacy standards based on digital ID. To realise the full potential
of CBDCs for more efficient cross-border payments, international collaboration will
be paramount. Cooperation on CBDC designs will also open up new ways for
central banks to counter foreign currency substitution and strengthen monetary
sovereignty.

In today’s payment systems, both real-time and deferred net settlement are used. Examples of the
latter include SNCE in Spain, IBPS in China and FPS in the United Kingdom, while examples of the
former include TIPS in the euro area and BiR in Sweden. Among the CPMI members, 12 FPS use
deferred net settlement while 15 use real-time settlement.

Banks must know or estimate borrowers’ solvency to price the associated risk. Public sector
institutions may not have the same degree of relevant knowledge as local and specialised private
lenders do. This is the core case for free markets, as presented in F Hayek, “The use of knowledge
in society”, American Economic Review, vol 35, no 4, 1945, pp 519–30.

US data show that reports of identity theft have risen steadily over the last years. See Federal Trade
Commission, “Consumer Sentinel Network Data Book 2020”, February 2021.

Because of their digital, borderless nature, fully anonymous CBDCs could become a vehicle for
illicit activity. Even with transaction limits, there is the potential for “smurfing”, or laundering the
proceeds of illicit transactions into many smaller transactions or accounts.
