Assumptions and Conventions

A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook.
It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during August
4–September 1, 2010, except for the currencies participating in the European exchange rate mechanism II
(ERM II), which are assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary
policies for selected economies, see Box A1); that the average price of oil will be $76.20 a barrel in 2010 and
$78.75 a barrel in 2011 and will remain unchanged in real terms over the medium term; that the six-month
London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on U.S. dollar deposits will average 0.6 percent in 2010 and 0.8
percent in 2011; that the three-month euro deposit rate will average 0.8 percent in 2010 and 1.0 percent in
2011; and that the six-month Japanese yen deposit rate will yield on average 0.6 percent in 2010 and 0.4 percent in 2011. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that would in any event be involved in the projections. The estimates and
projections are based on statistical information available through late September 2010.
The following conventions are used throughout the World Economic Outlook:
...

to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;

–	between years or months (for example, 2009–10 or January–June) to indicate the years or months
covered, including the beginning and ending years or months;
/

between years or months (for example, 2009/10) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.

“Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
“Basis points” refer to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of
1 percentage point).
In figures and tables, shaded areas indicate IMF staff projections.
If no source is listed on tables and figures, data are drawn from the World Economic Outlook (WEO)
database.
When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size.
Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding.
As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that
is a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial
entities that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.
Composite data are provided for various groups of countries organized according to economic characteristics or region. Unless otherwise noted, country group composites represent calculations based on 90 percent or
more of the weighted group data.
The boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on the maps do not imply, on
the part of the International Monetary Fund, any judgment on the legal status of any territory or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries.

Preface

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s
surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international
financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product
of a comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on
information the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are
carried out in particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific
Department, European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere
Department—together with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets
Department; and the Fiscal Affairs Department.
The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of
Olivier Blanchard, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Jörg Decressin, Assistant Director, Research Department, and Petya Koeva Brooks, Division Chief, Research Department.
The primary contributors to this report are Abdul Abiad, Pete Devries, Rupa Duttagupta, Charles Freedman, Jaime Guajardo, Prakash Kannan, Douglas Laxton, Daniel Leigh, Prachi Mishra, Andrea Pescatori, Alasdair Scott, and Petia Topalova. Toh Kuan, Gavin Asdorian, Stephanie Denis, Angela Espiritu, Emory Oakes,
Murad Omoev, Andy Salazar, Min Kyu Song, Ercument Tulun, and Jessie Yang provided research assistance.
Saurabh Gupta, Mahnaz Hemmati, Laurent Meister, Liessel Ampie, Vladimir Bougay, Anastasia Francis,
Wendy Mak, Shamiso Mapondera, Nhu Nguyen, Pavel Pimenov, and Steve Zhang managed the database and
the computer systems. Jenita Arshad and Tita Gunio were responsible for word processing. Other contributors
include Rudolfs Bems, John Bluedorn, Philippe Bracke, Nese Erbil, Roberto Garcia-Saltos, Robert Gregory,
Thomas Helbling, Deniz Igan, Robert C. Johnson, Michael Kumhof, Prakash Loungani, Petar Manchev, Troy
Matheson, Susanna Mursula, David Reichsfeld, Shaun Roache, Jair Rodriguez, Marina Rousset, Robert J. Tetlow, and Kei-Mu Yi. David Romer of the Research Department provided advice and encouragement. Donald
Davis was an external consultant. Kevin Clinton provided comments and suggestions. Linda Griffin Kean of
the External Relations Department edited the manuscript and coordinated the production of the publication.
The analysis has benefited from comments and suggestions by staff from other IMF departments, as well as
by Executive Directors following their discussion of the report on September 20, 2010. However, both projections and policy considerations are those of the IMF staff and should not be attributed to Executive Directors
or to their national authorities.

FOREWORD

A

chieving a “strong, balanced, and sustained world recovery”—to quote from
the goal set in Pittsburgh by the G20—
was never going to be easy. It requires
much more than just going back to business as
usual. It requires two fundamental and difficult
economic rebalancing acts.
First, internal rebalancing: When private demand
collapsed, fiscal stimulus helped alleviate the fall in
output. But fiscal stimulus has to eventually give
way to fiscal consolidation, and private demand
must be strong enough to take the lead and sustain
growth.
Second, external rebalancing: Many advanced
economies, most notably the United States, which
relied excessively on domestic demand, must now
rely more on net exports. Many emerging market economies, most notably China, which relied
excessively on net exports, must now rely more on
domestic demand.
These two rebalancing acts are taking place too
slowly.
Private domestic demand remains weak in
advanced economies. This weakness reflects both
a correction of precrisis excesses and the scars of
the crisis. U.S. consumers who had overborrowed
before the crisis are now saving more and consuming less, and while this is good for the long term,
it is a drag on demand in the short term. Housing booms have given way to housing slumps, and
housing investment will remain depressed for some
time. And weaknesses in the financial system are
still constraining credit.
External rebalancing remains limited. Net exports
are not contributing to growth in advanced economies, and the U.S. trade deficit remains large. Many
emerging market economies continue to run large
current account surpluses and to respond to capital
inflows primarily through reserve accumulation
rather than exchange rate appreciation. International reserves are higher than they have ever been
and continue to increase.

The result is a recovery that is neither strong nor
balanced and runs the risk of not being sustained.
For the past year or so, inventory accumulation
and fiscal stimulus were driving the recovery. The
first is coming to an end. The second is slowly
being phased out. Consumption and investment
now have to take the lead. But in most advanced
economies, weak consumption and investment,
together with little improvement in net exports, are
leading to low growth. Unemployment is high and
barely decreasing. By contrast, in many emerging
market economies, where excesses were limited and
the scars are few, consumption, investment, and net
exports are all contributing to strong growth, and
output is once again close to potential.
What can be done to improve things?
First, and wherever private demand is weak,
central banks should continue with accommodative
monetary policy. However, one should be realistic.
Not much more can be done, and one should not
expect too much from further quantitative or credit
easing. While there is no evidence yet that sustained
low interest rates are leading to excessive risk taking, should such risks materialize, they should be
addressed through macroprudential measures, not
through increases in policy rates.
Second, and wherever needed, governments
must continue both financial repair and financial
reform. Many banks remain undercapitalized, and
tight credit is constraining segments of demand.
Securitization, which must play an important role
in any future intermediation system, is still moribund. Financial reform is proceeding, but questions
remain about “too-big-to-fail” institutions, the
perimeter of regulation, and cross-border issues. The
faster reform uncertainty is reduced, the more the
financial system will support demand and growth.
Third, and again wherever needed, governments
must address fiscal consolidation. What is essential
is not so much phasing out fiscal stimulus now,
but offering credible medium-term plans for debt
stabilization and, eventually, debt reduction. Such
xiii

FOREWORD

credible plans may involve fiscal rules, the creation of independent fiscal agencies, and phased-in
entitlement reforms. They have not been offered in
most countries, but they are essential and, once in
place, will give governments more fiscal flexibility to
sustain growth in the short term.
Fourth, emerging market economies with large
current account surpluses must accelerate rebalancing. This is not only in the world economy’s
interest, but also in their own. In many countries, distortions have led to too low a level of
consumption or too little investment. Removing
these distortions and thus allowing consumption
and investment to increase is desirable. To a large
extent, market forces in the form of large capital
inflows are pushing these countries in the right
direction. Unless offset by reserve accumulation,
capital inflows will lead to exchange rate appreciation. With the help of macroprudential measures
and capital controls, these flows can help reallocate

xiv

production toward domestic goods. Finally, to the
extent that countries remain worried about sudden
stops, better provision of global liquidity can play
an important role and limit the accumulation of
reserves.
All these pieces are interconnected. Unless
advanced economies can count on stronger private
demand, both domestic and foreign, they will find
it difficult to achieve fiscal consolidation. And worries about sovereign risk can easily derail growth.
If growth stops in advanced economies, emerging
market economies will have a hard time decoupling.
The need for careful design at the national level,
and coordination at the global level, may be even
more important today than at the peak of the crisis,
a year and a half ago.

Olivier Blanchard
Economic Counsellor

Executive Summary

Thus far, economic recovery is proceeding broadly as
expected, but downside risks remain elevated. Most
advanced economies and a few emerging economies
still face large adjustments. Their recoveries are
proceeding at a sluggish pace, and high unemployment poses major social challenges. By contrast, many
emerging and developing economies are again seeing
strong growth, because they did not experience major
financial excesses just prior to the Great Recession.
Sustained, healthy recovery rests on two rebalancing
acts: internal rebalancing, with a strengthening of
private demand in advanced economies, allowing for
fiscal consolidation; and external rebalancing, with
an increase in net exports in deficit countries, such
as the United States, and a decrease in net exports in
surplus countries, notably emerging Asia. The two
interact in strong ways. Increased net exports in
advanced economies imply higher demand and higher
growth, allowing more room for fiscal consolidation. Strengthened domestic demand helps emerging
market economies maintain growth in the face of
lower exports. A number of policies are required to
support these rebalancing acts. In advanced economies,
the repair and reform of the financial sector need
to accelerate to allow a resumption of healthy credit
growth. In addition, fiscal adjustment needs to start
in earnest in 2011. Specific plans to cut future budget
deficits are urgently needed now to create new room
for fiscal policy maneuver. If global growth threatens
to slow appreciably more than expected, countries
with fiscal room could postpone some of the planned
consolidation. Meanwhile, key emerging economies
will need to further develop domestic sources of growth,
with the support of greater exchange rate flexibility.

Stronger Activity, but Setbacks to Financial
Stability
Economic recovery continued to strengthen during the first half of 2010. Global activity expanded
at an annual rate of about 5¼ percent––about ½
percent higher than anticipated in the July World

Economic Outlook (WEO) Update. A surge in inventory and, lately, fixed investment accounted for a
dramatic rise in manufacturing and global trade.
Low consumer confidence and reduced household
incomes and wealth are holding consumption down
in many advanced economies. Growth in these
economies reached only about 3½ percent during
the first half of 2010, a low rate considering that
they are emerging from the deepest recession since
World War II. Their recoveries will remain fragile
for as long as improving business investment does
not translate into higher employment growth. However, household spending is doing well in many
emerging market economies, which expanded by
close to 8 percent and where investment is propelling job creation. This heterogeneity in the pace of
recovery across advanced and emerging economies
is discussed in detail in Chapter 2.
At the same time, financial stability suffered a
major setback, as explained in the accompanying
October 2010 Global Financial Stability Report
(GFSR). Market volatility increased and investor
confidence dropped. Prices in many stock exchanges
fell, led initially by financial stocks and by European markets. Heavy selling of the sovereign debt of
vulnerable euro area economies rattled the banking system, triggering a systemic crisis. This added
to existing worries about the sustainability of the
recovery and caused a broader decline in stocks.
Risk premiums on corporate bonds widened, and
corporate bond issues slowed to a trickle in May.
Issuance in emerging markets also dropped sharply.
Since the beginning of the summer, however, financial conditions have improved again. Tail risks have
been reduced by unprecedented European policy
initiatives—the European Central Bank’s Securities Markets Program and euro area governments’
European Stabilization Mechanism—and by a
front-loading of fiscal adjustment. However, underlying sovereign and banking vulnerabilities remain a
significant challenge amid lingering concerns about
risks to the global recovery.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Questions about the Pace of Recovery
The global recovery remains fragile, because
strong policies to foster internal rebalancing of
demand from public to private sources and external rebalancing from deficit to surplus economies
are not yet in place. Global activity is forecast to
expand by 4.8 percent in 2010 and 4.2 percent
in 2011, broadly in line with earlier expectations,
and downside risks continue to predominate.
WEO projections are that output of emerging and
developing economies will expand at rates of 7.1
and 6.4 percent, respectively, in 2010 and 2011. In
advanced economies, however, growth is projected
at only 2.7 and 2.2 percent, respectively, with some
economies slowing noticeably during the second
half of 2010 and the first half of 2011, followed
by a reacceleration of activity. Slack will remain
substantial and unemployment persistently high.
Inflation is projected to stay generally low, amid
continued excess capacity and high unemployment,
with a few exceptions among the emerging economies. Risks to the growth forecasts are mainly to
the downside. However, the probability of a sharp
global slowdown, including stagnation or contraction in advanced economies, still appears low.

More Proactive Policies Are Needed
Policies need to become more proactive to
achieve the required internal and external rebalancing. Most advanced economies and a few emerging
economies still face major adjustments, including
the need to strengthen household balance sheets,
stabilize and subsequently reduce high public
debt, and repair and reform their financial sectors.
Monetary policy should stay highly supportive in
most of the advanced economies and should be the
first line of defense against any larger-than-projected
weakening of activity as fiscal support diminishes.
With policy rates already near zero in the large
advanced economies, monetary policymakers may
have to resort to further unconventional measures
if private demand weakens unexpectedly as fiscal
support wanes.
Fiscal adjustment needs to start in 2011. If global
growth threatens to slow appreciably more than
xvi

expected, countries with fiscal room could postpone
some of the planned consolidation. One of the
most urgent challenges for advanced economies is
to legislate plans that help achieve sustainable fiscal
positions before the end of the decade. This task is
now more pressing than it was six months ago to
rebuild room for fiscal policy maneuver in the face
of still-volatile sovereign debt markets. Such room
could be needed because monetary policy alone
might not be able to provide sufficient support to
counter the threat of a weakening of activity that is
markedly more pronounced than expected.
Fiscal policy tightening will likely prove contractionary in most economies, although the extent is
difficult to gauge. The survey of past experience
in Chapter 3 suggests that fiscal consolidation
in advanced economies typically detracts from
short-term growth. The introduction of credible,
growth-friendly, medium-term fiscal consolidation
plans––currently not on offer in many advanced
economies––would help limit the deflationary
impact of consolidation on private demand in
the short term. Such plans would have to include
reforms to rapidly growing spending programs,
notably entitlements, and tax reforms that favor
production rather than consumption.
Better financial sector policies and practices in
advanced economies are critical for strengthening
the resilience of the recovery to shocks and sustaining private demand over the medium term. Progress
on this front has been very slow. Apparently isolated
difficulties in a few spots can have large spillover
effects, via complex financial linkages and deterioration of fragile confidence. As the October 2010
GFSR explains, incomplete progress in addressing
the legacy problems of the crisis has left systems in
advanced economies vulnerable. Failure to rapidly
resolve, restructure, or consolidate weak banks and
repair wholesale markets raises the need for further
fiscal backstopping and low interest rates to support
recovery, which can cause other problems, including spillovers to emerging economies. More broadly,
policymakers need to continue to clarify and specify
regulatory reform, building on the improvements
proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision. This would help financial markets and
institutions provide more support, on a sounder

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

basis, for consumption and investment, which is
essential for strong, sustainable growth.
Structural policies that strengthen growth over
the medium term would also help support the
required normalization of macroeconomic policies
in advanced economies. While supportive macroeconomic policies and financial sector repair and
reform are essential for stronger job creation, in a
number of economies, labor market policies could
enhance growth and job creation and reduce high
unemployment over the medium term. Complementary reforms to product and services markets
could strengthen the employment effects by boosting labor demand and real wages through greater
competition and lower markups on prices.
Although many emerging economies are seeing
high growth again, they continue to rely significantly on demand from advanced economies.
Chapter 4 makes clear that demand for imports
from the advanced economies will continue to be
below precrisis trends, in view of the high share
of consumer durables and investment goods in
trade. Emerging economies that relied heavily on
demand from these economies will therefore have to
rebalance growth further toward domestic sources
to achieve growth rates similar to those before the
crisis, helping the required external rebalancing.
In economies with excessive external surpluses,
which are mainly in emerging Asia, fiscal tightening should therefore take a backseat to monetary
tightening and exchange rate flexibility. Removing
distortions that drive high household or corporate
saving rates and deter investment in nontradables
sectors would facilitate the rebalancing of growth
to domestic sources. Such rebalancing will require
further deregulation and reform of financial sectors
and corporate governance, as well as stronger social
safety nets in key Asian economies. In many other
emerging economies, fiscal tightening can start

immediately, because domestic demand recovery is
already well under way or public debt is relatively
high. In various emerging economies, rising inflation or high credit growth also signal a need for
further monetary tightening.
Many emerging and developing economies have
successfully concluded first-generation reforms
that improved macroeconomic policy frameworks,
strengthening their resilience to macroeconomic
shocks. However, to sustain or further raise potential growth and employment, efforts could usefully
focus on simplifying product and services market
regulation, raising human capital, and building
critical infrastructure. Such reforms would also help
absorb growing capital inflows in a productive manner, which would accelerate global income convergence and external rebalancing. As Chapter 1 and
the October 2010 GFSR underscore, these flows
can be expected to grow over the medium term, as
the performance of emerging economies improves
relative to that of the advanced economies, yields in
the advanced economies remain low for some time,
and institutional investors in advanced economies
continue to diversify their exposures.
Strong, coordinated policy responses by all are
essential to limit the fallout of the Great Recession. Historical evidence suggests that countries
hit by financial crises typically suffer permanent
output losses relative to precrisis trends. However, outcomes after individual crises have varied
widely, depending on the policy responses. So far,
much progress has been made through coordinated
policy responses in alleviating liquidity strains and
rebuilding confidence, and this has been essential
for activity to rebound. The challenge ahead is for
policymakers to put in place, in a coordinated manner, policies that support the fundamental adjustments needed for a return to healthy medium-term
growth.

Global Prospects and Policies

Thus far, economic recovery is proceeding broadly as
expected, although downside risks remain elevated. Most
advanced and a few emerging economies still face major
adjustments, including the need to strengthen household
balance sheets, stabilize and subsequently reduce high
public debt, and repair and reform their financial sectors.
In many of these economies, the financial sector is still
vulnerable to shocks, and growth appears to be slowing as policy stimulus wanes. By contrast, in emerging
and developing economies prudent policies, implemented
partly in response to earlier crises, have contributed to
a significantly improved medium-term growth outlook
relative to the aftermath of previous global recessions.
However, activity in these economies, particularly those
in emerging Asia, remains dependent on demand in
advanced economies. In this setting, global activity is forecast to expand by 4.8 percent in 2010 and 4.2 percent in
2011, with a temporary slowdown during the second half
of 2010 and the first half of 2011. Output of emerging and developing economies is projected to expand at
rates of 7.1 percent and 6.4 percent in 2010 and 2011,
respectively. In advanced economies, however, growth is
projected to be only 2.7 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively. Risks to the forecast are mainly to the downside.
Sustained, healthy recovery rests on two rebalancing acts:
internal rebalancing, with a strengthening of private
demand in advanced economies, allowing for fiscal
consolidation; and external rebalancing, with an increase
in net exports in deficit countries and a decrease in net
exports in surplus countries, notably emerging Asia. The
two interact in strong ways. Increased net exports in
advanced economies imply higher demand and higher
growth, allowing more room for fiscal consolidation. A
number of policies are required to support these rebalancing acts. In advanced economies, repair and reform of the
financial sector need to accelerate to allow a resumption
of healthy credit growth. In addition, fiscal adjustment
needs to start in earnest in 2011. Specific plans to cut
future budget deficits are urgently needed to create new
room for fiscal policy maneuver. If global growth threatens
to slow appreciably more than expected, countries with
fiscal room could postpone some of the planned con-

solidation. Meanwhile, key emerging economies will
need to further develop domestic sources of growth,
with the support of greater exchange rate flexibility.

Stronger Activity, but Setbacks to Financial
Stability
Economic recovery continued to strengthen
during the first half of 2010, but global financial
stability suffered a major setback with the turmoil
in sovereign debt markets in the second quarter
of 2010. The extent of economic recovery differs
importantly across regions, with Asia in the lead.
The United States and Japan experienced a noticeable slowdown during the second quarter of 2010,
while growth accelerated in Europe and stayed
strong in emerging and developing economies.
Financial conditions have begun to normalize, but
institutions and markets are still fragile. In general,
volatility in financial, currency, and commodity
markets remains elevated.

Growing Momentum through the First Half of 2010
The world economy expanded at an annual rate
of about 5¼ percent during the first half of 2010––
about ½ percent higher than in the July 2010 World
Economic Outlook (WEO) Update (Table 1.1). World
industrial production reached growth rates of about
15 percent, and global trade recovered at rates over
40 percent during this period (Figure 1.1). A surge
in inventory and, lately, fixed investment accounts
for this dramatic rise––with the latter in particular
boding well for continued recovery. Manufacturing
confidence indices are back to precrisis levels, and
employment in advanced economies is expanding
moderately. Household spending is doing well in
emerging market economies, but in advanced economies, low consumer confidence, high unemployment,
stagnant incomes, and reduced household wealth
are holding ­consumption down. Chapter 2 discusses
regional developments in more detail.

chapter 1

Growth in advanced economies reached about
3½ percent during the first half of 2010. This is
low, considering that these economies are emerging from the deepest recession since World War II.
Three groups can be distinguished (Figure 1.2):
•• The economies of advanced Asia, other than
Japan, have enjoyed a strong rebound. Their large
manufacturing sectors have benefited from the
global rebound in trade. As a result, their output
is already above precrisis levels.
•• The United States is close to precrisis levels of
output but far below precrisis trends, and activity
slowed noticeably in the second quarter of 2010.
Consumption has been growing since the third
quarter of 2009, but at low rates considering the
depth of the retrenchment. At the same time,
investment in business equipment and software
has been rising strongly lately, helped by foreign
demand, rebounding profits, and normalizing
financial conditions. However, this has not yet
triggered a sustained, solid recovery in employment and real estate activity remains very weak.
•• Japan and the euro area are still appreciably
below precrisis levels of output and remain
dependent on foreign demand. In Japan, fiscal
stimulus and the rebound in global trade and
strong demand elsewhere in Asia have boosted
output growth since the fourth quarter of 2009,
but activity weakened significantly in the second
quarter of 2010. In the euro area, led by Germany, activity showed significant strength only
in the second quarter of this year, following
a bad winter. The area’s dependence on bank
credit is restraining demand, as banks continue
to be unusually cautious in lending. However,
the depreciation of the euro from previous highs
is beginning to support the euro area’s tradable
goods sector, and fixed investment is staging a
modest comeback.
Emerging economies expanded by about 8 percent during the first half of the year. As in advanced
economies, there is significant heterogeneity both
across and within regions, with Asian and Latin
American economies in the lead. In both regions,
fixed investment has expanded vigorously, just as
inventory rebuilding has slowed and policy stimulus
has waned. This is a sign that autonomous private

World trade and industrial production have continued to rebound, and
employment has begun to grow again in advanced economies. Retail sales have
recovered. They are buoyant in emerging economies but lagging in advanced
economies, reflecting still-low consumer confidence. Recently, manufacturing
confidence has receded, but it remains consistent with further expansion.

Private consumption has recovered impressively in emerging economies but is
lagging in advanced economies. However, investment excluding construction
has staged a rebound in advanced economies, suggesting medium- rather than
short-term considerations are increasingly driving activity. This bodes well for
employment and consumption in the future. In the meantime, output in many
advanced economies is still around or below precrisis levels. Commodity prices
have recovered. Recent wheat price hikes are not representative of broader
developments in food prices.

demand is overtaking short-term, policy-related factors in the recovery.
•• Growth in emerging Asia reached about 9½
percent, as robust domestic demand spread from
China, India, and Indonesia to other Asian
economies. In China, major fiscal stimulus, a
large expansion of credit, and a number of specific measures to boost household incomes and
consumption increased domestic demand growth
to close to 13 percent in 2009, contributing to a
large decline in the current account surplus. The
recovery is now well established, and a transition
from public stimulus to private-sector-led growth
is under way.
•• Latin America has also recovered strongly,
with real GDP growth at about 7 percent. The
recovery is being led by Brazil, where real GDP
growth has been running close to 10 percent
since the third quarter of 2009 and the economy
is now showing signs of overheating. A number
of other economies have also returned to solid
growth. However, Mexico is lagging, partly
because of its strong trade linkages with the
United States. Growth in Mexico recently picked
up on the back of strengthening exports to the
United States, but the output gap remains large.
•• Many developing economies were less affected by
the global recession and now seem to be sharing in the pickup in world trade, and estimates
for growth in 2010 are generally encouraging.
Available data for African and Middle Eastern
economies point to robust growth. By contrast,
economies that were hit particularly hard by the
crisis are struggling to return to sustained growth,
including in many parts of emerging Europe and
the Commonwealth of Independent States, where
the recovery remains much more subdued.
Unemployment in advanced economies has
receded only modestly from peak rates. Estimates
are that more than 210 million people across the
globe are unemployed, an increase of more than 30
million since 2007. Three-fourths of the increase
has occurred in the advanced economies (with the
remainder in emerging market economies). In the
United States, the unemployed face record-long
periods of joblessness, and recent payroll data point
to a slowdown in employment growth in the second

chapter 1

quarter. In the euro area, the labor market shows
continued resilience in Germany, considering the
depth of the recession, but in Spain unemployment
is not showing any signs of abating from very high
levels, owing to labor market rigidities and the
collapse of construction. In emerging economies,
unemployment has broadly declined in parallel with
a strengthening recovery, with a few exceptions (for
example, South Africa).

Global Prospects and Policies

Figure 1.3. Recent Financial Market Developments
Equity markets have surrendered part of their large 2009 gains, and volatility
spiked during the first quarter. Losses were led by financial stocks in Europe.
However, as concerns about sustainability of the recovery grew, losses

discretionary consumer products. Commodity prices generally retreated, but
gold prices shot up, driven by rising investor risk aversion.

Financial stability suffered a major setback during
the first half of the year. As explained in the accompanying October 2010 Global Financial Stability
Report (GFSR), market volatility increased and risk
appetite declined when heavy selling of the sovereign debt of vulnerable euro area economies rattled
banking systems and triggered a systemic crisis as
funding stress spread to banks and sovereigns. This
added to existing worries about the sustainability
of the recovery and caused a broader decline in
stocks. Prices in many stock exchanges fell by 10
to 15 percent (Figure 1.3). Initially, the fall was led
by financial stocks and by European markets. Risk
premiums on corporate bonds widened (Figure
1.4), and corporate bond issues slowed to a trickle
in May. Bond issuance in emerging markets also
dropped sharply (Figure 1.5).
The second quarter sovereign debt turmoil posed
a threat to the recovery. There were only limited
propagation effects on sovereign borrowers beyond
the vulnerable euro area countries, in part due to
a “flight to safety” in major markets (Figure 1.6).
Nonetheless, there were small and brief increases in
the spreads of euro area countries whose creditworthiness is typically considered on par with that of
Germany, and this underscores the uncertainty of
the environment for all sovereign issuers. Correlation analysis (beyond that shown in Figure 1.6)
suggests that the behavior of sovereign risk premiums during May–June is significantly explained by
the interaction between high external net liabilities/
deficits on the one hand and high public debt/
deficits on the other. Simultaneously addressing
both budgetary and competitiveness problems in a
deteriorating external environment is likely to take

a heavy toll on growth, which may help explain
why some euro area banking systems came under
particular strain.

Figure 1.4. Developments in Mature Credit Markets
Funding strains in advanced economy banking markets reappeared, but tensions
remained much lower than one year earlier. Bond yields for Germany, Japan, and
the United States declined amid investor flight to safe havens and rising concerns
about the sustainability of the recovery. However, yields in vulnerable euro area
countries rose because of concerns about high public and external deficits and
debt. Notwithstanding the turbulence, bank lending conditions in major
economies continued to normalize. Corporate spreads widened somewhat, and
issuance briefly dried up.

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

In recent months, financial conditions have
been easing again. Tail risks have been reduced by
unprecedented European policy initiatives––the
European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) Securities Markets
Program (SMP) and euro area governments’ European Stabilization Mechanism––and by a frontloading of fiscal adjustment in response to market
pressures. However, underlying sovereign and
banking vulnerabilities pose a significant challenge
amid lingering concerns about risks to the global
recovery.
•• Sovereign bond auctions in the euro area have
successfully rolled over substantial maturities,
albeit at higher costs. But concerns about rollover
failures remain elevated.
•• After declining sharply in May, there was some
recovery in the issuance of both advanced economy nonfinancial corporate bonds and emerging
market sovereign and corporate bonds in June
and more through September.
The stress test exercise of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors was generally welcomed by
markets for improving disclosure. Following the tests,
credit default swap spreads on euro area bank bonds
declined, bank stocks recovered, and several banks
successfully tapped bond markets. However, significant tiering in interbank markets and still-heavy reliance by many banks on ECB financing suggest that
major policy challenges remain to be addressed.
The recovery has helped improve the health of
the banking system. According to the October
2010 GFSR, total bank write-downs and loan
provisions are $2.2 trillion, down from the April
2010 estimate of $2.3 trillion. Banks have made
further progress in realizing these write-downs, with
more than three-quarters already reported, leaving
a residual amount of approximately $550 billion.
In addition, the average Tier 1 capital ratio in the
global banking system rose to more than 10 percent
at end-2009, although this mostly reflects govern-

chapter 1

ment recapitalization, given that less than half the
capital raised was from market sources.
Overall, however, heightened economic uncertainty, continued deleveraging, and sovereign
spillovers imply that core banking systems remain
vulnerable to confidence shocks and are heavily
reliant on government or central bank support. As
discussed further below, banks face major refinancing requirements in wholesale markets that are still
in disrepair. This poses particular challenges for euro
area banks because of their high reliance on wholesale funding markets. As noted in the October 2010
GFSR, the financial system remains vulnerable to
downside risks because capital and liquidity buffers
are insufficient to support market confidence under
renewed stress.

Volatile Currencies and Commodity Prices
Financial turbulence led to sharp currency
movements in the first half of 2010 (Figure 1.7).
The euro depreciated by about 15 percent in real
effective terms, although it has partially recovered
and is currently trading at a level broadly in line
with medium-term fundamentals, according to
IMF staff estimates. The U.S. dollar appreciated
in real effective terms as risk aversion rose during
May–June, but it has since returned to levels seen
earlier in the year, on the strong side of mediumterm fundamentals. The yen weakened briefly in
April but has been appreciating since and now
stands more than 25 percent above 2007 levels,
prompting the authorities to intervene in exchange
markets due to concerns about disruptive yen
movements. At current levels, the yen remains
broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals.
With a few exceptions, emerging Asian currencies, including the Chinese renminbi, appreciated
modestly in real effective terms. However, many
remain undervalued relative to medium-term
fundamentals.
Commodity prices surrendered some of the
strong gains realized during the initial phase of
the recovery (see Figures 1.2 and 1.3). These early
gains reflected a combination of strong demand in
emerging economies and, considering the phase of
the cycle, low inventories for some commodities

Global Prospects and Policies

Figure 1.5. Emerging Market Conditions
Equity markets in emerging economies also surrendered a small part of earlier
gains during the turbulent months of May and June. Spreads widened
moderately and issuance fell. However, local bank credit markets continue to
recover, with emerging Europe lagging. China has slowed very high credit
growth rates to address growing macroprudential concerns.

world economic outlook: Recovery, Risk, and Rebalancing

Figure 1.6. Public Sector Financing1
Public sector financing needs are very large in many economies. However,
demand for sovereign debt has remained strong because of high risk aversion.
Accordingly, long-term government bond rates of most advanced economies
have declined since March 2010 as concerns about the recovery rose. Also, even
during the most turbulent times in June, only a few governments experienced a
major widening of spreads. In the euro area, widening spreads correlate
negatively with strong current account or fiscal balances.

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

(Appendix 1.1). Precious metals, however, continued to soar during the turbulence, amid heavy
buying by risk-averse investors. Furthermore, the
weather-related downgrades in harvest expectations
for some major exporters recently pushed up wheat
prices. Although the market for wheat remains
appreciably less tight than during the price spikes of
2007–08, and prices of other food and agricultural
inputs (for example, fertilizer) have not risen much,
policymakers may have to take action to protect
the poor from sharp price increases in major food
staples, such as wheat.

Questions about the Pace of Recovery
Thus far, economic recovery is proceeding more
or less as expected. Sustained, healthy recovery
rests on two rebalancing acts: internal rebalancing, with a strengthening of private demand in
advanced economies allowing for fiscal consolidation; and external rebalancing, with an increase
in net exports in deficit economies, such as the
United States, and a decrease in net exports in
surplus economies, notably emerging Asia. The
two interact in strong ways. Increases in net
exports in advanced economies imply higher
demand and higher growth, creating more room
for fiscal consolidation. In the short term, high
uncertainty in financial markets; weak real estate
markets, household balance sheets, and incomes;
and slowing inventory rebuilding will restrain the
transition from publicly to privately led recovery
in advanced economies. Domestic demand in most
emerging economies is expected to be robust in
comparison with recovery following past global
recessions as a result of improved fundamentals. Over the medium term, however, domestic
demand is unlikely to be strong enough to offset
weaker demand in advanced economies, and global
demand rebalancing is therefore projected to stall.
At the same time, unless financial and structural
policies are significantly strengthened, potential
output in advanced economies is likely to remain
appreciably below precrisis trends. Together, these
developments portend a slow and sluggish recovery
that is broadly in line with earlier WEO projections and that is vulnerable to downside risks.

chapter 1

Global Prospects and Policies

Questions about Near-Term Prospects

Figure 1.7. External Developments

The momentum of the global recovery appears
to be slowing in the third quarter in both advanced
and emerging economies. The IMF staff’s momentum tracker does, however, indicate that growth
remains above potential in many places (Figure 1.8;
Appendix 1.2). This reflects exceptionally strong
growth in manufacturing and trade during the
past year. A key question is how the recovery will
evolve during the remainder of 2010 and in 2011.
On the downside, the inventory rebound can be
expected to slow, fiscal policy stimulus is being
withdrawn, and there are ongoing uncertainties in
financial markets. Taken together with the positive
factors that are also in the pipeline, the recovery is
likely to slow in the near term and to reaccelerate
during 2011, but in advanced economies to stay
sluggish by past standards. Moreover, the recovery
remains vulnerable to shocks, and downside risks
predominate.

(Index, 2000 = 100; three-month moving average, unless noted otherwise)

Forces driving the near-term recovery
Robust growth in many emerging market economies will pull the recovery along over the near
term. In most, the recovery seems to have entered a
self-sustaining phase, beyond restocking and on to
consumption and fixed investment, which are strong
because large increases in industrial production have
eroded excess capacity (Figures 1.2 and 1.9). Emerging market economies have coped much better with
the global downturn by virtue of strong trend growth
and avoidance of financial excess (Box 1.1). Many
developing economies, particularly in sub-Saharan
Africa, were less affected by the global downturn
and are experiencing solid domestic demand growth.
High import growth is projected to lower the overall
current account surpluses (net lending) of the emerging and developing economies from about 3½ percent of GDP in 2008 to about 1½ percent of GDP
in 2011. As explained in the October 2010 GFSR,
relatively stronger growth prospects, a shift in global
asset allocation, and expectations for low interest
rates in mature markets continue to boost emerging
market capital flows.
In advanced economies, both manufacturing and
investment in machinery and equipment should continue to recover. Industrial production remains con-

The euro depreciated significantly during May–June 2010, while the currencies
of China, Japan, and the United States appreciated. More generally, the
currencies of many emerging economies appreciated noticeably from troughs
recorded during the crisis. Many emerging economies, notably in Asia, are
building up international reserves. This slows the rebalancing of global demand.

Figure 1.8. Prospects for Near-Term Activity
Lead economic and sentiment indicators point to diminishing growth
momentum in many parts of the world. However, momentum is generally
expected to remain above WEO trend growth rates. Activity is forecast to slow
during the second half of 2010 and then to re-accelerate, reflecting diminishing
policy stimulus but growing private sector demand. This change in momentum
is apparent in most countries. Unemployment is expected to stay high for some
time in many advanced economies.

siderably below precrisis levels, reflecting the adverse
impact of uncertainty and financial conditions
on purchases of “postponable” items––consumer
durables and investment goods (see Figure 1.9).
Although part of the output loss may be permanent, the remainder is likely to disappear gradually
with improved financial conditions and decreased
uncertainty. Investment in machinery and equipment is already showing strength in a number of
advanced economies. In addition, deleveraging by
nonfinancial firms is already further along than
deleveraging by households (Figure 1.10), which
reflects a smaller buildup of debt during the previous decade and the strong recovery of profitability
and cash flow. This is especially true in the United
States, where companies slashed investment and
payrolls early in the recession. Strong production
through July will likely continue to propel investment while inventory building decelerates.
The latest turbulence has interrupted, but not
derailed, the upturn in the credit cycle. Credit growth
is rising again in many emerging economies, with
the exception of crisis-hit countries in eastern Europe
(see Figure 1.5). In key advanced economies, surveys
suggest that bank lending has ceased to tighten (see
Figure 1.4). Setbacks in the euro area have turned out
to be smaller than feared during the market turmoil
of the spring, and U.S. banks loosened lending standards during the second quarter. Regulatory changes
designed to strengthen capital bases and discourage
excessive risk taking are not expected to have major
negative effects on lending in the near term.
Commodity prices have stabilized after an initial
rally. Fluctuating in a $75 to $80 range, crude oil
prices are higher than usual at this stage of a recovery. The same holds for other commodities, notably
metals. This is a lingering effect of tight markets
before the crisis. However, there is currently plenty
of spare capacity in the extractive industries, likely
enough to meet demand through 2011 (Appendix 1.1). Consistent with this view, forward markets
see broadly unchanged prices for oil and many
other commodities over the near term.
Forces holding back a near-term recovery
Although financial market confidence has been
returning, the October 2010 GFSR underscores

chapter 1

that high volatility and, notably, sovereign risk,
bank funding, and unfinished regulatory reform
remain causes for concern. Additional forces weighing on the recovery include weakness in real estate
markets, diminishing fiscal stimulus, and high
unemployment.
High uncertainty in financial markets
Absent strong, credible, medium-term fiscal consolidation plans, sovereign debt markets continue to
pose risks to the recovery. Sovereign debt maturing
in vulnerable euro area countries during the remainder of this year and 2011 is large (see Figure 1.6).
In refinancing this debt, these countries will face
stiff competition, given the large funding needs of
other advanced economies. Any renewed turbulence
in sovereign debt markets could trigger an adverse
feedback loop between sovereign debt markets and
the financial sector, inflicting major damage on the
recovery.
Banks also face a “wall” of maturing debt,
which presents important risks for the normalization of credit conditions. There has been little
progress in lengthening the maturity of their funding and, as a result, over $4 trillion in debt is due
to be refinanced in the next 24 months. Funding
problems could easily arise for specific institutions,
prompted by renewed stress in sovereign debt
markets, further weakness in real estate markets, or
downside surprises to economic activity. Because
of complex linkages within and across borders,
these problems could quickly become more
widespread.
Continued regulatory uncertainty or ill-conceived
regulatory action regarding the financial sector
could undercut the nascent recovery of credit. Many
prudential policy challenges remain to be addressed,
and taxation of financial activity may increase—
measures that might make the financial system safer
and less costly for taxpayers over the long term, but
which could weigh down output more than markets
expect during the short term.
No upside from real estate
Real estate market quagmires could further undercut household and bank balance sheets. The drop in
residential investment has been exceptionally steep

Global Prospects and Policies

Figure 1.9. Recovery Dynamics
During the crisis, industrial production fell much more sharply than suggested by
the trend relationship between output and GDP. This reflects a sharp drop in
purchases of "postponable" items. Industrial production will continue to catch up
with GDP, but at a diminishing rate. The inventory-driven rebound is largely over;
as capacity utilization rates climb, investment should expand further, making a
growing contribution to output growth.

Deleveraging by households
Households continue to save more than before
the crisis as they repair their balance sheets,
although saving rates are on course to moderate
soon (see Figure 1.10). Household debt ceased to
grow during 2009 in the United States and the
United Kingdom. While this has brought about a
noticeable decline in ratios of debt to income and
debt to financial assets, these ratios remain well
above the levels of a decade ago. In the euro area,
where the precrisis expansion had been rapid in
some economies, debt continued to grow throughout 2009, except in Germany. However, a sharp
cut in household borrowing is now under way, and
judging from debt ratios, corrections may have
some way to go, especially, but not exclusively, in
the vulnerable euro area countries. Even so, deleveraging may not require significant additional hikes in
household saving rates—WEO projections include
no further increases.

compared with past recessions. Nonetheless, in many
parts of the world real estate prices are still high compared with standard valuation indicators (Box 1.2).
In the United States, there remains a large overhang
of unsold properties with “underwater” mortgages.1
Depressed transactions keep inventories high, putting greater downward pressure on prices. In many
parts of the world, over the near term real estate will
remain a drag on growth, as well as a continued risk
to the stability of lending institutions.

40

In the United States and several advanced Asian
economies, inventory rebuilding has been in high
gear and is not expected to accelerate further. In
the euro area and Japan, inventory drawdowns
were more limited during the downturn, possibly
reflecting labor hoarding that kept production up.
In these economies, too, inventory rebuilding is
unlikely to accelerate. Therefore, inventories will
turn from being a supportive to a neutral factor in
the recovery.

mortgages are loans that exceed the market
value of the property. See Box 1.3 of the October 2010 GFSR

Global Prospects and Policies

Box 1.1. Does Slow Growth in Advanced Economies Necessarily Imply Slow Growth in Emerging
Economies?
The world economy has only recently begun to
emerge from the deepest recession since World War
II. In advanced economies, recovery is predicted
to be unusually sluggish compared with recovery
following previous recessions, with households
and financial institutions seeking to repair balance
sheets, credit growth constrained, and persistent
demand and employment uncertainty.
What are the prospects for emerging economies?
It has long been assumed that the fortunes of emerging economies follow those of advanced economies—when the United States sneezes, it has been
said, the rest of the world catches cold. This view
would imply that emerging economies are now likely
to experience a period of below-average growth.
But is this assumption correct? This box
reviews the growth of emerging economies in
the aftermath of previous advanced economy
recessions. A striking fact becomes clear: emerging economies have performed better after more
recent advanced economy recessions than after
those in the 1970s and 1980s. This fact holds
across different measures of performance. However, emerging economies have also become more
highly correlated with advanced economies over
time. One explanation that might reconcile these
dichotomous trends is improved domestic policies
in emerging economies that have increased their
resilience to shocks, even while greater integration
has made them more correlated with advanced
economy business cycles.
The analysis examines four recessions in
advanced economies: 1974–75, 1980–83, 1991–
93, and 2001. These dates are closely aligned with
U.S. recessions identified by the National Bureau
of Economic Research (NBER).1 All were significant downturns at a global level, with the majority of advanced economies experiencing outright
recession during the first three episodes.2
The authors of this box are Jörg Decressin, Alasdair Scott,
and Petia Topalova.
1The NBER identified separate recessions in 1980 and
1981–1982, but these are collapsed here into a single episode.
2For this reason, we extend the period of the 1991 recession to include 1992 and 1993, during which time many
advanced economies were in recession.

Tracking emerging economy performance in
the wake of major advanced economy recessions
requires clear metrics. Real GDP is an obvious measure of macroeconomic performance,
but relative to what? One reference point is the
economy’s own growth rate before the crisis—that
is, was the economy able to bounce back with
above-average growth in the immediate aftermath
of the recession, or did it experience a period of
below-average growth? This can be measured by
calculating the difference between the economy’s
average growth rate in the three years after the
recession and its average growth rate three years
before that recession. These measures are termed
“growth differences.” Another approach is to
gauge how much output was lost as a result of
the shock, which is estimated by calculating for
each economy the difference between the level
of output three years after the recession and the
level of output implied by extrapolating a trend
based on the seven years of output growth leading
in to the recession. These measures are termed
“level differences.” A third metric is the state of
the world economy in the aftermath of the recession—that is, how well did each economy cope
with the shock relative to the rest of the world?
This involves calculating the difference between
the average growth rate during the three years
after the recession for a given emerging economy
and the average advanced economy growth rates
over the same period (weighted by purchasing
power parity). These measures are termed “relative
growth differences.”3
These measures are used to examine real GDP
data for emerging economies during the aftermath
of the four advanced economy recessions considered
here. An intriguing pattern emerges: the perfor3The

mance of emerging economies has improved after
each subsequent advanced economy recession (first
figure). For emerging economies as a whole, growth
three years after the recessions of 1991–93 and 2001
exceeded growth three years before. In terms of levels
of output, emerging economies actually experienced
output gains relative to their precrisis trends after the
2001 recession. And there was stronger growth in
these economies than in advanced economies in the
aftermath of the recessions. By contrast, the growth
performance of emerging economies was poor after
the earlier recessions of 1974–75 and 1980–83, with a
substantial implied output loss. In these cases, emerging economies caught pneumonia when advanced
economies caught cold. But such vulnerability is
much less apparent in recent years.
One argument is that emerging economies have
performed better because they have “decoupled.”4
However, many studies point to increasing integra-

the early 2000s.

chapter 1

tion of emerging economies into global trade and
capital markets, which seems to contradict the
decoupling hypothesis. And a shared theme in the
economic histories of many emerging economies
is a move away from highly directed, domestically
oriented economies and toward increased market
liberalization and openness to foreign competition
in goods and capital. This pattern is supported by a
simple calculation of rolling correlations between the
detrended aggregate output of advanced and emerging economies (second figure).5 These correlations
steadily increased over time, accelerating in recent
years—if anything, emerging economies are more
“coupled” than ever with advanced economies.
How can we reconcile that emerging economies seem to be more dependent on advanced
economies but have managed nonetheless to be
less affected by their recessions? One possibility
is that improved macroeconomic management
may have helped insulate emerging economies from the worst effects of recent advanced
economy recessions. Empirical evidence suggests
that economies with weaker external balances
were particularly vulnerable to the recent crisis,
and that economies that were particularly depen­5As is common, the series is detrended using a HodrickPrescott (H-P) filter. The filter passes through the variation in
the series at business cycle frequencies (and higher) and removes
low frequencies (that is, very gradual shifts in underlying trends).

Shifting policy support
While monetary policy will remain accommodative, with increasing effectiveness as financial
markets heal, fiscal policy will soon become less
stimulative. At the same time, the mix of macroeconomic policies across countries will provide only
limited support to global demand rebalancing.
Easy monetary conditions
Monetary policy remains appropriately supportive
in most economies, and markets are expecting a
very gradual return to more normal interest rates
(Figure 1.11).
•• In advanced economies, the central banks of

dent on bank lending instead of foreign investment were susceptible to rapid capital outflows.6
Similarly, analysis of the four episodes considered
here shows that the current account balance at
the onset of the advanced economy recession is a
significant indicator of subsequent performance.
Narrative evidence suggests that emerging
economies are now more flexible and, as such,
have been more resilient to foreign shocks. For
example, flexible exchange rates helped to preserve competitiveness and allow trade to bounce
back quickly following the downturn in the early
2000s, and capital inflows have been much less
affected in recent episodes.
It could also be that the apparent pattern of
improved emerging economy performance over
time has more to do with the very different shocks
that generated the advanced economy recessions than any underlying trend toward greater
resilience. Unfortunately, from a statistical point
of view, there are too few recession episodes to
be able to rigorously test competing explanations
such as this. But there are good reasons to think
that emerging economies’ strong performance may
persist.

Norway, and Sweden have recently raised policy
interest rates. However, rates in these economies
remain very low by historical standards, except
where recovery is already more entrenched. The
Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, ECB, and Bank
of England have kept the main policy rate near
the zero bound, with the Federal Reserve indicating that conditions likely warrant exceptionally
low interest rates for an extended period. The
market response to concerns about the sustainability and pace of recovery has been a sharp
decline in longer-term government yields. As
financial institutions and markets heal, low interest rates should exert stronger stimulus.

ple, Brazil, India, Malaysia, Peru), increased
cash reserve requirements (for example, China,
India, Turkey), or direct limits on credit
growth (for example, China). The tightening
is expected to proceed at a gradual pace, as
inflation is generally projected to be contained.
The more pressing concern in a few economies
is high credit growth for real estate purchases.
In various Asian economies, the authorities
have successfully intervened to slow such credit
growth with prudential regulations. In some
economies in emerging Europe, by contrast,
central banks have cut rates in response to
diminishing price pressures and growing uncertainty in western Europe (for example, Hungary,
Romania, Russia).
Central banks had employed unconventional
support measures during the crisis to help stabilize
banks and markets. Some of these—such as the
provision of a large quantity of excess reserves to
the banking system—were designed to effect a
general easing of credit when short-term interest
rates were at the zero floor (“quantitative easing”). Others—such as the purchase of nontraditional financial assets—were designed to foster
confidence and liquidity in specific markets that
had broken down (“qualitative easing”). Central
banks have appropriately terminated many of their
unconventional support programs, but there have
also been reversals:
•• The Federal Reserve has rightly wound down
most of its emergency facilities (for example,
the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility expired June 30, 2010) and has also ended
an asset purchase program. However, it recently
decided to reinvest principal payments on its
portfolio of government-sponsored-enterprise
(GSE) debt and mortgage-backed securities into
longer-term Treasury bills. Although the quantitative impact of this measure is limited, it signals
the Federal Reserve’s resolve to maintain supportive monetary conditions for an extended period.
•• Renewed financial turmoil led the ECB to step
into government bond markets with its SMP.2
2Unlike the purchases of government bonds by the Bank of
England, which ended some time ago, the stated objective of the

chapter 1

Purchases under this program, which have
reached about €60 billion, helped lower volatility and have now been pared back in response to
stabilizing conditions. The ECB has stopped its
program of making limited purchases of covered
bonds as well as its 12-month long-term refinancing operation. However, many banks remain
highly dependent on ECB financing facilities,
and moving away from fixed-rate, full-allotment
operations and tightening collateral requirements
would be risky. This underscores the need to
make rapid progress with recapitalization at the
national level.
•• The Bank of Japan terminated its limited commercial paper and corporate bond purchasing
program and expanded a fund-supplying facility
aimed at reducing term premiums. However,
with the appreciation of the yen and declining
equity prices, financial conditions have tightened
and deflation remains a threat. Further monetary
easing may thus be needed.
•• The Bank of England halted its program of
reserve-financed government bond purchases
in February 2010. This was appropriate, given
normalization in many parts of the financial sector, low long-term interest rates on government
paper, and continued above-target inflation (due
to price-level shocks).3
•• Other central banks, such as the Reserve Bank
of Australia, the Bank of Canada, the Swedish
Riksbank, and those in emerging economies,
have largely unwound liquidity support measures
as their financial markets have healed and their
economies have recovered robustly. In fact, a
number of emerging economies have tightened
prudential policies and practices in response
to an upsurge in capital inflows or rapid credit
growth.
•• Given the sizable U.S. dollar funding needs of
many commercial banks outside the United
States, the Federal Reserve and the central banks
ECB’s intervention is not to lower long-term interest rates but to
counter excessive volatility in order to ensure proper functioning
of monetary transmission.

are financed by the issuance of treasury bills or as part of cash
management operations.

Global Prospects and Policies

of Canada, the euro area, Japan, Switzerland, and
the United Kingdom recently revived their dollar
swap facilities as dollar funding strains emerged
during the May–June financial turmoil.
Sales of assets, tightening of collateral requirements, or the phasing out of other support for
funding should be a gradual process, because market
volatility remains high, banks remain vulnerable,
various wholesale markets are in disrepair, and many
real-estate-related markets are weak.4 In the meantime, central banks can absorb liquidity in a variety
of ways should upside risks to inflation emerge.5
Fiscal consolidation
Fiscal policy will tighten during 2011 (Figure
1.12). In advanced economies, fiscal balances fell
(that is, deficits increased) by about 5 percent
of GDP in 2009, following a 2½ percent fall in
2008. In structural, or cyclically adjusted terms,
the decline was about 2½ percent in 2009—the
remaining 2½ percent resulted from the automatic
effects of the recession on tax revenues and social
spending. The balances are now forecast to increase
by about ¾ percent in 2010 and a further 1¼ percent of GDP in 2011. This reflects revenue gains
and expenditure reductions associated with the
recovery and a continued discretionary loosening
in 2010––by about ¼ percent of GDP––followed
by a 1 percent tightening in 2011.6 In emerging
economies, fiscal balances are forecast to increase
by ¾ percent of GDP in 2010 and by a further
¾ percent in 2011, following a loosening of almost
4½ percent of GDP in 2009.
The fiscal policy change will likely prove contractionary for most economies in 2011, although the
extent is difficult to determine. Chapter 3 presents an econometric analysis of past consolidation
efforts in advanced economies, which reveals that
4None of the major central banks have discussed a timetable
for selling securities.
5The Federal Reserve recently deployed a Term Deposit Facility and tested reverse repurchase operations to absorb liquidity,
if necessary.
6This represents consolidation of ¼ percent of GDP more
than forecast in the April 2010 World Economic Outlook for
2010–11, with about 1 percent of GDP additional tightening
in the euro area and ½ percent of GDP less tightening in the
United States.

Fiscal policy will become contractionary in 2011, following significant expansion
mostly during 2009. Nonetheless, public debt ratios are projected to continue to
rise, unless further action is taken. Although fiscal and household consolidation
can be expected to lower demand in advanced economies, domestic demand in
key emerging economies is not projected to compensate for this. Similarly, the
change in fiscal policies in emerging and advanced economies with low debt
and external surpluses is not expected to differ much from policy elsewhere.

fiscal tightening by 1 percent of GDP has typically
caused a 1 percent decline in domestic demand
after two years––about half the effect on real GDP
usually being offset by higher net exports. Past
experience may tell little about the likely impact
of consolidation under present circumstances,
but several considerations point to contractionary
effects over the short term, especially in the major
advanced economies. The introduction of credible,
growth-friendly, medium-term fiscal consolidation
plans would have beneficial effects on investment,
but such plans are generally not on offer. Also, with
many countries poised to adjust at the same time,
the export channel will be muted. Furthermore,
because markets already expect policy rates in the
large advanced economies to remain near zero
during the coming year, conventional monetary
policy can offer only limited short-term help when
demand weakens, unlike during some past consolidation episodes. Relatively little is known about the
effectiveness of unconventional monetary easing
measures under fiscal tightening.
The forecast for 2010–11
Overall, the recovery is expected to continue
broadly in line with earlier forecasts. With negative
and positive factors broadly canceling each other
out over the next couple of years, WEO projections
for 2010 and 2011 foresee little change in global
growth. World GDP is forecast to expand by 4.8
percent in 2010 and by 4.2 percent in 2011 (Table
1.1; Figure 1.13). The forecast assumes that the
downside risks identified do not materialize: high
uncertainty would weigh on private demand but
would not forestall a continued recovery of investment, employment, and household consumption.
This largely makes up for the diminishing fiscal
stimulus, which starts in the second half of 2010.
The stable annual growth rates mask a temporary
slowdown in activity. In advanced economies, where
GDP growth is estimated at 3½ percent for the
first half of 2010, projected growth in the second
half is 1¾ percent. Then, in response to expansionary factors, growth rises above 2½ percent during
the course of 2011 (see Figure 1.8). These are low
growth rates, considering the depth of the recession
and the amount of excess capacity, and this means

chapter 1

a very slow decline in high unemployment rates.
In emerging and developing economies, generally
healthy growth also slows in the second half of
2010, to about 6¼ percent.
Inflation is projected in general to stay low amid
continued excess capacity and high unemployment
(Figure 1.14). The recovery of commodity prices,
however, has raised the level of consumer prices
during 2010. Thus, in advanced economies, headline inflation has been running about 1¾ percent
for many months but has lately begun to slow to
under 1½ percent. Core inflation has been much
lower, recently falling below 1 percent. In emerging economies, headline and core rates are about
5¾ percent and 3 percent, respectively. With market
indicators suggesting that commodity prices should
remain stable and with downward pressure on wages
gradually diminishing, headline and core inflation
in advanced economies should converge to about
1¼ percent in 2011 and in emerging and developing
economies to about 5 percent. Among some major
emerging economies, capacity constraints are beginning to boost prices: Brazil, for example, has experienced gradual increases in inflation pressure, while
India has seen a sharp rise in inflation.
Risks to activity are mainly to the downside
Risks to the growth projections are mainly to the
downside. Financial and macroeconomic conditions
are likely to remain unsettled for as long as fundamental economic weaknesses persist and the required
reforms remain a work in progress. Major risks have
already been discussed. Key is that room for policy
maneuver in advanced economies has fallen. Refinancing requirements during the last quarter of 2010
and during 2011 will be large. For example, among
the major advanced economies, Japan will need to
issue a gross volume of government bills and bonds
with a value that exceeds 40 percent of GDP; in
France, Italy, and the United States, the value exceeds
20 percent of GDP (see Figure 1.6). With such high
volume passing through markets, small disturbances
may propagate rapidly across sovereign debt markets,
prompting changes in investor confidence and stalling the recovery.
In addition, the financial sector remains very
fragile. Banks face major funding requirements

With negative and positive factors broadly canceling each other out over the next
couple of years, WEO projections for 2010 and 2011 foresee little change in
global growth. In advanced economies, growth rates are forecast to remain low,
considering the depth of the recession and the amount of excess capacity. In
emerging economies, growth is projected to be robust, compared with the
experience following past global recessions, except in a number of economies in
emerging Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States.

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

Real estate markets have been a source of
strength during past recoveries, but this time is
different. In many advanced economies, household
sector develeraging and the process of reallocating
resources away from the construction sector will act
as a drag on economic activity. In a few countries,
these problems are serious enough to raise concerns
that there will be a “double dip” in the housing
market. In some economies, particularly in the
Asia-Pacific region, real estate markets are rebounding, but a fear of overheating is leading to policy
responses that are likely to keep these markets from
providing a boost to near-term growth.

Recent Developments in Real Estate Markets
The real estate boom between 2002 and 2007
was synchronized, but the subsequent bust was not.
Broadly speaking, economies fall into two clusters
(first figure):1
•• Bust economies: In the vast majority of economies, house prices are continuing to fall or are
gradually stabilizing, which translates into a fall
in both residential investment and gross value
added (GVA) in the construction sector. In these
economies house prices have fallen by over 10
percent a year since 2007, after rising about 8½
percent annually between 2000 and 2007. The
cumulative decline in residential investment
since 2007 is nearly 30 percent.
•• Rebound economies: Several economies in the
Asia-Pacific region, joined by most Scandinavian
countries and Canada, are seeing a rebound in
house prices and residential investment and a
stabilization in construction GVA.
The rebound economies are those with better postcrisis growth prospects and better growth
outcomes (second figure). Another factor influencing the cross-country variation in housing market
outcomes since 2007 was the extent of the boom

Loungani. Philippe Bracke and Jair Rodriguez provided
research assistance.
1A third group of economies lies in between. In this small
group (composed of Austria, Belgium, Colombia, Israel,
and Switzerland), house prices have increased modestly—by
about 2 percent annually since 2007, compared with a
2½ percent annual increase between 2000 and 2007—and
residential investment has been flat.

Collapse of Residential Investment in Advanced
Economies
In advanced economies, a feature of the real estate
cycle over the past decade that differs sharply from
past cycles is enhanced access to credit. Easy monetary
conditions and financial innovation gave households
greater access to credit and led to a buildup in leverage. The process of develeraging could make the
macroeconomic impact of this housing bust greater
than in the past. Moreover, household sector deleveraging proceeds at a much slower pace than corporate
or financial sector deleveraging. This is because the
largest portion of household balance sheets on both
the asset and the liability side tends to be real estate,

are other possible explanations for the cross-country variation in real estate market outcomes.

which is more difficult to sell off in a fire sale than
bonds and equities. Therefore, the recovery is likely
to be slower than in recessions triggered by problems
related to corporate balance sheets.
For countries such as Spain and Ireland there is
an additional reason to expect slow recovery. The
feedback loop between credit and collateral prices
created a construction boom, significantly distorting the allocation of resources. As a result, the construction sector grew disproportionately to other
sectors of the economy and became the engine of
growth in these economies. The share of construc-

tion in total value added stood at 12 percent in
Spain and 10 percent in Ireland by the end of
2006, compared with the euro area average of just
under 7 percent. The housing bust thus brought
a severe contraction in construction output and
employment.3 The unemployment rate is now three
times its 2000–07 average in Ireland and twice its
2000–07 average in Spain, compared with a 20
percent increase on average among euro area countries. Reallocation of labor away from construction
is likely to take considerable time, which will keep

unemployment rates stubbornly high (AspachsBracons and Rabanal, 2009).
The fourth figure compares the paths of two major
household-sector components of GDP, namely,
consumption and residential investment, around
house price cycle peaks during the current cycle and
previous cycles. For advanced economies as a whole,
after a sizable initial decline, private consumption
reverts to the path evident in previous housing cycles.
However, the path for residential investment is starkly
different in this cycle than in the past. Residential
investment does not appear likely to come back
anytime soon, especially given the outlook for house
prices. Historically, residential investment has been
positively correlated with residential property price
appreciation, with a cross-country average correlation
coefficient of 0.3. If the gap between current house
prices and their fundamental values based on an
econometric model were to be corrected over the next
five years in all advanced economies, real house prices
would fall at an annual rate of between 0.5 percent
and 1.5 percent on average between 2010 and 2015.4
Hence, residential investment could remain depressed
for several more years.

Double Dip in U.K. and U.S. Real Estate Markets?
Comparing current and past housing cycles in
the United States reinforces these observations (fifth
figure). Residential investment remains severely
depressed compared with past cycles, which can at
least partially be explained by the pattern in house
prices and household outstanding debt. The bleak
outlook for house prices slows deleveraging for the
household sector as mortgages remain underwater
(that is, with debt exceeding the market value of the
property). The problem is compounded because, in
4It is hard to predict when the correction in real estate
markets will be complete. Historically, downturns last
roughly four years, suggesting that the current downturn
could be over in the next two years. However, given that
the duration of the latest upturn was 2.6 times that of historical upturns, the correction could last for the next eight
years. The calculations in the text are based on a middleground assumption that the correction will be complete in
five years. The econometric model posits real house price
growth to be a function of (1) changes in per capita disposable income, working-age population, construction costs,
and credit and equity prices; and (2) the level of short- and
long-term interest rates.

chapter 1

this recession, U.S. states where the house price bust
was more pronounced are also where unemployment has increased the most. This relationship likely
reflects the importance of the construction sector in
these states’ economies as well as lower labor mobility resulting from problems in the housing sector.
In both the United Kingdom and the United
States, tax measures temporarily increased activity, but housing demand fell and prices receded
after the recent expiration of these incentives (sixth
figure).5 Although this was anticipated, the drop
was larger than expected. Especially in the United
States, given the limited success of mortgage modification programs and the shadow inventory from
foreclosures and delinquencies, this has renewed
fears of a double dip in real estate markets.6 A lot
will depend on the path of economic recovery: if
employment creation remains low, risks of a double
dip in housing naturally increase.
There are other threats to the fragile stabilization.
First, delinquency rates on commercial-mortgagebacked securities have recently reached record highs,
and considerable amounts of commercial real estate
debt will come due over the next few years.7 Second,
resets on adjustable-rate loans are looming on the
horizon. Refinancing options are limited, despite his5In

the United Kingdom, the temporary stamp duty
exemption for homes between £125,000 and £175,000 that
expired in December 2009 was replaced in March 2010 by
a new, two-year exemption on first home purchases up to
£250,000. This renewed policy initiative partially explains
the relatively better indicators in the U.K. market compared
with the U.S. market. What remains worrisome, however, is
that house prices are still high based on traditional valuation
yardsticks, and policy support may not be enough to prevent
further correction.
6In addition to the 2.3 million homes that are already in
foreclosure, an estimated 3.3 million properties are at risk
because they have been in default for 60 days or more. This
estimate does not include modified loans, for which redefault
rates reach 50 percent within a year of modification. On
top of that, some of the 5 million now holding underwater
mortgages may strategically default if prices do not recover.
All in all, the shadow inventory of houses for sale may reach
7 million, against a historical absorption of 700,000 units a
year overall in the U.S. housing market.
7In the United States, $566 billion in commercial real estate
debt, the majority of which was provided by banks, comes
due in 2010 and 2011, according to Foresight Analytics, LLC.
In the United Kingdom, about £160 billion in commercial
property debt will mature over the next five years.

Another Bubble in Asia?

rebound continue? In many of the economies in

this group, current price-to-rent and price-toincome ratios are still above historical averages,
and econometric estimates still show a deviation
of house prices from fundamental values. For the
Asian economies in this group (namely, China,
Hong Kong SAR, and Singapore), fundamentals
appear to provide more support for the observed
price increases, mainly due to strong growth
prospects. But the econometric estimates are less
reliable for these economies because data are available for only a fairly short period. More anecdotal
evidence—reports of speculative activity, rising
vacancy rates in commercial property, sizable mortgage credit growth, and massive capital inflows,
especially in China—suggest that these real estate
markets may be overheating. In China, deviation of
house prices from fundamentals is estimated to be
higher in Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen than in other cities (Ahuja and Porter, 2010).
In some cases, the rebound may be the result
of policy measures put in place to help economic
recovery during the crisis. For example, in China,
tax incentives for home buyers and encouragement
to banks to keep extending credit for real estate
purchases coincided with the strong rebound in
market activity. More recently, some governments in
the region have taken measures to tame real estate
markets. The Chinese government deployed a range
of regulatory tools in the spring of 2010, including
increases in transaction taxes and stricter controls on
lending. The government will need to evaluate the
impact of these measures over time and to fine-tune
them to keep risks in check while avoiding excessive
restraint on real estate investment.
To summarize, in contrast to past recoveries, there
appears to be little hope for a sustained upside boost
to the overall economy from the real estate sector.
In economies where real estate markets are still in
decline, the drag on real activity will continue. And
in economies where house prices and residential
investment are rebounding, concern about bubbles
is eliciting policy actions that will temper any shortterm boost to economic activity.

peak in the United Kingdom. Last but not least, differences
in supply constraints may also lead to a divergence in the
probability of a double-dip real estate downturn in these
two countries.

chapter 1

in a market that is still very risk averse. As recent
experience has shown, funding troubles at individual institutions can have major macroeconomic
ramifications. New capital shortfalls that require
additional public financial sector support would add
to the pressures on public finances, which in turn
could further dampen market sentiment.
•• In the euro area, as the October 2010 GFSR
shows, intensifying funding strains could again
stress banking systems. If unaddressed, such
funding pressures could reawaken deleveraging
pressures and the adverse feedback loop between
the euro area banking system and the regional
economy.
•• In the United States, the real estate sector could
well dip again, exposing pockets of vulnerability
in the banking system. A stress test of the top
40 U.S. bank holding companies suggests that,
under an adverse scenario where residential and
commercial real estate prices fall by 6 percent
and 9 percent, respectively, and real GDP growth
slows to 1.2 percent in 2011, banks would
require a total of $57 billion in additional capital
in order to maintain a 6 percent Tier 1 common
capital/risk-weighted assets ratio. Although the
capital of U.S. banks thus appears broadly sufficient, substantially more capital would be needed
in the absence of GSE and other government
intervention.
•• In Japan, a near-term disruption in the government bond market remains unlikely, but the
factors currently supporting the Japanese bond
market are expected to gradually erode. Also,
banks’ ever larger holdings of government bonds
and the increasing interest rate risk arising from
their extension into longer-dated maturities create a potential risk to financial stability if there
were a sudden increase in government bond
yields.
Quantitative risk indicators
The IMF staff’s quantitative indicators confirm that risks to activity are still high and to the
downside in 2011 (Figure 1.15). Specifically, risks
as measured by the dispersion in analysts’ forecasts for real GDP growth or inflation, oil price
options, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange

Figure 1.15. Risks to the Global Outlook
Risks to the growth projections are mainly to the downside. Financial and
macroeconomic conditions are likely to remain unsettled for as long as the
fundamental economic weaknesses persist and the required reforms remain a
work in progress. The fan chart confirms that risks to activity are still high and to
the downside in 2011. Risks as measured by the dispersion in analysts' forecasts
for real GDP growth, oil prices, inflation, and the VIX1 have moved up to varying
degrees lately, although they remain appreciably lower than one year ago.

Inflation in advanced economies has declined
by less than expected, considering the depth of the
recession. For example, in the United States, the
drop in core inflation from 2008 to 2010 was about
1 percent, whereas the drop during the 1981–83
recession was about 4 percent. The weaker inflation response may reflect a variety of factors, for
example, more credible inflation control, intensified
losses in productive capacity, and downward wage
and price rigidities.

and its exceptionally strong response, together

data point to larger upside risks to growth in 2010
than last April, consistent with upward revisions to
WEO growth projections. For 2011, the distribution of forecasts for the slope of the yield curve
is tilted downward, pointing to downside risks to
activity. Options prices on the S&P 500 indicate
smaller upside risks from financial surprises in
2010–11 relative to last April. Options prices
for futures on petroleum and other commodities
suggest smaller downside risks to growth in 2010
than last April; risks for sharp increases in commodity prices are higher in the medium term, as
spare capacity and inventory buffers diminish (see
Appendix 1.1).
The fan chart analysis also suggests that risks
for a sharp global slowdown, including a “double
dip” in advanced economies, over the coming year
still appear low (see Figure 1.15). Such a scenario
would entail 2 percent or less real GDP growth
over the coming year, with zero growth in the
advanced economies and about 4 percent growth
in the emerging and developing economies.
According to the fan chart, the probability of
global growth falling below 2 percent is less than
5 percent.

options on the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 index.

8Short-term

inflation expectations have also been higher than
suggested by their past relationships with various fundamental variables, such as unemployment rates, commodity prices,
capacity indicators, actual inflation, and medium- to long-term
inflation expectations.

Unemployment
Short-term Consensus Forecasts inflation expectations have overshot actual
inflation by substantial margins. They have also been higher than indicated by
past relationships with various fundamental determinants. This is surprising, as
IMF staff analysis suggests that deflation rather than high inflation is the more
pertinent risk. Assuming that these short-term expectations are representative of
those in the broader economy, their stickiness may explain part of the stickiness
of actual inflation.

further, may be key explanatory factors. With
strong credibility, medium- to long-term inflation
expectations are much more stable than the actual
inflation rate—overpredicting inflation when it is
below the presumed central bank target, and vice
versa.
However, recent short-term forecasts from Consensus Economics have also overpredicted the actual
outcomes in a large number of countries, sometimes
by surprisingly large margins (Figure 1.16). Assuming that these expectations are representative of those
in the broader economy, their stickiness may explain
part of the stickiness of actual inflation. This raises the
question of why short-term expectations have been so
high in some countries.8 Possible explanations could
be “turning point” mistakes (misjudging changes in
the business cycle); optimistic views about the depth
of the recession; fears of high commodity prices; or
concerns about growing central bank balance sheets,
diminishing central bank independence, or central
banks’ commitment to low inflation. In fact, concerns
about the potential for high inflation in advanced
economies in the future have been lingering in the
background. Beyond a downside skew to growth from
stronger-than-anticipated monetary tightening in the
fan chart (see Figure 1.15), such concerns are reflected
in record high prices for gold.
These concerns appear excessive for a variety
of reasons. Measures of liquidity in advanced
economies, such as the growth rate of broad
money, show very little dynamism, and central
banks have policy tools at their disposal to control
liquidity, notwithstanding large balance sheets.
Also, with open capital markets, higher inflation
targets would quickly feed into higher public debt
service. Moreover, risks from commodity prices
appear limited over the next couple of years: if,
for example, oil prices were to jump unexpectedly,
the fact that wages did not rise correspondingly
during the 2005–07 oil price spikes is largely reassuring about the prospective behavior of inflation.
For high inflation to emerge, there would have to

2The residuals are differences between actual one-year-ahead Consensus inflation
expectations and out-of-sample forecasts of these expectations. The forecasts are
obtained from regressions of one-year-ahead Consensus inflation expectations on
lagged values of these expectations, Consensus expectations for unemployment rates,
WEO expectations for output gaps, oil price growth rates, and long-term Consensus
expectations for inflation. The regression samples typically cover 1999:Q1 to 2008:Q4.
Positive residuals suggest that short-term Consensus expectations have been higher
than could have been expected given their past relationship with unemployment rates,
output gaps, oil prices, and long-term Consensus expectations.

be multiple shocks, including a sudden move to
financial or trade protectionism that would undo
much of the integration of markets that has taken
place over recent decades. Such a scenario seems
remote.
Under present circumstances, deflation is the
more pertinent risk. The reason is that risks to
activity are clearly to the downside: households
remain saddled with appreciable debt; the financial
system remains vulnerable; and expectations could
gradually catch up with actual inflation, putting
further downward pressure on prices and wages.
Judging by the IMF staff’s deflation risk indicator,
deflation risks have recently risen again to a high
level, although they remain below the peaks reached
one year ago (see Figure 1.16). How households
behave will crucially depend on how policymakers roll back large public deficits. Mistakes could
cause a long period of deflation or low inflation and
disappointing economic growth.9

Questions about Medium-Term Prospects
One year into the recovery is the right time to
take stock of some medium-term developments
and assess what they portend for growth prospects.
These include (1) the apparent worsening of fundamentals in advanced versus emerging economies,
which has been amplified by the financial crisis and
will delay a robust pickup in private demand, and
(2) the limited extent to which emerging economies that have external surpluses can offset lower
demand in advanced economies, which indicates
that demand rebalancing is stalling. Together, these
developments are consistent with a subdued recovery in many parts of the world.
This stocktaking sets the stage for a discussion
of some of the key challenges facing advanced and
emerging economy policymakers that are discussed
in the subsequent section: (1) repair and reform of
financial markets, (2) medium-term fiscal consolidation, (3) monetary and exchange rate policies, and
(4) policy coordination.

Deteriorating growth prospects in advanced
versus emerging economies
The latest crisis comes on top of an ongoing
decline in advanced versus emerging economy
growth rates. In advanced economies, this trend is
being driven by a variety of fundamental factors,
such as falling population growth (Figure 1.17).
Developments in emerging economies have been
quite different (see Box 1.1). As a group, emerging economies posted a string of impressive growth
rates after the turn of the millennium. Looking
ahead, advanced economies face appreciably weaker
prospects for activity than over the past decade,
absent significant reforms. The results of an analysis
of potential output developments are sobering
(Box 1.3): they point to large and persistent output
losses from the recession. This is consistent with
other empirical evidence that suggests that a portion
of the sharp decline in GDP during the recession
should be presumed to be permanent, unless there
is significant policy change.10
One can best infer the path for potential output,
which is by nature an unobservable variable, on the
basis of the joint behavior of observable variables
that potential output either influences (output
growth, inflation, unemployment, capacity utilization) or is influenced by (labor force growth, capital
investment, productivity growth). For example, the
steep drop in business fixed investment during the
recession has reduced manufacturing capacity (see
Figure 1.9). This suggests lower potential output
and hence a smaller output gap. In the opposite
direction, U.S. labor productivity has been very
strong until lately.
There are various ways to estimate potential
output, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The
most credible estimates, given current information, point to a substantial downward shift in the
path of potential output for the United States and
the euro area. Box 1.3 compares the most recent
estimates of potential output growth and output

outlined in Chapter 4 of the October 2009 World
Economic Outlook, financial crises have typically been followed by
large, permanent losses of output. However, the aftermath shows
wide variation, not least because conditions and policy responses
differed across countries.

chapter 1

gaps by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the U.S. Congressional
Budget Office, or the European Commission with
those obtained with the IMF staff’s Global Projection Model and the WEO. These estimates point
to three conclusions: (1) a sizable and persistent
reduction in potential output relative to the precrisis trend; (2) substantial excess supply—that is,
large negative output gaps—for both regions;11 and
(3) considerable imprecision in the estimates, suggesting that the distribution of possible outcomes is
a matter of substance for policymakers.
Taken at face value, the lower estimates for trend
output levels in advanced economies have significant policy implications. They imply that a large
portion of fiscal revenue losses relative to precrisis
revenue trends should be presumed permanent. In
turn, this means that public expenditure programs
would have to be scaled back (or taxes increased), or
fiscal deficits and debt will continue to grow rapidly
over the medium term. More fundamentally, capital
and labor will need to be reallocated from declining
to expanding sectors, posing major social challenges. From a global perspective, Chapter 4 makes
clear that the demand for imports by advanced
economies will be below precrisis trends, in view of
the high share of consumer durables and investment goods in trade. Emerging economies that
relied heavily on demand from these economies will
therefore have to rebalance growth further toward
domestic sources to achieve growth rates similar to
those before the crisis.
Constraints on raising domestic demand in
emerging economies
Notwithstanding a relatively healthy growth
outlook, emerging economies are unlikely to fully
compensate for the lower demand from advanced
economies over the medium term. In particular,
recent developments in economies with excessive
surpluses do not point to a significant acceleration
in domestic demand relative to precrisis growth
rates (see Figure 1.12). For developing Asia, WEO
11Furthermore, a deeper analysis of labor productivity developments in the United States suggests that its recent increase is at
least partly a cyclical phenomenon, reflecting, for example, that
the least productive workers are likely to have lost their jobs first.

Global Prospects and Policies

Figure 1.17. Global Imbalances
The growth performance of emerging economies has been improving, whereas
for advanced economies it has been deteriorating over the past couple of
decades. This will continue to push capital flows toward emerging economies.
Nonetheless, global imbalances are not projected to narrow over the
medium term, as these economies are finding it hard to absorb these inflows
productively and are building up reserves to protect themselves against flow
reversals, which have often occurred in the past. As a result, the savings surplus in
Asia will rise relative to the GDP of advanced economies. This will limit the
increase in long-term interest rates in response to rising public debt.

world economic outlook: Recovery, Risk, and Rebalancing

Box 1.3. Inferring Potential Output from Noisy Data: The Global Projection Model View
The sluggish output growth experienced during
the recovery to date has brought increasing attention to whether this is merely demand deficiency—
a large, negative output gap—or whether much
of it could be because trend output—otherwise
known as potential output—has shifted downward.
This question is a perennial one, not the least
because estimating potential output is a challenging
task; for policy institutions, however, it is critical. The growth rate of potential output pins down
for fiscal authorities and lawmakers how quickly
an economy’s tax base is likely to expand. It also
establishes a baseline for GDP growth for forecasters and provides a benchmark for market watchers
to interpret the flow of data in real time. The level
of potential output defines the point toward which
the economy should be expected to gravitate over
the indefinite future and provides an estimate of
incipient inflation or deflation pressure. This box
reviews some issues associated with the measurement of potential output and outlines one method,
among several, that is used by the IMF staff as an
input for the World Economic Outlook (WEO), as
well as for other purposes.
Intrinsically, potential output is unobservable; it
must be inferred from the movement of actual output, either on its own or in conjunction with the
comovement of associated variables. One popular
approach is to use univariate time-series methods,
such as split time trends and the Hodrick-Prescott
(H-P) filter. These have the advantage of simplicity and replicability, but disadvantages include
the limited information that univariate methods
employ, the inconsistency of “prefiltered” estimates
because they are not estimated jointly with the
forecast model in which there are used, and the
sensitivity of the estimates to the data at the end
of the sample.1 The end-of-sample sensitivity of
many detrending methods is a special case of the
broader issue of how alternative methods respond
to additions to data sets and revisions to existing
The main author of this box is Robert Tetlow. Petar Manchev provided research assistance.

data. All else equal, a user would prefer estimates of
output gaps that are not significantly revised with
the receipt of new data.2

The Global Projection Model
The Global Projection Model (GPM), a nonlinear, forward-looking, multicountry model formulated by the IMF’s Research Department, includes
a block that computes estimates of potential output
and the associated output gap. The block is a
member of a class of models called “unobserved
components models,” so called because their task
is to split the observable variable output into
two unobservables, the output gap and potential
output. Potential output, in turn, is driven by
permanent shocks to the level of potential output
and temporary (but possibly long-lasting) shocks to
the growth rate of potential output. The model uses
observable measures such as output as well as inflation, long-term inflation expectations, unemployment, and total capacity utilization to infer what
potential output is likely to be.
The idea is best illustrated with a concrete
example: conventional wisdom says firms respond
to short-term fluctuations in sales by adjusting
labor input, from which it follows that product
market gaps are linked to labor market gaps, a
nexus known as Okun’s law. It follows that if
output is rising and unemployment is falling, firms
are facing increasing demand. If, however, output is
rising and unemployment is flat or rising, firms are
augmenting sales without increasing employment,
and thus their costs must be falling, and a supplyside improvement is likely at work. Of course, in
practice, matters are not so clear-cut. The relationship between unemployment and output is loose
and dynamic. The linkage shows variation over
stages of the cycle and over time more broadly. And
the interpretation of changes in labor input that
emerge from fluctuations in labor force participation and the average workweek can differ from
those stemming from changes in employment.
2A univariate filter does not recognize a cycle until it is
over. With multivariate methods, the more the comovements
of associated variables can pick up turning points in the cycle
in real time, the less the addition of new observations will
change prior estimates.

chapter 1

Global Prospects and Policies

For this reason, the GPM’s estimates of potential output are conditioned on three variables,
other than on output itself. The first of these is
unemployment operating through Okun’s law, as
just discussed. A second source of information is
capacity utilization. If output is down because of
a negative demand shock, production falls much
more than industrial capacity, opening a substantial capacity-utilization gap. But if the shock is to
productivity, the desired capital stock would fall
and, accordingly, capital investment would also
fall, reducing business capacity. Thus, a capacityutilization gap that is disproportionately small
given the observed decline in output signals a
negative supply shock. In short, the model reads
observations in total capacity utilization and
infers from prediction errors in this and other
series whether utilization has changed because of
a demand shock, or whether equilibrium capacity
itself has changed. It does this by choosing the
characterization of shocks that minimizes prediction errors. The third indicator is inflation. At the
crux of the Phillips curve is the notion that for
inflation to be stable over time, there must be neither excess demand nor excess supply. As it happens, the influence of excess demand on inflation
is a weak one, with a variety of other forces also
at work, and thus inflation’s role in pinning down
potential output in the GPM is often dominated
by other factors.
The virtue of this system is its consistency, flexibility, and ability to render not just estimates of
unobservables but measures of uncertainty around
those estimates. But it is not a panacea. Consider
the first figure, which shows 90 percent confidence
intervals for both year-over-year growth and the
level of potential output in the United States. The
red line in the bottom panel showing the actual
data is well outside the confidence interval, indicating that it is statistically safe to conclude that the
current output gap is negative, an inference that is
often difficult to make in more normal times. More

generally, the figure exhibits noteworthy in-sample
precision, but the bands widen substantially during
the forecast period.3 Indeed, while we can say that
it is likely that the level of potential output in the
United States will be higher in the future than it
is currently, we cannot say much more than that

3The block is estimated using a systems approach with
Bayesian methods and the Kalman filter. This allows for
potential output to be estimated simultaneously with two
other unobservables, the nonaccelerating inflation rate of
unemployment, and the equilibrium capacity-

utilization rate. In the figures, the path for potential growth
is the two-sided estimate from the Kalman smoother.
In-sample confidence intervals are asymptotic estimates computed from the inverse of the model’s Hessian matrix.

with great confidence. Clearly, even in this instance
where we are taking the model of potential output
as given, there is a lot of uncertainty and considerable room for debate regarding the “best” projection for potential.

Models as Characterizations of the Data
The evolution over time of estimates of
potential output expresses how the user sees
the incidence of shocks: smooth, deterministic
time trends suggest that the user believes supply
shocks are rare and easily identifiable in real
time. A volatile, stochastic process signals a view
that supply shocks are an important source of

32

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

business cycle fluctuations.4 It is in this context
that the way the recent financial crisis is interpreted is important. The smooth-trends view
represents the belief that the precrisis trend is
sustainable and points directly to demand management policies to move actual output to that
trend. The stochastic view entertains the notion
that the crisis and its aftermath may have shifted
potential downward, which would call for somewhat less activist policies on the demand side but
perhaps more policy actions to boost aggregate
supply.5
The top panel of the second figure illustrates
the issue for the United States and the euro area.
In both panels, the dark-blue line captures the
precrisis view of the (indexed) level of trend output
as measured by an H-P filter to 2007 and then
projected forward.6 The other lines show estimates
from the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD), the WEO, and either
the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) or
the European Commission (EC), as applicable.
The light-blue line is from the GPM. As is the case
for the CBO and OECD estimates, the GPM says
potential output has fallen significantly below what
the precrisis estimate would have been. At the same
time, the GPM projections show some tendency to
revert to a higher level; indeed, although it is not
apparent from the chart, the GPM path implies a
lasting effect on the level of potential output from
the crisis, but no permanent effect on the growth
rate. The output gaps that are implied by these
estimates of potential are shown in the bottom
panel. Taken together, these estimates suggest that
the data had a substantial influence on estimates of
4Two opposing cases are represented by a simple time
trend representing the highly Keynesian view that supply
shocks play no significant role in the business cycle and a
view that all fluctuations in output are equilibrium phenomena, encompassing the real business cycle view that all shocks
are supply shocks.
5Cerra and Saxena (2008) and Reinhart and Rogoff
(2009) provide evidence to suggest that financial crises may
produce highly persistent reductions in output. See also
Chapter 4 of the October 2009 World Economic Outlook.

potential and the ensuing output gaps regardless of
the model, as indicated by the substantial vertical
distance between the dark blue line and the other
lines in both figures. At the same time, all three
estimates currently show substantial excess supply—that is, large negative output gaps—for both
the United States and the euro area.
These estimates are snapshots taken at a given
point in time; it is also interesting to examine how
estimates change with the receipt of new data.
The third figure shows the evolution of estimates
of potential output growth and the output gap
during the late 1990s boom in the United States
as measured by the GPM and the CBO.7 What
makes this an interesting period to study is that, in
hindsight, we know that the boom was driven by
persistent shocks to productivity.8 Three vintages
are shown, one before the boom was manifest, one
as the boom crested, and the latest vintage.9
A tenet of monetary economics is that central
banks should work against demand shocks and
accommodate supply shocks. How did the two
models assess the incoming data? Were there
substantial revisions to the historical record? As
might be expected, there were significant upward
revisions to the estimates of potential growth for
both models. However, the CBO (bottom left
panel) tended to shift potential growth more or less
uniformly; that is, revisions affected both forecast
and backcast growth. In contrast, the GPM revisions (top-left panel) varied more from date to date
and affected forecast growth more than backcast
growth.

projections suggest that saving rates will rise from
about 44½ percent of GDP in 2010 to close to
45½ percent in 2012–15, while the investment
ratio moves sideways.12 Thus, global imbalances
are not projected to narrow further. This reflects
primarily four factors:

12In the other region with high saving rates––the Middle
East––the savings ratio is also projected to rise during 2009–15.
In this case, it is a reflection of a modest correction from a large
oil-price and fiscal-stimulus related fall during 2008–09.

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

We have already noted the substantial changes in
estimated potential growth since the onset of the
financial crisis. The fourth figure decomposes the
contributions to the change for 2010:Q2, relative
to before the crisis in 2007:Q2. Not surprisingly,
potential output growth has shifted downward, and
a contributor to the change in view was the collapse in GDP growth. The data on unemployment
actually reduce potential output, and thus shrink
the absolute output gap slightly, because the decline
in unemployment from its peak earlier in the year
is seen as being early; the model therefore infers
that more of the decline in output must originate
from the supply side. With some manipulation, the
first two bars of the chart can be used to tease out
the contribution of output per worker, a calculation
of some interest given the strong growth in output
per worker in 2009. The GDP growth contribution
and (un)employment contribution approximately
cancel each other out, which amounts to saying
that the model sees output per worker in 2009 as a
cyclical phenomenon.11 More intriguing, perhaps,
given its small share of U.S. GDP, is the very large
subtraction from potential growth—making the
output gap less negative than otherwise—coming
from capacity utilization. The mechanism here is as
described above: the financial crisis reduced business fixed investment, and hence total industrial
capacity, such that capacity utilization was not as
low as would be expected if the shock were entirely
a demand disturbance.
11As

it happens, in recent quarters, growth in output per
worker in the United States has declined substantially.

•• Structural constraints: Some two-thirds of gross
national saving in the region has been by China
in the recent past. Even in a best-case scenario,
however, China will provide only a partial offset
to the weaker demand from advanced economies,
given the relatively small size of both overall
Chinese consumption and Chinese imports of
consumer goods.13 Also, in many emerging Asian
economies, investment in the services sector is
13See IMF (2010). IMF (2009) finds that despite above-average import growth rates over the past 15 years, China’s imports

chapter 1

low, with India a notable exception. Policy efforts
have been directed at allowing greater competition in infrastructure-related services, further
opening the retail and financial sectors, and lifting restrictions on entry into social services, such
as health and education. However, these will take
time to bear fruit.
•• Restrictions on capital inflows: Here it is useful to
distinguish between restrictions from the period
before the latest crisis and recovery and restrictions
imposed recently in response to capital inflows.
The former can have large effects on inflows but
can be reduced only very gradually, in tandem
with reforms to goods and services markets, financial systems, and prudential policies and practices.
Controls imposed recently are reviewed in more
detail in Chapter 2. Again, two types can be
distinguished: (1) those that affect both domestic
residents and foreign investors (macroprudential
measures)––most of the measures adopted in
emerging Asia fall into this category; and (2) those
that target foreign investors specifically (classic
capital controls)––these have been the main focus
of some countries in Latin America (Brazil). Given
the nature of measures adopted recently, their
medium-term effects on global demand rebalancing are probably not large.
•• Concerns about destabilizing currency appreciations and related losses of competitiveness: These
have led key emerging economies to mainly accumulate reserves rather than to allow the nominal
exchange rate to appreciate in response to trade
surpluses and capital inflows (see Figure 1.7).
While offering insurance against sudden stops,
accumulating reserves to mitigate currency appreciation pressures in response to sustained current
account surpluses is likely to slow domestic
demand and to gradually raise inflation. And it
puts a burden on the budgets of emerging economies, given the difference between domestic and
reserve-asset interest rates.
•• Fiscal policy stances: Almost all major emerging
market economies are consolidating, with only
a few keeping support broadly unchanged (for
of consumer goods still accounted for only 3 percent of global
imports in 2008.

Global Prospects and Policies

example, Brazil, Indonesia). The difference in
the pace of consolidation during 2011 between
economies with excessive external surpluses and
deficits is modest (see Figure 1.12). Mediumterm projections reinforce this point.

More Proactive Policies Are Needed
To sum up, short- and medium-term prospects
continue to point to the slow, sluggish recovery
anticipated earlier, and it remains subject mainly
to downside risks. Policies need to accelerate the
rebalancing of demand from public to private sources
in advanced economies and from economies with
external deficits to those with external surpluses.
In many advanced economies, the financial sector
remains the Achilles’ heel of recovery prospects for
private demand. Insufficient progress with repair
and reform is weighing on credit and slowing the
normalization of monetary and fiscal policies, with
adverse spillovers for emerging economies. Accelerated financial restructuring and reform should thus
be top priorities. So far, progress has been painfully
slow. Fiscal consolidation needs to start in 2011.
Government budgetary policies are in the process of
moving from short-term stimulus to medium-term
consolidation. However, fiscal policymakers urgently
need to legislate measures that lower deficits over the
medium term. This is necessary not only to halt and
ultimately reverse the large rise in public debt ratios,
but also to help create more room for policy maneuver in the short term. In addition, fiscal adjustment
needs to be supported with structural reform. Policies
that eliminate distortions to domestic demand in key
emerging economies would strengthen prospects for
global demand rebalancing and thereby support a
more robust recovery in both emerging and advanced
economies. However, there are many constraints on
what can be achieved over the medium term, and
policymakers would be well advised to base their
plans on prudent growth projections.

More Progress Is Needed in Repairing and Reforming
the Financial Sector
Financial sector policies are critical for sustaining
a healthy recovery. Apparently isolated difficulties in
International Monetary Fund | October 2010

world economic outlook: Recovery, Risk, and Rebalancing

a few spots can have large spillover effects via complex financial linkages and deterioration of fragile
confidence. Failure to rapidly resolve, restructure, or
consolidate weak banks and repair wholesale markets raises the need for further fiscal backstopping
and low interest rates to support recovery, which
can cause other problems, including spillovers to
emerging economies. More progress with financial
sector repair and reform should thus be a top priority for advanced economies.
As the October 2010 GFSR explains, insufficient progress in addressing the legacy problems of
the crisis has left the system vulnerable to funding
shocks and a loss of market confidence. Progress in
addressing weak banks is urgently needed:
•• U.S. banks have made considerable progress
in recognizing losses and rebuilding capital.
However, important risks continue to revolve
around exposure to real estate, especially by small
and midsize banks, which are major providers
of credit to small and medium-size enterprises
(SMEs). These account for a large part of total
employment in the economy. In addition, continuing weakness in private-label securitization
markets is limiting the ability of banks to offload
risk from their balance sheets. Reforms to the
housing finance system are crucial but remain
unfinished.
•• European banks face challenges from fragile
funding and profitability, sovereign debt exposure, and real estate lending. Decisive actions are
being undertaken in some countries (for example,
Ireland, Spain, United Kingdom), but much
remains to be done to put bank balance sheets
on a sustainable footing. In other countries (for
example, Germany) long-standing problems have
yet to be addressed. A range of measures should
be considered, including forcing weak banks to
raise additional capital, secure stable funding,
and more decisively clean up their balance sheets.
In cases when viable business models cannot be
established, regulators should have the power to
restructure or resolve quickly.
In the meantime, the public sector will remain
heavily involved in financial intermediation. In the
United States, for example, mortgage lending is being
propped up by the government’s purchase of GSE
36

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

obligations. In Europe, a number of banks remain
reliant on ECB financing facilities or on various
forms of government support. Moreover, as underscored in the October 2010 GFSR, usage of governments’ recapitalization and debt guarantee programs
remains substantial in advanced economies, even if
demand for these programs has declined. In fact,
while programs were closed in some advanced economies, they had to be extended in many European
economies. Given the “wall” of maturing bank debt,
governments and central banks may need to continue
to provide funding guarantees and extraordinary
liquidity facilities (or ensure that they will have the
ability to provide liquidity insurance via other means
if necessary) until banks clearly demonstrate their
ability to self-fund unaided.
Beyond addressing the legacy problems, authorities face the challenge of putting in place prudential
frameworks that deliver a safer and stronger global
financial system. Regulatory reforms have focused
primarily on improving the prospects of individual
institutions and sectors and now need to adopt a
more global view. Thus, the focus should be not just
on enhancing microprudential regulation but also
on developing a more macroprudential approach to
limit systemic risks emanating from too-big-to-fail
institutions, which are now recognized to include
nonbanks.
In this context, the recent proposals of the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) are
welcome, representing a substantial improvement
in the quality and quantity of capital in comparison
with the precrisis situation. In particular, common
equity will represent a higher proportion of capital
and thus allow for greater loss absorption. Also, the
amount of intangibles and qualified assets will be
limited to 15 percent.14 Phase-in arrangements have
been developed to allow banks to move to these
higher standards mainly through retention of earnings. As the global financial system stabilizes and
the world economic recovery is firmly entrenched,
completely phasing out intangibles and scaling back
the transition period should be considered. This will
14These

include deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing rights,
significant investments in common shares of financial institutions, and other intangible assets.

chapter 1

further raise banking sector resilience to absorb any
future shocks. Under the baseline scenario, shorter
phase-in periods would not have placed undue
pressure on the banking system and the economy.
In fact, the longer financial institutions remain
with lower buffers, the higher the risk of emerging vulnerabilities and the greater the burden on
supervisors.
A major challenge is removing the ability of significant financial enterprises in the public or private
sector to leverage (implicitly or explicitly) taxpayersubsidized borrowing. This applies to a broad range
of enterprises, such as the GSEs, many public sector
banks in Germany and elsewhere, and many “tooimportant-to-fail” entities. Excessive risk taking in
the financial system also needs to be mitigated by
ensuring strong capitalization and risk management
at significant nonbank institutions and by removing
tax breaks for personal or corporate debt financing.
Other policy challenges range from reforms to overthe-counter derivative exposures, to more effective
cross-border resolution frameworks, and from better
compensation practices, to improved accounting
standards.
The potential effects of the full set of reforms on
credit and growth are hard to determine. Much will
depend on their design and how they are phased
in––they will likely detract from activity in the
short term but will bring benefits in the long term.
Model-based assessments by the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision suggest that tighter capital
regulation will affect macroeconomic activity,
primarily through an increase in the cost of bank
credit.15 The new regulation is expected to reduce
macroeconomic volatility by reducing bank vulnerability during crises and limiting credit expansion in
upturns. However, the effectiveness of these bankcentric measures will depend critically on the rigor
of implementation and the potential for the shift
15Available

estimates suggest that in the steady state, a 2 percentage point increase in required bank capital will permanently
reduce the level of output by about 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point.
However, model risks surrounding the estimate are skewed
toward a more significant impact of up to 0.7 percentage point
of output in some specifications. In any case, the calibration will
have to be revisited in light of the latest capital adequacy and
liquidity proposals. For further discussion, see BCBS (2010) and
MAC and BCBS (2010).

Global Prospects and Policies

of ctivities toward less regulated, nonbank financial
intermediaries or markets.16
Requirements differ in emerging economies.
Many avoided financial excesses ahead of the crisis
by adopting prudential policies and practices that
were more stringent than those in the major financial centers, an approach that has been vindicated.
The challenge facing these economies is to further
deepen financial intermediation, with a view to
fostering sound lending to households and SMEs.
In some cases, this will require broader reform of
legal frameworks, including bankruptcy codes. At
the same time, prudential policies and practices will
have to stay one step ahead of the development of
national financial systems.

“Growth-Friendly” Plans for Medium-Term Fiscal
Consolidation Are Still Missing
Fiscal consolidation needs to start in earnest in
2011. Of utmost importance are firm commitments
to ambitious and credible strategies to lower fiscal
deficits over the medium term, preferably with
legislated tax and expenditure reforms that become
effective in the future and support investment and
labor supply over the medium term. This task is
now more urgent than it was six months ago, as
further fiscal accommodation could be needed in
the short term if global activity slows appreciably
more than projected. Absent credible plans to lower
deficits over the medium term, however, such support could cause renewed turbulence in sovereign
debt markets that could undermine the effectiveness
of any support measures.
Plans should emphasize policy measures that
reform major, rapidly growing spending programs,
such as pension entitlements and public health
care systems, and make permanent reductions in
nonentitlement spending.17 There is also wide
scope to improve tax structures, for example, by
shifting the tax burden from earnings to consumption spending or property. Well-designed spending

also Chapter 3 of the April 2009 GFSR; Claessens and
others (2010); and Viñals and Fiechter (2010).
17The net present value of future increases in health care
and pension spending is many times larger than the increase in
public debt due to the crisis.

Some economies' medium-term economic growth projections appear optimistic,

expenditure cuts. However, WEO projections suggest that not all countries will
achieve an expenditure ratio appreciably lower than before the crisis, suggesting
that room for further cuts remains.

and tax reforms can help rebuild confidence by
reducing the fiscal burden for the future and by
boosting the economy’s supply potential. Plans
could also include legislation to strengthen fiscal
institutions and to introduce binding multiyear
targets. Measures that improve prospects for faster
growth in incomes for the foreseeable future may
also mitigate the adverse short-term effects that
fiscal consolidation has commonly caused in the
past. At the same time, governments should try to
extend the average maturity of their debt, proactively reducing refinancing risk.
In the near term, the extent and type of fiscal
adjustment should depend on country circumstances, particularly the pace of recovery and the
risk of a loss of fiscal credibility.
•• Considering the widespread absence of strong,
credible plans for medium-term consolidation and the latest turbulence in sovereign debt
markets, fiscal consolidation plans for 2011 strike
a broadly appropriate balance between progress
toward stabilizing public debt and continued
support for recovery (Figure 1.18). Countries facing severe foreign funding pressures have already
had to retrench; in these economies, strong
signals of commitment remain necessary.
•• In economies with excessive external surpluses
and relatively low public debt, fiscal tightening
should take a backseat to monetary tightening
and exchange rate adjustment. This would help
support domestic demand as foreign demand
temporarily weakens. In other emerging economies, fiscal tightening can start immediately
because recovery is already well under way. Fiscal
tightening should be a top priority in emerging
economies that have relatively high public debt
and are struggling to absorb large capital inflows
productively.
•• If activity threatens to weaken appreciably more
than projected, countries with fiscal room should
allow automatic stabilizers to play fully; in some
countries with small stabilizers, temporary support through extended unemployment benefits or
wage subsidies could be continued. In addition,
if needed for the recovery to continue, some of
the consolidation planned for 2011 may also
have to be postponed.

chapter 1

Global Prospects and Policies

Looking further ahead, advanced economy governments need to begin legislating the consolidation
measures they intend to implement in the future to
achieve their medium-term fiscal objectives. Most
advanced economy governments aim to stabilize or
lower debt-to-GDP ratios sometime before or during 2015––objectives beyond 2015 have typically
not been spelled out.18 WEO projections suggest
that many will achieve this objective, although
typically one or two years later than planned. Their
governments should adopt additional measures
soon to reduce the likelihood of slippage. Among
the major advanced economies with high or rapidly
rising debt, Spain and the United States would fail
to stabilize debt by 2015. A major reason for the
projected overshooting is that real GDP growth
projections of the authorities are noticeably higher
than those of the WEO.19 These governments too
should soon specify significant adjustment measures
to achieve debt stabilization by 2015. Japan is planning to reduce its public-debt-to-GDP ratio starting
in FY2021; the authorities should outline the key
revenue and expenditure measures of their strategy
in order to strengthen its credibility.
As discussed, the fiscal adjustment that is shaping up is likely to detract from demand. Present
fiscal plans for 2011 and beyond do not point to
major differentiation across countries according to
their external and public debt positions (see Figure
1.12). Chapter 3 suggests that such synchronized
adjustment will make consolidation more painful.
Encouragingly, however, some two-thirds of the
planned adjustment is taking place on the expenditure side (notably lowering spending on wages,
pensions, and public administration), which seems

to depress output by less than revenue increases,
according to Chapter 3. Also, indirect rather than
direct taxes contribute mainly to revenue-raising
measures, which should limit distortions to labor
supply and investment and accelerate output gains
over the long term.
Additional efforts could usefully focus on lowering spending and eliminating many tax exemptions
and subsidies, notably those that favor debt over
equity financing, and, in some economies, raising
taxes on property.20 Moreover, more could be done
to secure long-term fiscal sustainability. This can
help build confidence in public finances without
necessarily detracting from demand today. Examples
of such measures include linking statutory retirement ages to life expectancy and improving the
efficiency of health care spending. Thus far, only
a few governments have recently take steps in this
direction. While rolling back deficits, governments
will need to protect the most vulnerable segments
of society.21
Fiscal consolidation should alleviate any undue
pressure for longer-term interest rates to rise as the
global economy approaches full potential output.
Existing empirical evidence suggests that a lower
debt ratio in advanced economies, equivalent to
10 percentage points of GDP, might lower equilibrium interest rates by at least 30 basis points over
the long term, with a few estimates going as high as
100 basis points. The IMF staff estimates in Chapter 3 are close to the lower bound of this range.
With plenty of excess capacity, real interest rates
are currently not a relevant constraint on private
investment. However, this may change, although a
case for major, public-debt-driven increases in rates

18The IMF’s forthcoming November 2010 Fiscal Monitor
will provide a detailed assessment of fiscal policy challenges and
objectives. Ideally, high-debt countries should try to reduce debt
ratios back to the precrisis median of 60 percent of GDP: doing
so by 2030 would require improvements in structural primary
balances of advanced economies by over 8 percentage points
of GDP from the 2010 level. For emerging economies, using
a similar methodology but assuming a lower debt target (40
percent, a threshold beyond which fiscal risk is often considered
to rise in emerging economies), the adjustment averages less than
3 percentage points of GDP.
19This reflects the WEO’s larger estimated reduction in potential output relative to precrisis trends as the major financial and
real-estate-related shocks continue to reverberate for some time.

20Expenditure ratios in a number of advanced economies
with high debt are not projected to fall much below precrisis
levels, and thus there still appears to be further room to lower
spending. Revenue measures to consider include improving the
performance of the value-added tax (VAT)—for example, by
eliminating exemptions and reduced rates; in some countries,
raising tobacco and alcohol excises to the advanced G20 average; and increasing property taxes in European countries to the
level in other advanced economies. For the United States and
Japan, introducing a VAT and raising the rate, respectively, could
become significant sources of additional revenue.

beyond precrisis averages is far from evident considering the following:22
•• In many advanced economies, absent major
policy initiatives to raise potential output, household saving rates are likely to be higher than
before the crisis and investment lower, in line
with potential output.
•• In key emerging economies, savings surpluses are
forecast to continue to rise (see Figure 1.17). The
gap between saving and investment in emerging
Asia, following a recent contraction, would widen
to above precrisis levels, if measured as a share of
advanced economies’ GDP.
Thus, to some extent, features of the precrisis
“savings glut” are going to remain in place. However, this should not induce advanced economies to
postpone the adoption of measures that reduce fiscal
deficits over the medium term. Postponing fiscal
consolidation in advanced economies until emerging
economies have boosted internal demand increases
downside risks, as the IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model illustrates (see Box 1.4).

Monetary Policy Should Stay Accommodative in Many
Economies
Given subdued inflation and prospects for fiscal
consolidation, monetary conditions should remain
highly accommodative for the foreseeable future
in most advanced economies. If downside risks to
growth materialize, monetary policy should be the
first line of defense. At present, because of near-zero
policy rates, central banks in key advanced economies would again have to rely on balance sheet
expansion or changes in balance sheet composition
to ease financial conditions. Although difficult to
predict with great confidence, qualitative easing
measures are likely to be more effective than quantitative easing measures, given the still-weak state of
banks, the disrepair in some financial markets, and
generally elevated volatility. To put it differently,
risk premiums across markets should probably be
of greater concern to policymakers than levels of
22Measuring

real interest rates raises a number of problems.
IMF staff estimates suggest that long-term real interest rates were
somewhat below the long-term historical average––commonly estimated at about 2½ percent––during the decade before the crisis.

40

long-term government bond rates. Central banks in
emerging economies have more room for interest
rate cuts, if needed.
Looking further ahead, monetary policy will
have to carefully consider the implications of fiscal
consolidation and key financial sector trends for
inflation. A number of governments are planning
revenue increases, notably from indirect taxes. Past
experience in advanced economies suggests that
central banks typically were less accommodative of
revenue than of expenditure measures to cut deficits
(see Chapter 3). In the face of weak labor markets
in advanced economies, a long-term trend toward
more job-friendly wage setting, and some labor
market reforms, significant inflationary effects of
sales tax hikes on wages appear unlikely in the current economic environment, and thus central banks
can afford a more accommodative response. At the
same time, risk premiums and financial intermediation costs can be expected to stay more elevated
after the crisis. All else equal, both trends would call
for greater monetary accommodation.
Monetary policy requirements are diverse for
emerging and developing economies. Some of the
larger, fast-growing emerging economies, faced
with rising inflation or asset price pressures, have
appropriately tightened monetary conditions, and
markets are pricing in some further moves (see
Figure 1.11). Central banks in emerging and developing economies must be alert to second-round
effects on wages from higher food prices or upside
surprises to energy prices. Risks are more elevated
in economies that have had a history of unstable
inflation or that are operating closer to capacity. By
the same token, if downside risks to global growth
materialize, there may need to be a swift policy
reversal. Looking further ahead, falling risk premiums would call for tighter monetary policy stances,
all else remaining unchanged.

Exchange Rate Policies Should Support the
Rebalancing of Global Demand
In emerging economies with excessive external surpluses, monetary tightening should be
supported with currency appreciation as excess
demand pressures build. In this regard, exchange

Global Prospects and Policies

Box 1.4. Uncoordinated Rebalancing
The downside scenario in this box is based on
simulations using the IMF’s Global Integrated
Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF), a multiregional dynamic general equilibrium model.1 The
scenario starts in 2011 and illustrates that postponing fiscal consolidation in advanced economies
until emerging economies have boosted internal
demand increases downside risks in the form of an
unfavorable market reaction that raises advanced
economies’ sovereign and corporate spreads. This
in turn forces these economies into large, frontloaded, and ill-targeted fiscal consolidation that
takes many years to become credible and to bring
spreads back down. Throughout, interest rates are
assumed constant for two years in the advanced
economies and for one year elsewhere, with emerging Asia following a flexible exchange rate regime.
The figure shows WEO baselines in light blue (or,
when gray-shaded, it shows deviations from WEO
baselines).
The first part of the scenario (orange lines)
assumes that emerging Asia uses fiscal and structural policies to stimulate internal demand. It
assumes increases of 2 percentage points of baseline
GDP in both government investment and transfers targeted to individuals with a high propensity
to consume, financed in equal parts by increases
in the deficit and in consumption taxes. Domestic structural policies in the region produce an
additional 1 percent gain in GDP relative to the
baseline by 2014. The combined policies lead
to a cumulative domestic output expansion of 2
percent by 2015. They also generate positive trade
spillovers, particularly for strong exporters such as
Japan and Germany.
Under regular circumstances, this would be
only partly offset by higher policy interest rates in
advanced economies in response to demand-driven
inflation pressures. But because the policies reduce
emerging Asia’s external surpluses, they also reduce
The main author of this box is Michael Kumhof.

remaining countries (the remaining countries region is not
shown in the figure here).

the region’s demand for government debt from the
advanced economies (emerging Asia has been a particularly heavy investor in U.S. debt). Particularly if
accompanied by investor perceptions that advanced
economies do not have in place credible mediumterm consolidation plans, such a portfolio shock
could lead to an increase in sovereign and corporate spreads (blue lines), especially for the United
States. We assume a 225-basis-point increase in the
sovereign spread on impact (which retreats to 175
basis points permanently after five years), with a
150-basis-point additional and temporary increase
for the corporate sector. The increase in spreads
is roughly half the size for the other advanced
economies. This leads to an output decline of about
3 percent in the United States, with a very slow
recovery thereafter, and of about 0.5 percent in
other advanced economies.
The increase in borrowing spreads forces large,
earlier-than-planned, and highly contractionary
fiscal consolidation in the advanced economies
starting in 2012. Consolidations equal 2 percentage points of GDP in the United States and half
as much in other advanced economies (red lines).
Negative multiplier effects, including spillovers
to regions that do not undertake fiscal consolidation, are large for two reasons. First, the cuts are
assumed to be chosen on the basis of implementation speed rather than likely impact on output,
with 40 percent accounted for by higher labor
income taxes, 40 percent by cuts in transfers
targeted to individuals with a high propensity to
consume, and 20 percent by cuts in government
investment. Second, the sudden, forced consolidations are assumed to become credible only in
2014, so that their beneficial effects on risk premiums are quite gradual. By 2015 most regions are
on their way to a full recovery. The exception is
the United States, which takes several additional
years to recover.
Maximum output losses relative to baseline
under this scenario equal almost 4 percent in
the United States and about 1 percent in other
advanced economies, with emerging Asia experiencing only very small output losses in 2011 and
2012. The current account imbalance between

the United States and emerging Asia improves
significantly.
These results are of course sensitive to our
assumptions about the size of shocks. Although
there is reasonable agreement on the likely magnitude and effects of fiscal measures, the likely
magnitude of spread-related shocks is subject to
considerable uncertainty. But it seems clear that the
negative growth effects of a generalized increase in
risk premiums in all advanced economies should
be larger than the positive growth effects of higher
demand from emerging Asia, except of course

rate instability and overshooting remain important
concerns for many emerging economies. However,
improvements in fundamentals in many of these
economies relative to those of advanced economies
are consistent with a long-term appreciation of
their currencies.
The challenge for emerging economies is to
determine the extent to which changes in exchange
rates bring them in line with fundamentals. Such an
assessment would have to be made on a case-by-case
basis.
•• If exchange rate overshooting and falling competitiveness become concerns, countries should
consider reducing fiscal deficits to ease pressure
on interest rates, some building up of reserves,
and possibly imposing some restrictions on
capital inflows or removing controls on outflows.
As discussed in more detail in Chapter 2, some
countries in Latin America fall into this category.
However, the restrictions on capital inflows
appear to be second-best responses, and it will
be important to deploy suitable regulatory and
supervisory responses, as is being done in some
countries, to obtain more durable protection
against speculative excesses.
•• If exchange rates are undervalued from a
medium-term perspective, then nominal appreciation should be part of the policy response to
inflows. This applies to a number of countries in
emerging Asia (discussed further in Chapter 2)

Global Prospects and Policies

for emerging Asia itself. The reason is that the
advanced economies account for a very large share
of the world economy. For the United States, the
difference between the two effects is even larger,
given the limited export flows from the United
States to emerging Asia.
The policy conclusion from this analysis is that
rebalancing from public to private demand in
advanced economies and rebalancing from external
to domestic demand in key emerging economies
are closely related and that a robust recovery
requires that they move ahead together.

and, in some respects, presents a problem that
might best be addressed by collective action
taken in a coordinated manner. Nonetheless,
where inflows are associated with sector-specific
overheating, targeted macroprudential measures
to address the specific risks can play a useful
supplementary role.
Taking a medium-term perspective, economies
should continue to strengthen their prudential frameworks and open up sectors to domestic and foreign
direct investment, with a view to creating opportunities for productive use of incoming capital. This
will help fight speculative excesses and reduce the
need for macroprudential interventions, including
restrictions on capital inflows. As far as the latter are
concerned, their objective should be to ensure a productive use of capital. However, determining what is
productive and what is not can be a challenge. Also,
relatively little is known about the effectiveness and
efficiency of macroprudential measures and capital
controls beyond the very short term.

Structural Reforms Are Needed to Support Growth
and Rebalancing
Structural policies to develop productive potential and support global demand rebalancing are
essential to forging a sustainable recovery. A detailed
discussion of the challenges, which are very comInternational Monetary Fund | October 2010

43

world economic outlook: Recovery, Risk, and Rebalancing

plex, is beyond the scope of this report.23 Requirements will vary both across and within the groups
of advanced and emerging economies.
High and persistent unemployment poses a
major policy challenge in many advanced economies. Accommodative macroeconomic policies and
financial sector repair (to facilitate access to credit
by SMEs, which account for most employment) are
essential to raise employment. In addition, labor
and product market policies could enhance growth
and job creation and reduce high unemployment
over the medium term. Labor market reforms that
could increase employment include (1) measures
that eliminate two-tier labor markets by lowering protection afforded to workers on permanent
contracts, while raising protection available to
those with temporary contracts; (2) measures to
facilitate job searching, skills matching, and labor
mobility; (3) better access to training and education to support ongoing sectoral changes; (4)
well-designed employment subsidies for vulnerable
groups­­ (the long-term unemployed or the young)
to help accelerate their reintegration into the labor
market. Complementary product market reforms
could strengthen the employment effects by boosting labor demand and real wages through greater
competition and lower markups on prices.
Many emerging and developing economies have
successfully concluded first-generation reforms
that improved macroeconomic policy frameworks,
strengthening their resilience to macroeconomic
shocks. However, to further raise potential growth
and employment, efforts could usefully focus on
simplifying product and services market regulation, raising human capital, and building critical
infrastructure.
In key emerging Asian economies, the removal of
distortions that drive high household or corporate
saving rates and deter investment in nontradables
sectors could boost domestically led growth, as
demand from major advanced economies stays
below precrisis trends. This could be helped with
further deregulation and reform of financial sectors
and corporate governance, as well as stronger social

World Bank (2010a and earlier years).

44

safety nets. Even with the rapid progress under way,
however, such reforms will take some time to yield
major gains.24

Developing Economies Need Help in Coping with
Potentially Tighter Financing Constraints
Thanks to stronger policy frameworks, growth
in the world’s poorer economies is projected to
return to about 6 percent during 2010–11, which is
appreciably higher than during the 1990s. Encouragingly, foreign investors have not taken wholesale
flight from developing economies, as evidenced, for
example, by recovering equity markets, sovereign
spreads that returned close to precrisis levels, and
successful bond issuances (for example, by Senegal
in December 2009).
However, some developing economies could
face the prospect of scarcer and costlier capital.
With tighter capital markets, these economies will
need to increasingly rely on domestic sources of
funding. This puts a premium on financial development. In addition, there is a need for supplementing traditional financing with innovative
forms of finance such as risk-mitigation guarantees, public-private partnerships, and South-South
investments.25 Moreover, initiatives should be
taken to improve poor countries’ market access—
for example, extending 100 percent duty-free and
quota-free access to the least developed countries,
with liberal rules of origin. Improved market
access for low-income countries would have to be
complemented with stronger trade facilitation and
aid-for-trade programs to enhance these countries’
trade capacity.

Policy Coordination Brings Major Benefits
Much progress has been made through coordination in alleviating liquidity strains and rebuilding
confidence. Key actions—large interest rates cuts
and unconventional monetary measures, financial
support from the IMF and other international

chapter 1

financial institutions, and global fiscal stimulus—
have all involved international policy coordination.
The quality of coordination will now have to
change. Accommodative macroeconomic policies
and support for the financial sector were necessary
to avoid costly, chaotic adjustments in response to
structural shocks that, ultimately, will need to be
met with fundamental reforms. The challenge ahead
is to put in place these fundamental reforms in a
coordinated manner. Unlike during the height of
the crisis, the measures that are required now differ
across countries. They will need to encourage less
public demand in the advanced economies, more
domestic demand in key emerging economies,
and further financial sector repair and reform. A
separate IMF report for the G20 Mutual Assessment Program finds that the adoption of growthfriendly medium-term fiscal consolidation programs
by advanced economies, policies to rebalance
demand in emerging economies, and structural
reforms to boost potential output everywhere would
raise global GDP by 2½ percent over the medium
term.26 Hence, policy coordination can have major
benefits, as it did at the height of the crisis.

Appendix 1.1. Commodity Market
Developments and Prospects
The authors of this appendix are Thomas Helbling,
Shaun Roache, Nese Erbil, and Marina Rousset.
After rising through early May 2010, commodity prices generally declined during the remainder
of the second quarter, following increased financial
market volatility on concerns about vulnerable euro
area economies (Figure 1.19, top panel). Prices
have since recovered much of their second-quarter
losses, but only the prices of food commodities,
beverages, and agricultural commodities have risen
beyond early May peaks. The overperformance of
the latter largely reflects downgraded harvest expectations resulting from poor weather conditions.
The downgrading was particularly large for wheat,
reflecting drought conditions and wildfires in Russia
and some other major exporters, and wheat prices
26See

G20 (2010b).

Global Prospects and Policies

surged in July and August. Overall, in August the
IMF commodity price index was about 6 percent
above its December 2009 level.
The recovery in global commodity markets
continued through August, notwithstanding price
fluctuations due to changes in expectations about
near-term global economic prospects. Incoming
commodity market data have corroborated expectations of robust or improving demand, given
forecasts for global growth. The peaking of excess
inventories for many cyclical commodities was
another sign of normalization.
Recent commodity price developments were a
reminder of the marked effects that broad financial
market volatility has had on commodity prices during the global financial crisis and the early recovery.
Such volatility spillovers from broader financial
markets to commodity markets are not unusual,
although their strength has varied depending on
the underlying factors. When driven by rapidly
changing expectations about future global economic
prospects, as in May and June of this year, strong
volatility spillovers are to be expected, given that
commodities are both goods and real assets and that
inventory demand is forward looking. Similarly,
higher currency market volatility often leads to
increased commodity price volatility.
In recent weeks, global financial market conditions have stabilized, as tail risks have been reduced
by policy adjustment. Demand should continue to
support commodity prices as the global recovery progresses under the baseline projections in this World
Economic Outlook. In many cases, however, further
upward price pressures will likely remain moderate and will be balanced by other forces. Demand
growth should slow for some of the more cyclically
sensitive commodities, notably metals, as the boost
to global manufacturing activity from the inventory
cycle wanes. Within the broad global context, prospects for activity in China are particularly important
for many commodities, given the rapid increase in
that economy’s share of global commodity demand
over the past decade. Moderating growth in China
will thus likely be a force in restraining commodity
demand expansion. On the supply side, there are
still considerable capacity and inventory buffers. The
commodity-specific impact of these broad forces

will vary, depending on factors such as exposure to
demand in China, sensitivity to global manufacturing activity, and the elasticity of supply to price and
demand signals.
The recent wheat price surge has not altered this
relatively benign near-term outlook. The surge has
led to upward revisions in the wheat price projections through 2011, but with larger global wheat
inventories now than during 2006–07, the market should be in a better position to absorb this
temporary supply shock. Against this backdrop,
price spillovers to other major food crops—through
substitution linkages on the consumption and supply sides—have been limited so far.
Market expectations mirror the favorable nearterm prospects for commodity markets. The probability distributions of future spot prices derived
from options contracts suggest that risks remain
tilted to the upside, although the probability of
another broad-based commodity price spiking close
to or above 2008 peaks continues to be limited
in the near term (Figure 1.19, third panel). The
risks for extreme price spikes are related primarily to major disruptions to supply, including for
geopolitical and weather-related reasons. Other risk
factors include unexpected changes in the pace of
the global economic recovery, as well as renewed
financial market stress and volatility. Within this
broad picture, the vulnerability of wheat markets
to further supply disruptions has increased with
the supply shocks of this summer, and any further
significant shock through the remainder of this
harvest year would likely also lead to large spillovers
to other major crop prices.
While the near-term commodity market outlook
is benign given global cyclical conditions, commodity prices are projected to remain high by historical
standards over the medium term, with risks tilted to
the upside. The upward shift in commodity demand
growth that started some 10 years ago is expected to
be sustained as global growth continues to be driven
by emerging and developing economies. A sustained
upward shift in commodity demand can lead to
long periods of trend increases in real commodity
prices because of sluggish supply responses, given
long lags for exploration and investment. As discussed in Box 1.5, there is evidence that base metals

chapter 1

are in the midst of such a trend upswing after 20
years of trend declines.

Oil and Other Energy Markets
The spot price of one barrel of crude oil in the
world market has remained broadly in the $70
to $80 range that began to emerge in fall 2009,
although there has been occasional trading above
and below the band. Within the anchor provided
by the band, price volatility has remained relatively
elevated since concerns over fiscal positions and
competitiveness in vulnerable euro area economies
intensified in May.
The normalization in physical spot oil markets
has continued since the release of the April 2010
World Economic Outlook. Oil demand strengthened more than expected in the first half of 2010,
primarily reflecting stronger-than-projected global
activity and an increase in Chinese oil demand
above what would have been expected on the basis
of activity. Current data indicate that global oil
demand rose by 2.7 percent on an annual basis in
the first half of the year, the strongest year-over-year
increase since 2004 (Table 1.2). While demand has
risen more than expected in advanced as well as
emerging and developing economies, the latter still
account for virtually all the growth in demand (Figure 1.20, top left panel). In particular, oil demand
in China increased by 14 percent in the first half
of the year, exceeding real GDP growth by some
3 percentage points. Such divergences between oil
demand and broad activity growth in China were
observed in the past, notably in early 2004, but
they seemed to reflect special factors and remained
short-lived. Nevertheless, compared with other
cyclically sensitive commodities, notably base metals, advanced economies still account for a relatively
larger share of final oil consumption.
Oil production edged up during the first half of
2010, almost matching the rise in demand. About
half the supply increase is attributable to rises
in total production outside the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), notwithstanding production declines in the North Sea and
Mexico (middle left panel). The turnaround in
overall non-OPEC production reflected widespread

Global Prospects and Policies

gains, partly due to the incentives from high prices
to ramp up production, including through greater
use of enhanced recovery techniques where feasible.
Still-favorable cost conditions on the oil services
side have reinforced these incentives.
Increases in OPEC production of natural gas
liquids, which are not subject to production quotas,
also account for a substantial share of the production increases in 2010 (top right panel). OPEC
crude oil production in contrast has risen only
marginally despite low capacity utilization in some
major producers, highlighting the continued need
for production curbs to keep prices in the $70–$80
range.
Overall, however, oil markets have not yet
reached a state of full cyclical normalization. With
the broadly balanced expansion of demand and supply, the correction of excess cyclical inventories—
those above seasonal five-year average levels—in
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development countries has remained partial (middle right panel). And OPEC spare capacity buffers
remain high despite some rise in crude oil production because capacity has increased even more. The
continued upward slope in the oil futures curve
(“contango”) is another reflection of incomplete
normalization in oil markets.
Oil demand will continue to rise as the global
recovery progresses, with the buoyancy determined in part by the strength of the expansion in
activity. Based on previous patterns in the early
stages of expansion after global recessions, some
of the recent buildup of oil demand momentum
in emerging and developing economies is likely to
carry into 2011. While the momentum will put
upward pressure on prices, oil futures data suggest that the extent of price pressure will remain
limited (see Figure 1.19, bottom panel). On the
demand side, despite the likely rapid demand
expansion in emerging and developing economies, global oil demand growth is expected to be
moderated by stagnation or subdued increases in
advanced economies. Such expectations are consistent both with recent fuel efficiency trends and
the estimated relationship between oil demand,
activity growth, and real oil prices in advanced
economies. Second, information on upstream

Under such relatively benign supply conditions,
OPEC production policies would continue to
remain an important factor in determining prices.
In particular, the price path will depend on (1) the
target price at which OPEC members will accommodate an increasing call on their spare capacity,
(2) the reservation price at which additional supply
would be reduced, and (3) quota discipline among
members.
The main upside risks to this baseline picture of
relative stability in the oil market come from the
supply side, whereas on the demand side they seem
limited to large upward surprises. On the downside,
demand risks related to risks to the global recovery
remain important. In terms of the distribution of
risks, oil futures market participants see relatively
large price spikes to be more likely than large price
drops, although such events remain tail risks.27
Supply risk factors with the potential for a
sustained impact are likely to come from obstacles
to investment projects, for both new and replacement projects, although some geopolitical risks
may also have a longer-lasting price impact. High
oil prices and lower costs have helped keep capital
expenditure at robust levels, supporting an unexpected increase in non-OPEC production despite
ongoing declines in the North Sea and Mexico. But
the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has illustrated
the risks involved in projects at the technological
frontier. The production effects of the moratorium
on new deepwater drilling in the U.S. part of the
Gulf will be small from a global perspective, as deep
sea exploration and development elsewhere have
continued. Nevertheless, expansion of this segment of unconventional oil production faces risks
that extend beyond U.S. borders and safety-related
government intervention.
Price differentiation has remained a hallmark of
broad fuel market developments (Figure 1.20, bottom panel). In particular, natural gas prices in the
North American market have remained relatively

low, reflecting weak demand, given the still large
output gap in the region and the shale gas “revolution” (the promise of unlocking large quantities of
natural gas from shale deposits through advances in
hydraulic fracturing). With the implied shift in relative energy prices, natural gas has recouped some
of its previous loss of competitiveness as a primary
energy input, including in the power sector. The
improvement in long-term U.S. gas supply prospects has also had reverberations in gas markets in
other regions. One transmission channel has been
the redirection of liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments away from the United States in the context
of an improved global distribution infrastructure.
This redirection has introduced some price arbitrage
between markets and changes in pricing regimes in
European gas markets, notably with respect to the
indexing of gas contract prices to oil markets. How
lasting the pricing regime changes and the pressure
for further narrowing of the large price differentials across regions will be depends on a number of
factors. The most important ones are prospects for
developing shale gas production on other continents
and the prices at which shale gas production can be
expanded on a sustained basis. The same factors will
also determine whether natural gas will experience
sustained global market share increases as a source
of primary energy.

Metal Market Developments
Metal prices have responded strongly so far to
changing expectations about prospects for the global
economic recovery. Following a sharp rise through
May, due largely to a faster pace of recovery than
expected, metal prices declined as turbulence in
financial markets cast a cloud over the prospects for
growth (Figure 1.21, top left panel). Reflecting the
influence of common macroeconomic factors, metal
prices have moved in tandem with broader financial conditions since the intensification of the crisis
in the third quarter of 2008, notably with global
equity markets (top right panel). Metal-specific
supply developments have played some part in price
behavior, but the relatively low dispersion of price
changes so far in 2010 highlights the importance of
common factors (middle left panel).
50

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

The outlook for metal demand depends importantly on growth prospects in China, given
the rapid rise of this economy’s share in global
demand over the past decade (middle right panel).
Following a strong rise in 2009, related to significant macroeconomic policy stimulus—directed,
in large part, toward infrastructure investment—
China’s metal demand has now stabilized at a high
level, and two developments are likely to restrain
demand growth in the quarters ahead. First, the
pace of growth in China should continue to moderate as the effects of stimulus wane and efforts
to slow credit growth affect investment. Second,
end users may choose to run down the inventories that built up rapidly during 2009 to support
increased investment activities. Base metal stocks
held in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange have only just begun to decline
from their recent cyclical peaks, with destocking
in copper most advanced. Renewed appreciation
of the Chinese renminbi may partially offset these
factors by increasing the purchasing power of
domestic metal consumers. There have been signs
of recovering metal demand from advanced economies during early 2010, but the gradual pace of
expansion anticipated for these economies suggests
that emerging economies will remain the engine of
demand growth (bottom left panel). On balance,
this suggests that metal prices should increase
modestly through the end of 2011.
Supply issues have not played a major role in
price changes in recent months. The exception is
iron ore, for which a shift from contract to spot
pricing affected the price formation process and
may explain some of the recent rise in prices.
However, over the medium term, constraints on
the growth of supply may become more important
in determining market balances and prices (Box
1.5). Deteriorating mine productivity (copper and
tin) and the impact of policies targeted at reducing
the impact of metal smelting on the environment
(lead) are among the most important constraints
on supply. Inventory-to-use ratios increased during
the recession and provide some buffer for shocks;
however, they have begun to decline and would
experience sustained falls in the event of physical
market deficits (bottom right panel). The medium-

Global Prospects and Policies

Box 1.5. Have Metals Become More Scarce, and What Does Scarcity Mean for Prices?
Emerging economies have been an engine of
growth during the current global economic recovery, and they are likely to continue to lead growth
in the years ahead. Because their growth is more
commodity-intensive than that of advanced economies, the rapid increase in demand for commodities over the past decade is set to continue. Will
supply keep pace with demand growth at prices
close to today’s levels, or will increasing commodity
scarcity require that prices keep rising over the long
term? This box addresses that question for base
metals by assessing a commonly accepted indicator
of scarcity, the long-term behavior of real prices.
What does economic theory predict for longterm commodity price behavior? Hotelling (1931)
showed that the price of a nonrenewable resource
should reflect the marginal cost of extraction
and the in situ value; that is, the marginal value
of keeping reserves in the ground. This theory
famously predicts that the resource price should
increase at the rate of interest if marginal extraction costs remain unchanged. In equilibrium, the
return from keeping reserves in the ground is just
equal to what could be earned in interest, keeping
the resource owner indifferent to extracting one
more unit of the commodity. The increase in prices
can then be interpreted as a “scarcity rent,” and
the price can be expected to continue rising until
demand is choked off and the resource is effectively
exhausted.
Changes in scarcity can mean that prices do not
follow this rule in practice. Prices may rise faster
than the rate of interest, reflecting permanent shifts
in demand that cannot be met by a compensating
change in supply due to physical or technological
constraints (for example, the finite availability of
reserves or deteriorating ore quality). Prices may
also remain broadly unchanged or even decline
in the event that marginal extraction costs fall
(and supply increases) or end users find lower-cost
substitutes, both the result of new technology. This
suggests that the long-term behavior of commodity
prices can provide useful information for assessing
how the nature of scarcity is changing.

1Spliced principal component incorporating the largest
number of metals at each date based on data availability.

The behavior of a real base metals price index
going back to 1850 suggests that metal supply
became more abundant during the 19th century as
real prices declined, with somewhat more balanced
supply and demand growth since 1900 leading to
broadly constant real prices (first figure). Hotelling’s
prediction of lower prices stemming from a drop
in marginal costs has come about largely because of
technological innovation, which has allowed for a
combination of lower extraction costs and new ore
deposit discoveries. These developments over the
very long term have been punctuated by upswings
and downswings that have sometimes persisted
for decades. One way to analyze time variation
in long-term price behavior is to examine the
so-called low-frequency component in these series.
This component can be extracted with a low-pass
filter, which removes the influence of fluctuations
at seasonal or business cycle frequencies that play
an influential role in commodity price behavior

(Cashin, McDermott, and Scott, 2002). For commodities, in contrast to many macroeconomic
variables, it may also be appropriate to filter out
even longer periodic fluctuations that are unrelated
to long-term scarcity.
Some previous studies have suggested the possibility of “super cycles” for commodity prices (Cuddington and Jerrett, 2008), and this is supported by the
empirical evidence. For example, a significant contribution to the total variation in real prices comes
from slow-moving (or low-frequency) components,
which include the effects of long-term scarcity but
also the existence of medium-term super cycles.1 The
underlying causes of these super cycles are the long
implementation lags for discovery, exploration, and
capital investment in minerals industries, rather than
1For most of the metals considered in this analysis,
periodograms, which decompose the variance in real prices
into cycles of different frequencies, show that cycles with
durations significantly longer than the business cycle account
for a particularly large share of the variation.

52

true long-term scarcity. For example, for base and
precious metals, the average time needed to confirm
a discovery following initial exploration can be as
long as 20 years, with the average time from discovery to production estimated at about nine years (Sillitoe, 2000). The sluggish supply response to shifts
in demand can then give rise to price cycles with a
longer duration than the typical two- to eight-year
business cycle (Slade, 1982).
For the purpose of this box, measures of the longterm component in real base metal prices were thus
extracted with a low-pass filter that excludes all fluctuations with a cycle frequency of less than 30 years
(including business and super cycles).2 To distill the
common factor in the long-term price measures for
individual metals, the first principal component was
computed for different groups among them, based
on when price data first become available. The first
principal component accounted for between 70
percent and 80 percent of total variance in all cases,
depending on which metals were included.
These measures show very similar behavior in the
long-term component of real prices for base metals.
They bottomed out between 1996 (aluminum)
and 2000 (zinc) and have risen for all metals since
then. This followed a period lasting about 25 years,
during which the trend component in real prices
declined significantly. The measure of the common
factor in long-term real base metal prices reached
a trough in December 1998 and subsequently
experienced its largest rise for at least a century
over the past 12 years (see first figure). The rise has
not been interrupted by the global financial crisis
or the Great Recession. The decline and recovery of
metal prices observed since 2007 is instead largely
explained by fluctuations in the business cycle
component in prices.
What explains this evidence for increased longterm scarcity of base metals? The most important
explanation is increasing commodity demand by
emerging economies, particularly China, together
with a relatively sluggish supply response (second

figure). During 1998–2009, global base metal
demand grew by about 4 percent on an annual
average basis, slightly exceeding the growth of primary production.3 As a result, most metal markets
have moved into, or very close to, deficit, as measured by the difference between primary production and consumption. Deficits have been filled by
running down inventories or using scrap, but these
resources remain limited.
Supply has shown some signs of responding
to higher prices, and global primary production
grew at its fastest annual rate in at least 10 years
in 2007; however, even in the aftermath of the
Great Recession, concern has continued to build
about the ability of supply to keep pace with future
consumption growth. This is only partly related
to a lack of capital investment. For some metals,
technological and geological constraints have led
to declining mine productivity—particularly for
copper and tin. For other metals, constraints on
current production technologies imposed by environmental policies may also curtail supply—especially for lead and, to a lesser extent, aluminum.
3Measured as the IMF-index-weighted average of aluminum, copper, iron ore, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc.

term balance of risks for prices should thus remain
tilted toward the upside, particularly for copper.

Food Market Developments
Food prices broadly declined during the first two
quarters of 2010 but have since recovered to leave
the IMF food and beverage price index about 20 percent higher for the year to date (Figure 1.22, top
left panel). Price volatility has picked up somewhat
in recent months, but it still remains considerably
below the elevated levels of the 2008–09 period, and
the probability of future extreme price movements—
implied from options prices—has fallen modestly
(top right panel). In contrast to other commodities,
including base metals and energy, food prices have
shown little sensitivity in recent months to changing

Global Prospects and Policies

Does the evidence of increased scarcity mean
that demand-supply balance will require even
higher prices in the future? The measure of scarcity
used in this analysis suggests that base metal prices
are only about halfway through the current period
of trend price increases. On average since 1850,
the common factor in the long-term component
of metal prices has taken about 20 years to move
from trough to peak, although the duration of
these upturns varies and depends on the pace of
technological innovation.4
Until now, there have been few convincing signs
of a persistent increase in the growth of metal supply, and an ongoing global recovery will preclude
a strong offset from cyclical factors. This would
mean that, if demand continues to grow at the
rates observed over the past decade, the current era
of higher scarcity, rising metal price trends, and a
balance of price risks tilted toward the upside may
continue for some time.

expectations of global growth or to changing global
financial market conditions. Reflecting a return to
more normal conditions, the correlation of food
prices with other commodities has been steadily
declining since peaking in early 2009, and comovement is now approaching the levels that characterized
food markets before the 2008–09 boom and bust
(middle left panel).
The normalization is due largely to the againdominant influence of commodity-specific supply
developments for major food crops. In particular,
during the early part of 2010, as other commodity
prices were rising on improving prospects for the
global economy, food prices were drifting lower as
demand projections remained relatively stable and
global supply expectations were revised higher (middle right panel). The expansion of global acreage in

response to higher prices during 2005–08 contributed to the rise in supply, along with robust yields,
in part due to favorable weather patterns in key
producing areas. In recent months, global supply
estimates for the major crops in 2010 have begun to
be downgraded. The sharpest downgrade has been
for the 2010 wheat harvest due to adverse weather
conditions in Russia, Ukraine, and to a lesser extent
North America. Spillovers from these supply shocks
to other food prices have so far been limited, in
part reflecting the temporary nature of the shocks,
relatively ample wheat inventories. Harvest expectations for other major crops have been revised
modestly lower, with the early effects of the La
Niña weather pattern contributing to lower output
in Asia. Notwithstanding these revisions, prospects
remain for relatively buoyant supply this year from
possible wheat substitutes, including corn and rice,
and crops that may be more indirectly affected by
higher wheat prices, including soybeans.
The relatively low cyclical sensitivity of food
demand means that actual and anticipated demand
growth has remained modest. Emerging economies
should continue to account for much of the growth
in demand for major crops during 2010–12, with
demand in advanced economies remaining relatively
sluggish, continuing the pattern of recent years
(bottom left panel). One factor that has restrained
demand growth is the slowdown in the growth
of biofuel production, as lower fuel prices led to
a decline in the energy-to-food price ratio and
thereby reduced the incentives for biofuel use. This
slowdown may be temporary, however, as energy
prices have recovered faster than corn prices (bottom right panel). A number of large U.S. ethanol
producers have now emerged from bankruptcy or
have restarted idled production facilities, and the
share of the U.S. corn crop used for ethanol production is expected to increase modestly to 35 percent in 2010. The prospects for a further increase in
biofuel demand will also depend on public policies. Examples include changes in usage mandates
and ceilings, including the outcome of the current
review of the amount of ethanol in gasoline sold in
the United States, and other forms of government
support, such as subsidies.

chapter 1

Overall, food prices remain high in real terms
compared with averages over the past few decades
and, at this level, are expected to provide for a
broadly balanced expansion of demand and supply.
In the near term, with the exception of wheat,
stock-to-use ratios could even increase, as markets
for major crops may be in surplus in 2010 and
2011. Nevertheless, stock-to-use ratios are unlikely
to return to long-term averages.28 The capacity of
some major food commodity markets to absorb
supply shocks therefore may be relatively limited,
suggesting that food prices will remain subject to
upside risks over the medium term.

Growth indicators have recently been developed
that utilize a wide range of economic data. This
appendix discusses the methodology underlying the
growth indicators and provides some details on the
data used to compute the indicator for each country. Also discussed is how well the growth indicators
fit the past behavior of quarterly real GDP growth
and how well they forecast relative to a simple timeseries benchmark.
The colors in the growth tracker heat map (Figure
1.23) are based on the behavior of the new growth
indicators over time. Figure 1.24 shows a stylized
example of how to interpret what each color in the
heat map means: orange indicates growth below
trend and falling; red and pink indicate contraction
at increasing and moderating rates, respectively; the
two lightest shades of blue represent rising growth
rates, with the lightest blue indicating that growth is
below potential; and the darkest blue indicates that
growth is moderating but remains above potential.
As background, it is important to understand
that economic data are often very noisy and available only with a substantial lag. Determining the
underlying state of an economy is thus very difficult
in practice, requiring a mix of information gleaned

from economic and statistical models and, perhaps
most important, economic judgment. Against this
backdrop, the growth indicators should be viewed
as a useful addition to the toolkit for assessing the
current state of economic activity.

The Dynamic Factor Model
The growth indicators are estimated using a
dynamic factor model (DFM).29 The DFM is
particularly useful in this context, because it can
utilize a large number of economic time series in a
timely fashion and can produce reasonable shortterm forecasts.
The DFM assumes that real GDP growth yt can
be decomposed into a common component ct and
an idiosyncratic component et.The common component captures the bulk of the covariation between
growth and a wide range of economic indicators,
while the idiosyncratic component is assumed
mainly to affect only growth:

Note: The growth trackers are constructed using a large number of daily, monthly,
and quarterly indicators and a dynamic factor model that incorporates all available
data. The trackers are estimated and forecast at a monthly frequency. The
classifications represented in the table are based on the behavior of a centered
seven-month moving average. The most recent estimates implicitly include forecasts
and can change with the arrival of more data. The trend is the growth rate of potential
output in the WEO projections. Within regions, countries are listed by economic size.

where m is a constant and ct = ΛFt, with
Ft = (F1t, . . . , Frt ) ′ and Λ = (l1, . . . , lr ). The
common component is thus related to growth
through a linear combination of a small handful of
r common factors Ft. The common factors themselves are, in turn, estimated using information
from a potentially large set of economic indicators.
For each country, it is the common component of
growth that is used as the growth indicator.
The dynamics of the common factors are captured by the following vector autoregressive process:
p

Ft = ∑ biFt–i + Bnt, where nt ~ N(0, Iq), (A.1.2.2)
i=1

where the bis are r × r matrices, p is the lag length
of the process, B is an r × q matrix, and q is the
number of underlying common shocks driving the
economy. The number of static factors r is generally assumed to be large relative to the number of
common shocks in order to capture the dynamic
relationships in the economy. See Giannone, Reich29See Giannone, Reichlin, and Small (2008); Matheson (2010,
forthcoming); and Liu, Romeu, and Matheson (forthcoming).

lin, and Sala (2005) for the detailed assumptions
underlying the model.
For the growth indicators, the number of common factors r is chosen for each country and at
each point in time using a simple rule that aims to
avoid overfitting: the number of factors is chosen to
minimize Schwarz’s Bayesian information criterion
(SBC) in regressions of quarterly real GDP growth
on the common factors. The number of common
shocks q is then chosen using information criteria
described in Bai and Ng (2007). The number of
lags of the factors p included in the model is determined using the SBC.
One of the key advantages of this framework is
that common components of growth can be estimated when some indicators have missing values at
the end of the sample due to publication lags. This
allows all available information to be utilized in a
timely fashion.

Data Selection
Data selection is a crucial step in developing the
indicators. Choosing series that are too focused on
particular sectors of the economy will bias the estimates, reducing the effectiveness of the DFM in
estimating the underlying factors driving growth.
For each country, close attention has been paid
to choosing data from a broad cross section of the
economy. Given poor data quality, particularly for
some emerging economies, a multistep procedure
has been employed to clean from data of outliers
and missing observations. The vast majority of the
series are measured at a monthly frequency, with
the remaining series measured at daily and quarterly
frequencies. All series are converted to a monthly
frequency, and where required, they have been
transformed to be devoid of long-term trends (nonstationarity) prior to estimation of the DFM.30
Broadly speaking, the data were chosen to cover
the following categories (with representative types
of data listed):

1R2 between quarterly real GDP growth and the dynamic factor model (DFM) estimate of the common component of growth over the entire sample. “Forecasts Begin” is the beginning of
the out-of-sample evaluation period. Relative root mean square error (RMSE) is the RMSE in forecasting the next quarterly real GDP release relative to the RMSE from an autoregressive (AR)
model. The DFM forecasts are made with the data that would have been available at the beginning of the third month of each quarter.

•• Activity (surveys)—purchasing managers indices,
consumer and business confidence indicators;
•• Activity (hard data)—retail sales, industrial
production;
•• Trade—exports, imports, exchange rates;
•• Financial conditions—interest rates, equity
prices, credit conditions;
•• Employment and income—employment, wages;
and
•• Prices and costs—producer price and consumer
price indices, inflation expectations.
Some information about the series used and
their classifications can be found in Table 1.3. For
most of the advanced economies, the sample period
begins in 1994; the samples for many of the emerging market economies begin later due to a lack of
58

available data and the presence of structural breaks.
The number of series used also varies across countries depending on available data, ranging from 97
series for Kazakhstan to 290 for Sweden.

Evaluating the Growth Indicators
To get an idea of the quality of the growth
indicators in describing the past behavior of real
quarterly GDP growth, the percentage of the variance of growth explained by the indicators, R2,
was computed. These statistics are displayed in
Table 1.3. The indicators generally explain a sizable
portion of growth for the majority of countries,
particularly for advanced economies. Because the
growth indicators are estimates of the underlying,

chapter 1

pervasive component of growth, their explanatory
power tends not to be as great for emerging economies, where growth tends to be more volatile and
subject to larger idiosyncratic shocks.
Assessing the underlying state of the economy
is contingent on the behavior of the data at hand
and the model used to analyze the data. As such, to
the extent new data differ from previous estimates
produced by the indicators, they can be revised over
both the historical period and the forecast period.
This may cause the indicators to produce some false
signals in real time. Thus, to evaluate how well the
indicators perform in real time, a simulated realtime forecasting experiment was conducted.
Specifically, over a forecast evaluation period,
the indicators were estimated once every quarter
using all data that would have been available at the
beginning of the third month of each quarter.31
Using the latest available data for real quarterly
GDP growth as the target for the forecasts, root
mean squared errors (RMSEs) for the indicators
in predicting the next observation of quarterly real
GDP growth were computed. For the purposes
of comparison, RMSEs for simple autoregressive
(AR) models are also calculated.32 The ratios of the
RMSEs of the growth indicators relative to those
of the AR model are displayed in Table 1.3, where
ratios less than 1 show that the growth indicator
outperforms the AR model.
For almost all countries, the growth indicators
outperform the AR in forecasting, with India and
Australia the only exceptions. The relatively good
forecasting performance of the growth indicators is
confirmed in Matheson (2010), who uses comparisons with forecasts from a range of more sophisticated models than reported here.

Country and Regional Perspectives

As discussed in Chapter 1, the global recovery is
­continuing, but its strength is not yet assured.
­Economic prospects remain uneven across countries and
regions (Figure 2.1). In general, the pace of recovery
is expected to be faster in economies that had stronger
fundamentals before the crisis, smaller output losses
during it, and now have more room for policy maneuver and deep links with fast-growing trading partners.1
China’s increasingly wide trading network is driving
growth prospects in numerous economies, especially
commodity exporters. Strong internal dynamics are
supporting near-term growth in other emerging economies, too. However, economic prospects are subdued
in major advanced economies, where much-needed
policy adjustments have only just begun—in the form
of financial sector repair and reform and medium1See Chapter 2 of the April 2010 World Economic Outlook and
IMF (2010a).

term fiscal consolidation. This will weigh on growth in
emerging economies, raising the need to boost domestic sources of demand. At the same time, capital will
continue to flow toward strong emerging and developing economies, induced by relatively good growth
prospects and favorable interest rate differentials.
This chapter begins with Asia, which is leading the
global recovery. Then it turns to North America, where
there is renewed concern that the recovery may be stalling,
with significant implications for the rest of the world.
Next, the chapter reviews Europe’s economic and policy
challenges, which in many ways mirror those at the
global level: the need for demand rebalancing within the
region, financial sector repair, and medium-term fiscal
consolidation. It then outlines the wide range of developments and prospects in Latin America and the Caribbean
(LAC), the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),
the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and subSaharan Africa.

Asia Is Advancing with Resilience
Asia entered the global crisis on a strong footing and is continuing to lead the global recovery
(Figure 2.2). In most parts of the region, resilience in domestic demand—thanks in part to proactive policy stimulus—has offset the drag from
net exports (Figure 2.3). The handoff from publicsector-driven to private-sector-driven growth is
well under way in most Asian countries. Industrial
production and retail sales have been strong in
China and India, among others. Robust activity
in these countries in turn is helping power growth
in the rest of Asia. In fact, China’s strong and
sustained growth over the past several years has
served as a linchpin for global trade, benefiting
exporters of commodities (for example, Australia,
Indonesia, New Zealand) and capital goods (for
example, Germany, Japan, some NIEs).2,3 More2Newly

industrialized Asian economies comprise Hong Kong
SAR, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan Province of China.
3While China continues to be an important conduit in Asia’s
global supply chain, the much faster pace of increase in emerging

over, unlike in previous recoveries, a turnaround
in private capital inflows has bolstered domestic
demand by providing access to external financing.
The region is projected to grow by about 7.9 percent in 2010 and 6.7 percent in 2011 (Table 2.1).
Activity is projected to moderate from the second
half of 2010 and in 2011 in line with the winding
down of policy stimulus and policy tightening
in economies facing demand pressures, as well as
downdrafts from policy adjustments in advanced
economies.
Near-term growth performance will vary across
countries because of differences related to the
strength of stimulus and private demand along
with underlying economic and financial conditions
and risks. Thus, a massive fiscal stimulus and credit
expansion has boosted domestic demand in China.
In India, low reliance on exports, accommodative
Asia’s exports to China in recent years—relative to China’s own
exports to advanced economies—points to the rising strength of
China’s final domestic demand in driving its imports from the
rest of Asia (see Figure 2.3 and the April 2010 Regional Economic
Outlook: Asia and Pacific).

policies, and strong capital inflows have supported
domestic activity and growth. In contrast, Japan’s
economic prospects remain weak, given lackluster
domestic demand and a lack of fiscal room to further
boost the economy. Prospects are also weak for
economies at the lower end of the quality ladder in
manufacturing exports and for those where there is
macroeconomic and financial uncertainty (Vietnam).
The outlook for Pakistan has deteriorated significantly after the recent massive flooding. Countryspecific details are discussed further below:
•• In China, real GDP grew at 10.3 percent (year
over year) in the second quarter, compared
with 11.9 percent in the first quarter. Sustained
growth in retail sales and industrial production
confirms that private sector activity has advanced
beyond the lift from government stimulus. Overall, growth is projected to average 10.5 percent in
2010 and 9.6 percent in 2011, driven by domestic demand. The slight moderation in recent
activity is expected to continue through 2011
in light of tighter quanitative limits on credit
growth, measures to cool off the property market
and limit bank exposure to this, and the planned
unwinding of fiscal stimulus in 2011. On average
over 2010–11, private domestic demand is poised
to contribute two-thirds of near-term growth,
and government activity about one-third, whereas
the contribution from net exports will be close to
zero. Notwithstanding the robustness in domestic demand, the pickup in inflation in 2010
reflected mainly higher food prices rather than
core inflation.
•• India’s macroeconomic performance has also
been vigorous, with industrial production
at a two-year high. Leading indicators—the
­production manufacturing index and measures of
business and consumer confidence—continue to
point up. Growth is projected at 9.7 percent in
2010 and 8.4 percent in 2011, led increasingly
by domestic demand. Robust corporate profits
and favorable external financing will encourage
investment. Recent activity (10 percent year-overyear growth in real GDP at market prices in the
second quarter) was driven largely by investment,
and the contribution from net exports is projected to turn negative in 2011, as the strength

Country and Regional Perspectives

Figure 2.3. Asia: Leading the Global Recovery1
Economic activity has bounced back because of domestic demand and
rebounding exports. Robust import demand from China—particularly in
commodities, machinery, and capital goods—has supported activity in both
emerging and advanced Asia. The region is attracting capital inflows, which,
while providing easy access to financing, has posed some macroeconomic policy
challenges (see Box 2.1).

in investment further boosts imports. The rapid
pace of domestic activity, evidenced by rapidly
rising inflation, led the central bank to increase
the repo policy rate, in steps, by a cumulative
125 basis points.
•• In Japan, an export-led recovery since the second
quarter of 2009 strengthened in early 2010,
thanks to a stronger-than-anticipated recovery
in the Western advanced economies and rising
demand for capital goods from China. However,
sporadic appreciation of the yen (for example, in
May 2010, when financial volatility in Europe
triggered safe haven inflows) and the recent
cooling of the U.S. economy will continue to
affect exports. Although investment activity is
projected to pick up—sparked by export-oriented
businesses—the unwinding of fiscal stimulus and
the sluggish labor market are likely to weigh on
near-term growth. Real GDP growth is projected
at 2.8 percent in 2010 and 1.5 percent in 2011,

although output will remain below its potential

•• The rapid recovery in the NIEs has been
driven by a rebounding inventory cycle, strong
domestic activity, and robust regional demand
for these economies’ exports (electronics for
Singapore, services for Hong Kong SAR, capital
goods for Korea). Some NIE property markets
have been experiencing sizable price increases
(for example, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore),
which prompted use of macroprudential policies to prevent the emergence of an asset price
bubble. Inflation expectations are nevertheless
broadly stable.

chapter 2

The broad-based export rebound is now feeding
through an autonomous demand-driven recovery, particularly in private investment (although
investment activity is not yet fully under way
in Malaysia). In Vietnam, the macroeconomic
situation has recently stabilized after the 2009
stimulus measures, which had raised perceived
risk and triggered market uncertainty, were partly
reversed. Overall, near-term growth for the
region is projected to be underpinned both by
exports and domestic demand.
•• In the advanced economies of commodity producers, Australia and New Zealand, early in the year
policy stimulus and exports supported activity.
Stronger trade links with China have increased
these economies’ resilience to cyclical downturns
in traditional partners, such as the United States.
Notwithstanding impressive performance so far,
risks to near-term growth in emerging Asia are
tilted slightly to the downside, mainly because of
uncertainty in the external environment. Thus,
a slower recovery in the United States and the
euro area, a greater-than-anticipated slowdown in
China, or negative spillovers from unanticipated
financial shocks abroad could interrupt the pace
of recovery. These risks are somewhat offset by an
upside risk of even faster recovery in private sector
activity.
In advanced Asia, downside risks dominate as
well, but also reflect domestic vulnerability. These
risks include yen appreciation and worsening deflation in Japan; higher risk premiums, given high
external debt in New Zealand; and, given assessed
mild overvaluation, a potential correction in house
prices that could hit household wealth and consumer confidence in Australia and New Zealand.
Looking beyond the crisis, Asia’s medium-term
prospects depend on how successfully it is able to
rebalance the drivers of growth—with greater reliance on domestic sources compared with external
demand. Such a rebalancing in China is critical
to enhance the role of household consumption in
domestic growth. To the extent that a stronger Chinese currency eases this process, other surplus countries in the region could follow suit, which would
facilitate the needed shift toward domestic sources
of growth. However, in addition to China, the

Country and Regional Perspectives

entire region will need to adopt some combination
of the following policies to support durable domestic demand: appropriate appreciation of the currency to enhance domestic income and purchasing
power, removal of structural bottlenecks to domestic
investment or consumption or both, and boosts to
productivity in the nontradables or service sector.5
In addition, the macroeconomic and structural
policy mix to address near-term challenges must—to
the extent possible—be conducive to meeting the
region’s medium-term rebalancing needs.
Against this backdrop, fiscal policy—in particular
the unwinding of stimulus—needs to be carefully
calibrated to strike a balance between supporting
a self-sustained recovery in private activity over
the near and medium term and avoiding fiscal risk
or overheating pressure. Therefore, fiscal withdrawal would be appropriate under the baseline
projections, provided a private demand recovery is
robustly established. Some postponement of consolidation may be needed, where there is fiscal room
to do so, should external downside risks to growth
materialize. In addition, some economies could
reorient the composition of fiscal spending within
the available fiscal envelope to further support the
role of domestic demand in growth (for example,
measures to encourage consumption in China and
to improve the quality of infrastructure services
in Indonesia). In contrast, consolidation should
be a priority where fiscal risks are building (India,
Malaysia, Philippines). In Japan, decisive fiscal
consolidation is unavoidable, given the high level of
public debt and anticipated fiscal needs related to
the aging population. Consolidation should focus
on entitlement spending and comprehensive tax
reform. New Zealand’s high external debt also calls
for greater fiscal prudence.
Monetary policy needs to be responsive to the
domestic cycle—that is, prospects for inflation,
which are influenced by the degree of economic
slack. Most economies in the region have already
resumed rate hikes (Australia, India, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand), tightened liquidity
management (reimposition of quantitative limits

exchange rate target by Singapore). The overall
monetary stance, however, is still largely accommodative or neutral. Thus, economies that are
beginning to face inflation pressure should further
tighten monetary policy. If domestic overheating is
influenced by strong capital flows, monetary tightening should be accompanied by currency appreciation to help offset inflation pressure, discourage
speculative inflows, and support medium-term
rebalancing. Conversely, if private demand is not
yet fully established and in the absence of inflation
pressure, monetary policy would need to remain
accommodative to help jump-start private activity.
Finally, if broad-based downside risks to growth
begin to materialize, most Asian economies can use
the available monetary room to support economic
activity.
With the return of normal financial sector
conditions, the time is also ripe for unwinding
special support measures introduced during the
crisis. Some countries have already started (for
example, removal of guarantees on banks’ wholesale
funding in Australia and New Zealand, unwinding
of the previously expanded central bank liquidity/
rediscount window in Hong Kong SAR and Philippines). Others are tightening regulatory measures
further to enhance financial system stability. Policymakers in New Zealand introduced a new liquidity
policy, including a core funding ratio to improve
bank liquidity and reduce banks’ dependence on
short-term funding. In China, prudential regulations were introduced to reduce banks’ exposure to
potentially risky property loans, and other direct
measures were deployed to cool the property market
(for example, increased minimum down payments,
lower loan-to-value ratios, higher mortgage rates for
second homes). The banking system thus appears
well positioned to absorb moderate potential losses
(see the October 2010 issue of the Global Financial
Stability Report—GFSR). Similarly, policymakers
in Hong Kong SAR took measures to address risks
of property price inflation. These include maximum loan-to-value ratios on high-end properties

66

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

and higher stamp duties on property sales, among
others. Hong Kong SAR, Malaysia, and Singapore
are employing a coordinated approach to withdraw
blanket guarantees on banks’ wholesale deposits.
The recent resurgence in capital inflows to
emerging Asia, after a temporary stop during the
global crisis in 2008, has raised potential policy
challenges. On the one hand, capital flows have
helped support domestic demand. On the other
hand, the size of global inflows relative to the
comparatively small financial markets has raised
or intensified existing concerns, including the risk
of inflation, asset price bubbles, financial sector
instability (if inflows are not properly intermediated), excessive appreciation, and risks associated with a sudden stop of capital flows. Given
wide variation in capital account openness across
economies and across alternative types of investment within the same economy, it is possible that
some economies may receive more capital inflows
than they can ­efficiently ­intermediate. Alternatively,
capital controls in one sector (for example, foreign
direct investment—FDI) may be inducing excessive
inflows into others (for example, portfolio, equity).
Economies have been implementing a range
of measures to deal with their varied situations
(Box 2.1). The measures generally address potential financial stability concerns and do not impose
wholesale restraint on capital inflows. At the
same time, it is not clear how much these policy
responses will deliver. A few issues stand out:6
•• Macroprudential measures should focus primarily on financial stability and should not be used
to postpone needed macroeconomic adjustment.
Thus, where large current account imbalances
may reflect an undervalued exchange rate,
currency appreciation is the best response to
capital inflows. Conversely, if the exchange rate
is broadly at its medium-term equilibrium level,
but reserves are assessed to be insufficient, capital
inflows should be used to build up reserves.
Many economies in emerging Asia are among the
largest reserve holders, and so they do not fall
into this category.

Country and Regional Perspectives

Box 2.1. Emerging Asia: Responding to Capital Inflows
Emerging Asia is experiencing a revival in capital
inflows. Total inflows to the region over the past
four quarters more than quadrupled relative to
2008 levels (figure), although in many cases, net
inflows are negative or dwarfed by large current
account surpluses. Many economies are responding to balance of payments surpluses largely
through reserve accumulation rather than currency
appreciation. In addition, some economies have
preemptively adopted a variety of macroprudential
measures to address potential financial stability
issues and/or discourage speculative inflows:
•• Preventing asset price bubbles—setting maximum loan-to-value ratios, increased provisioning
vis-à-vis real estate credit, and taking other measures specifically targeting the real estate market
(Hong Kong SAR, India, Korea, Singapore).
•• Tightening liquidity control and management—
taking measures to prevent excessive volatility of
capital flows (for example, a one-month holding
period for central bank certificates for both
resident and nonresident investors in Indonesia);
raising required reserves for banks (India).
•• Limiting banks’ foreign exchange exposure—setting prudential limits on banks’ forward open
position limits and net open positions (Korea).
•• Tightening financial supervision—tightening
prudential limits on capital, liquidity, and leverage; enhanced stress testing; enhanced corporate
governance (Hong Kong SAR, Singapore).
•• Capital controls on inflows—preventing nonresidents from opening short-term time deposit

•• Greater exchange rate flexibility can reinforce
macroprudential measures. For example, twoway exchange rate flexibility can increase the
perception of exchange rate risk and discourage
speculative capital inflows. This is especially
important for economies with excessive external
surpluses, where relatively sizable appreciation—apart from narrowing the current account
imbalance—would increase the perception of
exchange rate risk and therefore deter speculative
capital inflows.

accounts (Taiwan Province of China); setting
limits on external borrowing operations (India).
•• Further liberalizing selected outflows (India,
Malaysia, Thailand).

•• Other macroeconomic policy options include a
more aggressive unwinding of fiscal stimulus or
even tightening—if inflows are concentrated in
government securities—to prevent vulnerability
to a sudden turnaround in investor sentiment or
a lowering of interest rates when inflation expectations are well grounded. However, given that
the adoption of fiscal policies that improve the
recipient economy’s macro fundamentals could
in fact result in stronger inflows to the private
sector, such policies on their own would not

world economic outlook: Recovery, Risk, and Rebalancing

necessarily reduce the need for greater exchange
rate flexibility.
•• If the financial sector is healthy, restrictions on
capital outflows can be eased to limit upward
pressure on the currency and alleviate concerns
about overvaluation or loss of external competitiveness. Furthermore, measures can be taken to
free up restrictions in key growth sectors, which
could help attract longer-term capital inflows (for
example, FDI).
The best response to capital inflows may be a
coordinated one, especially when they are driven
by global factors or have global implications.7
Thus, resistance to currency appreciation by one
economy could discourage others because of
competitiveness concerns. Alternatively, macroprudential measures by one economy could divert
flows to others in the region. A potential ratchet
effect could lead to reserve accumulation in emerging market economies—larger accumulation of
reserves by one could induce further ­accumulation
by ­others in the region if the level of reserves
is perceived as a proxy for the credibility of a
country’s policy framework (see Cheung and Qian,
2009). International coordination could alleviate
challenges of this nature.
Asia should also focus on various structural
reforms to accomplish its medium-term rebalancing objectives. Specific policy options include
implementing reforms to health care, education,
and pension systems to enhance the social safety
net (China); promoting investment by small and
medium-size enterprises (Japan); improving the
business climate (Philippines); increasing the
productivity of the nontradables or services sector
(China, Japan, Korea); facilitating further product and labor market flexibility and productivity
(China, Malaysia, some NIEs, Philippines); lowering corporate saving by realigning relative prices
for a range of inputs, including capital, land, water,
and energy (China); and further financial sector
development and capital market deepening (China,
India, Philippines, Thailand).

also IMF (2010b).

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

Many economies have already embarked on such
reforms. Apart from the recent resumption of a
managed floating exchange rate regime in China,
the government has launched a number of measures
to enhance the social safety net (IMF, 2010c). In
Korea, the government recently announced plans
to further develop the service industry, including
through streamlined regulation and greater competition. Singapore’s recent budget contains measures
to enhance labor productivity. However, the time
needed for these measures to be effective, and the
slower pace of adjustment in advanced economies
(anticipated in light of the shorter-term economic
challenges they face), suggest that the period over
which global imbalances may eventually narrow will
be protracted.

The U.S. Recovery Is Moderating in the Face
of Debt and Continued Uncertainty
The U.S. economy is recovering, thanks to
unprecedented macroeconomic policy stimulus,
emergency financial stabilization measures, and a
modest cyclical upswing. But the rate of expansion
is beginning to moderate. The economy grew at an
annualized rate of 1.7 percent in the three months
to June, a slower pace than the 3.7 percent growth
rate posted in the first quarter. Moreover, highfrequency indicators suggest a weak recovery in
coming quarters.
Much of the weakness of this recovery is due to
sluggish personal consumption—by far the biggest
component of U.S. GDP. There are several reasons
for this weakness. First, household net worth has
deteriorated sharply (Figure 2.4). House prices
have fallen by 25 to 30 percent over the past three
years (depending on which index is used), with
the brunt of the adjustment falling on households that have the highest marginal propensity
to consume. Second, unemployment is high: it is
currently 9.6 percent of the workforce; a broader
measure of unemployment (which takes into
account those seeking full-time jobs but finding
only part-time work) is 16.7 percent; and the
median duration of unemployment, 20 weeks,
is nearly twice the peak level of the previous 40

chapter 2

years. A weak labor market hits incomes and the
ability to obtain credit, and it raises job uncertainty for those currently employed. Third, banks
are still reluctant to lend to consumers, restricting credit for larger purchases, as they struggle
to reduce leverage and restore balance sheets.
Overall, given the unusually low savings levels
before the crisis and the steep decline in personal
net worth since, the desire to save is more likely
to stay elevated relative to precrisis levels. The personal saving rate since the beginning of 2009 has
averaged 6 percent—a level last seen in 1995—
and is projected to remain at about 4 to 6 percent
through 2015.
In contrast to private consumption, ­private
investment in software and equipment has
rebounded strongly. Firms have also increased productivity, and unit labor costs have declined sharply.
In the near term, fixed investment is likely to be the
principal driver of domestic demand as inventory
accumulation slows. The current account deficit is
projected to remain at about 3.3 percent of GDP
over the medium term—much lower than during the years leading up to the crisis—because the
recovery in investment will be financed by strong
private saving and improving fiscal balances.
The most likely prospect for the U.S. economy
is for a continued but slow recovery, with growth
far weaker than in previous recoveries, considering
the depth of the recession. GDP growth is projected to be 2.6 percent in 2010 and 2.3 percent
in 2011 (Table 2.2; Figure 2.5). This implies that
the gap between actual and potential output will
remain wide, even though potential growth has
itself suffered temporarily from the crisis. The
unemployment rate is therefore expected to remain
stubbornly high. Against this backdrop, inflation
will remain low—it is projected to be 1.4 percent in
2010 and 1 percent in 2011.
Risks to the outlook remain elevated and are
tilted to the downside. Residential and commercial
real estate markets are still fragile. Further loan
write-downs at small and medium-size banks could
inhibit recovery of normal credit conditions. The
sharp rise in government debt has increased vulnerability to financial market sentiment, although

Country and Regional Perspectives

Figure 2.4. United States and Canada: Differing
Fortunes
The pace of recovery in the United States has moderated. Consumers face
headwinds of high debt and fallen asset values; weak credit growth, despite
extraordinarily loose monetary conditions; and persistently high unemployment.
Personal saving rates will remain higher than precrisis levels for a sustained
period, and public fiscal balances are projected to deteriorate further. By contrast,
the Canadian economy is less hampered by the same factors and is set to recover
more strongly.

world economic outlook: Recovery, Risk, and Rebalancing

Treasury security yields have fallen significantly
recently amid economic weakness, flight to quality,
and expectations of additional government bond
purchases by the Federal Reserve (Fed). Easing
consumer price inflation, together with weak labor
markets and relatively low consumption demand,
points to a tail risk of deflation. On the upside,
it is possible that business fixed investment could
rebound faster from still-depressed levels.
Against this backdrop, U.S. authorities will need
to find a way to exit from extraordinary policy
intervention without undermining the fledgling
recovery, while dealing with the long-term legacies
of fiscal imbalances, gaps and overlaps in financial
regulation, and a weakened banking sector.
•• A key macroeconomic challenge is to ensure
that the public debt is put on a sustainable
path without jeopardizing the recovery. Under
current policies, the general government deficit
is projected to be about 10 percent of GDP in
both 2010 and 2011, and gross general government debt will increase to about 110 percent
of GDP by 2015. Given the risks posed by
budgetary imbalances, the groundwork for
fiscal consolidation must begin in 2011. The
proposed fiscal tightening of about 1 percent
of GDP in 2011 implied by the administration’s mid-session review strikes the right balance
between near-term support for the recovery

and medium-term credibility. If downside risks
to growth materialize, there is some room to
reduce up-front adjustment while strengthening
medium-term credibility. This could be achieved
by further entitlement spending reforms, which
would have little immediate impact on demand.
However, the existing fiscal plans do not stabilize
medium-term debt, which should be put firmly
on a downward path to rebuild room for fiscal
maneuver and avoid negative effects on lending rates and long-term growth. Hence, a clear
commitment to additional consolidation measures under credible economic assumptions (by
enshrining targets and/or measures in legislation,
for example) would be desirable. In this context,
the President’s Fiscal Commission is expected to
play a key role in fostering political consensus,
including in difficult areas such as tax policy and
entitlement spending.
•• Monetary policy should remain accommodative
because of muted inflation, subpar growth, and
lingering financial strain. The Fed has maintained
the policy rate at a record low while signaling
that conditions are likely to warrant keeping the
rate at exceptionally low levels for an extended
period. In light of larger downside risks, the
Fed’s recent decision to resume its purchases
of government securities (using resources from
maturing government-sponsored-enterprise debt

and mortgage-backed securities in its portfolio) is
appropriate. In the event that such risks materialize, policy responses could include a strengthened
commitment to maintaining the ultra-low policy
rate for an extended period, expanding asset purchases, and relaunching facilities to aid stressed
markets. Meanwhile, the Fed has been developing
a well-diversified toolkit for managing monetary
conditions, which will help facilitate monetary
exit when needed.
•• Notwithstanding considerable efforts to improve
financial stability, the banking system remains
vulnerable. Capital will probably need to be
raised to meet higher regulatory requirements.
The newly enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act expands

oversight of systemically important financial
firms. It establishes a special resolution authority,
with the aim of facilitating orderly intervention
procedures for systemically important nonbank
financial institutions. It increases regulation of
over-the-counter derivatives markets and establishes the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. The legislation also authorizes the Financial
Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which
encompasses all the major financial supervisory
bodies at the federal level and is chaired by the
Treasury secretary. The FSOC is authorized
to (1) recommend higher prudential requirements; (2) designate financial firms, activities, or
market utilities as systemically important; and
(3) approve the breakup of large and complex

companies if financial stability is threatened.
However, the specifics will need to be worked
out before it will be clear how the legislation will
be implemented in practice, especially concerning
the setting of new prudential norms, the crossborder implementation of resolution procedures,
and the functioning of the FSOC.
Policy choices in the United States matter greatly
for the rest of the world. The huge prospective
funding requirements of the government may have
implications for other economies. To the extent that
10-year Treasury bonds set a benchmark for other
assets, market nervousness about the fiscal position
of the United States could cause an international
increase in interest rates. In addition, because of
the U.S. dollar’s role as a reserve currency and the
importance of the United States as a financial center, policy inaction by the U.S. authorities would
have far greater effects on other economies than
that implied by trade linkages alone. Shocks to confidence in the United States could cause an international increase in bond and equity risk premiums.
The Canadian economy has been relatively buoyant. Household balance sheets are healthier than
in the United States, and banks have very solid
books. Monetary and fiscal stimulus and strong
international demand for commodities helped boost
the growth rate in the first quarter of this year to
5.8 percent, double that of the United States, with
consumer spending especially robust. House prices
held up relatively well during the crisis. The unemployment rate, at 8.1 percent, is well below that in
the United States and has been declining steadily
since early 2009. However, recent data indicate a
moderation in growth, which nonetheless seems
to remain above potential. Risks to the Canadian
economy are mainly external. The economy is vulnerable to a dip in commodity prices, particularly
for minerals and energy, and a slowdown in the
U.S. economy, which buys about three-quarters of
its exports.
Improving conditions have allowed policymakers
in Canada to start unwinding policy stimulus. The
Bank of Canada has already raised the overnight
rate from 0.25 percent, where it had been since
the crisis, to 1 percent as of September. The fiscal
stimulus package has been implemented as sched72

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

uled. Should conditions worsen unexpectedly, fiscal
policy would be able to respond—the Canadian
fiscal deficit is projected to be 2.9 percent of GDP
in 2011, with net public debt hovering around
33.5 percent of GDP.

Europe Is Facing a Gradual and Uneven
Recovery
In Europe, the road to recovery has been bumpy.
Largely caused by unsustainable policies in some
member countries, the sovereign debt crisis in the
spring erupted before the euro area’s recovery could
gain traction. The crisis spread internationally,
threatening the financial system as well as regional
and global recovery. A strong and far-reaching
policy response contained the situation. Unprecedented liquidity and credit support, new European
financing instruments, and substantial fiscal action
in affected countries arrested the financial turmoil,
moderating its adverse impact on Europe’s economic activity.
The recovery has finally gained some vigor, but
it is still likely to be moderate and uneven (Figures
2.6 and 2.7). Advanced Europe’s GDP is projected
to grow at 1.7 percent in 2010 and 1.6 percent
in 2011 (Table 2.3). Emerging Europe’s growth is
expected to be 3.7 percent in 2010 and 3.1 percent
in 2011. There are pronounced differences in
economic prospects across the region, depending on
the condition of public and private sector balance
sheets and the extent to which macroeconomic policies can support the recovery.
•• Despite robust manufacturing exports in recent
months, moderate recovery is expected in Germany because weak growth is expected among its
trading partners. In France, growth is projected
to be modest, as private consumption is weakened by high unemployment and the withdrawal
of stimulus measures. In Italy, the recovery is
expected to be even more subdued, as a persistent competitiveness problem limits the scope
for export growth, and planned fiscal consolidation weakens private demand. Constrained by
fiscal and competitiveness imbalances, growth in
Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain is projected
to be much lower. Outside the euro area, the

prospects for recovery are similarly diverse. In the
United Kingdom, domestic demand is expected
to remain relatively subdued, particularly following the recent measures to cut the budget deficit.
•• In emerging Europe, growth in economies that
experienced the mildest downturns (Poland), and
others that faced the crisis with relatively strong
household and bank balance sheets (Turkey), is
projected to continue gaining strength, helped
by the normalization of global trade and capital flows. However, those that had experienced
unsustainable domestic booms (Bulgaria, Latvia)

or have vulnerable private or public sector balance sheets (Hungary, Romania) are expected to
recover more slowly. These problems have tightly
constrained the room for policy maneuver.
Risks to the outlook have become more balanced.
Although downside risks continue to threaten
Europe’s recovery, some upside risks have recently
emerged. The main upside risk comes from higherthan-expected real activity in Germany, which could
lift growth in Europe more generally, given the
country’s substantial trade and production linkages.
Nevertheless, downside risks still loom large. In the

Figure 2.7. Europe: A Gradual and Uneven
Recovery
The recovery is gradually taking hold, but domestic demand is expected to
remain sluggish, especially in advanced Europe. Fiscal consolidation plans across
Europe are rightfully differentiated: economies facing market pressure or external
financing constraints have larger and more front-loaded adjustments than those
with more manageable debt dynamics. Economic prospects are closely
connected via cross-border bank flows and trade linkages, especially with
Germany.

systems are still heavily reliant on government support and are highly vulnerable to deterioration in
the real economy, sovereign shocks, and funding
strains. Hence, if unaddressed, renewed financial
sector stress could spread—including to emerging
Europe via trade and cross-border bank flows—and
could have significant adverse effects on real activity.
In the medium term, the main risk is that fiscal and
competitiveness imbalances in peripheral economies
and insufficient action to tackle weak banks could
lead to a protracted period of subpar growth and
occasional crises.
Against this backdrop, the overarching policy
challenge is to use the window of opportunity
afforded by the unprecedented policy support to
address underlying problems through national and
EU-level action.
Establishing public debt sustainability remains a
top priority for many European economies. Across
Europe, current fiscal consolidation plans are going
in the right direction. They are rightfully differentiated—economies facing market pressure or severe
external financing constraints (for example, Greece,
Iceland, Ireland, Portugal, Spain) have larger and
more front-loaded adjustments than others. Nevertheless, given the considerable near-term easing
in Germany, the overall fiscal stance in the euro
area will remain broadly neutral in 2010—as is
appropriate, given the still-fragile recovery. Plans
for medium-term fiscal adjustment, however, need
to be strengthened considerably to deliver permanent savings in the face of looming age-related
spending. Ambitious entitlement spending reforms
would deliver large credibility gains at a lesser cost
in terms of short-term growth; they would also
forestall a need for more painful reforms in the
future. Some economies have taken steps in that
direction (for example, France, Italy), but more
could be done. Key items will be raising the retirement age to reflect increased life expectancy, more
efficient health care spending, and reform of social
security funding that reduces distortions to the
labor supply.

Monetary policy should remain very supportive for the foreseeable future in most European
economies. In advanced Europe, inflation remains
low because output gaps are large, and inflation
expectations are well anchored. Core inflation is
projected to remain at about 1½ percent in the
euro area. Thus, in the euro area, it is appropriate
to keep interest rates exceptionally low, and, given

continued financial strain, to very gradually unwind
nonstandard support measures and collateralrequirement changes. This will help support the
recovery by dampening the adverse short-term
effects of fiscal consolidation on domestic demand.
If downside risks to growth materialize, central
banks in advanced Europe may need to again rely
more strongly on their balance sheets to further ease

monetary conditions. In emerging Europe, inflation prospects are a bit mixed—reflecting different exchange rate regimes and varying degrees of
economic slack—but are generally contained. In
some economies, value-added tax hikes are likely to
temporarily drive up inflation (for example, Poland,
Romania).
The resilience of Europe’s financial sector must
be improved and its stability secured. Resolving
banking sector issues is essential to spur lending,
which is very important to firms’ external funding.
As discussed in the October 2010 GFSR, however, European banks continue to face challenges.
These include heavy reliance on European Central
Bank financing facilities—or on government support—and large exposure to risky sovereign debt.
The stress tests conducted by the Committee of
European Banking Supervisors have been helpful
in improving disclosure regarding banks’ condition. These tests also provide a useful guide to the
need to recapitalize, restructure, or resolve vulnerable banks. In this respect, some economies (for
example, Ireland, Spain) have made more progress
than others (for example, Germany) in tackling
weak banks. Nonetheless, as discussed in the GFSR,
an adverse funding scenario could have a significant
impact on the European banking system. To cope
with the looming wall of maturing bank debt, some
blanket financial support measures may need to be
extended, but not at the cost of postponing muchneeded restructuring. Meanwhile, it will be important to resolve uncertainty about regulatory reforms,
which would help increase banks’ ­willingness to
supply credit and support the recovery. Invigorating credit is also a challenge in emerging Europe,
particularly given the deterioration in bank credit
portfolios during the crisis.
Another crucial task ahead is the reform of EU
policy frameworks. The cross-border dimension of
many issues argues for a stronger role at the EU
level. The crisis exposed long-standing problems in
existing fiscal, structural, and financial stability policies. Such weaknesses need to be addressed in order
to ensure Europe’s future stability and growth.
A key challenge is the future of fiscal surveillance
and sovereign crisis management. An arrangement
along the lines of the European Stabilization Mech76

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

anism (ESM) is likely to prove useful, but sharing
fiscal burdens implies a need for shared responsibility for fiscal policy. This principle was recognized
with the adoption of the Stability and Growth Pact.
However, economies failed to live up to its letter
and spirit by not adjusting sufficiently during good
times. Thus, the Pact needs to be strengthened to
feature better incentives for preventing and resolving fiscal imbalances. It needs to encourage the
building up of sufficient buffers in good times,
establish credible procedures for the enforcement
of the common fiscal rules, and beef up centralized
crisis management capabilities—a gap now temporarily filled by the ESM and the larger European
Financial Stability Facility, the latter designed
specifically for euro area members.
In addition, the crisis has shown how financial sector problems in specific countries can very
quickly have pan-European consequences. Differences in prudential policies and practices across
countries encourage complex business structures,
regulatory arbitrage, and rent seeking, with deleterious consequences for Europe’s financial stability.
Supervisory or regulatory gaps have major spillovers. Hence, joint accountability and responsibility
for Europe’s common good of “financial stability”—
in the form of an integrated European financial
stability framework—are urgently needed. Such
a ­framework needs to be built on two pillars: (1)
integrated crisis management and resolution—for
example, through a European resolution authority—and (2) integrated supervision, to make burden
sharing acceptable. Both are necessary to achieve
a fully integrated, efficient, and stable market for
financial services. Steps in this direction are being
taken—for instance, the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board and discussions about a
more integrated resolution framework. Nevertheless,
considering the devastating consequences of the
crisis and the magnitude of the challenge, progress
is still very slow, hampered by narrow national
interests.
Last, a better structural policy framework is also
necessary to help improve competitiveness, address
macroeconomic imbalances, and boost growth.
The current policy agenda (Europe 2020) could
be improved in several ways. Specifically, surveil-

chapter 2

lance over structural bottlenecks, competitiveness,
and imbalances needs to become more binding. It
should also consider the fiscal and financial policy
challenges facing countries. To speed the process
of reform, priority should be given to a narrow
range of strategic objectives that have major crossborder implications. For instance, most Mediterranean economies need to address labor market
segmentation, inadequate wage flexibility, and
skill mismatches; upgrade education systems; and
foster capital deepening and innovation. In addition, reform to bankruptcy proceedings in these
economies will help facilitate firm turnover and
entrepreneurship. For all EU economies, further liberalization of product and service markets under the
Single Market program will strengthen the employment effects of labor market reform.

Latin America Is Sustaining Its Growth
Momentum
The LAC region is exiting the global crisis at a
faster pace than anticipated (Figures 2.8 and 2.9).
This reflects solid macroeconomic policy fundamentals, sizable policy support, favorable external financing conditions, and strong ­commodity
revenues. Robust commodity export revenues
have boosted domestic income, which along with
easy financing conditions has supported domestic demand. For many of these economies, the
­potential negative effect from subdued demand
for imports by the advanced economies will be
manageable, given lower reliance on external trade8
and greater dependence on commodity exports,
for which external demand is projected to remain
robust (see Chapter 1, Appendix 1.1). However,
Mexico, with its deep real and financial links to
the U.S. economy, and the commodity-importing
Central American and Caribbean regions, with their
dependence on tourism and remittance flows from
the United States, will be more vulnerable than others to weak U.S. economic conditions.
8For

instance, the share of exports plus imports in total
GDP—a very rough measure of openness—averaged less than 50
percent in the LA-5 (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru) in
the past five years (compared with more than 125 percent for the
ASEAN economies).

Country and Regional Perspectives

Growth in the region is projected to average 5.7
percent in 2010 and 4 percent in 2011 (Table 2.4).
Risks to the outlook emerge from both external
and domestic factors. External risks are tilted to the
downside, reflecting mainly a worse-than-anticipated recovery in advanced economies, with its negative spillovers on commodity prices. An additional
contagion channel arises from the large presence of
foreign banks in Latin America, although the fact
that these banks have relied primarily on subsidiaries funded by local deposits rather than cross-border
flows mitigates the risk. On the other side, there
are also risks of overheating, particularly if unwinding of earlier stimulus takes longer than currently
anticipated (see below).
Prospects within the LAC region are quite diverse
given the varying strength of macroeconomic policy
frameworks, the role of domestic demand, and different degrees of exposure to spillovers from global
trade and financial markets:
•• Impressive improvements in macroeconomic policy frameworks over the past two decades, combined with accommodative policies, easy external
financing conditions, and strong commodity
prices, are driving a robust recovery in the LA-4
(Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru). Despite the
expected dynamism in domestic demand, current
account balances are projected to deteriorate only
marginally in 2010 and 2011. High commodity
prices and continued vitality in Asia are expected
to sustain exports. Similarly, Uruguay, which
has made substantial progress in macroeconomic
policy management and faces a favorable external
environment, is expected to experience strong
growth dynamics in 2010–11.
•• Mexico is also staging a steady recovery, despite
the 2009 hard landing and the drag from the
U.S. economy. As in the LA-4, recovery has been
underpinned by strong policy frameworks in the
run-up to the crisis. However, Mexico’s outlook
arguably faces larger downside risks than that
of the LA-4. A weaker-than-projected recovery
in the U.S. economy would have important
implications for Mexico. Furthermore, with more
than 80 percent of domestic financial system
assets owned by systemic global banks, substantially higher capital charges arising from global

financial sector regulatory reform could affect
the availability of credit for the private sector in
Mexico.
•• The outlook for the rest of the LAC region is
somewhat mixed. Overall, the commodity

78

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

exporters will continue to benefit from the
strength in their terms of trade, growing links
with China, and strong intraregional linkages. Thus, ­Argentina and Paraguay are set to
experience high growth, supported in large part

chapter 2

by strong trade ties vis-à-vis Brazil and a sharp
rebound in agricultural production following
last year’s severe drought. Conversely, despite
high oil prices, ­Ecuador’s ­recovery will be muted
given supply-side constraints. Venezuela’s recession will continue in 2010, reflecting severe
supply bottlenecks, challenges from capital
flight, and generally weak policy frameworks.
Growth in most of the Caribbean countries
will be subdued amid weak prospects for tourism and remittances and limited room for
policy support in light of chronic public debt
burdens.9
LAC economies need to establish policies to
achieve strong and sustainable growth like Asia.
However, unlike Asia, medium-term policy priorities are not driven by rebalancing more toward
domestic demand (given relatively low reliance
on external trade, although the tourism-dependent Caribbean countries are notable exceptions)
but rather by a need to ensure that strong growth
does not give rise to balance sheet vulnerabilities in the private or public sector. Macroeconomic and prudential policies will need to be
designed to ensure that the recovery becomes well
entrenched and at the same time to contain the
risks of overheating and the buildup of fiscal and
financial sector risks.
Thus, the priority for the region is now to use
the window provided by the cyclical upswing to
start unwinding stimulus, regain room for policy
maneuver, and sustain its relatively recent track
record of strong macroeconomic policy management. In many economies the policy mix should
favor early withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus, while
allowing the withdrawal of monetary stimulus to
proceed at a slower pace. Fiscal tightening will help
address risks of inflation pressure (Peru, Uruguay)
and exchange rate overvaluation (Brazil), reduce
the generally high public debt and associated
vulnerability, and provide a cushion for future
contingencies. Moreover, given policy challenges
arising from strong and persistent capital inflows

A proactive crisis response and favorable terms of trade have driven Latin
America’s speedy recovery. Commodity exporters are also benefiting from
increasing demand from emerging Asia, particularly China. Capital inflows have
picked up sharply in some economies. Although inflows have boosted the
equities market, the recovery in private credit has remained sluggish.

in some economies, fiscal tools are likely better
options to deal with overheating pressures than
monetary tools. However, in Chile, fiscal stimulus
can be withdrawn only gradually in the context of
earthquake-related reconstruction spending, and
so tighter monetary conditions may be needed to
rein in inflation. For the rest of Latin America as
well, it is also critical to use the cyclical upswing to
rebuild fiscal room and avoid procyclical policies.
However, the pace of stimulus withdrawal could
be slowed if downside risks to growth were to
materialize, especially for countries with available
policy room.
With respect to the approach to capital inflows,
the focus among the LA-5 (LA-4 plus Mexico) has
appropriately been to deepen capital markets and
improve the supervisory and regulatory framework
to enable absorption of capital inflows without
endangering financial stability. Other priorities for
80

the region include structural reforms to improve
the investment climate, which would attract stable
FDI inflows and improve external competitiveness
(for example, streamlining business regulations,
upgrading infrastructure, labor and product market
reforms). However, these reforms will take time
to implement. In the meantime, economies have
begun to use a combination of macroeconomic and
macroprudential measures to address the challenges
posed by capital inflows (Box 2.2). Regarding the
use of capital controls, preliminary indications are
that they may have helped somewhat in changing
the composition of inflows but not the volume (see
the April and October 2010 issues of the GFSR).
In this context, the possible use of capital controls should be supported by other measures—for
example, continued two-way exchange rate flexibility to discourage speculative inflows, fiscal consolidation (where public debt is high and private sector

chapter 2

Country and Regional Perspectives

Box 2.2. Latin America-5: Riding Another Wave of Capital Inflows
After a brief hiatus during the height of the global
crisis in 2008, the LA-5 economies are experiencing a resurgence in capital inflows (figure). Strong
capital inflows have been a mixed blessing. On the
one hand, they have provided cheap and readily
available financing to boost domestic demand. On
the other hand, these flows have increased concern
about domestic overheating, external competitiveness (given considerable currency appreciation in
the context of exchange rates that are mostly at or
above their medium-term values), increased sterilization costs (with sizable interest rate differentials
vis-à-vis external rates), and heightened risks of a
potential boom-bust cycle—problems this region
has confronted in the past. The situation today raises
fewer financial stability concerns because domestic
credit is staging a relatively slow recovery. However,
capital inflows have induced booms in many equity
markets, and concerns about asset price bubbles have
been growing.
Against this backdrop, country authorities have
responded by adopting a number of measures to
safeguard financial sector stability, eliminate asset
price bubbles, and discourage inflows:
•• Financial sector supervision—all the LA-5 countries are at various stages of further enhancing
financial sector regulatory standards for capital
adequacy, liquidity, and asset quality.
•• Tighter liquidity control and management—
required reserves for banks have been raised
(Brazil).
•• Capital controls on inflows—These include a
direct tax on fixed income and equity inflows
(reintroduced in October 2009 by Brazil after
a brief break) and minimum-stay rules for FDI

monitoring and supervision.

The CIS Region Is Experiencing a Modest

region is benefiting from Russia’s gradual recuperation. Some economies in the region have already
experienced an increase in remittances from Russia.10
10Alturki, Espinosa-Bowen, and Ilahi (2009) find that Russia
appears to influence regional growth mainly through the remittance channel. In particular, a 10 percentage point increase in
growth of remittances from Russia is associated with a 0.3 percentage point GDP increase in growth in the CIS countries, with
a 0.4 percentage point increase in oil-importing CIS countries’
growth.

Real activity for the CIS region is expected to
grow at 4.3 percent in 2010 and 4.6 percent in
2011 (Table 2.5). As in other regions, prospects
vary considerably. Exposure to commodity prices,
the degree of integration with global financial
markets, the extent of policy support, and links
to Russia are factors that differ importantly across
economies.
•• In Russia, despite relatively high oil prices, the
near-term outlook is for a modest recovery.
Output growth is projected to reach 4 percent
in 2010 and 4.3 percent in 2011. Although the
current heat wave and related wildfires could
detract from near-term growth, and the ongoing rebound still depends on policy support, a
self-sustained consumption-led recovery should
gradually take hold. The adjustment of bank
balance sheets appears to have run its course, and
banks seem poised to cautiously expand lending.
82

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

Gradually rising real wages and lower unemployment should support consumption.
•• High commodity prices also benefit other
energy exporters in the region. Large-scale
investment and higher volumes of gas exports
are projected to boost growth in Turkmenistan
to 9.4 percent in 2010 and 11.5 percent in
2011. In Uzbekistan, real activity is expected
to expand by 8 percent in 2010 and 7 percent
in 2011. Kazakhstan is set for a slower recovery, due to lingering problems in its financial
system.
•• For energy importers as a group, growth is
projected to pick up to 4.6 percent in 2010 and
5 percent in 2011, reflecting the global recovery
and financial stability (for example, Ukraine).
Some of these economies (for example, Armenia, Moldova, Tajikistan) will benefit from the
rebound in remittances from Russia.

chapter 2

Overall, near-term risks to growth in the region
are broadly balanced. On the upside, more favorable
external developments—particularly higher commodity prices and a renewal of capital inflows—or
a more rapid recovery in credit could push growth
higher. The recently launched customs union among
Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia could enhance trade
and provide an additional boost to growth within the
union. On the downside, external shocks—adverse
changes in commodity prices or a shock to investor
confidence—present the key downside risks. With
some exceptions (for example, Kazakhstan), foreign
banks have a minor role in CIS economies. At the
same time, the region—and Russia in particular—
continues to be very vulnerable to volatility in capital
flows and global risk appetite. For instance, the euro
area crisis in May led to a fresh bout of volatility
in Russian stock markets and renewed downward
pressure on the ruble. A worse-than-expected growth
outcome in Russia would have second-round effects
throughout the region, mainly through remittances
and trade.
The fiscal challenges vary across the region. In
Russia, the task is to ensure that the large fiscal
stimulus (about 9 percent of GDP) is unwound
as the global economy gathers strength—in this
regard, a key concern is that some three-quarters
of the fiscal package entailed permanent measures
(for example, higher pension outlays). Given the
composition of government spending, reversing the
fiscal stimulus will be difficult without undertaking
significant public sector reforms that allow savings
in socially sensitive areas such as health care, social
protection, and pensions. Energy importers in the
region have limited fiscal room and are mostly
aiming for a neutral fiscal stance or modest fiscal
adjustment in 2010.
Most economies in the region operate under
pegged or heavily managed exchange rate regimes,
which deprive them of one means of adjusting to
shocks. In this respect, the recent greater exchange
rate flexibility in Russia is welcome. So far, the more
flexible exchange rate regime, alongside cuts in policy
interest rates, has helped deter speculative capital
inflows. But the focus now should be on inflation
control, and the monetary easing cycle has been
appropriately paused. In Kazakhstan, the economy

The recovery in the CIS region is gaining traction, supported by high commodity
prices, normalizing trade and capital flows, accommodative policies, and positive

are expected to pick up, but to lower levels than before the crisis. In Russia, the
more flexible exchange rate regime, alongside cuts in policy interest rates, has
helped deter speculative capital inflows. But the focus now should be on inflation
control.

would benefit from greater exchange rate flexibility,
once the problems in the banking system have been
resolved. This would facilitate monetary management,
help the economy adjust to external shocks, and promote local-currency financial market development.
Banking sector balance sheets remain impaired
in several CIS economies and call for continued
policy attention. In Russia, restoring normal credit
expansion will require decisive actions to improve
provisioning standards and to enhance the powers
of the supervisory authority, including over connected lending. In Kazakhstan, a transparent and
comprehensive strategy to resolve bad debts—which
involves an independent assessment of systemic
banks to evaluate recapitalization needs—is critical
for restoring financial sector health. In Ukraine,
financial sector reforms are also essential to revitalizing the banking system, by ensuring an adequate
level of capitalization. More independence for the
central bank to pursue monetary and financial
stability would also be desirable.

84

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

Over the medium term, the overarching challenges
in the region are to improve the investment climate
and diversify the pattern of growth. In Russia, for
instance, there is a need for public administration
reform, civil service reform, and judicial reform to
ensure a level playing field for all investors. Such
reforms will be critical to modernizing the economy.
It will also be important to use capital flows wisely,
in order to help move the economy from its dependence on oil revenues. In other energy exporters in
the region, the priority is to facilitate private sector
development and, in some economies, diversify away
from the hydrocarbon sector. Such policies will help
achieve sustained welfare gains.

The Middle East and North Africa Region Is
Recovering Strongly
The strength of the recent economic recovery in
the MENA region is largely underpinned by the
rebound in oil prices from their trough in 2009,

chapter 2

which has boosted receipts for oil exporters in the
region. In addition, a sizable and rapid fiscal policy
response, especially in oil-exporting economies, has
played a substantial role in supporting the nonoil sector in these economies. These expansionary
policies have had spillover effects on the region’s oil
importers—where fiscal expansion was of a more
moderate size—due to close trade links between these
two groups of economies (Figures 2.12 and 2.13).
These positive factors contribute to an expected
growth rate for the region as a whole of 4.1 percent
in 2010 and 5.1 percent in 2011 (Table 2.6).
•• Average growth rates among oil exporters are
projected to be higher over the next two years,
compared with 2009. Supported by sizable government infrastructure investment, real activity in
Saudi Arabia is expected to grow at 3.4 percent
in 2010 and 4.5 percent in 2011.
•• Growth in oil-importing economies is expected
to remain robust in 2010 and 2011. Members of
this group managed to weather the global recession relatively well, partly due to relatively limited global financial links. Some economies that

Country and Regional Perspectives

experienced a boom-bust cycle in capital flows,
such as Egypt, responded by drawing down
reserves to limit the impact on the exchange rate
and the real economy. In fact, net capital inflows
have already turned positive in Egypt since the
second half of 2009. Within the group, Lebanon
continued to register strong growth through the
recession, supported by signs of political stability
and strong capital inflows.
The economic outlook in the region is closely
linked to global developments, primarily through
the impact of global economic activity on oil prices.
The impact is not confined to the MENA exporters.
Oil-importing economies in the region also benefit
(roughly one-fourth of their exports go to oil exporters). Although oil prices have rebounded from the
lows in 2009, future increases are projected to be
modest. Expansion in demand by rapidly growing
emerging markets is expected to be offset by stagnant
demand from advanced economies. Oil and gas
production capacity is set to increase, particularly in
Saudi Arabia and Qatar, underpinned by continued
expansion of productive capacity. The balance of

Recovery in the region is supported largely by the rebound in oil prices from their
trough in 2009. In addition, government spending programs, especially in the
oil-exporting economies, have played a significant role in supporting the non-oil
sector in these economies. This fiscal stimulus has had positive spillovers to the
oil-importing economies, which have close trade and financial links with the oil

risks to oil prices, as evidenced in options prices, is
currently to the upside, which augurs well for the
region. Nevertheless, the tail risk of a collapse in oil
prices has significant implications for the region,
especially for lower-income oil-exporting economies.
The prospective increase in world shale gas production is also likely to weigh on receipts of MENA gas
exporters (see Appendix 1.1 in Chapter 1 for further
discussion of commodity developments).
The possibility of heightened economic turbulence in Europe poses a significant downside risk
for oil importers in the MENA region. Europe is
their largest trading partner, accounting for about
half of their total exports. In addition, the Maghreb
economies (for example, Tunisia, Morocco) are
heavily reliant on Europe as a source of tourism,
remittances, and FDI flows. The volatile global
environment poses significant policy challenges
for the region. Fiscal policy strategies have varied,
largely due to the respective strengths of public sector balance sheets. Most oil exporters are continuing
to implement stimulus measures in 2010. Although
particular country circumstances vary, plans to
consolidate should be in place once recovery is
more entrenched or if signs of incipient overheating emerge. Some oil importers, on the other hand,
have already begun the process of consolidation.
Debt levels in these economies are, on average,
higher than in oil-exporting economies.
Monetary policy in the region largely mirrors that of the United States because of the large
number of economies that have fixed exchange
rates vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Economies that have
independent monetary policies, mostly the oil
importers, have appropriately halted their easing in
the face of growing inflation pressure.
An immediate challenge for policymakers in
this region is to revive the financial intermediation
process. In many economies, credit growth has been
sluggish in the aftermath of the crisis due to weak
balance sheets both for the banking sector and the
nonfinancial corporate sector. Prominent corporate
defaults in Dubai, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia have
contributed to increased uncertainty regarding the
health of the corporate sector generally. The spillover
from these episodes to broader lending conditions in

limited—possibly due to relatively rapid and orderly
restructuring. The decline in external sources of
funds, along with slow deposit growth, has nevertheless curtailed the ability of banks to extend loans.
The region has largely been bypassed by the
recent surge in capital flows to emerging markets,
with the notable exception of Egypt and Lebanon.
Portfolio flows turned negative in 2009 and are
expected to remain so over the next two years. Bank
flows to the region are also unlikely to rebound
quickly because of the ongoing restructuring and
regulatory changes in advanced economies.
In line with the improvement in oil prices, the
overall external balance in the region is expected
to recover, although not to precrisis levels. For oil
exporters, the current account balance, which fell
from a surplus of close to 20 percent of GDP in
2008 to 4.6 percent in 2009, is projected to increase
to 6.7 percent of GDP in 2010 and 7.8 percent of
GDP in 2011. Surpluses of roughly this magnitude

are expected to continue through 2015. The counterpart is a large buildup in net foreign assets, which
historically have flowed into government securities
and private equity investments in the United States
and advanced economies in Europe.
As discussed in the October 2010 Regional
Economic Outlook: Middle East and Central Asia,
a key medium-term objective is to raise potential
growth and create jobs for the region’s rapidly growing population. The region needs to redirect trade
toward today’s growth engines, attract FDI from
these economies, and exploit the potential for intraregional trade and FDI. This underlines the need
for structural measures to enhance competitiveness. Improving the business environment, including through the establishment of strong legal and
regulatory frameworks, is essential. Building human
capital through greater emphasis on education and
training will be particularly important. And, as in
all emerging market regions, increased financial

positioned to benefit from the global recovery now
under way (Figure 2.14). The slowdown to 2.6
percent in 2009 was brief, limited also by the rapid
implementation of countercyclical policies made
possible by the policy room that many economies
had built prior to the downturn. Output growth in
the region is projected to accelerate to 5 percent in
2010 and 5.5 percent in 2011, supported not only
by the recovery in exports and commodity prices,

chapter 2

but also by robust domestic demand in a number
of economies (Table 2.7). Foreign inflows to the
region, including official flows, FDI, and remittances, were less affected by the global downturn
than had been feared, although the outlook remains
uncertain (Figure 2.15).
The pickup in global demand and the strengthening of oil prices are supporting growth in Africa’s
oil-exporting economies. In the region’s largest oil
exporter, Nigeria, continued strong growth in the
non-oil sector is being supported by increasing oil
production, a result of reduced instability in the
Niger Delta region. Thus, Nigeria’s output growth
is expected to accelerate from 7 percent in 2009
to 7.4 percent in both 2010 and 2011. Growth
in Angola, the region’s second-largest oil exporter,
is also expected to recover in 2010, following the
decline in oil exports and the tightening of its budget in 2009. Angola’s growth is projected to increase
from less than 1 percent in 2009 to about 6 percent
in 2010 and about 7 percent in 2011.
Sub-Saharan Africa’s middle-income economies—whose output contracted in 2009 due to
their stronger global trade linkages—are now
firmly on the path to recovery. The region’s largest economy, South Africa, has benefited from
continued strong demand for commodities from
emerging Asia and from a recovery in demand for
manufactures from its largest export market, the
euro area. There are also signs that the monetary
easing pursued last year is supporting a recovery in
domestic demand. After contracting by almost 2
percent in 2009, South Africa’s output is expected
to grow by 3 percent in 2010 and by 3.5 percent
in 2011.
The relatively low degree of exposure of the
region’s low-income economies to international
trade and financial flows shielded them from the
worst of the global downturn. Correspondingly,
the acceleration of growth this year is expected to
be modest. Output growth in these economies is
expected to rise from 4.5 percent in 2009 to 4.9
percent in 2010, and further to 6 percent in 2011.
Growth in low-income economies is generally
expected to be driven as much by domestic factors
as by the global recovery. In Kenya, for example, a
recovery in tourism inflows and an improvement in

Accelerating
The slowdown in 2009 was brief, in part due to rapid implementation of
countercyclical policies. A recovery in exports and commodity prices is helping
support the rebound, as is robust domestic demand in many economies.
Nonportfolio flows have been stable. Although the United States is the main
trading partner of oil exporters, Europe is the main export destination for many
low- and middle-income economies in the region.

rainfall are expected to support the acceleration of
output growth, to 4.1 percent in 2010.
The primary risk to the outlook for the region
is a faltering global recovery. But different economies in the region have differing exposures. For the
oil-exporting economies, spillovers from a global
slowdown would be manifested primarily through
its impact on oil prices. In contrast, middle- and
low-income economies’ exposure comes from their
exports to Europe, which are about one-third of
total exports, nearly four times the share of their
exports to the United States. In addition to these
trade linkages, continued weakness and measures
to cut budget deficits in advanced economies may
affect the low-income economies of sub-Saharan
Africa by reducing aid and private financial flows
to the region. For example, remittances are an
important source of foreign inflows to the region,
amounting, for example, to almost 10 percent
of GDP in Senegal. These may be susceptible to
90

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

weaker conditions in economies employing migrant
workers from sub-Saharan Africa.
Asset market spillovers resulting from increased
global volatility or risk aversion are likely to be limited. Portfolio flows are a less critical component of
overall capital flows in sub-Saharan Africa than in the
rest of the world, and most economies in the region
have relatively underdeveloped financial markets.
South Africa is the notable exception: its equity and
currency markets are often more sensitive to shifts
in global sentiment than other emerging markets in
Asia or Latin America, because nonresident transactions account for a relatively high share of turnover.
Finally, with the recovery in progress, fiscal policies in many economies in the region should begin
addressing medium-term priorities. As private and
external demand recovers, economies will need
to rebuild fiscal room and reorient its use. Where
output growth has recovered, debt levels are rising,
and primary deficits are above levels that will stabilize

chapter 2

debt over the medium term, more prudent fiscal balances are in order. However, where output growth is
still weak, outstanding debt is low, and fiscal deficits
are in check, there may be scope to sustain higher
levels of spending in priority areas such as education, health, and infrastructure investment. One
of the positive aspects of the response to the recent
downturn was the ability of many economies in the
region to shield such pro-poor and pro-growth public
spending. As highlighted in the April 2010 Regional
Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa, spending on
health and education actually increased in real terms
in 20 of 29 low-income economies in 2009. Public
capital spending also increased in real terms in half
the economies in the region.

Will It Hurt? Macroeconomic Effects of Fiscal
Consolidation

This chapter examines the effects of fiscal consolidation
—tax hikes and government spending cuts—on economic
activity. Based on a historical analysis of fiscal consolidation in advanced economies, and on simulations of the
IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model
(GIMF), it finds that fiscal consolidation typically reduces
output and raises unemployment in the short term. At
the same time, interest rate cuts, a fall in the value of
the currency, and a rise in net exports usually soften the
contractionary impact. Consolidation is more painful
when it relies primarily on tax hikes; this occurs largely
because central banks typically provide less monetary
stimulus during such episodes, particularly when they
involve indirect tax hikes that raise inflation. Also, fiscal
consolidation is more costly when the perceived risk of
sovereign default is low. These findings suggest that budget
deficit cuts are likely to be more painful if they occur
simultaneously across many countries, and if monetary
policy is not in a position to offset them. Over the long
term, reducing government debt is likely to raise output,
as real interest rates decline and the lighter burden of
interest payments permits cuts to distortionary taxes.

Budget deficits and government debt soared during
the Great Recession. In 2009, the budget deficit
averaged about 9 percent of GDP in advanced
economies, up from only 1 percent of GDP in
2007.1 By the end of 2010, government debt is
expected to reach about 100 percent of GDP—its
highest level in 50 years. Looking ahead, population
aging could create even more serious problems for
public finances.
In response to these worrisome developments,
virtually all advanced economies will face the
challenge of fiscal consolidation. Indeed, many
governments are already undertaking or planning

described in the Statistical Appendix.

large spending cuts and tax hikes. An important
and timely question is, therefore, whether fiscal
retrenchment will hurt economic performance.
Although there is widespread agreement that
reducing debt has important long-term benefits,
there is no consensus regarding the short-term
effects of fiscal austerity. On the one hand, the
conventional Keynesian view is that cutting spending or raising taxes reduces economic activity in the
short term. On the other hand, a number of studies
present evidence that cutting budget deficits can
stimulate the economy even in the short term. The
notion that fiscal retrenchment stimulates growth
in the short term is often referred to as the “expansionary fiscal contractions” hypothesis. A key factor
explaining such effects is an improvement in household and business confidence.2 The truth could be
a mixture. For example, it may be that the shortterm effects are usually contractionary, but that
expansionary effects can occur when government
solvency is in question, or when the consolidation is
structured in a way that increases confidence.
This chapter offers new evidence regarding these
important issues by studying fiscal consolidation
in advanced economies over the past 30 years. It
examines budget policies to identify periods of
fiscal consolidation, and then uses simple statistical techniques to investigate the short-term growth
effects of consolidation and how those effects are
influenced by such factors as monetary policy,
international trade, the form of the consolidation,
and perceived sovereign risk. To complement the
historical analysis, the chapter employs simulations
of the IMF’s GIMF to explore additional issues
such as the long-term effects of debt reduction. In
particular, the chapter attempts to answer the following questions:
2 For

a summary of how such expansionary effects can arise
in the short term, see, for example, Alesina (2010). Under some
strict assumptions, Ricardian equivalence can imply that fiscal
consolidation has no impact on economic activity, as changes in
private demand exactly offset changes in government demand.

world economic outlook: Recovery, Risk, and rebalancing

•• What are the short-term effects of fiscal retrenchment on economic activity? Does output
typically contract or expand in response to tax
hikes and spending cuts? What happens to
unemployment?
•• What factors dampen or exacerbate the shortterm effects? In particular, what are the roles of
monetary policy, the composition of the package
(taxes versus spending), and the perceived risk of
sovereign default in shaping the outcome? What
are the consequences of many countries cutting
deficits at the same time?
•• Does fiscal consolidation have different effects
when interest rates are near zero? Interest rates
have rarely been near zero in the past––with the
exception of Japan since the 1990s––but they are
near zero in many advanced economies today.
Would fiscal consolidation in this environment
be more or less painful than in the past?
•• What are the long-term effects on output of
reducing government debt? Do the long-term
effects depend on whether the savings from lower
interest payments are used to provide tax cuts or
to finance new spending?
Given the importance of these issues, this chapter
is not the first to address them. In particular, previous work by Giavazzi and Pagano (1990, 1996),
Alesina and Perotti (1995, 1997), and Alesina and
Ardagna (1998, 2010) has been extremely influential in the debate regarding the consequences of
fiscal adjustment.3 A key conclusion of these studies
is that fiscal adjustments tend to be expansionary when they rely primarily on spending cuts.4
However, these studies often identify periods of
fiscal consolidation using a statistical concept––the
increase in the cyclically adjusted budget surplus––
that, as this chapter shows, is a highly imperfect
measure of actual policy actions. The chapter finds
that this way of selecting cases of consolidation

broader empirical literature on the effects of fiscal policy, which
includes, among others, the work of Blanchard and Perotti
(2002), Barro and Redlick (2009), Hall (2009), Ramey and
Shapiro (1998), Ramey (2009), and Romer and Romer (2010).

methodology, including Broadbent and Daly (2010), Tsibouris
and others (2006), and Von Hagen and Strauch (2001).

biases the analysis toward downplaying contractionary effects and overstating expansionary ones.
To avoid the problems associated with these
existing studies, we use an alternative method
for identifying periods of fiscal consolidation. In
particular, our approach focuses on policy actions
intended to reduce the budget deficit. As we
explain later, this approach helps us obtain more
accurate estimates of the effects of tax hikes and
spending cuts on economic activity. Methodologically, our approach is close to that of Romer and
Romer (1989, 2010), who examine the effects on
U.S. output of changes in monetary policy and tax
rates in the United States.
The main findings of the chapter are as follows:
•• Fiscal consolidation typically has a contractionary effect on output. A fiscal consolidation equal
to 1 percent of GDP typically reduces GDP by
about 0.5 percent within two years and raises
the unemployment rate by about 0.3 percentage
point. Domestic demand—consumption and
investment—falls by about 1 percent.
•• Reductions in interest rates usually support
output during episodes of fiscal consolidation.
Central banks offset some of the contractionary
pressures by cutting policy interest rates, and
longer-term rates also typically decline, cushioning the impact on consumption and investment.
For each 1 percent of GDP of fiscal consolidation, interest rates usually fall by about 20 basis
points after two years. The model simulations
also imply that, if interest rates are near zero, the
effects of fiscal consolidation are more costly in
terms of lost output.5
•• A decline in the real value of the domestic currency typically plays an important cushioning
role by spurring net exports and is usually due
to nominal depreciation or currency devaluation. For each 1 percent of GDP of fiscal
consolidation, the value of the currency usually
falls by about 1.1 percent, and the contribu5 For simplicity, the model simulations ignore the possibility that the central bank responds to fiscal consolidation using
unconventional monetary tools, such as quantitative and credit
easing. To the extent that such tools would be used to support
output, the simulations may overstate the impact of the zero
interest rate floor.

tion of net exports to GDP rises by about 0.5
percentage point. Because not all countries can
increase net exports at the same time, this finding implies that fiscal contraction is likely to be
more painful when many countries adjust at the
same time.
•• Fiscal contraction that relies on spending cuts
tends to have smaller contractionary effects than
tax-based adjustments. This is partly because
central banks usually provide substantially more
stimulus following a spending-based contraction
than following a tax-based contraction. Monetary
stimulus is particularly weak following indirect
tax hikes (such as the value-added tax, VAT) that
raise prices.
•• Fiscal retrenchment in countries that face a
higher perceived sovereign default risk tends to
be less contractionary. However, even among
such high-risk countries, expansionary effects are
unusual.
•• Model simulations suggest that over the long
term, reducing debt is likely to be beneficial.
In particular, the GIMF simulations considered
here suggest that lower government debt levels reduce real interest rates, which stimulates
private investment. Also, the lower burden of
interest payments creates fiscal room for cutting
distortionary taxes. Both of these effects raise
output in the long term. Overall, the simulations
imply that for every 10 percentage point fall in
the debt-to-GDP ratio, output rises by about
1.4 percent in the long term.
The remainder of the chapter is organized as
follows. The first section provides an empirical assessment of the short-term impact of fiscal
consolidation using a new database of historical
episodes of fiscal consolidation during 1980–2009.
The second section complements the historical analysis by conducting model simulations to
address additional issues, such as the consequences
of being near the zero bound on nominal interest rates, the impact of having many countries
consolidating simultaneously, and the long-term
consequences of reducing debt levels. The concluding section draws lessons from the analysis for
countries considering fiscal consolidation in the
current environment.

Will It Hurt? Macroeconomic Effects of Fiscal Consolidation

Looking at History: What Is the Short-Term
Impact of Fiscal Consolidation?
In this section, we examine the history of fiscal
retrenchment in advanced economies over the past
30 years and evaluate the short-term effects on economic activity. The section starts by explaining how
we identify periods of fiscal consolidation, and contrasts our approach to the standard approach used
in previous studies. It then reports the estimated
effects of fiscal consolidation, and compares our
results with those based on the standard approach.

Identifying Cases of Fiscal Consolidation
The usual approach to identifying historical
cases of fiscal retrenchment is to focus on swings
in the cyclically adjusted primary budget balance (CAPB). The CAPB is calculated by taking
the actual primary balance––non-interest revenue
minus non-interest spending––and subtracting the
estimated effect of business cycle fluctuations on
the fiscal accounts. For example, Alesina and Perotti
(1995) and Alesina and Ardagna (2010) correct
the primary surplus for year-to-year changes in the
unemployment rate.6 Cyclical adjustment offers an
intuitive way of dealing with the fact that tax revenue and government spending move automatically
with the business cycle. The idea is that, once they
are cyclically adjusted, changes in fiscal variables
reflect policymakers’ decisions to change tax rates
and spending levels. A sharp increase in the CAPB
would therefore provide evidence of deliberate deep
deficit cuts.
However, the conventional approach used to
identify cases of fiscal consolidation is far from
perfect and can bias the results toward finding

6 In

particular, these studies use a method proposed by
Blanchard (1990) following which “the cyclically adjusted value
of the change in a fiscal variable is the difference between a
measure of the fiscal variable in period t computed as if the
unemployment rate were equal to the one in t − 1 and the actual
value of the fiscal variable in year t – 1” (Alesina and Ardagna,
2010, p. 7). Most studies also use a statistical threshold for identifying large increases in the CAPB. For example, Alesina and
Ardagna (2010) identify a period of fiscal adjustment as a year
in which the ratio of the CAPB to GDP improves by at least 1.5
percentage points.

expansionary effects.7 Two key problems relate to
measurement errors and to policy motivation:
•• The first problem is that cyclical adjustment
methods suffer from measurement errors that are
likely to be correlated with economic developments. For example, standard cyclical-adjustment
methods fail to remove swings in government
tax revenue associated with asset price or commodity price movements from the fiscal data,
resulting in changes in the CAPB that are not
necessarily linked to actual policy changes.8 Thus,
including episodes associated with asset price
booms––which tend to coincide with economic
expansions––and excluding episodes associated
with asset price busts from the sample introduces
an expansionary bias.9 For example, in the case
of Ireland in 2009, the collapse in stock and
housing prices induced a sharp reduction in the
CAPB despite the implementation of tax hikes
and spending cuts totaling 4.5 percent of GDP.10
•• The second problem with the standard approach
is that it ignores the motivation behind fiscal
actions. Thus, it omits years during which actions
aimed at fiscal consolidation were followed by
an adverse shock and an offsetting discretionary stimulus. For example, imagine that two
countries adopt identical consolidation policies,
but then one is hit by an adverse shock and so
adopts discretionary stimulus, while the other is
hit with a favorable shock. Here, the change in
the CAPB would show a smaller increase for the
7 Appendix 3.3 provides a number of specific examples
that illustrate the problems associated with the conventional
approach.
8 As Morris and Schuknecht (2007) explain, “asset price
movements are a major factor behind unexplained changes in the
cyclically adjusted balance, which, if not accounted for, can lead
to erroneous conclusions regarding underlying fiscal developments” (p. 4).
9 A similar problem occurs during sharp recessions. As
Wolswijk (2007) explains, standard cyclical adjustment methods
assume that the automatic response (elasticity) of fiscal variables
to the business cycle is constant over time. However, there is
evidence that sharp recessions have a stronger-than-average automatic effect on fiscal variables. Therefore, if a fiscal consolidation
coincides with a sharp recession, it is less likely to be picked up
by the standard approach, which searches for an increase in the
CAPB.

first country than for the second country, despite
the presence of identical consolidation measures.
The standard approach would therefore tend to
miss cases of consolidation followed by adverse
shocks, because there may be little or no rise in
the CAPB despite the consolidation measures.
The case of Germany in 1982 provides a realworld counterpart to this hypothetical example:
the CAPB-to-GDP ratio rose by only 0.4 percentage point, despite the fact that the authorities
implemented fiscal austerity measures amounting
to about 1.4 percent of GDP.11 The impact of
these measures on the CAPB was partly offset by
countercyclical stimulus measures introduced in
response to the recession that year.12
Moreover, the problems with the usual approach
are not just hypothetical or limited to a few specific
cases. As we show in Appendix 3.3, the change in the
CAPB-to-GDP ratio is an unreliable guide regarding the presence of fiscal consolidation. The standard
approach tends to select periods associated with favorable outcomes but during which no austerity measures
were actually taken. It also tends to omit cases of fiscal
austerity associated with unfavorable outcomes.
Therefore, rather than focusing on the CAPB,
we look at policy actions. In particular, we identify
cases in which the government implemented tax
hikes or spending cuts (at the general government
level) to reduce the budget deficit and put public finances on a more sustainable footing. Thus,
whereas the usual strategy identifies periods of consolidation based on successful (cyclically adjusted)
budget outcomes, our approach identifies episodes
based on fiscal policy actions motivated by deficit
reduction, irrespective of the outcomes.
11 The source of the data for the CAPB-to-GDP ratio is Alesina and Ardagna (2010). The concept of government used for
the CAPB is that of the general government.
12 For similar reasons, the standard approach is likely to identify cases of fiscal tightening that are unrelated to deficit-reduction concerns. For example, imagine that two countries adopt no
consolidation measures, but then one is hit by a favorable shock
and so adopts countercyclical tightening to cool the economy,
while the other does nothing. Here, the change in the CAPB
would show tightening for the first country, and no change for
the second country, despite the lack of consolidation measures in
both countries. The standard approach would therefore tend to
include cases associated with economic booms despite the lack of
measures aimed at fiscal consolidation.

chapter 3

Although our action-based approach addresses
the problems associated with the conventional
approach to identifying fiscal consolidation, both
the standard approach and our approach are subject
to two additional criticisms. First, if countries
sometimes postpone fiscal consolidation until the
economy recovers, then the consolidation exercise
will be associated with good economic outcomes in
both the standard approach and our approach. Second, if a country is committed to a deficit-reduction path and the economy falls into a recession,
it may implement additional fiscal consolidation
measures, thus associating fiscal consolidation with
unfavorable economic outcomes in both the standard approach and our approach. Thus, biases may
remain even in our approach, although it is unclear
in which direction they would go overall.
In addition, in contrast to some previous studies,
we do not focus on periods of “sustained” (multiyear) fiscal consolidation. A key problem with
such an approach is that governments may choose
to interrupt a program of fiscal austerity due to
unfavorable output developments. For example,
Japan’s six-year fiscal adjustment plan, initiated in
1997, was suspended in December 1998 following
a sharp economic downturn. In contrast, favorable
output developments are likely to help governments
complete a sustained fiscal consolidation. Therefore,
focusing on cases of sustained consolidation would
bias toward finding expansionary effects.
In sum, not only does the standard approach
sometimes select years that bear no relation to
actual changes in fiscal policy, it also biases the
results toward downplaying contractionary effects
and overstating the expansionary effects of fiscal
adjustment. In contrast, a key contribution of this
chapter is to reduce these bias problems and therefore allow us to better estimate the causal impact on
output of fiscal consolidation.

Implementing the Action-Based Approach
Our approach requires identifying policy actions
motivated by deficit reduction. Therefore, we examine accounts and records of what countries actually did. In particular, we analyze OECD Economic
Surveys, IMF Staff Reports, IMF Recent Economic

Will It Hurt? Macroeconomic Effects of Fiscal Consolidation

Developments reports, country budget documents,
and additional country-specific sources.13 The
estimated effect on the budget deficit is based on
these sources. In this respect, our methodology is
closely related to the “narrative approach” proposed
by Romer and Romer (1989, 2004, 2010).14 The
analysis also distinguishes between permanent
and temporary measures. Temporary measures are
recorded as generating positive savings when they
are introduced and negative savings when they
expire.
The sample includes the fiscal actions taken to
reduce the deficit in 15 advanced economies during
1980–2009.15 The main reason the analysis focuses
on advanced economies is that fiscal policy adjustment needs are particularly large, on average, for
the group of advanced economies, as discussed in
the IMF’s May 2010 Fiscal Monitor (IMF, 2010).
For the 15 countries covered—Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
the United Kingdom, and the United States—we
identified 173 years in which there were budgetary measures aimed at fiscal consolidation. Thus,
on average across the sample countries, about 40
percent of years saw the introduction of budgetary measures aimed at reducing the deficit (Figure
3.1). The average size of fiscal consolidation was
about 1 percent of GDP per year, but the range was
wide (see Figure 3.1). Fiscal contractions of more
13 Additional

country-specific sources used to clarify the
motivation behind the fiscal consolidation measures include
Kuttner and Posen (2002), Nakagawa (2009), and Takahashi
and Tokuoka (2010) for Japan; Lawson (1992) for the United
Kingdom; and Romer and Romer (2009) and the sources cited
therein, for the United States. We find that the estimates of the
measures’ expected impact on the fiscal deficit at the time they
were implemented are similar across the various sources.
14 Focusing on the United States, Romer and Romer (2010)
use the narrative record, such as congressional reports, to identify
the size and motivation for all post–World War II tax policy
actions. They find that only a small share of observed changes in
government revenue reflect actual changes in tax policy and use
the changes in tax policy identified by means of their narrative
approach to obtain estimates of the causal impact of tax changes
on the economy.
15 The complete list of periods of fiscal adjustments is reported
in Appendix 3.1. A companion paper, available on request,
shows how we implement the approach. In particular, it provides
quotations and citations for each case to show how we determined the presence of fiscal consolidation measures.

than 1.5 percent of GDP per year represent about
one-fifth of all cases of consolidation. Therefore,
on average, countries implemented such large fiscal
adjustments once every 14 years. As we show later
on, the estimated effects of these large adjustments
on output are similar to the effects of smaller
adjustments.

Figure 3.1. Action-Based Fiscal Consolidation

Estimated Effects of Fiscal Consolidation

There were about 170 cases of action-based fiscal consolidation over the past 30
years in advanced economies. Consolidation has often relied primarily on
spending cuts. On average, action-based fiscal consolidation amounted to 1
percent of GDP a year, but the range was wide.

With periods of fiscal consolidation now identified, this section employs statistical techniques to
assess the impact of the fiscal measures on economic
activity. The statistical methodology is standard and
follows that of Cerra and Saxena (2008), Romer
and Romer (2010), and others. In particular, we
estimate the average impulse response of output to
action-based fiscal consolidation using panel data
analysis. The estimated equation makes use of an
autoregressive model in growth rates estimated on
annual data for 1980–2009 for the 15 countries in
our sample. The growth rates are then cumulated to
obtain the estimated impact of fiscal consolidation
on the level of output.16
A key result is that fiscal consolidation is typically contractionary. A fiscal consolidation equal to
1 percent of GDP typically reduces real GDP by
about 0.5 percent after two years (Figure 3.2). The
effect on the unemployment rate is an increase of

real GDP as the dependent variable on the left-hand side. On
the right-hand side, the explanatory variables are the current and
lagged values of the fiscal consolidation measures identified as
discussed above. Including lags allows for a delayed impact of fiscal consolidation on growth. In addition, the approach controls
for lags of real GDP growth, to distinguish the effect of fiscal
consolidation from that of normal output dynamics. Thus, the
equation estimated is

among countries’ normal growth rates. The estimated equation
also includes a full set of time dummies (lt ) to take account of
global shocks such as shifts in oil prices or the global business
cycle.

about 0.3 percentage point after two years.17 The
results are statistically significant at conventional
levels. Overall, the idea that fiscal austerity stimulates economic activity in the short term finds little
support in the data.18
However, the average effect of fiscal consolidation
shown in Figure 3.2 hides a range of experiences
related to a number of factors. In particular, we
now turn to three key factors that shape the outcomes: the role of interest rates and exchange rates,
the composition of the fiscal package, and the role
of perceived sovereign risk of the country undertaking the consolidation.

Will It Hurt? Macroeconomic Effects of Fiscal Consolidation

Figure 3.2. Impact of a 1 Percent of GDP Fiscal
Consolidation on GDP and Unemployment
Fiscal consolidation is normally contractionary. A fiscal consolidation equal to
1 percent of GDP typically reduces real GDP by about 0.5 percent and raises the
unemployment rate by about 0.3 percentage point.

The Mitigating Role of Interest Rates and Exchange Rates

GDP (percent)

Unemployment rate (percentage points)

This section looks at the role of interest rate
cuts and declines in the value of the currency in
mitigating the impact of fiscal consolidation. In
addition, to clarify how interest rates and exchange
rates shape the outcome, we examine the behavior
of the components of GDP, including exports and
imports. To explore these channels, we use the same
statistical approach as described above, but apply
it to studying the impact of fiscal consolidation
on exchange rates and interest rates instead of on
output.19

17 To

explore the impact on the unemployment rate, we
replace all the GDP growth terms in the estimated equation with
the change in the unemployment rate. We then cumulate the
impulse responses to obtain the impact of fiscal consolidation on
the level of the unemployment rate.
18Several robustness checks were performed, as reported in
Appendix 3.2. In particular, excluding lags of growth had little
effect on the results; using different lag lengths (up to four)
yielded similar results. Although the country dummies are
correlated with the lagged dependent variables in the estimated
equation, the bias is small here given the large number of observations per country relative to the number of countries (30 years
for each of our 15 countries). When the estimation is conducted
using the Arellano-Bond estimator, which corrects for this possible bias, the results are very similar.
19For example, to examine the response of the real exchange
rate to fiscal consolidation, we repeat the estimation of the equation described above, while replacing all the GDP growth terms
with the change in the log of the real exchange rate. We then
cumulated the impulse responses to obtain the impact of fiscal
consolidation on the (log) level of the real exchange rate.

The short-term policy interest rate typically falls
by about 20 basis points in response to a fiscal consolidation of 1 percent of GDP (Figure 3.3). Since
the rate of inflation usually does not change much
following fiscal consolidation, the fall in real interest
rates is similar. At the same time, the long-term
nominal interest rate on government bonds falls
broadly in line with short-term rates. In particular,
the yield on government bonds with a maturity of
10 years declines by about 15 basis points after two
years in response to a fiscal consolidation equal to
1 percent of GDP. The response of long-term rates
suggests that fiscal consolidation may reduce risk
premiums.20

In response to a fiscal consolidation of 1 percent
of GDP, the exchange rate depreciates by about
1.1 percent in real terms (see Figure 3.3). Interestingly, this real depreciation is almost fully explained
by nominal exchange rate depreciation or currency
devaluation. Examples of large devaluations during
fiscal consolidation include, among others, Finland
(1992), Ireland (1987), and Italy (1992).
Transmission channel: the role of net exports
How do these changes in interest rates and
exchange rates affect the economy? The fall in
interest rates is likely to support consumption and
investment. And the real depreciation should support economic activity by boosting net exports.
Decomposing the response of GDP into its
demand components confirms that net exports
expand in response to fiscal consolidation, providing a key cushioning role. In particular, the contribution of net exports to GDP increases by about
0.5 percentage point (Figure 3.4). The increase in
net exports reflects both an increase in real exports
in response to the real exchange rate depreciation

20 The

effect of fiscal consolidation on longer-term interest
rates may be influenced by two factors: the decline in the current and future short-term interest rate and a reduction in the
risk premium related to the perceived improvement in the fiscal
outlook.

and a decline in real imports, which also reflects the
fall in income (see Figure 3.4).21
Meanwhile, domestic demand (consumption and
investment) declines substantially in response to
fiscal retrenchment. In particular, a consolidation
of 1 percent of GDP reduces the contribution of
domestic demand to GDP by about 1 percentage
point after two years. This result is broadly consistent with textbook (Keynesian) effects on demand
of spending cuts and tax hikes.
Overall, this section confirms that a fall in the
value of the currency plays a key role in softening the impact of fiscal consolidation on output
through the impact on net exports. Without this
increase in net exports, the output cost of fiscal
consolidation would be roughly twice as large, with
output falling by 1 percent instead of 0.5 percent.
Cuts in interest rates also help cushion the impact
on consumption and investment.

Taxes versus Spending: Does Composition Matter?

-0.5

Does the composition of fiscal consolidation
across taxes and spending matter? A number of
studies suggest that fiscal contraction associated
primarily with declines in spending is accompanied
by an expansion of the economy in the short term,
whereas adjustments based primarily on revenue
increases feature output contractions.22 In this section, using our data set of periods of action-based
fiscal consolidation, we revisit these stylized facts to
test whether the composition of consolidation measures makes a difference in terms of their impact on
growth. We also investigate the role of interest rates
and exchange rates in explaining the effects of different types of fiscal consolidation measures.

21 Since the analysis controls for shifts in global demand (time
dummies), the estimated increase in exports does not reflect an
upswing in external demand. Also, the estimated response of
exports and imports is consistent with that implied by standard
elasticities with respect to the real exchange rate, as reported, for
example, in Bayoumi and Faruqee (1998).
22 See, for example, Alesina and Perotti (1995, 1997), Alesina
and Ardagna (2010), Broadbent and Daly (2010), and others.

solidation. The first type, denoted “tax-based,”
corresponds to years in which the contribution of
tax hikes to fiscal consolidation is greater than the
contribution of spending cuts. The second type,
denoted “spending-based,” corresponds to years in
which the contribution of spending cuts to fiscal
consolidation is greater than that of tax hikes.23
The following main results emerge from the
analysis:
•• Spending-based adjustments are less contractionary than tax-based adjustments. In the case of
tax-based programs, the effect of a fiscal consolidation of 1 percent of GDP on GDP is –1.3
percent after two years (Figure 3.5). In the case
of spending-based programs, the effect is –0.3
percent after two years, and is not statistically
significant.24 Similarly, while deficit cuts that
rely on tax hikes raise the unemployment rate
by about 0.6 percentage point, spending-based
deficit cuts raise the unemployment rate only
by about 0.2 percentage point (see Figure 3.5).
However, as will be shown below, a key reason the costs of spending-based deficit cuts are
relatively small is that they typically benefit from
a large dose of monetary stimulus, as well as an
expansion in exports.
•• Domestic demand contracts for both types of
fiscal consolidation, but by more in the case of
tax-based packages. In particular, in the case of
spending-based measures, domestic demand falls
by about 0.9 percent after two years, whereas the
decline exceeds 1.8 percent in the case of taxbased packages (see Figure 3.5).
•• A rise in net exports mitigates the impact of the
consolidation on GDP in both cases. However,
there is a considerably larger improvement in
exports associated with spending-based measures
than with tax-based measures, whereas imports fall
more for tax-based adjustments (see Figure 3.5).

23 Similar results are obtained if the tax-based type corresponds
to years in which the contribution of tax hikes to fiscal consolidation was more than 60 percent of the total; the same holds
true for the spending-based type.
24 The difference between the tax-based and spending-based
responses is strongly statistically significant.

102

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

Why are spending-based adjustments less
contractionary?
Much of the difference is due to the response
of monetary conditions to fiscal consolidation:
interest rates and the value of the currency tend to
fall more following spending-based consolidation
(Figure 3.6). Existing estimates in the literature
can provide a rough sense of how much of the
difference in output performance stems from the
difference in monetary conditions. The difference
in interest rate responses between tax-based and
spending-based fiscal consolidation is about 50 basis
points in the first year (see Figure 3.6).25 Meanwhile, the output cost for tax-based consolidation
exceeds that for spending-based consolidation by
about 0.3 percentage point in the first year and by
about 1 percentage point in the second year (see
Figure 3.5). Therefore, for the difference in output
outcomes to be attributable entirely to the different
monetary policy responses, a 100 basis point rise
in interest rates would need to reduce output by
about 0.6 percent in the first year and 2 percent in
the second. Such impacts are within the range of
estimates found in the empirical literature, though
toward the high end.26 Thus, it appears that the
difference in monetary policy responses accounts for
much, though probably not all, of the difference in
output performance.
These findings are in line with the notion that
central banks view spending-based deficit cuts more
favorably, possibly because they interpret them as a
signal of a stronger commitment to fiscal discipline,
and are therefore more willing to provide monetary
stimulus following spending-based adjustments. It is
also plausible that an increase in taxes, if it involves
indirect tax hikes (sales and excise taxes, VAT),
raises inflation on impact, making interest rate cuts
25 Note that part of the effect of interest rates on output works
through the exchange rate. Therefore, to avoid double counting,
the difference in output costs due to the difference in exchange
rate behavior is not considered separately here.
26 Romer and Romer (2004) find that an unexpected 100
basis point increase in interest rates reduces output (measured
by industrial production) by 4.3 percent after two years. Sims
(1992) estimates the maximum impact on industrial production
at about –1.5 percent, while Bernanke and Mihov (1998) and
Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1996) find a maximum
effect on real GDP close to –1 percent.

Will It Hurt? Macroeconomic Effects of Fiscal Consolidation

Figure 3.5. Impact of a 1 Percent of GDP Fiscal Consolidation: Taxes versus Spending
Spending-based consolidation is less contractionary than tax-based consolidation. GDP falls by less and unemployment increases less. Domestic demand
contracts significantly as a result of both spending-based and tax-based consolidation, but the contraction is sharper after tax-based adjustments. A boom in net
exports mitigates the contraction in both cases. A surge in exports drives the net export boom associated with spending-based consolidation. After tax-based
consolidation, net exports rise mainly because imports fall.

by an inflation-averse central bank less likely. In line
with this notion, Figure 3.7 provides evidence that
the policy rate rises on impact for tax-based adjustments, and even more so when they include some
indirect tax hikes. In the case of tax-based packages
that include indirect tax hikes, the output costs are
particularly large.27
The results reported above suggest that spending-based measures are less contractionary than
tax-based measures, but do the effects differ across
different types of spending cuts? In particular, a
number of studies, such as Alesina and Perotti
(1995), predict that spending-based adjustments
have relatively benign effects if they involve cuts to
politically sensitive items, such as transfer programs,
or government consumption, such as the public sector wage bill. The key idea is that cutting politically
sensitive items may signal a credible commitment
to long-term deficit reduction and that, in these
cases, positive “non-Keynesian” confidence effects
offset the negative “Keynesian” impact on aggregate
demand. On the other hand, cuts to less politically
sensitive items, such as government investment,
might have weaker confidence effects. To investigate
this possibility, we divide the spending-based adjustments into three groups: those that rely mainly
on cuts to government transfers (31 percent of all
spending-based packages), those that rely mainly on
cuts to government consumption (46 percent), and
those that rely mainly on cuts to public investment
(9 percent).28
The estimated impact on output of these three
types of deficit cuts provides some evidence suggesting that spending cuts based on cuts to govern27 Similarly,

long-term interest rates tend to rise following taxbased adjustments that include indirect tax hikes, but tend to fall
for those based on direct tax hikes or spending cuts. These results
suggest that markets may perceive governments that make spending cuts or direct tax hikes as more serious about carrying out
fiscal consolidation over time. This perception might be based on
the notion that it is more difficult politically in most jurisdictions to cut spending or to raise direct taxes than to raise indirect
taxes and that governments willing to invest political capital in
the former measures are more likely to persist in their endeavor
to reduce government debt.
28 The remainder (14 percent of cases) features spending-based
adjustments without sufficient documentation regarding the
types of spending cuts or where no category accounted for the
majority of the adjustment.

chapter 3

ment transfers are relatively benign (Figure 3.8).
In particular, the point estimates indicate a modest
expansion. For adjustments based mainly on cuts to
government consumption or investment, the output
costs are larger. However, the estimates reported in
Figure 3.8 are based on a small sample of observations for which we have details regarding the types
of spending cuts implemented. Hence, these results
should be interpreted with caution. In particular,
even for the cases of consolidation based on transfer
cuts, there is no strong evidence of expansionary
effects, as the results are statistically indistinguishable from zero.

The Role of Perceived Sovereign Risk
One would expect expansionary fiscal contraction to be more likely in situations where doubts
about solvency raise borrowing costs and where
the consolidation could reduce those costs sharply.
In line with this notion, Giavazzi and Pagano
(1990) found evidence of “expansionary fiscal
contractions” in Denmark in 1983 and Ireland in
1987—two countries that had experienced a rapid
deterioration in their sovereign debt rating.29 In
this subsection, we examine the role of sovereign
risk perception.
To explore this issue, we split the sample into
two groups. The first group includes fiscal adjustment preceded by high (above-median) levels of
perceived sovereign credit risk in the three years
before fiscal consolidation. The second group
includes adjustment preceded by low (belowmedian) perceived sovereign credit risk. Our measure of perceived solvency risk is the Institutional
Investor Ratings (IIR) index.30 These ratings are
based on assessments of sovereign risk by private
sector analysts. Each country is rated on a scale of
zero to 100, with a rating of 100 assigned to the

30 Studies that use the IIR as a proxy for sovereign default risk
include Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003) and Eichengreen
and Mody (2004). Similar results are obtained when the sample
is split into three groups—high, medium, and low risk.

lowest perceived sovereign default probability.31 The
median level of this index, 80, is close to that of
Portugal in 2007.32
The estimation results suggest that deficit cuts
preceded by high perceived sovereign risk are indeed
less contractionary than those preceded by low perceived sovereign default risk (Figure 3.9). This finding is consistent with the notion that confidence or
credibility effects help mitigate the impact of fiscal
consolidation on high-risk countries and that low
perceived sovereign default risk is associated with a
more typical contraction.
At the same time, however, even for the group
of high-risk countries, the results are not usually
expansionary. The point estimates imply that output
on average still falls following fiscal consolidation
in these countries by about 0.4 percent after two
years. However, when the only two episodes of fiscal consolidation considered are those of Denmark
(1983) and Ireland (1987), the estimated effect
on output is indeed positive (although not statistically significant). These findings are consistent with
the finding of Giavazzi and Pagano (1990) that
Denmark and Ireland experienced “expansionary fiscal contractions.” However, the results also suggest
that these two cases are not representative of the
normal output response, even among countries with
a relatively poor initial credit rating.

Comparison with Other Studies
How do our results compare with those obtained
using the standard set of fiscal consolidation
episodes? To answer this question, we consider the
sample of large fiscal adjustments identified by
Alesina and Ardagna (2010) for our same sample of
15 countries––years in which the CAPB-to-GDP
ratio increases by at least 1.5 percentage points.33
For this sample, the estimation results suggest
that fiscal austerity usually stimulates GDP and
31 Note that these ratings are strongly correlated with sovereign
bond yields (although the latter reflect more than just default
risk).
32 Note that Denmark (1983) and Ireland (1987)––the two
cases studied by Giavazzi and Pagano (1990)––fall into this highperceived-risk category.
33 The episodes identified by Alesina and Ardagna (2010) are
listed in Table 3.5.

reduces the rate of unemployment in the short term
(Figure 3.10). In contrast, for a comparable set of
large consolidation episodes identified according to
our action-based approach (those greater than 1.5
percent of GDP), the impact on GDP is negative
and unemployment rises.
What explains this stark contrast? Why is fiscal
contraction usually painless based on the standard
set of episodes but contractionary based on our
sample of action-based episodes? As described
above, the standard approach to identification
of consolidation based on the behavior of the
CAPB may be imperfect and create bias in the
estimated effects of consolidation. Appendix 3.3
demonstrates that these problems are substantial.
It shows that there are large differences between
the episodes identified by the two approaches. It
then examines the 10 cases in which the difference
between the size of the consolidation identified by
the two approaches is largest and establishes two
results. First, the action-based measure appears to
be substantially more accurate. In the majority of
the 10 episodes, there were specific economic or
budgetary developments that cause the CAPBbased approach to inaccurately measure the size
of the consolidation; in the remainder, there were
economic developments that very likely had a large
effect on the CAPB-based measure. Second, the
errors are correlated with economic developments.
Most notably, the CAPB-based approach often
fails to identify consolidation when governments
took substantial actions to reduce the deficit but
the actions were associated with severe economic
downturns. It is therefore not surprising that
the estimates based on the CAPB-based measure
do not find that consolidations are on average
contractionary.
Finally, Figure 3.10 also illustrates another
interesting finding: based on our set of fiscal adjustments, the incremental impact of fiscal consolidation on economic activity appears to be unrelated to
the size of the package. In particular, the estimated
responses of output and unemployment to these
large deficit cuts (greater than 1.5 percent of GDP)
are similar to those reported before for our full
sample of fiscal consolidation. For each additional
fiscal consolidation of 1 percent of GDP, the impact

Fiscal consolidation preceded by high perceived sovereign risk is less
contractionary than when preceded by low perceived default risk. But even for
the group with high perceived risk, fiscal retrenchment rarely triggers faster
growth. Exceptions include Denmark (1983) and Ireland (1987)—two cases of
fiscal consolidation studied by Giavazzi and Pagano (1990)—which were
expansionary.

Additional Insights from Model Simulations
The previous section looked at historical episodes
of fiscal consolidation in advanced economies to
assess the short-term effects. But historical analysis goes only so far. For example, the empirical
framework used above is not well suited to providing estimates of the effects of fiscal consolidation
over long periods such as 10 or 20 years. Moreover,
historical analysis cannot fully address specific issues
that are relevant for today but that rarely arose in
the past, such as the zero floor on nominal interest rates. Therefore, to complement the empirical
analysis, this section looks at fiscal consolidation
in the controlled “laboratory” setting of the GIMF,
a dynamic general equilibrium model designed to
simulate the effects of fiscal and monetary policy
measures.35
In particular, we examine the following
questions:
•• How do the effects of fiscal consolidation change
when nominal interest rates are near zero?
•• How do the effects change when many countries
conduct fiscal consolidation simultaneously?
•• What are the long-term effects of reducing government debt from high levels?

34 Additional analysis suggests that the proportional impact
is also similar for very large deficit cuts (equal to more than 3
percent of GDP per year), although the estimation results are less
precise for these cases due to the smaller number of observations.
35 For presentations of the structure of the GIMF, see Kumhof
and Laxton (2007); Kumhof, Muir, and Mursula (2010); Freedman and others (2009, forthcoming); and Clinton and others
(2010). A companion paper, available on request, shows that
the GIMF produces short-term expenditure and tax multipliers
that are in line with those reported in the previous section of the
chapter. In addition, it explains why fiscal multipliers associated with fiscal consolidation are likely to be smaller than those
associated with fiscal stimulus, including the fact that monetary
policy stimulus partly offsets the effect of fiscal consolidation but
reinforces the effect of fiscal stimulus.

chapter 3

Fiscal Consolidation when Policy Rates Are Near the Zero
Interest Rate Floor
Since the onset of the Great Recession, shortterm interest rates in the largest advanced economies have been near the zero interest rate floor.
Yet of the historical episodes considered above,
only those of Japan since the 1990s occurred in an
environment of near-zero interest rates. In the other
episodes, interest rate cuts typically followed fiscal
consolidation.
Therefore, to look at the effects of fiscal consolidation when interest rates are near zero, we use
model simulations. In particular, we look at what
happens when a small open economy, which we
calibrate to fit the main features of Canada, implements fiscal consolidation with and without the
zero interest rate floor. For simplicity, the analysis
ignores the possibility of the central bank responding to the consolidation by using unconventional
monetary tools, such as quantitative and credit easing. To the extent that such policies would be used
to support output in response to the consolidation,
the simulations reported here may overstate the
impact of the zero interest rate floor.
The consolidation considered here is a reduction
in the deficit equivalent to 1 percentage point of
GDP, composed entirely of spending cuts. Threequarters of the spending cuts fall on government
transfers, with the rest falling on government
consumption. All the simulations considered in
this subsection assume that there are no cuts to
productive public investment. If the spending cuts
do include cuts to productive public investment,
the long-term effects of fiscal consolidation can be
negligible or even negative.
The results suggest the following:
•• When the interest rate is well above zero and free
to decline, the output cost is about 0.5 percent
after two years (Figure 3.11). This output cost is
broadly consistent with the estimated short-term
effect reported in the previous section of this
chapter. Two factors make the impact on GDP
less than one-to-one for every 1 percent of GDP
of fiscal consolidation. First, lower interest rates
help offset the shock to domestic demand. Second, a significant depreciation in the exchange

Will It Hurt? Macroeconomic Effects of Fiscal Consolidation

rate, resulting from the persistence of the decline
in the interest rate, boosts exports and raises the
trade balance. Again, these simulation results are
consistent with the empirical findings reported in
the previous section.36
•• However, when interest rates are stuck at zero,
the output cost of fiscal consolidation doubles to
about 1 percent after two years (see Figure 3.11).
Here, the simulation assumes that the zero lower
bound holds for two years.37 During this time,
the central bank is powerless to offset the slump
in aggregate demand and inflation induced by
the cut in government spending. The resulting fall in inflation raises the real interest rate,
which in turn exacerbates the decline in aggregate
demand, amplifying the short-term contractionary effect of fiscal consolidation.

Fiscal Consolidation in Many Countries at the Same Time
How do the effects of fiscal consolidation change
when many countries consolidate at the same time?
This question is relevant today, as a number of advanced
economies set fiscal consolidation in motion.
To address this issue, the simulations compare a
situation in which only Canada cuts its fiscal deficit
to one in which all countries do so simultaneously
(global fiscal consolidation). We again use Canada here
to illustrate the case of an economy small enough to
have small spillover effects on the rest of the world and
open enough that fiscal contraction in the rest of the
world has significant effects on its GDP.38
36 In an economy such as the United States, with less exposure
to foreign trade, the domestic-demand channel would be more
important. In this case, it would require a larger decline in the
interest rate to offset the effects of the fiscal contraction on
domestic demand.
37 Why do the simulations assume that the zero interest rate
floor holds for two years? In the model, the only way the central
bank can stabilize output and inflation is by cutting nominal interest rates. When the option of cutting interest rates is
removed for a long time—here, three or more years––the model
generates unstable macroeconomic dynamics, which complicates
the computation of simulation results. In addition, for most
countries, it is unlikely that interest rates will stay at zero for
more than two years.
38 In 2009, Canada’s GDP was 1.9 percent of global GDP
on a purchasing-power-parity basis, and the sum of exports and
imports represented 71 percent of GDP.

As before, the adjustment involves reducing the
deficit-to-GDP ratio by 1 percentage point, with
the adjustment composed entirely of spending cuts.
Three-quarters of the spending cuts fall on government transfers, with the rest falling on government
consumption. Also, as before, the analysis considers
two cases: the first assumes that the zero interest rate floor holds in all countries for two years,
and the second assumes that the interest rate may
change without constraint.
The following results emerge:
•• In the simulations where the zero interest rate
floor applies, the Canada-only consolidation
implies an output loss of about 1 percent (Figure
3.12). But when the rest of the world conducts
fiscal consolidation at the same time, the output
cost to Canada more than doubles, to 2 percent.
This simulation illustrates that, when interest
rates are near zero, international spillovers are
important.
•• When central banks are able to cut interest rates,
the difference between the Canada-only consolidation and the global consolidation is smaller. This
reflects the interplay of two forces. On the one
hand, the fiscal contraction in the rest of the world
reduces demand for Canadian exports, and the
exchange rate provides a smaller buffer—currencies cannot all depreciate at the same time. But on
the other hand, the interest rate is now unconstrained by the zero bound, and the central bank
can thus respond with more monetary stimulus.
These larger interest rate cuts play a substantial
cushioning role, and the additional output cost of
global consolidation is therefore modest.
Overall, these results illustrate that changes
in both the interest rate and the exchange rate
are important to the adjustment process. When
countries cannot rely on the exchange rate channel
to stimulate net exports, as in the case of the global
consolidation, and cannot ease monetary policy to
stimulate domestic demand, due to the zero interest
rate floor, the output costs of fiscal consolidation
are much larger. Thus, in the presence of the zero
interest rate floor, there could be large output costs
associated with front-loaded fiscal retrenchment
implemented across all the large economies at the
same time.

chapter 3

Long-Term Effects of Reducing Government Debt
The discussion so far has focused on short-term
effects. We now turn to the long term. Does fiscal
consolidation generate long-term gains? And if
so, how soon do the long-term gains arrive? This
question is one that cannot be adequately addressed
using the empirical framework used in the previous
section, and so we again use model simulations.
To focus the discussion, we consider a fiscal
consolidation that, over time, reduces the government-debt-to-GDP ratio by 10 percentage points
in each of the G3 currency areas (euro area, Japan,
United States). As in the simulations discussed
above, the consolidation is based on permanent cuts
to government consumption and transfers. As the
debt-to-GDP ratio declines, the burden of interest payments falls, and the resulting savings may
be used to finance either new tax cuts or spending
increases. In the main simulation reported here, we
assume that the savings are used to reduce labor
income taxes. The tax cuts are designed to ensure
that the debt-to-GDP ratio stabilizes at 10 percentage points below the initial level.
The simulations suggest that, over the long term,
a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to
raise output both in the G3 economies and in the
rest of the world. Two main factors underlie this
increase:
•• Lower real interest rates: Reducing the fiscal deficit
raises the overall G3 saving rate and improves
the G3 current account balance.39 Over time, the
greater supply of savings lowers the real interest
rate. In the simulation, the 10 percentage point
fall in the debt-to-GDP ratio helps produce a
fall in the G3 real interest rate of about 30 basis
points (Table 3.1).40 Since capital is assumed to
be mobile across borders, the real interest rate
falls by the same amount in the rest of the world.
In turn, lower real interest rates “crowd in”

account balance is a worsening in the current account balance of
the rest of the world. The magnitude of this effect will depend
on the degree to which government bonds are treated as net
wealth and the sensitivity of aggregate consumption to changes
in real interest rates.
40 The magnitude of this interest rate–debt link is in line with
empirical estimates in the literature, such as Engen and Hubbard
(2004), Laubach (2009), and Baldacci and Kumar (2010).

private investment, thereby raising the stock of
physical capital and GDP over the long term.41
In the baseline simulation, the stock of physical
capital rises by 2.1 percent in the G3 and by 1.6
in the rest of the world. Meanwhile, the level of
GDP rises by 1.4 percent in the G3 and by 0.8
percent in the rest of the world.
•• Lower income taxes: The lower interest rates
and lower stock of government debt generate
savings in terms of lower interest payments
that can be used to finance tax cuts. In the
baseline simulation, we assume that the savings
are used to lower taxes on labor income. Since
labor income taxes discourage workers from
supplying labor, reducing them raises labor
supply and output. As the lower panel of Table
3.1 reports, using the savings to cut capital
income taxes instead has an even more beneficial impact on GDP in the long term. This is a
reflection of capital income taxes’ strong negative effect on private sector investment. On the
other hand, if the savings are used to finance

subsection has not taken into account the likelihood
that reduced government debt would reduce risk premiums in
market interest rates. A lower expected level of debt would alleviate concerns that the fiscal outcome might become unsustainable. That is, it would reduce the perceived risks of default and
inflation. Reduced risk premiums in government and private
sector borrowing rates would enhance and accelerate long-term
positive effects on output.

cuts to consumption taxes, or to finance higher
spending on government transfer programs, the
long-term output gains are smaller.42 Finally,
there are positive spillover effects from the G3
to the rest of the world arising through trade
linkages. The more G3 incomes rise over the
long term, the more goods the G3 economies
import and the more income this generates for
the rest of the world.43
How long does it take for the positive output
effects to outweigh the negative short-term effects?
GIMF simulations suggest that for a consolidation based on cuts to government consumption
and transfers, GDP is lower than baseline for three
years before rising above the baseline forever. The
break-even point, at which the sum of the annual
GDP losses in the early years is just offset by the
sum of the gains later on, occurs five years from
the start date.

42 This

ranking is consistent with the standard view of the
relative distortionary supply-side aspects of the various fiscal
instruments.
43 Fiscal consolidation in the G3 generates a permanent
improvement in the G3 current account balance, which implies a
declining path for the G3 ratio of net foreign liabilities (NFL) to
GDP. Over the long term, in the GIMF, an increase in imports
relative to exports ensures that the NFL-to-GDP ratio stabilizes
at a lower level instead of perpetually falling.

chapter 3

Lessons for Countries Considering Fiscal
Consolidation
This section summarizes the principal findings
of the chapter and outlines key lessons for countries considering fiscal consolidation in today’s
environment. Virtually all advanced economies
are likely to conduct fiscal consolidation at some
point in the future to put their fiscal positions
back on a sustainable footing. The evidence based
on historical analysis for advanced economies and
model simulations in this chapter provides several
lessons.
The idea that fiscal austerity triggers faster growth
in the short term finds little support in the data.
Fiscal retrenchment typically has contractionary
short-term effects on economic activity, with lower
output and higher unemployment. A budget cut
equal to 1 percent of GDP typically reduces domestic demand by about 1 percent and raises the unemployment rate by 0.3 percentage point. At the same
time, an expansion in net exports usually occurs,
and this limits the impact on GDP to a decline of
0.5 percent.
Central banks usually offset some of the contractionary pressure by reducing policy rates, and
longer-term interest rates typically decline, cushioning the impact on domestic demand. Undertaking
fiscal consolidation is likely to have more negative
short-term effects if—as is currently the case in a
number of countries––interest rates are near zero
and central banks are constrained in their ability to
provide monetary stimulus.
A decline in the real value of the domestic
currency typically plays an important cushioning role by spurring net exports and is usually
the result of nominal depreciation or currency
devaluation. Therefore, because not all countries
can have real depreciations and increase their
net exports at the same time, simultaneous fiscal
consolidation by many countries is likely to be
particularly costly. Fiscal retrenchment is also
likely to be more costly for members of a monetary union where scope for a fall in the value of
their currency is reduced. At the same time, in
the current global environment, heightened market sensitivity to fiscal deficits and government

Will It Hurt? Macroeconomic Effects of Fiscal Consolidation

debt may imply that no adjustment could have a
negative impact on growth.
The findings also suggest that spending-based
deficit cuts, particularly those that rely on cuts to
transfers, have smaller contractionary effects than
tax-based adjustments. A key reason for this difference is that central banks typically provide less
monetary stimulus during tax-based adjustments,
particularly when they involve hikes in indirect
taxes that put upward pressure on inflation. This
finding again highlights that the fiscal adjustment
process is likely to be more painful without the supportive role of interest rate cuts.
Fiscal retrenchment in countries that face a
higher perceived sovereign default risk tends to
be less contractionary. But expansionary effects of
consolidation are unusual even for this group. This
result implies that short-term negative effects are
likely to be smaller in economies currently facing
greater market pressure.
In addition, fiscal consolidation is likely to be
beneficial over the long term. In particular, lower
debt is likely to reduce real interest rates and the
burden of interest payments, allowing for future
cuts to distortionary taxes. These effects will likely
crowd in investment and increase output in the
long term.
Finally, as discussed in Chapter 1, a number
of policy actions could enhance the credibility of
fiscal adjustment programs, thereby mitigating the
adverse effects of fiscal consolidation in the short
term. Such actions could include strengthening
fiscal institutions and reforming pension entitlements and public health care systems. To the extent
that such measures improve household and business confidence and raise expectations about future
income, they could help support activity during the
process of fiscal adjustment.

The sources of the data used for the analysis are
listed in Table 3.2. The episodes of fiscal consolidation identified based on the action-based approach
are reported in Tables 3.3 and 3.4. The episodes of
fiscal consolidation identified based on the standard
approach are reported on Table 3.5.

shifts in global variables, such as the global business
cycle. The country-fixed effect captures differences
in countries’ steady-state growth rates. F-tests reject
the absence of country- and time-fixed effects. The
impulse response function for the effect of the fiscal
actions on the level of output, along with one-standard-error bands, is obtained via the delta method.
Several robustness checks were conducted:
•• Excluding lags of growth had little effect on the
results (Figure 3.13). If consolidation is less likely
in a weak economy, there should be a correlation
between lagged output growth and consolidation, and controlling for lagged output would
have an appreciable impact on the estimates. The
finding that it does not is therefore reassuring, as
it suggests that this source of bias is small in our
sample.44
•• Using an alternative estimation approach––the
Arellano-Bond (1991) procedure––had little
effect on the results (Figure 3.14). As discussed
above, this result suggests that the bias due to
fixed effects being correlated with the lagged
dependent variables is small in this sample.
•• Splitting the sample of fiscal consolidation
according to size of government (tax-to-GDP
ratio in the three years preceding fiscal consolidation) yielded an interesting result. Economies
that initially have a larger size of government
(above the median tax-to-GDP ratio of 42 percent) have smaller output costs than those with
a smaller initial size of government.45 However,
larger governments are also more likely to engage
in spending-based consolidation than smaller
governments. Keeping composition constant,
the differences due to government size are less
apparent. In particular, tax-based consolidation
is equally costly in terms of lost output for large
and small governments. Therefore, it seems that
the type of consolidation (tax- versus spendingbased) is more important than the size of government in determining the output cost of fiscal
consolidation.
44 In addition, using different lag lengths (up to four) yielded
similar results.
45 Similar results were obtained using the government-spending-to-GDP ratio as a proxy for government size.

•• The results were more contractionary when
the sample of fiscal adjustments was limited to
episodes occurring in economies with a fixed
exchange rate regime. This result held up under
both the IMF’s de facto and de jure classification
of exchange rate regimes. The result is consistent with standard Mundell-Fleming theory
and a number of recent studies, such as Ilzetzki,
Mendoza, and Végh (2009), who find that fiscal
multipliers are larger in economies with fixed
exchange rate regimes.
•• Splitting the sample of fiscal consolidation
episodes according to openness to trade (ratio of
exports plus imports to GDP) did not materially
change the results.

Consolidation: The Standard Approach versus

Figure 3.15 provides a scatter plot of increases
in the cyclically adjusted primary budget balance
(CAPB)––the standard measure of fiscal consolidation––on the vertical axis versus the size of fiscal
consolidation based on the policy record on the
horizontal axis. The figure reports years for which
either the CAPB-to-GDP ratio increased or the
policy record indicated fiscal consolidation.46 The
CAPB-to-GDP data are from Alesina and Ardagna
(2010).47 The top-right corner of the scatter plot
shows cases in which the two measures agree that
there was a large fiscal consolidation (greater than
1.5 percent of GDP). It includes cases such as
Denmark (1983) and Ireland (1987)––the two cases
highlighted by Giavazzi and Pagano (1990) in their
work on expansionary fiscal contraction. However,
Figure 3.15 also reports numerous cases in which
the standard approach and our approach come to
different conclusions regarding the presence and size
of fiscal consolidation.

Which approach typically more accurately identifies fiscal consolidation? To address this question,
we focus on the largest discrepancies between the
two approaches: the 10 cases for which the discrepancy between the two approaches exceeded
3 percent of GDP. In each of these cases, fiscal
consolidation was assessed as large (greater than
1.5 percentage points of GDP) by at least one of
the two approaches. These 10 cases are highlighted
in Figure 3.15.
We start with the cases in the top-left corner of
Figure 3.15, which contains five periods identified as large consolidations based on the standard
approach, but for which the policy record shows
either only a small consolidation or no consolidation at all.
•• Germany (1996): The CAPB-to-GDP ratio
increased by 6.4 percentage points, but the policy
record indicates fiscal consolidation measures
amounting to only 0.2 percent of GDP. The
large increase in the CAPB-to-GDP ratio in
1996 reflected a large one-time capital transfer
in 1995, which implied a change in the CAPBto-GDP ratio of about –7 percentage points in
1995 and 6.4 percentage points in 1996. The
sharp increase in the CAPB in 1996 thus had
nothing to do with fiscal austerity measures. In
particular, as reported in the 1996 IMF Recent
Economic Developments report (p. 18), a one-time
transfer of Treuhand (Trust Agency) and East
German housing debt to the general government
amounting to 6.8 percent of GDP occurred
in 1995. This operation was recorded by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) as a one-time increase in
capital transfers that raised the general government deficit from 2.3 percent of GDP in 1994
to 9.7 percent of GDP in 1995. The deficit
returned to a more normal level in 1996, at 3.3
percent of GDP. Therefore, the sharp increase
in the CAPB in 1996 bears no relation to fiscal
austerity measures, but instead reflects the end of
a one-time capital transfer.
•• Japan (1999): The CAPB-to-GDP ratio rose
by about 4.9 percentage points, but the policy
record shows no evidence of fiscal consolidation
measures. Indeed, Japan’s fiscal consolidation

chapter 3

program, initiated in 1997, was suspended in
1998 following the onset of a severe recession,
and there is no evidence of measures designed
to cut the budget deficit until 2002, when
the authorities announced a new multiyear
program of fiscal consolidation (2003 OECD
Economic Survey: Japan, p. 15). Instead, as the
1998 OECD Economic Survey: Japan reports (p.
84), the government made a one-time capital
transfer in 1998 to the Japan National Railway,
amounting to about ¥24.3 trillion (4.8 percent
of GDP). The one-time nature of this capital
transfer implies a change in the (general government) CAPB of about 4.8 percentage points of
GDP in the following year, 1999. This increase is
similar to the 4.9 percentage point change in the
CAPB-to-GDP ratio computed by Alesina and
Ardagna (2010). Therefore, the sharp increase
in the CAPB in 1999 bears no relation to fiscal
austerity measures, but instead reflects the end of
a one-time capital transfer.
•• Finland (2000): The CAPB-to-GDP ratio
increased by 4.1 percentage points, but the policy
record shows fiscal consolidation measures amounting to only 0.9 percent of GDP.48 This episode corresponds to an asset price boom: real stock prices
in Finland rose by 70 percent in 1999 and by 86
percent in 2000 (Haver Analytics). Of the 4.1 percentage point increase in the CAPB-to-GDP ratio,
2 percentage points reflect a rise in revenue from
one-time factors unrelated to policy actions.49
These one-time factors included a rise in tax revenue associated with stock-option and capital gains
and an increase in non-tax (property income) revenue partly due to an extraordinary dividend issued
by the fully state-owned bank Leonia on the eve
of its merger with the private insurance company
Sampo. Regarding the remaining 1.2 percentage
point discrepancy relative to the historical record
(2.1 versus 0.9), the OECD Economic Outlook
database indicates a fall in cyclically adjusted
social security outlays of about 1 percentage point.
48 The fiscal measures reflected mainly central government
spending restraint (OECD Economic Surveys 1999–2000, p. 36).
49 The 2001–02 issue of OECD Economic Surveys: Finland
reports the 2000 budget outcome as “a very high surplus mainly
due to one-off factors” (p. 37).

Will It Hurt? Macroeconomic Effects of Fiscal Consolidation

However, we can find no mention of social security
cuts in the historical record, such as in the OECD
Economic Survey.50 Overall, therefore, we conclude
that the increase in the CAPB-to-GDP ratio of 4.1
percentage points overstates the amount of consolidation in 2000 by at least 2 percentage points and
probably closer to 3.
•• Japan (2006): The CAPB-to-GDP ratio increased
by 4.1 percentage points, but the policy record
indicates fiscal consolidation measures amounting
to only 0.67 percent of GDP, implying a discrepancy of about 3.4 percent of GDP. In terms of
actual consolidation measures, the policy record
indicates a cut in public investment of about
0.27 percent of GDP (2007 IMF Staff Report,
pp. 32–33) and income tax hikes worth about
¥2 trillion (0.4 percent of GDP—Takahashi and
Tokuoka, 2010). At the same time, the CAPB-toGDP ratio reported in the 2008 OECD Economic
Surveys: Japan rose by 3.2 percentage points in
2006 (Table 3.1, p. 65, line 4). Thus, some (0.9
percentage point) of the discrepancy is due to
differences between the OECD Economic Survey
and Alesina and Ardagna (2010) in the method
used to compute the CAPB. In addition, the
OECD Economic Survey indicates that a large part
of the CAPB increase resulted from one-time
asset operations that improved the fiscal balance
in 2006 but were unrelated to tax hikes or spending cuts.51 Without these one-time asset operations, the 2008 OECD Economic Survey: Japan
estimates that the CAPB-to-GDP ratio increased
by only 0.4 percentage point in 2006 (OECD
Table 3.1, p. 65, line 8). Therefore, once the
change in the CAPB-to-GDP ratio is adjusted to
remove the influence of asset operations unrelated to tax hikes and spending cuts, the increase

50 Note that cuts to social security spending, which is not
recorded as central government spending, are not part of the
measures amounting to 0.9 percent of GDP that we identify in
the policy record.
51 The 2008 OECD Economic Survey: Japan reports that the
one-time factors include receipts of funds by the government
from corporate pension funds, receipts associated with the privatization of highway corporations, and receipts from the “transfer
of the reserve fund from the Fiscal Loan Fund Special Account
to the central government” (p. 65).

in the CAPB-to-GDP ratio is close to our estimate of policy measures of 0.67 percent of GDP.
•• Belgium (1984): The CAPB-to-GDP ratio
increased by 4.7 percentage points, but the policy
record indicates fiscal consolidation measures
amounting to 0.88 percent of GDP, implying a
discrepancy of about 3.8 percent of GDP.52 At
the same time, the CAPB-to-GDP ratio reported
in the OECD Economic Outlook database rises
by 4.1 percentage points in 1984. Thus, some of
the discrepancy (0.6 percentage point) is due to
differences in the method used to compute the
CAPB. Of the remaining discrepancy (3.2 percentage points), most is explained by the end of
a one-time capital transfer made in 1983. In particular, the OECD Economic Outlook database
indicates a one-time increase in capital transfers
in 1983 that reduced the CAPB-to-GDP ratio
by 2.1 percentage points in 1983. When this
one-time transfer came to an end in 1984, it
caused the CAPB-to-GDP ratio to rise by 2.1
percentage points (OECD Economic Outlook
database). Therefore, excluding the influence of
this one-time capital transfer, the discrepancy
between the standard approach and our actionbased approach shrinks from 3.2 percent of GDP
to 1.1 percent of GDP (3.2 minus 2.1).53
Next we turn to the five cases in the bottomright corner of Figure 3.15––periods that are
identified as large consolidations based on our
action-based approach, but which feature either a
fall or a small increase in the CAPB.
•• Ireland (2009): Here, the CAPB-to-GDP ratio
fell by about 4.4 percentage points, but the
historical record reports that fiscal consolidation measures of about 4.5 percent of GDP were
implemented in 2009. These measures included
52 According to the policy record, fiscal consolidation consisted
of a “levy of 2 percent a year for three years on earned incomes,”
which was expected to increase revenue by 0.75 percentage point
of GDP in 1984 (1984/1985 OECD Economic Surveys: Belgium,
p. 11), and spending cuts of 0.13 percent of GDP consisting
of cuts to the public sector wage bill, public sector operating
costs, and social security savings (IMF, Belgium: Recent Economic
Developments, 1984, p. 47).
53 The policy record suggests that the increase in capital transfers in 1983 reflected “direct aid to industry” (1985/1986 OECD
Economic Survey: Belgium, pp. 25–26).

both tax hikes and spending cuts.54 The fall in
the CAPB despite a substantial fiscal consolidation reflects the impact of the financial crisis
during which stock and house prices fell sharply.55 For reasons discussed above, such sharp
contractions tend to have a negative impact on
the CAPB, causing the CAPB-based approach
to inaccurately identify the size of consolidation
measures. Indeed, while the CAPB-to-GDP ratio
computed by Alesina and Ardagna (2010) falls
by 4.4 percentage points, the CAPB-to-GDP
ratio computed by the OECD falls by only
1.1 percentage points. As expected, the fall in the
CAPB-to-GDP ratio is driven by a sharp decline
in cyclically adjusted tax revenue, which falls by
2.6 percentage points in 2009 according to the
OECD’s calculations. Government tax revenue
directly related to asset prices––capital gains taxes
and stamp duties––fell by 1 percent of GDP in
2009.56 Another 0.8 percentage point decline in
the CAPB-to-GDP ratio is driven by an increase
in cyclically adjusted social security benefit payments that have no counterpart in the policy
record. Excluding these cyclically adjusted items,
the CAPB-to-GDP ratio rises by 2.3 percentage points (–1.1 1 2.6 1 0.8), which represents
a large fiscal consolidation and is substantially
closer to our estimated size of fiscal consolidation
than the Alesina and Ardagna (2010) estimate of
–4.4 percentage points.
•• Italy (1993): The CAPB-to-GDP ratio increased by
only 0.2 percentage point in 1993, but the policy
record reports a large consolidation of 4.3 percent
of GDP. A plausible reason for this large discrepancy is that there was a sharp economic contraction
54 The 2009 OECD Economic Survey: Ireland (p. 50) and EC
(2008, p. D15) report spending cuts in 2009 of €1 billion (0.6
percent of GDP) announced in July 2008, and the 2009 OECD
Economic Survey: Ireland (pp. 50–51) reports additional spending
cuts and tax hikes amounting to 3.9 percent of GDP, implying a
total consolidation of 4.5 percent of GDP.
55 Real stock and house prices fell by 44 percent and 20 percent in 2009, respectively (Haver Analytics database).
56 Revenue from capital gains taxes and stamp duties fell by
73 and 45 percent in 2009 (Ministry of Finance white paper
on receipts and expenditures 2009 and 2010). There was also a
sharp fall in the cyclically adjusted indirect-tax-to-GDP ratio,
which fell by 1.4 percentage points (OECD Economic Outlook
database).

chapter 3

in 1993 associated with the European exchange rate
mechanism crisis, which, for the reasons explained
above, causes the CAPB-based approach to be
inaccurate. Indeed, while the CAPB-to-GDP ratio
computed by Alesina and Ardagna (2010) increases
by 0.2 percentage point, the CAPB-to-GDP ratio
computed by the OECD increases by 1.9 percentage points (OECD Economic Outlook database).
The OECD’s calculation of the change in the
CAPB-to-GDP ratio is therefore consistent with
a large fiscal consolidation in 1993 (greater than
1.5 percent of GDP). However, even this estimate
of fiscal consolidation is substantially smaller than
what is in the policy record. In particular, according
to the OECD Economic Surveys and the IMF Recent
Economic Developments reports, fiscal consolidation
measures in 1993 amounted to more than 4 percent
of GDP. The source of the remaining discrepancy
vis-à-vis the change in the CAPB-to-GDP ratio
could plausibly reflect the fact that, during sharp
recessions, cyclical-adjustment techniques tend to
allocate part of the fiscal worsening due to automatic stabilizers to a fall in the CAPB. This problem causes the increase in the CAPB to understate
the size of fiscal consolidation measures.
•• Finland (1992) and (1993): The CAPB-to-GDP
ratio fell by 2.0 percentage points in 1992 and rose
by 0.8 percentage point in 1993, but the policy
record indicates consolidation measures amounting to 1.8 and 3.8 percent of GDP in 1992 and
1993, respectively. The fall in the CAPB in 1992
despite evidence of fiscal austerity measures during
those years was probably due to the depth of the
recession after the outbreak of the Finnish banking
crisis at the end of 1991.57 For reasons explained
above, these developments probably depressed
tax revenue and increased social security transfers
beyond what could have been predicted based on
standard cyclical-adjustment techniques. In line
with this notion, the cyclically adjusted tax-revenueto-GDP ratio fell in 1992 by 1.2 percentage
points, and the cyclically adjusted social-securityspending-to-GDP ratio rose by 2.3 percentage
57 Real GDP fell by 6.4 percent in 1991 and 3.8 percent in
1992, and the unemployment rate increased by 5.1 percentage
points in 1992. In 1993, real GDP fell by another 0.9 percent
and the unemployment rate increased by 4.6 percentage points.

points (OECD Economic Outlook database).
Excluding these two cyclically adjusted items, the
CAPB-to-GDP ratio rose by 1.5 percentage points
in 1992, close to the size of consolidation based
on the policy record (1.8 percent of GDP). Similarly, in 1993, as the sharp recession continued,
the cyclically adjusted tax-revenue-to-GDP ratio
fell by 1.1 percentage points, and the cyclically
adjusted social-security-spending-to-GDP ratio
rose by 1.9 percentage points. Excluding these
two cyclically adjusted items, the CAPB-to-GDP
ratio rose by 3.8 percentage points in 1992, in line
with the size of consolidation based on the policy
record (3.8 percent of GDP).
•• Ireland (1982): The CAPB-to-GDP ratio
increased by 0.05 percentage point, but the
narrative record indicates fiscal consolidation
measures totaling 3.8 percent of GDP. The small
increase in the CAPB reflects the problems of
cyclical-adjustment techniques during episodes
in which consolidation consists of consumption
tax hikes and in which there is a large decline in
private consumption. In particular, Ireland’s 1982
fiscal consolidation package included substantial
increases in value-added tax (VAT) rates (from
10 to 18 percent in the lower rate, and from 25
to 30 percent in the standard rate) and in excise
duties. At the same time, real private consumption fell by 7.1 percent, although real GDP grew
by 2.3 percent, supported by external demand.
This is the only year since 1970 in which private
consumption fell while GDP grew. The result
was a small increase in VAT receipts for a given
level of GDP. The change in tax rates is not taken
into account by the CAPB-based approach, as
fiscal variables are cyclically adjusted with respect
to overall GDP and the elasticity is assumed to
be constant over time. Therefore, the CAPB-toGDP ratio fails to pick up the large tax hikes that
occurred that year. The OECD’s CAPB-to-GDP
ratio increases by more than that of Alesina and
Ardagna (2010)––0.8 percentage point––leaving
a discrepancy of 3 percent of GDP relative to our
action-based fiscal consolidation measure. The
following simple calculation illustrates how more
than half of this remaining discrepancy could
be due to the unusual behavior of consumption
International Monetary Fund | October 2010

121

world economic outlook: Recovery, Risk, and rebalancing

during this episode. If the consumption-to-GDP
ratio in 1982 had remained at the 1981 level
of 65 percent, instead of falling to 59 percent,
the VAT hike would have added 1.6 percentage points to the cyclically adjusted tax-to-GDP
ratio.58 This increase in cyclically adjusted tax
revenue would have raised the CAPB-to-GDP
ratio from the OECD’s 0.8 percentage point to
2.4 percentage points, far closer to our actionbased measure of fiscal consolidation (3.8 percent
of GDP). Overall, this is a case in which the
standard approach seems to miss a large part of
the fiscal austerity measures.
This examination of the 10 largest disagreements between the two approaches provides strong
evidence that our action-based approach more
accurately identifies the size of fiscal consolidation.
We find seven cases where we are able to identify
specific economic or budgetary developments that
cause the CAPB-based measures used by Alesina
and Ardagna (2010) to inaccurately identify the size
of the consolidation and that largely explain the
gap between the two measures. In the remaining
three cases (Italy in 1993 and Finland in 1992 and
1993), there were crises or large economic contractions that could plausibly have caused the CAPBbased approach to be highly inaccurate. We find no
cases where there is evidence that our action-based
measure was substantially inaccurate.

particular, the indirect-tax-to-GDP ratio in 1982 was

Therefore, keeping the consumption-to-GDP ratio at the 1981

Do Financial Crises Have Lasting Effects on Trade?

This chapter looks at trade dynamics following
banking and debt crises, to help us understand how
trade might evolve for economies recently affected by
such crises. Imports of the crisis economy tend to fall
substantially in the short term—beyond what would
be expected from the decline in output—and they
stay depressed through the medium term. In contrast, exports of the crisis economy are not as badly
affected. These findings suggest that the recovery
of import demand in the United States and much
of western Europe may be even more anemic than
suggested by their relatively weak projected output
recoveries. Thus, the narrowing of the large current account deficits of some crisis countries such as
the United States that occurred in 2009 may prove
to be quite durable. For economies that experience
a crisis, the chapter underscores the importance of
embracing structural reforms to help support the
recovery of output and trade. For economies that rely
heavily on external demand for their growth, the
chapter’s findings highlight the urgency of reorienting growth by strengthening domestic demand.

One of the most notable features of the Great
Recession was the “sudden, severe, and synchronized”
collapse in trade in late 2008 and early 2009 (Baldwin,
2009). In the half-year encompassing the last quarter
of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, the annualized
drop in world imports was more than 30 percent, with
roughly equal declines experienced by advanced and
emerging economies (Figure 4.1). The fall in trade
spared no one—all economies experienced a drop in
both exports and imports during this period. Likewise,
growth in trade in virtually all product categories went
from positive in the second quarter of 2008 to negative by the first quarter of 2009.
The rapid recovery in trade that began in the
second half of 2009 has been remarkable as well.
The main authors of this chapter are Abdul Abiad, Prachi
Mishra, and Petia Topalova, with support from Gavin Asdorian,
Stephanie Denis, and Andy Salazar. Donald Davis was the
external consultant.

World imports grew at an annualized rate of
more than 20 percent in the last two quarters
of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010. However, as this chapter shows, trade remains below
its precrisis trend, and for some economies—
particularly those hit by a banking crisis—it
remains below precrisis levels. Because the recent
crises occurred in large, advanced economies
that account for a substantial portion of global
demand, the speed and extent of their trade
recovery will affect the growth prospects not only
of the crisis economies but also of their trading
partners.
This chapter looks at trade dynamics following banking and debt crises, to help us
understand how trade might evolve for economies that are affected by such crises. It continues
the research agenda pursued in recent issues
of the World Economic Outlook to analyze the
medium-term macroeconomic consequences
of crises. This chapter addresses the following
questions:
•• To what extent has trade recovered from the
recent global recession? Have the speed and
extent of the recovery differed among economies, particularly between those that suffered a
banking crisis and those that did not? Has the
recovery varied across different product groups?
•• How has trade behaved in the wake of previous
banking and debt crises? Do such crises have lasting effects on trade?
•• What factors apart from the level of output are
associated with sharp declines in trade following
a crisis? And what role can postcrisis policies and
conditions play in enhancing the recovery of trade?
•• What are the implications for the recovery of
trade from the recent crisis? And what lessons can
be drawn for the future?
Much of the recent literature on trade and crises
has focused on the recent global downturn and specifically on explaining the “Great Trade Collapse”—
that is, on why world trade fell by much more than

GDP.1 Only a few papers have looked at the full
dynamics of trade—both declines and recoveries—
following earlier crises. Among these, Freund (2009)
describes the evolution of world trade following four
previous global downturns. She finds that the size of
the decline in world trade during these episodes is
almost five times the corresponding decline in world
GDP. She also finds that, while world trade growth
resumes quickly following a global downturn, it takes
more than three years for trade to reach predownturn
levels. This chapter does not focus on trade dynamics following global downturns but instead on what
happens to the trade of individual economies that
experience a banking or debt crisis; it should thus be
seen as a complement to Freund’s work.2
This chapter uses a methodology derived from
the “gravity model,” the standard workhorse for
modeling trade flows. The gravity model is widely
used to explain the level of bilateral trade flows
on the basis of individual characteristics of each
partner (size and level of economic development)
as well as the characteristics of the country pair
(distance between them and whether they share a
common border, language, or currency). However,
the standard gravity model best describes patterns
of trade between economies rather than over time
and therefore may not provide an accurate picture
of what happens to aggregate trade for a particular
economy in the aftermath of a crisis. This chapter
therefore uses a “collapsed” version of the gravity model, estimated in differences, that analyzes
changes in aggregate trade flows.3 We examine
episodes of banking and debt crises over the past
40 years and track the changes in imports and
exports both to estimate the overall trade declines
and to measure the association of various factors

2Similar in spirit and methodology to this chapter is the
analysis by Berman and Martin (2010) of the vulnerability of
sub-Saharan African economies to financial crises in advanced
economies. They find that a financial crisis has a moderate but
long-lasting effect on trading partners’ exports but that the effect
is larger for African exporters.

gives similar results, as described in Appendix 4.2, which outlines
the robustness tests performed as part of this analysis.

such as output and exchange rate dynamics with
the postcrisis behavior of trade.
The main findings of the chapter are as follows:
•• There is a sharp decline in an economy’s
imports following a crisis—16 percent, on
average—and this decline is persistent, with
imports remaining below normal (that is, below
their predicted level in the absence of a crisis)
even over the medium term. Depressed output
does not explain the entire decline in postcrisis
imports.
•• Exports of the crisis economy are not as adversely
affected. There is a small and gradual decline in
exports, so that, in the medium term, exports are
on average about 8 percent below their predicted level in the absence of a crisis. And unlike
for imports, all of the export decline can be
explained by adverse output dynamics; after controlling for output declines, export performance
is no different from normal.
•• Weak output remains the most important factor
in the decline of imports in both the short and
the medium term, but other factors also play a
role. In particular, impaired credit conditions
are associated with a weaker recovery in imports
(above and beyond the impact of weak credit on
output), especially in the medium term. In the
short term, increased exchange rate volatility and
currency depreciation are associated with import
losses. There is no evidence that tariffs and
antidumping measures rise, on average, during
crisis periods. There is also evidence to suggest
that “the composition effect” can account for at
least a portion of postcrisis import losses: during
crises, demand falls primarily in products that
comprise a larger share of trade than of output,
such as durables.
•• Pre- and postcrisis conditions and policies affect
the behavior of trade following a crisis. Import
losses tend to be greater for economies entering a
crisis with a relatively weak current account position—suggesting that external imbalances tend
to diminish following a crisis. Imports also fare
worse when the crisis is accompanied by greater
currency depreciation and exchange rate volatility, relatively weaker credit conditions, and larger
increases in protectionism.

These findings suggest that the full recovery of
import demand in countries that recently suffered a
banking crisis—including the United States and the
United Kingdom—may be even more protracted than
suggested by their relatively slow projected output
recovery. Thus, the narrowing of the large current
account deficits in some crisis countries such as the
United States that occurred in 2009 may prove to be
quite durable. For economies that experience a crisis,
the chapter underscores the importance of embracing structural reforms to help support the recovery of
output and trade. For economies that rely heavily on
demand from those countries for their growth, the
chapter’s findings highlight the urgency of rebalancing
growth by strengthening domestic demand.
It is important to emphasize from the outset that
this chapter seeks to identify patterns and correlations
rather than to establish causality between various policies and initial conditions on one hand and postcrisis
trade dynamics on the other. Many of the variables
we explore, including credit and the exchange rate, are
likely to be simultaneously determined with trade. For
example, do adverse credit conditions in the aftermath
of a crisis hinder trade finance and reduce trade flows?
Or are weak credit and anemic trade both manifestations of depressed postcrisis economic conditions?
Sorting out these possibilities is beyond the scope of
this chapter.
The remainder of the chapter is structured as
follows. The first section describes the behavior of
trade following the recent global downturn, documenting both the collapse in trade and the recovery
to date, and exploring differences across economies
and product categories. The second section uses a
regression framework to analyze earlier crisis episodes, providing estimates of the size of import and
export losses in both the short and medium term.
The third section examines the extent to which
postcrisis import dynamics are associated with various factors such as credit, protection, and exchange
rate dynamics. The fourth section discusses implications for the global economic outlook.

Has Trade Recovered?

2008 and early 2009 was quite severe. The annualInternational Monetary Fund | October 2010

ized quarter-over-quarter drop in global real GDP
in the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of
2009 averaged just under 6 percent, but the drop in
global real imports was five times as large, averaging
over 30 percent (Figure 4.2, top panel). The emerging consensus is that much of the outsize decline in
trade can be explained by the “composition effect.”
That is, the increased uncertainty following the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008
and the subsequent freezing of credit markets led to
a collapse in demand for “postponable” items such as
capital goods and consumer durables. And because
those items account for a much larger share of trade
than of GDP, the former fell by much more than the
latter.4 Box 4.1 discusses the role of the composition
effect and vertical linkages—the use of imported
intermediate goods to produce exports—in the recent
trade collapse.
The recovery in world trade began in the second
half of 2009 and appears quite strong: the annualized
growth in world real imports in the last two quarters
of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 was over 20
percent. So has trade fully recovered? Unfortunately,
it has not, and the extent of the recovery differs
substantially across economies and across products.
An important distinction across economies seems
to be whether an economy recently went through a
banking crisis.5 In economies that avoided a crisis,
imports are just slightly below the precrisis peak
reached in the second quarter of 2008, although this
still leaves them almost 15 percent below a simple
extrapolation of the 2001–07 precrisis trend (Figure
4.2, middle panels).6 In contrast, imports in the crisis
economies remain more than 20 percent below their
precrisis levels and almost 40 percent below their
precrisis trend. Because the crisis economies include
the United States and much of western Europe,
4A

related but distinct explanation is that firms chose to run
down inventories in response to increased uncertainty; see Alessandria, Kaboski, and Midrigan (forthcoming) for evidence from
the United States.
5As discussed below, our banking crisis episodes are taken
from Laeven and Valencia (2010).
6Of course, the precrisis trend may reflect unsustainable
growth dynamics that ultimately led to a crisis and hence may
not be considered “normal.” The methodology used in this
chapter does not rely on deviations from precrisis trends, but
estimates normal trade flows given countries’ fundamentals.

chapter 4 Do Financial Crises Have Lasting Effects on Trade??

Box 4.1. The Role of the Composition Effect and Intermediate Goods in the Great Trade Collapse
The Great Recession was accompanied by a collapse in global trade. This box documents the role
of two sets of forces in the trade collapse.1 The first
is the “composition effect” and its contribution to
the outsize decline in global trade relative to GDP.
The second is the extent to which trade in intermediate goods made global trade more or less resilient
to the global recession.
The focus on these two forces is motivated by
two key facts:
•• The contraction in final demand during the
recent crisis was asymmetric across sectors, with
demand for durables falling by considerably
more than demand for nondurables or services.
For example, demand for durables in the United
States and the European Union fell by more
than 30 percent and 20 percent, respectively,
whereas demand for nondurables and services
fell by only 1 to 3 percent (first figure, top
panel).2 Because durable goods have a larger
weight in trade flows than in final demand (bottom panel), the asymmetrical changes in demand
across sectors caused global trade to fall by more
than aggregate demand.
•• Two-thirds of global trade comprises intermediate inputs to production rather than final goods,
and these two categories respond differently to
a contraction in final demand. Intermediate
goods are linked only indirectly to final demand,
whereas final goods are linked directly. In addition, durables, nondurables, and services have
different weights in overall trade flows for final
and intermediate goods.
We use a multicountry, three-sector (durables,
nondurables, services) framework to compute the
relative contributions of these two factors to the
collapse in global trade during 2008–09. Our
framework combines information from national
input-output matrices with detailed data on

world economic outlook: Recovery, Risk, and Rebalancing

Box 4.1 (continued)
In this framework, changes in final demand
shape trade flows through two channels: (1)
Imports of final goods change proportionally to
domestic final demand within each sector. (2)
Imports of intermediate goods change proportionally to gross production within each sector, which
itself responds to changes in final demand at home
and abroad. If final demand changes symmetrically
across sectors, then trade flows are proportional
to aggregate production and GDP. However, with
asymmetrical demand changes, this proportionality
does not hold.

How Important Was the Composition Effect?
To estimate the size of the composition effect,
we calculate how much output and trade would fall
under our framework given the observed sectorspecific final demand changes in the United States,
the European Union, and the rest of the world. We
then compare the simulated response of trade and
output to what actually happened during the Great
Recession. Our framework estimates a fall in global
trade that exceeds the fall in global GDP by a factor of 2.8, explaining more than 70 percent of the
observed trade elasticity in the data (second figure).
For comparison, a more restrictive, two-sector
framework with the same size demand changes for
durables and nondurables accounts for 60 percent
of the collapse; and a one-sector framework, which
eliminates all composition effects, generates a fall in
trade that is roughly proportional to GDP.
These results are consistent with other recent
efforts to quantify composition effects. Eaton
and others (2010) find that asymmetrical
demand changes account for 80 percent of the
global decline in the trade-to-GDP ratio during
the crisis in a three-sector Ricardian trade framework. Levchenko, Lewis, and Tesar (forthcom-

which account for a sizable portion of global import
demand, exports remain substantially below trend
for crisis and noncrisis economies alike (Figure 4.2,

remain about 25 to 30 percent below precrisis trends.
The extent of the recovery has also differed across
various product categories. Among the four catego130

ing) report that, for the U.S. economy, sectors
with larger reductions in domestic output had
larger drops in trade.

How Important Was Trade in Intermediate
Goods?
To gauge the role of intermediate goods trade
in the crisis, we compare the responses of trade
in intermediate and final goods to crisis-induced
changes in final demand. As noted, both intermediate and final goods trade would respond propor-

ries shown in Figure 4.3, consumer nondurables
declined the least during the collapse, and the subsequent recovery has brought trade in these products
almost completely back to its precrisis trend. Primary
goods (a category that includes commodities and that
went through a boom just prior to the crisis) and
intermediate goods both experienced sharp declines,

chapter 4 Do Financial Crises Have Lasting Effects on Trade??

tionally to demand changes that were symmetric
across sectors. With asymmetrical demand changes
and given the assumptions of our framework, the
response of trade in final goods depends on the size
of sectoral demand asymmetries and sectoral trade
weights, whereas the response of trade in intermediate goods depends on the size of sectoral supply
asymmetries and sectoral trade weights. All the necessary ingredients for the estimation are obtained
from the framework.
Simulations show that trade in intermediate
goods was more resilient to the decline in final
demand during the recent global downturn. The
relative resilience of trade in intermediates to
observed changes in final demand can be explained
by two factors:
•• The sectoral asymmetries for changes in gross
production (derived from our framework) are
smaller than the observed sectoral asymmetries
in final demand (third figure, top panel).4
•• Durables have a smaller weight in intermediate goods trade relative to their weight in final
goods trade (bottom panel).
The differences in the responses of trade in
intermediate and final goods are quantitatively
large. The elasticity of global trade in final goods to
GDP is estimated at 4.3, whereas the same elasticity for trade in intermediates is 2.0. These results
are broadly consistent with the chapter’s finding
that, in crisis episodes, trading partners with greater
production sharing show smaller declines in exports
to the crisis economy.

4This

result follows from the observation that services constitute a relatively large input in the production of durables
and, as a result, a contraction in final demand for durables
can significantly decrease the gross production of services.

but both are less than 10 percent below their precrisis
trend. In contrast, and as mentioned earlier, the
largest collapse was in capital and consumer durables,
and while there has been some recovery, trade in
that product category still remains almost 20 percent
below its precrisis trend.

In sum, while the global trade collapse spared no
one, import dynamics were particularly adverse for
economies that went through a banking crisis. And
while the recovery in trade has commenced, it is
highly uneven, with imports of crisis economies still
substantially below precrisis trends or even precrisis
levels. Finally, among product groups, capital and

consumer durables remain farthest from closing
the gap. Are these just transitory deviations from
normal, or might these gaps persist? Where might
trade be headed from here? The following section
examines the historical record for some clues.

Note: The precrisis linear trend is based on data between January 2001 and

Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, and United States.

The global reach and scale of the recent financial
crisis have few precedents, but history is replete with
individual economies experiencing either a banking
or a debt crisis. Laeven and Valencia (2008, 2010),
whose crisis dates are used in this chapter, identify
129 episodes of systemic banking crises since 1970—
defined as situations in which the financial sector
experiences a large number of defaults, nonperforming loans increase sharply, and all or most of the
aggregate banking system capital is used up. They
also identify 63 episodes of sovereign debt crises over
the same period—defined as an episode of sovereign
debt default and/or restructuring.7 We focus here
on banking and sovereign debt crises because the
most recent crises in the large advanced economies
have been systemic banking crises and because the
prospect of a sovereign debt crisis in a number of
economies has been increasing. The chapter does not
focus on currency crises, because trade dynamics following such crises are fundamentally different—the
most important characteristic of currency crises is,
by definition, a large exchange rate decline, which
greatly influences the postcrisis dynamics of both
imports and exports. In addition, large and abrupt
depreciations did not characterize the most recent
financial crises in advanced economies. Nevertheless,
in this analysis we investigate the role of the exchange
rate—changes in both its level and its volatility—in
influencing the behavior of trade following banking
and debt crises.
Our methodology for analyzing postcrisis trade is
derived from the gravity model, the standard work7Among

the banking and debt crises in the Laeven-Valencia
data set are 10 cases in which the two coincide. An analysis of
these “twin banking and debt crises” suggests that trade dynamics
following these episodes were qualitatively similar to those with
only one type of crisis, although the effects were slightly more
accentuated. We do not highlight these in the chapter, however,
given the limited number of observations.

chapter 4 Do Financial Crises Have Lasting Effects on Trade??

horse in the empirical trade literature.8 The gravity
model relates the level of bilateral trade flows—or
alternatively, import and export flows separately—
to characteristics of the importing and exporting
economies (most notably size and level of development) as well as to country-pair characteristics such
as distance between them and whether they share
a common border or language. These and other
time-invariant country-pair characteristics can also
be controlled for by the inclusion of country-pair
dummy variables. The gravity model has been in use
since the 1960s, and its popularity has derived in
large part from its ability to empirically fit the trade
data, that is, to describe what normal bilateral trade
flows should be, given economies’ fundamentals.
The literature has used this framework to investigate
a number of questions, including the impact of
trade agreements (Frankel, Stein, and Wei, 1996),
currency unions (Rose, 2000), exchange rate volatility (Thursby and Thursby, 1987), and war (Glick
and Taylor, 2010; and Martin, Mayer, and Thoenig,
2008). The use of the gravity model has also been
supported by recent attempts to strengthen its theoretical microfoundations (see Anderson and Van
Wincoop, 2003, among others).
The approach taken in this paper is a collapsed
version of the gravity model that uses aggregate
imports or exports of a given economy rather than
bilateral trade flows. This is done because our
primary concern is in describing the evolution of
aggregate trade, not bilateral trade. And the model
is estimated in growth rates rather than in levels
to better model the dynamics of trade over time.
The results are robust to estimating the standard
bilateral gravity model in changes as well as to other
changes in specification. (Appendix 4.2 outlines the
econometric specifications used and the robustness of the main results to alternative econometric
specifications.)
Our sample consists of 154 advanced as well as
emerging and developing economies covering the
period 1970–2009. Bilateral and aggregate import
and export flows for each economy are obtained

Baldwin and Taglioni (2006) for a survey of the use of
gravity models in the literature, as well as the pitfalls faced in
estimating them.

from the IMF’s Direction of Trade Statistics
(DOTS) database. We also extend the NBER-UN
World Trade Flows database (Feenstra and others,
2005) to analyze trade patterns by product category. (Data sources are outlined in Appendix 4.1.)
Growth in aggregate imports and exports is then
modeled as a function of contemporaneous and
lagged values of a crisis dummy variable, changes in
economic fundamentals (primarily economic size,
as proxied by GDP), and changes in the (importor export-weighted) characteristics of its trading
partners.9 To control for economies’ characteristics
that do not change over time, country dummies are
also included. Finally, all our specifications include
time dummies to control for factors that affect all
economies’ trade simultaneously, such as global
downturns or increases in global uncertainty or risk
aversion.

What Happens to Imports and Exports after a Crisis?
We first estimate the unconditional behavior of an
economy’s imports and exports—that is, without
controlling for output—to gauge the extent to
which trade is affected in the aftermath of a crisis.
On average, imports fall by about 8 percent in the
crisis year (Figure 4.4, top-left panel; Table 4.1). An
additional drop of about 8 percent occurs the following year. There is little sign of recovery in subsequent years, so that by the fifth year after the crisis,
imports remain about 19 percent below their level
predicted in the absence of a crisis. That pattern—
a sharp short-term drop in imports followed by
little or no recovery in the medium term—is also
evident when looking at debt crises and banking
crises separately, although medium-term effects are
more adverse for the former (Figure 4.4, middle-left
and bottom-left panels). The differences in import
dynamics between the two types of crisis are not
statistically significant, however.
9Most

gravity models in the literature are typically estimated
in levels and also include GDP per capita. When estimating
the model in changes, however, there is a very high correlation
between the growth rates of GDP and GDP per capita, and so
we exclude the latter in our baseline specification. The results
reported below are very similar if one includes own and trading
partners’ growth in GDP per capita.

There is a sharp and significant decline in imports in the first two years after a crisis
and no recovery in subsequent years. Exports exhibit a smaller and more gradual
decline, which is marginally significant in the medium term. Trade dynamics are
similar following debt and banking crises, although the adverse dynamics of
imports and exports are slightly (but not significantly) more severe following
debt crises.

134

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

The effect on exports is smaller and more gradual
(Figure 4.4, top-right panel). There is no sharp drop
in exports in the short term; exports drop by only 3
percent on average at the onset of a crisis. There is,
however, a gradual deterioration in exports, so that
by the fifth year after a crisis, exports are on average
about 8 percent lower than normal, and the difference is marginally significant. The smaller decline in
exports relative to imports implies that, on average, the
external trade balance tends to improve after a crisis.
Similar patterns of gradual export decline are observed
for debt and banking crises separately, although the
variation in export losses is larger following debt crises
(Figure 4.4, middle-right and bottom-right panels).
As was the case for imports, the differences in export
dynamics between the two types of crisis are not statistically significant, and in the subsequent analysis we
simply look at banking and debt crises together.10
These results are robust to the use of a number
of alternative methodologies for estimating losses.
The first and simplest methodology for calculating losses, adopted from Chapter 4 of the October
2009 World Economic Outlook, looks at deviations
of imports and exports from a precrisis trend. A
second robustness test is to include autoregressive
terms in the estimation to more closely parallel
the specification used in studies such as Romer
and Romer (2010) and Cerra and Saxena (2008).
Third, the full bilateral gravity model in changes is
estimated, using both the full sample and the top
20 partners of each country. Finally, to address the
concern that our findings may be driven by large
depreciations accompanying banking and debt
crises, we isolate episodes that did not coincide
with currency crises. All methodologies produce
qualitatively similar results. Further details on these
robustness tests are reported in Appendix 4.2.

10 The larger and more persistent losses in imports relative to
exports may reflect the consequences of weak balance sheets (or
other financial difficulties) for domestic demand. Although lower
domestic demand directly reduces import volumes, it may also
reduce residents’ consumption of exportable goods, freeing up
room for more exports.

Does Output Fully Explain the Behavior of Imports
and Exports?
Previous studies, including Chapter 4 of the October 2009 World Economic Outlook and Cerra and
Saxena (2008), find that output declines significantly following financial crises and stays depressed
over the medium term. Is the behavior of trade
described above simply a reflection of these postcrisis output dynamics? To address this issue, we control for output by adding GDP of both the home
economy and trading partners. Whereas standard
gravity models assume that the elasticity of trade to
output is uniform across economies and over time,
we relax this assumption in our analysis because
these elasticities are crucial for assessing whether
trade behavior is fully explained by output.11 The
top panel of Figure 4.5 and Table 4.1 suggest that
11Specifically,

we allow the elasticity to vary across regions
as defined in the World Economic Outlook database (defined
in Appendix 4.1) and also to vary between the pre-1990 and

while depressed output contributes significantly
to the adverse evolution of imports, it does not
explain all of it. Controlling for output reduces the
estimated import losses substantially—by about
10 percentage points in both the short and the
medium term (Table 4.1). However, the import
losses remain significantly different from zero.
The finding that output does not explain all of
the adverse behavior of imports is robust to several
tests. One possibility is that the estimated elasticity of
imports to output picks up the sensitivity of imports
to long-term or trend movements in output; if the
elasticity of imports to cyclical fluctuations or during
crisis periods is larger, then imposing a fixed elasticity
would result in large unexplained declines in imports
during cyclical downturns or crises, even after controlling for output. To test for this, we allow the coefficient on output to vary during crisis and noncrisis
post-1990 periods. Assuming a uniform elasticity results in larger
estimated import losses, as reported in Appendix 4.2.

periods; we also allow it to vary across the trend and
cyclical components of output, where the trend and
cycle were separated using a Hodrick-Prescott filter.
In both cases, the elasticity of imports to higher-frequency movements in output was indeed found to be
significantly higher. Finally, we include lags of GDP
growth in the specification. Nevertheless, the adverse
behavior of imports remained, even after controlling
for output. It is also robust to the use of alternative
methodologies described in Appendix 4.2.
In contrast to import behavior, much of the
behavior of exports following a crisis seems to be
associated with adverse output dynamics (Figure
4.5, bottom panel). After controlling for output,
exports are close to normal, and the estimated deviation is not statistically different from zero either in
the short or the medium term. Because of this, the
remainder of the chapter focuses on imports, which
seem to bear the primary impact of crises.

Do Dynamics Differ across Products, Trading Partners,
and Crises?
The previous section noted significant differences in the behavior of trade in various product
categories during the most recent global downturn.
Is this pattern also borne out in earlier crises? Figure
4.6 shows some similarities between the most
recent global downturn and earlier crises, but it
also shows some differences.12 In the past, as in the
more recent global downturn, capital and consumer
durables experienced the largest short-term decline,
with an average drop of almost 15 percent in the
second year after the crisis, even after controlling
for changes in output. There was little sign of recovery in imports for this product category over the
medium term. The other three product categories
also experienced significant drops in the short term
but of less than 10 percent. However, these product
categories exhibited further deterioration over
12It

should be noted that the behavior of imports illustrated
in Figure 4.3 covers only 13 economies and includes both crisis
and noncrisis economies, whereas Figure 4.6 shows the behavior
of imports in these product groups for crisis economies only.
In addition, Figure 4.3 presents unconditional import losses,
whereas Figure 4.6 shows losses after controlling for output and
other variables.

chapter 4 Do Financial Crises Have Lasting Effects on Trade??

the medium term, which is somewhat puzzling,
especially because the analyses that find these losses
already control for output.13
It is also possible that different trading partners’
exports to the crisis economy are affected in different ways. Are some trading partners’ exports more
resilient than others? One factor that does seem to
matter is the strength of international production
linkages—the use of intermediate imported goods
in the production of exports.14 Greater production sharing tends to make trade more resilient:
the more vertically integrated a crisis economy is
with a trading partner, the smaller the decline in
imports from that trading partner (Figure 4.7). The
finding is consistent with the idea of a “beachhead
effect,” with firms that have incurred the sunk costs
of entering a relationship unwilling to leave simply
because conditions turn bad.15
Finally, we evaluate whether trade dynamics
differ if a crisis coincides with a global downturn,
where the latter is defined as in Freund (2009).16
About one-fifth of earlier crisis episodes occurred
during years of global downturns. Economies that
13If

past crises typically occurred in lower-income countries
with weak social safety nets, it is possible that crises and the
resulting (uncushioned) rise in unemployment would lead to
declines even in consumer nondurables. See, for example, Friedman and Levinsohn (2003) for an analysis of the impact of the
1997 Asian crisis on Indonesian households. The effects would
remain even in the regressions that control for output if the
measured GDP decline failed to adequately capture the adverse
impact on poorer households.
14We measure the intensity of production linkages between
two countries by the ratio of value-added to exports (VAX) of
Johnson and Noguera (2010). The VAX ratio, constructed from
input-output tables and bilateral trade across a large sample of
countries, captures the extent to which the exports from country
A to country B are used as intermediate goods in the production
of country B’s exports.
15See Baldwin (1988), who proposed beachhead effects as one
potential explanation for hysteresis in international trade. Our
findings are also consistent with other studies, such as that by
Altomonte and Ottaviano (2009), who note the resilience of
trade between western and central Europe during the recent crisis, and Bernard and others (2009), who document the resilience
of intra-Asian “supply chain” trade following the Asian crisis.
16Specifically, Freund (2009) defines global downturns as years
when world real GDP growth is (1) below 2 percent, (2) more
than 1.5 percentage points below the previous five-year average,
and (3) at its minimum relative to the previous two years and
the following two years. The procedure identifies the following
global downturns: 1975, 1982, 1991, 2001, and 2008.

deeper import and export losses, both unconditionally and after conditioning on output (Figure 4.8).
The unconditional import losses remain larger than
the export losses, and so, even in these cases, net
exports of the crisis economies still tend to improve.
This suggests that such financial crises may result in
deeper trade losses than historical episodes that did
not coincide with a global downturn.

The import dynamics in Figures 4.4 and 4.5
present only the average behavior across all historical crisis episodes. But might import dynamics differ depending on precrisis conditions? For
example, an economy that entered the crisis with
a relatively deteriorated current account balance
may see more of an adjustment in relative prices,
so that imports may fare relatively worse than in an
economy that entered a crisis with a more favorable
current account position. The top panels of Figure
4.9 suggest that this is the case. For the subsample
of crisis episodes with above-median precrisis current account balances, there was no deterioration
in imports after controlling for output; for the
subsample with below-median precrisis current
account balances, the import loss after controlling
for output was much larger and more persistent.
Similarly, economies with a higher degree of
financial or trade openness entering the crisis
seemed to experience a smaller import loss (Figure
4.9, middle and bottom panels). While the exact
nature of the association between precrisis openness and postcrisis trade dynamics is unclear, we
have two conjectures. First, greater financial openness could mean less dependence on the domestic
banking sector, especially for trade finance. If this
is the case, then a banking crisis that damages the
domestic financial sector could have less of an
impact in more financially open economies. Second,
the association between trade openness and postcrisis dynamics could be related to the greater trade
resilience of more vertically integrated economies,
because economies with the strongest production
linkages also tend to have relatively high measured
levels of trade integration.

chapter 4 Do Financial Crises Have Lasting Effects on Trade??

What Factors Are Associated with Postcrisis
Import Dynamics?
If output does not explain all the behavior of
imports following a crisis, then what does? Potential
additional explanations, which have been discussed
in the context of the recent crisis, include the
following:
•• Impaired credit: Banking crises in particular are
associated with a tightening of credit conditions—
Abiad, Dell’Ariccia, and Li (forthcoming) find
that when a downturn is associated with a banking
crisis, a “creditless recovery” (one in which real
credit growth is negative) becomes twice as likely.
If the downturn is also preceded by a credit boom,
the likelihood of a creditless recovery quadruples
and becomes a near certainty. Difficulty in obtaining credit may have deleterious effects on imports,
above and beyond any effects weak credit might
have on aggregate demand.17
•• Increased protectionism: In the aftermath of
a crisis, interest groups that favor protecting
domestic production may be strengthened.18
Increased protection need not come in the form
of increased tariffs; it may also be manifest in
increased use of antidumping measures and other
forms of “murky protectionism,” such as clauses
in stimulus packages that restrict spending to
domestic producers. Box 4.2 discusses the use of
protectionist measures and their effect on trade
in the wake of the recent crisis.
•• Exchange rate dynamics: Imports may be adversely
affected by changes in both the level and the
volatility of exchange rates. Kaminsky and
Reinhart (1999) note that many banking crises
are also associated with sharp depreciations of
the currency; in such cases the swing in relative
prices would hurt imports but boost exports. In
addition, exchange rate variability may increase
during crisis periods, and increased variability has
17See Amiti and Weinstein (2009), Iacovone and Zavacka
(2009), and Chor and Manova (2010) for the importance of
trade finance and credit in explaining export performance during
crises.
18For example, the Great Depression was followed by a
“wholesale rise in protectionism,” which not only slowed the
process of economic recovery but created lasting protectionist
legacies in a number of countries (see O’Rourke, 2009).

been shown to adversely affect trade (Thursby and
Thursby, 1987).
•• The composition effect: Because certain product
categories represent a greater share of trade than
of output, a fall in demand for these products will
result in a larger drop in trade than in output. Crises may lead to a greater fall in demand for goods
than for services, for example, and most trade is
in goods, whereas services account for the bulk of
output. And within goods, durables form a larger
share of trade than of output. As noted in Box
4.1, the composition effect seem to explain much
of the outsize drop in trade during the recent
crisis. Unfortunately, the lack of comprehensive
historical data on the composition of demand
precludes a detailed investigation of this particular
mechanism, but below we present some evidence
that suggests that composition effects played at
least a partial role even in earlier crises.
For these mechanisms to be associated with
the observed postcrisis import dynamics, not only
should these factors have an adverse effect on
imports, they should also tend to worsen during crisis periods. To investigate the role of each of these
mechanisms, we follow a three-step approach. In
the first step, we estimate impulse-response functions to gauge how credit, protection, and exchange
rate dynamics evolve in the aftermath of a crisis.
In the second step, we estimate the elasticity of
imports with respect to these factors. The third step
combines the first two steps to obtain an estimate
of how much each mechanism can account for
postcrisis import dynamics. Details are described in
Appendix 4.2. It should be emphasized that none
of this analysis attempts to identify causation, only
association; we want to know how much of an
import decline we would predict given the behavior
of the various correlates.
The results of the first step of this three-step
methodology are shown in Figure 4.10, which shows
how the level and volatility of the real effective
exchange rate (REER), credit, and tariffs evolve on
average following a crisis. The REER depreciates in
the short term by about 6 percent on average in the
first two years of the crisis and stays depreciated in
subsequent years, but the variation around this average is quite large. There is also a significant increase

chapter 4 Do Financial Crises Have Lasting Effects on Trade??

in the volatility of the REER in the short term that
declines over the medium term. Credit to the private
sector, measured relative to GDP, steadily declines in
the years following a crisis, with an average decline
of more than 15 percentage points by the fifth year.
Although the magnitude of this decline looks quite
large, it should be noted that many banking crises
were preceded by excessive credit growth. Finally
and somewhat surprisingly, there is no evidence
that protectionism, as measured by the average tariff
level, increases following a crisis. There is a statistically insignificant change in average tariffs following
a crisis in both the short and medium term.19 This
last finding, however, should not be interpreted to
mean that overall protection does not rise, given
that increased protectionism may manifest itself in
“murky” forms (mentioned above), which are difficult to detect in the data.
The estimated elasticity of imports to mechanisms other than output is outlined in Table 4.2.20
The estimated elasticity of imports to the REER, at
about 0.09, is substantially smaller than estimates
from other studies. This may be due to the fact
that the model estimates only the contemporaneous
association between the REER and imports.21 The

19The number of antidumping measures imposed by a country
also does not increase significantly following crises.
20As noted above, the estimated elasticity of imports with
respect to output in the baseline specification varies across
regions and over time. These elasticities are discussed in Appendix 4.2.
21Estimates of this elasticity in the literature vary by horizon
(Senhadji, 1998, for example, finds an elasticity close to zero
in the short term but higher than 1 in the long term), as well
as across countries (Kwack and others, 2007, have elasticities
that range from 0.4 to 1.2 across a wide range of countries).
Using the higher estimates found in the literature will, of course,
increase the fraction of import loss that can be accounted for by
postcrisis declines in the REER.

(Percent; years on x-axis; crisis begins at t = 0)

Output declines account for the biggest share of import losses in the
aftermath of crises. However, the temporary rise in exchange rate volatility and
persistent impairment of credit also contribute. Controlling for these potential
explanations still leaves a portion of import losses unexplained, which may
reflect composition effects.

Note: Unconditional import losses (see Figure 4.4) are decomposed into changes
attributable to the fall in output and credit, a rise in exchange rate volatility,
depreciation, and changes in tariffs. The contribution of output is computed as the
difference between the unconditional and conditional import losses (see Table 4.1).
The contribution of the remaining factors is calculated as the product of the elasticity
of imports with respect to each factor and the change in the factor following crises
(depicted in Figure 4.10), as a percent of the unconditional change in imports after
crises.
1REER = real effective exchange rate.

estimated elasticity of imports to REER volatility and credit are both statistically significant and
of the expected sign. The estimated elasticity of
imports to tariffs, while negative as expected, is not
statistically significant.
Combining these results allows us to estimate
the average contribution of these various mechanisms (Figure 4.11). The estimated contribution
of output is derived as the difference between the
unconditional import loss reported in Figure 4.4
and the import loss controlling for output in Figure
4.5. At the onset of a crisis (year t), the decline in
output accounts for about half of the overall loss in
imports in that year; increased exchange rate volatility accounts for another one-fifth of the import loss.
Real depreciation and weak credit together account
for less than 10 percent of the loss in the crisis
year, so that about 20 percent of the import loss in
the year of the crisis remains unaccounted for. In
subsequent years, output remains the most important contributor to depressed imports, accounting
for anywhere between 50 and 60 percent of the
total import loss. The role of exchange rate volatility
diminishes over time, a reflection of the fact that
the surge in volatility in the immediate aftermath
of a crisis subsides over time. The role of credit, in
contrast, increases over time because credit steadily
worsens following a crisis; by the fifth year, weak
credit conditions account for about 10 percent of
the total import loss.
Although these mechanisms help account for
a significant portion of the estimated postcrisis
import loss, between 20 and 35 percent of the
latter remains unexplained. To what extent might
the composition effect account for the unexplained
component? This chapter’s focus on trade in goods,
and the lack of detailed historical data on the
demand share of durables and nondurables for a
wide range of economies preclude inclusion of composition effects in our three-step methodology. But
there is some evidence to suggest that such effects
were important in earlier crises as well.22 Imports
fall much more than output if two conditions are
22Box 4.1 uses a more sophisticated framework and more
disaggregated data to obtain more precise estimates of the role
of the composition effect in explaining the most recent trade
collapse.

chapter 4 Do Financial Crises Have Lasting Effects on Trade??

satisfied: demand for some goods must fall more
than for others, and those goods must account
for a larger share of trade than of output. Across
a sample of 48 economies and 26 crisis episodes
for which data are available, tradable investment
goods (machinery and equipment) account for 18
percent of trade but only 8 percent of GDP (Figure
4.12). And the postcrisis decline in machinery and
equipment is much larger—imports of these goods
decline by more than one-third by the second year
after a crisis, more than 10 times the postcrisis
decline in the rest of GDP over the same
period.23 Calculations in Appendix 4.2 suggest that,
even when focusing narrowly on these investment
durables, the composition effect can explain at least
a portion of the postcrisis fall in imports.
The three-step methodology provides only an
estimate of the average contribution of the various mechanisms to import dynamics. For example,
although the size of the average depreciation is
small following a crisis, it is also clear from Figure
4.10 that there is substantial variation around this
average. Is it possible that economies whose currencies depreciated more substantially had imports
that evolved differently than those whose currencies did not depreciate as much? Figure 4.13 sheds
some light on these possibilities; once again, all the
reported import losses already control for output.
Crisis episodes with a relatively large depreciation
seem to be associated with more depressed imports
than those with smaller depreciations (top panels).
Crises during which the increase in exchange rate
volatility was lower, or credit conditions were better,
seem to be associated with less import deterioration
(middle panels).24 Finally, there is evidence that crises during which tariffs increased by relatively more
were associated with worse import performance,
particularly in the short term, consistent with the
findings in Box 4.2 regarding the recent crisis.

Figure 4.12. Import Losses and Composition Effects
(Percent)

Durables comprise a much larger share of trade than of output. In addition,
demand for durables declines substantially more than demand for nondurables
following crises. These two facts suggest that composition effects may play an
important role in postcrisis import losses.

23One

possibility is that a decline in credit availability following a crisis affects demand for durables more than demand for
other goods.
24These findings are robust to the use of alternative proxies
that more closely track trade finance as opposed to the measure
of general credit conditions that is used here. Specifically, it is
robust to using the change in the outstanding stock of external
short-term debt, which includes short-term credit for trade
(Ronci, 2004).

Losses, Controlling for Output

(Percent deviation from normal; years on the x-axis; crisis begins at t = 0)
The evolution of imports following crises is associated with postcrisis economic
conditions and policies. Imports fare worse when a crisis is accompanied by a
larger depreciation, greater exchange rate volatility, a sharper decline in credit,
or a greater increase in protectionism.

imports relative to what would be predicted in the absence of a crisis. Predictions are
based on a collapsed gravity model in changes, with contemporaneous and lagged
crises, home and trade-weighted partner output, a trade-weighted partner crisis
dummy, and country and time dummies. Crisis episodes are split into those during
which depreciation, the change in real effective exchange rate volatility, and the
change in credit to GDP between t = 0 and t = 5 are, respectively, above or below the
crisis sample median. In the case of tariffs, the figure reports conditional imports
after crises with a change in the trade liberalization index above and below the 75th
percentile.

This analysis finds that crises tend to depress
imports substantially in the short term—above
and beyond any import compression due to lower
output—and that imports tend to stay depressed
through the medium term. Imports tend to decline
more if the economy entered the crisis with a
relatively unfavorable current account balance and if
the crisis resulted in a relatively large decline in the
REER or poor credit conditions. Finally, exports
exhibit a smaller and more gradual decline that can
be fully accounted for by changes in output.
How do those results inform the outlook for
trade? As the world economy emerges from the Great
Trade Collapse of 2008–09, recent data make it
just as easy to view the trade recovery glass as being
half full as it is to view it as half empty. Optimists
can point to strong growth in world trade since the
second half of 2009, while pessimists can lament
that imports and exports remain far below precrisis trends, or even below precrisis levels for some
economies. Which perspective is justified? Although
caution should be exercised when drawing implications for the recent, more global crisis from historical
crisis episodes, we use the evidence in this chapter to
try to shed light on where trade might be headed.
The recent financial crisis has been concentrated
in many large, advanced economies (Table 4.3),
and so this chapter’s findings have implications not
just for individual economies but also for the global
recovery and for global trade patterns. The 13

chapter 4 Do Financial Crises Have Lasting Effects on Trade??

countries that recently had a systemic banking crisis
account for about 40 percent of global demand,
with the three largest countries—Germany, the
United Kingdom, and the United States—accounting for more than one-third of global demand.
Including 10 additional countries that Laeven and
Valencia (2010) identify as having had a “borderline” systemic banking crisis, the recent crisis
countries account for over half of world demand
and output. This chapter’s estimates of postcrisis
trade dynamics are consistent with the sharp and
substantial drop in import demand that has been
evident in these countries. More important for the
outlook, this analysis suggests that these countries’
imports are likely to remain depressed for a number
of years, even more than their tempered output
projections would suggest. If, in addition, some
economies fall into a sovereign debt crisis—which
this analysis finds to be associated with more acute
import losses—prospects for global import demand
will dim even further. For economies that rely heavily on external demand for growth, the chapter’s
findings underscore the importance of rebalancing
toward domestic sources of growth or, more generally, of developing “twin engines” of growth.
The analysis also suggests that import dynamics
may differ across the crisis countries. For countries
that entered the crisis with a relatively weak current account, such as the United Kingdom and the
United States, import demand is likely to be even
more anemic. Exports to the United Kingdom are
also weighed down by the substantial depreciation of the pound sterling since 2008. Finally, real
credit in these two economies is decelerating or
even contracting, which the chapter suggests will
also weaken imports beyond its effects on output.
The fact that these countries’ exports are not
expected to decline nearly as much as their
imports implies a likely improvement in the
external balances of the crisis countries and a
deterioration in the balances of their partners.
Because the United States accounted for a large
part of the global imbalances that widened
substantially in the early 2000s, a silver lining
from the recent crisis is the narrowing of the
U.S. external deficit, and this chapter suggests
that this narrowing may be more durable than

The extent of trade protectionism before and
during the recent crisis has been subject to significantly different interpretations. This box addresses
the question by drawing on recent research by IMF
staff (Gregory and others, 2010). New trade restrictions have so far been limited to a small share of
global trade but have had a strong negative impact
on trade flows. This box suggests ways for economies to avoid allowing rising trade protectionism to
interfere with the recovery.
Trade became much freer during the second half
of the 20th century. Among major western European
and North American countries, average tariffs fell
from 15 to 4 percent between the 1950s and mid2000s. In many major developing economies, tariffs
increased or remained very high until the 1980s
but have since come down sharply. Nonetheless, the
pace of trade reforms waned after the mid-2000s
as protectionist sentiment began to increase, and so
substantial trade restrictions were still in place when
the crisis hit. Moreover, gaps in World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments leave a wide scope
for legal backsliding on trade policy. Tariffs—the
most transparent and easily monitored trade policy
instrument—provide an illustrative example. Some
economies can raise tariffs substantially without
exceeding their WTO bindings (first figure).
Once the crisis took hold in mid-2008, political leaders’ awareness of the risks of protectionism,
backed by increased monitoring activities, helped
limit the protectionist response. Mindful of both
the disastrous results of protectionism during the
1930s and the contribution of trade to macroeconomic performance, the Group of 20 (G20)
economies pledged in November 2008 to “refrain
from raising new barriers to investment or to
trade in goods and services, imposing new export
restrictions, or implementing WTO inconsistent
measures to stimulate exports.” In April 2009 and
again in June 2010, G20 leaders extended this
pledge and asked the WTO and other institutions
to monitor adherence.
Several other factors have worked to limit the
protectionist response to the crisis:

Source: World Trade Organization, World Tariff Profiles 2009.
1MFN = Most favored nation.

•• Multilateral rules and institutions have clarified
the types of policy actions considered responsible. The strong WTO-based trade system has
been central.
•• Trade declined much more rapidly than overall
economic activity. The ratio of imports to GDP
declined as well. Although job losses mounted,
they were not, by and large, blamed on trade.
•• Macroeconomic and financial sector policies
were supportive of trade.
Even so, once the crisis took hold, a number of
trade restrictions were introduced. The sharp rise in
unemployment and its continued high levels may
help explain the increased frequency of industry
requests for trade remedies. In addition, there was
increased use of unconventional measures, which
are harder to quantify.
However, the extent of trade restrictions is
unclear, and various monitoring efforts have
come to quite different conclusions. None of the
watchdogs suggest that we have seen, or are likely

year” and that “much of the discrimination put in
place then has yet to be removed” (GTA, 2010).
Gregory and others (2010) explore the impact
of both conventional and more unconventional
“behind the border” measures highlighted in the
GTA reports, such as technical barriers to trade,
procurement, and regulatory measures. The analysis
matches data from GTA monitoring of measures
taken between mid-2008 and late 2009 with
detailed product-level data on bilateral monthly
trade flows.1 The second figure illustrates the varied
nature of these protectionist measures. There is
strong evidence that, after an economy imposed
import restrictions on a particular product, its
imports fell in succeeding months relative to world
trade in the same product (third figure). Allowing
for various time-varying fixed effects, more sophisticated econometric analysis suggests that trade in
the affected products dropped an average of 3 to 8

to see, an extreme protectionist surge like that of
the 1930s, but their assessments differ markedly.
The June 2010 joint report of the WTO, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD), and United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (unctad) indicates that
“protectionist policy responses have been limited,
although there are still instances of restrictive measures taken… [T]here continues to be few instances
of new import restrictions and a greater use of
export restrictions, but some G20 governments
have also taken steps to facilitate trade” (WTO,
OECD, and unctad, 2010). In contrast, the sixth
report of Global Trade Alert (GTA), which is associated with the London-based Centre for Economic
Policy Research and supported by the World Bank,
also released in June 2010, concludes that “as far as
open markets were concerned, 2009 was a terrible

percent after the imposition of restrictions. However, in the aggregate, restrictions implemented
during the study period decreased trade by 0.25
percent, because these measures affected only a
small share of global trade.
Looking ahead, sustained high unemployment,
uneven growth, an unwinding of government stimulus measures, and growing economic imbalances
may increase protectionist pressure. In some economies, such pressure may also emerge from high
commodity prices or a surge in capital inflows,
which may lead to rapid currency appreciation.

in the absence of a financial crisis. On the other
hand, the finding that imports decline mostly for
investment-related goods suggests that the postcrisis outlook for innovation and potential growth
could be diminished.
Domestic policymakers who might be concerned
about the harmful effects of a financial crisis on
exports may be reassured by the chapter’s findings
that declines in exports are, on average, small and
gradual. Moreover, these effects can be accounted
for by weaker output, suggesting that addressing the
factors that depress output on the supply side will
help exports recover as well.
Finally, although domestic policymakers may
care more about the consequences for exports than
for imports, the global nature of the recent crisis
means that a coordinated and protracted slump in
import demand across a wide swath of economies
bodes ill for the global recovery. Not surprisingly,
the chapter finds that boosting output will considerably help imports to recover. In that regard,
productivity-enhancing structural reforms could
help raise growth. The chapter’s findings suggest
that, beyond supporting domestic demand, taking
steps to improve credit conditions, keeping protectionist tendencies at bay, and avoiding excessive exchange rate volatility may help support the
recovery of trade. A conclusion of the Doha Round
of global trade talks would also reinforce the revival
of global trade.

148

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

Gaps in WTO commitments leave ample scope
for further trade restrictions, and a failure by all
economies to vigorously resist protectionism could
threaten the economic recovery and slow future
growth. Maintaining and enhancing the monitoring
of protectionist measures and sustaining high-level
political awareness of the associated macroeconomic
risks will help. But the surest way to avoid such a
downside scenario is to tighten multilateral trade
commitments by completing the WTO Doha
Round. This can be viewed as a key part of the exit
strategy from the global economic crisis.

Appendix 4.1. Data Sources
The primary data sources for the chapter are the
IMF’s Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS), World
Economic Outlook (WEO), and International
Financial Statistics (IFS) databases; the NBER-UN
World Trade Flows database (2005); and Laeven and
Valencia (2008, 2010). Additional data sources are
listed in Table 4.4, and the WEO analytical regions
are in Table 4.5.
Crisis indicators are from Laeven and Valencia
(2008, 2010). Laeven and Valencia (2010) present
new and comprehensive data on the starting dates
and characteristics of systemic banking crises over
the period 1970­–2009, building on earlier work
by Caprio and others (2005), Laeven and Valencia
(2008), and Reinhart and Rogoff (2009). They
update the Laeven and Valencia (2008) database
on systemic banking crises to include the recent
episodes following the U.S. mortgage crisis of
2007 and identify 129 episodes since 1970.
Laeven and Valencia (2008) also identify debt
crisis episodes based on sovereign debt default
and restructuring by relying on information from
Beim and Calomiris (2001), World Bank (2002),
Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer (2006), and IMF
staff reports. The information compiled includes the
year of sovereign default on private lending and the
year of debt rescheduling. Using this approach, they
identify 63 episodes of sovereign debt default and
restructuring since 1970.

Data on bilateral and aggregate imports and
exports from the DOTS database are reported in
current U.S. dollars. These are deflated using the
world import and export price deflators from the
IFS database, to determine each economy’s real
imports and exports. The series on real GDP in
U.S. dollars is from the WEO database. Importand export-weighted partner GDP and GDP per
capita are constructed using real GDP in U.S. dollars and import and export weights from the DOTS
database. These weights vary each year according
to the actual import and export flows between
economies.
Data on imports and exports by product category
are constructed from the NBER-UN World Trade
Flows database (see Feenstra and others, 2005).
The database is first extended using the UN
Comtrade database. The codes from the Standard International Trade Classification, Revision 2,
that identify products in the NBER-UN trade data
are matched to the UN Broad Economic Classification (BEC) codes. These are then classified into
Capital Goods, Consumer Durables, Consumer

Nondurables, Intermediate Goods, and Primary
Goods, following Pula and Peltonen (2009).
The current account balance is taken from the
WEO database. Trade openness is measured as the
ratio of the sum of imports and exports to GDP.
Financial openness is calculated as the sum of
foreign assets and foreign liabilities divided by GDP,
using the updated and extended External Wealth of
Nations Mark II Database (see Lane and MilesiFerretti, 2007).
Bank credit to the private nonfinancial sector is
taken from the IFS database. Breaks in these data
are identified using the IFS Country Notes publication, and data are growth-spliced at these points.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) data are
from the IMF’s Information Notice System. The
volatility of the REER is calculated as the standard
deviation of the monthly REER change in each
year. The measure of trade liberalization is from the
IMF Structural Reforms Database and is described
in IMF (2008).
Bilateral data on production sharing are from
Johnson and Noguera (2010).

Appendix 4.2. Methodology and Robustness
Tests
Estimating Unconditional Import Losses
The analysis25 first estimates the unconditional
dynamics of imports in the aftermath of crises using
a “collapsed” gravity model of trade in changes.
In the baseline regression specification in the text,
the growth in an economy’s aggregate imports,
D ln Mit , is expressed as a function of a dummy
variable indicating whether a crisis started in year t,
five lags of this dummy variable, and country and
time dummies:
D ln Mit 5 ai 1 pt 1 ∑ ak crisisi,t–k 1 eit. (4.1)
The robustness of the estimated unconditional
import losses from the baseline specification is
verified by using the following five alternative
specifications:
•• Alternative 1: Deviation from precrisis trend—
This procedure measures import loss as a simple
deviation of ln Mit from a precrisis trend, ln Trit,
where the latter is a linear trend based on a
precrisis window from (t – 7) to (t – 1). The
mean import loss k years after a crisis is just the
average of this import loss, (ln Mit – ln Trit),
across all crisis episodes. This is equivalent to
estimating the following equation, either in levels
or changes:
ln Mit 2 ln Trit 5 ∑ bk crisisi,t–k 1 eit.

(4.2)

This procedure is similar to the procedure
used in Chapter 4 of the October 2009 World
Economic Outlook for estimating output losses

25We

focus on import dynamics here, since the chapter’s
results suggest that imports are where the impact of a crisis on
trade is primarily manifested.

following a crisis.26 In contrast to the baseline,
this methodology allows for an episode-specific
trend, as opposed to the country-specific trend
that is captured by ai in the baseline specification. However, it does not control for global
conditions as is done in the baseline.
•• Alternative 2: Baseline specification with autoregressive terms—The baseline specification is
augmented by including four lags of the growth
of imports on the right-hand side, paralleling the
specifications used in Romer and Romer (2010)
and Cerra and Saxena (2008):
D ln Mit 5 ai 1 pt 1 ∑ rl D ln Mi,t–1
1 ∑ ak crisisi,t–k 1 eit.

(4.3)

•• Alternative 3: Bilateral gravity in changes—A
directional gravity model (that is, one with bilateral imports or exports as opposed to bilateral
trade) is estimated in changes. The growth in
bilateral imports of an economy from each trading partner, D ln Mimp,exp,t, is regressed on a crisis
indicator and its lags, as well as on time and
importer-exporter pair dummies:
D ln Mimp,exp,t 5 aimp,exp 1 pt
1 ∑ a'k crisisimp,t–k 1 eimp,exp,t .

(4.4)

•• Alternative 4: Bilateral gravity in changes, using top
20 partners—This specification is identical to the
directional gravity model in changes as described
in equation (4.4) but focuses only on the top
20 partners from which an economy imports.
This is done because our primary concern is in
describing the behavior of aggregate trade, rather
than average bilateral trade. The standard gravity
model weights all bilateral trade observations
equally, regardless of the size of the bilateral trade
26The

results from estimating equation (4.2) in levels or
changes are identical because, as in Chapter 4 of the October
2009 World Economic Outlook, the import losses are normalized
so that the loss in the year before the crisis (t – 1) is zero. The
primary differences between the procedure used here and in
Chapter 4 of the October 2009 World Economic Outlook are the
following: (1) the definition of crisis (debt crises combined with
banking crises versus banking crises only), (2) the precrisis window used to calculate the trend [(t – 7) to (t – 1) versus (t – 10)
to (t – 3)], and (3) the choice of dependent variable (imports
versus GDP per capita).

relationship. But trade is highly uneven—in the
sample used in this chapter, the top 20 trading
partners account for 89 percent of an economy’s
total imports, on average, even though the average economy imports from 175 economies. In
other words, about 90 percent of the observations in a typical gravity model account for only
10 percent of total trade. The behavior of aggregate trade will more closely follow the dynamics
of larger trading partners.
•• Alternative 5: Baseline specification, excluding
banking and debt crises that were accompanied by
a currency crisis—This specification is identical to
the baseline equation (4.1) but focuses only on
“pure” banking and debt crises. More specifically,
we exclude banking and debt crisis episodes that
were accompanied or preceded by a currency
crisis as defined in Laeven and Valencia (2008).
As Table 4.6 and Figure 4.14 illustrate, the estimated impulse response functions of imports using
these different approaches are similar both qualitatively and quantitatively. This confirms the finding that there are large and statistically significant
unconditional import losses after crises.

(4.5)

As discussed in the text, the elasticity of
imports to output is crucial for assessing whether
the evolution of trade is fully explained by output. To be as general as possible, we allow the
output elasticities of imports and exports in the
baseline specification to vary across the 10 WEO
analytical regions described in Table 4.5. We also
allow each of these regional elasticities to vary
between the pre- and post-1990 periods. The
estimated elasticities, shown in Table 4.7, range
from 0.8 to 4.5 and are in general higher for the
post-1990 period.
The following tests were performed to check the
robustness of the conditional import losses presented in the text:
•• Robustness Test 1: Distributed lag specification—
We augment the specification to include lagged
output growth. The elasticity of imports to
contemporaneous and lagged output is allowed
to vary across regions and between the pre- and
post-1990 periods.

Import Losses Controlling for Output
The import losses controlling for output
are also computed using the baseline model in
changes, this time with a set of controls derived
from the standard gravity model. Specifically,
the growth of imports, D ln Mit, is modeled as a
function of the growth in the economy’s output,
D ln GDPit, its partners’ import-weighted output,

•• Robustness Test 2: Uniform elasticity of imports to
output—We report the results from a specification that would most closely mirror a collapsed
gravity specification in changes. Namely, as is
standard in the literature, we impose the same
elasticity of imports to output across economies
and over time.
•• Robustness Test 3: Bilateral gravity (all controls) in
changes—Rather than focusing on the economy’s
aggregate imports, we estimate a unidirectional (bilateral) gravity model in changes. The
specification is as in equation (4.4) but contains the standard gravity controls: the growth
in the economy’s and partners’ output as well
as a set of dummies for crises occurring in
both home and partner economies, indicators
for whether the country pair is in a currency
union or free trade agreement, and time and
importer-exporter pair dummies. The elasticity
with respect to an economy’s output is allowed
to vary across regions and between the pre- and
post-1990 periods.
•• Robustness Test 4: Allowing the elasticity of imports
to vary across cyclical versus trend components of
output—Imports may be more responsive to
cyclical than to trend movements in output; if
so, the baseline approach would overestimate
the fall in imports controlling for output. To
test this, we allow the elasticity of imports to
vary across the trend and cyclical components

of output, where the trend and cycle were
separated using a Hodrick-Prescott filter. As in
the baseline, the import elasticity with respect
to both the cyclical and trend components of
output are allowed to vary across WEO regions
and between the pre- and post-1990 periods.
•• Robustness Test 5: Controlling for changes in the
REER and relative prices—Import dynamics may
differ after crises due to changes in the REER
and relative price levels. Equation (4.5) is augmented to control for changes in REER and the
domestic price level, proxied by the change in the
GDP deflator.
•• Robustness Test 6: Controlling for changes in
domestic aggregate demand—An economy’s GDP
may not be a good proxy for absorption in
the importing economy, and to the extent that
absorption declines more than GDP during crises, the estimated import losses after controlling
for output may be overstated. We replace growth
in output by growth in domestic absorption
(consumption plus investment) on the right-hand
side of equation (4.5).
•• Robustness Test 7: Allowing the elasticity of imports
to output to differ across economies—We further
increase the flexibility of our specification by
estimating separately the elasticity of imports
to output for each of the 154 economies in the
sample.
•• Robustness Test 8: Allowing the elasticity of imports
to output to vary across crisis versus noncrisis peri-

ods—Similar to Robustness Test 4, the sensitivity
of imports to output may be particularly high
in times of crisis. We thus allow the coefficient
on output to vary during crisis and noncrisis
periods.
The results of these robustness tests are presented
in Table 4.8 and Figure 4.15. The finding that
imports remain below their normal levels following
a crisis, even after controlling for output, is confirmed across all these robustness checks. While the
standard errors increase substantially once we allow
the estimated elasticity of imports to output to vary
across economies, the point estimates remain very
similar to the baseline specification.

Decomposition of Unconditional Import Losses
We use a three-step approach to evaluate the
importance of different mechanisms in explaining
the unconditional import losses, as detailed below.
It is important to keep in mind that this is simply
an accounting exercise that attempts to decompose
the unconditional import losses based on observed
correlations. The true contributions of the various mechanisms might differ from these estimated
correlations.
Step 1: We document whether crises are followed
by persistent changes in tariffs, credit, the REER,
and exchange rate volatility by estimating equation
(4.1) with the mechanisms of interest as the dependent variable.

by the estimated elasticity of imports with respect
to that mechanism in step 2. The contribution of
each mechanism is then expressed as a fraction of
the unconditional import losses. The contribution
of output is computed as the difference between the
unconditional import losses from equation (4.1)
and import losses conditional on output from equation (4.5).

Composition Effects during Earlier Crises: A Back-ofthe-Envelope Calculation
If GDP and imports had the same composition
of goods and services, and if, within each sector,
imports changed proportionally to domestic final
demand, imports would be expected to fall by as
much as GDP after a crisis. However, if there are
differences in the composition of imports and GDP,
and if goods and services that constitute a larger
share of trade than of GDP experience a relatively
larger decline in demand following a crisis, imports
will fall more than GDP even in the absence of
changes in other factors (such as credit, exchange
rates, or degree of protectionism) described in the
chapter. For example, part of the outsize decline
in imports relative to GDP in the recent crisis has
been attributed to the resilience in the demand
for services relative to manufactured goods. Since
demand for manufactured goods experienced a
relatively larger decline and since manufactured

Crises are followed by roughly equal declines in services and industry. The

goods comprise a larger share of trade than of GDP,
overall imports declined more than GDP (Borchert
and Mattoo, 2009).
We first investigate whether historically there is
a difference in the behavior of manufactured goods
and services following crises. Since detailed data on
the demand side are not available, we use sectoral
value-added data to document whether there
are differences in the behavior of services versus
industry after crises. Somewhat surprisingly, this
does not appear to be the case. The estimated drop
in services is very similar to the decline in industry
value added after crises (Figure 4.16, top panel).27
Given this similarity in the dynamics of services and
industry, the different shares of services in output
and trade do not appear to be a likely explanation.
However, within the “manufactured goods” category, there are compositional differences between
output and trade. Across a sample of 48 economies
for which disaggregated data on gross fixed investment are available, (capital) durables, measured by
tradable investment goods—namely, machinery and
equipment—account for only 8 percent of GDP.
For the same set of economies, the average share
of (capital) durables in imports is 18 percent.28
Although the data coverage is rather scant—only
26 of the identified crises can be included in the
analysis— we provide some back-of-the-envelope
calculations to estimate the contribution of these
composition effects in explaining import losses following crises.
We begin with the following two identities:

27The overall output loss is slightly lower than the loss of

28The definition of “durables” in the trade and output data is
not identical because these series come from different, not always
comparable, data sources. However, it is unlikely that differences
in definitions account for the differences in the shares of these
goods in imports and output.

(4.10)

Based on equation (4.10), we define the composition effect as the extent to which the difference
between the growth rates of GDP and imports is
explained by different compositions of GDP and
imports. It is a product of two factors: (1) differences in the share of durables in imports and GDP
and (2) differences in the growth of durables and
other components following a crisis. If either of
these differences is zero, composition cannot be an
explanation for observing import losses controlling
for output.

Table 4.9 and Figure 4.16 present the findings
from this exercise. The impulse response functions
of investment in machinery and equipment and
the rest of GDP are shown in Figure 4.16 (bottom
panel).29 The postcrisis decline in investment, and
in particular in machinery and equipment, is much
larger than the postcrisis decline in the rest of GDP
over the same period. As presented in column (6)
of Table 4.9, for this selected sample of crises, the
composition effect can explain 5 to 13 percent of
the unconditional import loss. It is important to
keep in mind that these composition effects are
calculated only from the different shares and postcrisis behavior of machinery and equipment relative
to the rest of output; other composition effects—
most notably, from consumer durables—may
also be present. In addition, composition effects
may already be reflected in the higher elasticity of
imports to output that is allowed for in our baseline
specification. Thus, these estimates of the size of the
composition effect could be thought of as a lower
bound.

29Given the share of durables in GDP, as well as the decline in
overall GDP, we can also calculate how much demand for other
components of GDP falls after crises.

Annex

IMF Executive Board Discussion of the Outlook, September 2010

The following remarks by the Acting Chair were made at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the
World Economic Outlook on September 20, 2010.

E

xecutive Directors observed that the global
economic recovery is proceeding broadly as
projected, despite disturbances in financial
markets. The recovery is losing momentum temporarily during the second half of 2010 and
will likely remain weak in the first half of 2011, as
extraordinary policy stimulus is gradually withdrawn.
Directors welcomed signs that financial conditions
have begun to normalize, aided by policy coordination and announcements of a front-loading of fiscal
adjustment in Europe. A more robust, self-sustaining
global recovery will require progress in achieving
both internal and global demand rebalancing, supported by healthy financial systems.
Directors noted that the observed asymmetry
in growth performances will likely persist. In most
advanced and a few emerging market economies,
recoveries are proceeding at a sluggish pace, and
large internal adjustments remain needed to achieve
internal rebalancing from stimulus-led to privatesector-led growth. On the other hand, growth in
many emerging market and developing economies
continues to be vigorous, on the back of improved
macroeconomic policy frameworks and a stronger
financial footing. Downside risks to near-term
global growth remain elevated and concentrated in
advanced economies. These emanate from heightened uncertainty in financial markets, fragile real
estate markets, continued household deleveraging,
and persistently high unemployment. However, the
probability of a sharp global slowdown, including
stagnation or contraction in advanced economies,
appears low.
Directors agreed that fiscal consolidation is a
top priority in countries with relatively high public
debt. They highlighted the urgency of adopting
credible strategies for medium-term consolidation

and debt stabilization, including through legislation
where necessary. At the same time, policymakers
should stand ready to act if global growth threatens
to slow appreciably more than expected. In this
regard, consideration could be given to postponing consolidation in countries with fiscal room and
credibility to do so. In all but the most vulnerable
countries, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to
operate. Directors stressed that medium-term consolidation plans should be based on realistic growth
projections and include reforms to limit rapidly
escalating spending programs such as pension entitlements and public health care and tax incentives
to boost the supply potential and discourage debt.
In light of subdued inflation pressures, Directors generally considered that monetary policy in
most advanced economies should remain highly
accommodative, including through unconventional
measures if needed, and should be the first line of
defense against any larger-than-projected weakening
of activity as fiscal stimulus is being unwound. In
emerging market economies with rising inflation or
asset price pressures, monetary tightening has been
broadly appropriate. For all economies, the implications of fiscal consolidation and developments
in financial and asset markets for inflation would
also need to be taken into account when setting
monetary policy.
Directors underscored the urgent need for restoring financial sector health and making progress
in regulatory reforms in a coordinated manner,
especially among advanced economies. To enable
an early exit from fiscal support as well as address
legacy problems, priorities include restructuring and
resolving weak financial institutions; implementing
measures to shore up bank capital adequacy, liquidity, and stability of funding sources; and improving

world economic outlook: Recovery, Risk, and Rebalancing

coordination of supervision to avoid rapid crossborder amplification of shocks. Further advancement toward building a stronger financial regulatory
framework is crucial to underpin market confidence
and enhance global financial stability.
Directors emphasized that medium-term growth
prospects depend on progress in implementing
structural policies to give forceful impetus to global
demand rebalancing. In this regard, many emerging
market economies would need to further reorient
toward domestic demand, not only because import
recovery in advanced economies will likely trail
behind precrisis trends, but also to achieve balanced
growth that addresses their own consumption and
investment needs. For economies with excessive
external surpluses, this would entail allowing further
exchange rate flexibility and appreciation in response
to sustained capital inflows, while safeguarding financial stability with macroprudential or other targeted
measures. These measures should be complemented
by structural reforms aimed at enhancing social safety
nets and shifting toward optimal saving-investment
patterns. Similarly, measures to boost net exports
would be crucial for economies with excessive current

162

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

account deficits. Continued fiscal adjustment and
financial sector reforms that discourage excessive
spending are also key.
Directors noted that structural policies that
strengthen growth over the medium term would
help support the required normalization of macroeconomic policies in advanced economies. Labor
market policies, coupled with complementary
product and services market reforms, should aim
to promote competition and enhance growth and
job creation, and with sufficient support for the
unemployed.
Directors underscored the critical importance of
continued policy effort and coordination at both
the regional and global levels—as demonstrated
during the global crisis and more recently during
the European sovereign debt market turmoil. While
policy requirements now differ considerably across
countries, it is essential that countries continue to
work together toward the common goal of achieving strong, sustained, and balanced growth over
the medium term. Directors also emphasized the
need to avoid negative spillovers as well as trade and
investment protectionism.

Statistical Appendix

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical data, as well as projections. It
comprises five sections: Assumptions,
What’s New, Data and Conventions,
Classification of Countries, and Statistical Tables.
The assumptions underlying the estimates and
projections for 2010–11 and the medium-term scenario for 2012–15 are summarized in the first section. The second section presents a brief description
of changes to the database and statistical tables.
The third section provides a general description of
the data and of the conventions used for calculating country group composites. The classification
of countries in the various groups presented in
the World Economic Outlook is summarized in the
fourth section.
The last, and main, section comprises the statistical tables. Data in these tables have been compiled on the basis of information available through
late September 2010. The figures for 2010 and
beyond are shown with the same degree of precision as the historical figures solely for convenience;
because they are projections, the same degree of
accuracy is not to be inferred.

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced
economies are assumed to remain constant at their
average levels during the period August 4–September 1, 2010. For 2010 and 2011, these assumptions
imply average U.S. dollar/SDR conversion rates of
1.516 and 1.520, U.S. dollar/euro conversion rates
of 1.308 and 1.284, and yen/U.S. dollar conversion
rates of 88.5 and 84.2, respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average
$76.20 a barrel in 2010 and $78.75 a barrel in
2011.
Established policies of national authorities are
assumed to be maintained. The more specific policy

assumptions underlying the projections for selected
economies are described in Box A1.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that
the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on sixmonth U.S. dollar deposits will average 0.6 percent
in 2010 and 0.8 percent in 2011, that three-month
euro deposits will average 0.8 percent in 2010 and
1.0 percent in 2011, and that six-month yen deposits will average 0.6 percent in 2010 and 0.4 percent
in 2011.
With respect to introduction of the euro, on
December 31, 1998, the Council of the European
Union decided that, effective January 1, 1999, the
irrevocably fixed conversion rates between the euro
and currencies of the member states adopting the
euro are as follows.

World Economic Outlook: Recovery, Risk, and Rebalancing

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions Underlying the Projections for Selected Economies
Fiscal Policy Assumptions
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used
in the World Economic Outlook (WEO) are based
on officially announced budgets, adjusted for differences between the national authorities and the
IMF staff regarding macroeconomic assumptions
and projected fiscal outturns. The medium-term
fiscal projections incorporate policy measures that
are judged likely to be implemented. In cases
where the IMF staff has insufficient information to assess the authorities’ budget intentions
and prospects for policy implementation, an
unchanged structural primary balance is assumed,
unless indicated otherwise. Specific assumptions
used in some of the advanced economies follow
(see also Tables B5, B6, B7, and B9 in the Statistical Appendix for data on fiscal net lending/borrowing and structural balances).1
Argentina: The 2010 forecasts are based on the
2009 outturn and IMF staff assumptions. For
the outer years, the IMF staff assumes unchanged
policies.
Australia: Fiscal projections are based on the
2010–11 budget, 2010 economic statement, 2010
pre-election economic and fiscal outlook, and
IMF staff projections.
Austria: Fiscal projections for 2010 are based
on the authorities’ budget, adjusted for differences
in the IMF staff’s macro framework. For 2011
the IMF staff includes the central government’s
1The output gap is actual minus potential output, as a percent of potential output. Structural balances are expressed as
a percent of potential output. The structural budget balance
is the budgetary position that would be observed if the level
of actual output coincided with potential output. Changes
in the structural budget balance consequently include effects
of temporary fiscal measures, the impact of fluctuations in
interest rates and debt-service costs, and other noncyclical
fluctuations in the budget balance. The computations of
structural budget balances are based on IMF staff estimates
of potential GDP and revenue and expenditure elasticities
(see the October 1993 World Economic Outlook, Annex I).
Net debt is defined as gross debt minus financial assets of the
general government, which include assets held by the social
security insurance system. Estimates of the output gap and
of the structural balance are subject to significant margins of
uncertainty.

164

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

spending ceilings (approved by Parliament) and
the health insurance package savings for all years
(2011–15).
Belgium: Projections for 2010 are IMF staff
estimates based on the 2010 budgets approved by
the federal, regional, and community parliaments
and further strengthened by the Intergovernmental Agreement 2009–10. Projections for the outer
years are IMF staff estimates, assuming unchanged
policies.
Brazil: The 2010 forecasts are based on the
budget law and IMF staff assumptions. For the
outer years, the IMF staff assumes unchanged
policies, with a further increase in public investment in line with the authorities’ intentions.
Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts in
the latest Budget 2010—Leading the Way on Jobs
and Growth. The IMF staff makes some adjustments to this forecast for differences in macroeconomic projections. The IMF staff forecast also
incorporates the most recent data releases from
Finance Canada and Statistics Canada, including
federal, provincial, and territorial budgetary outturns through the end of 2010:Q1.
China: For 2010–11, the government is
assumed to continue and complete the stimulus
program it announced in late 2008, although the
lack of details published on this package complicates IMF staff analysis. Specifically, the IMF staff
assumes the stimulus is not withdrawn in 2010,
and so there is no significant fiscal impulse. Stimulus is withdrawn in 2011, resulting in a negative
fiscal impulse of about 1 percent of GDP (reflecting both higher revenue and lower spending).
Denmark: Projections for 2010–11 are aligned
with the latest official budget estimates and the
underlying economic projections, adjusted where
appropriate for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic
assumptions. For 2012–15, the projections incorporate key features of the medium-term fiscal plan
as embodied in the authorities’ 2009 Convergence
Program submitted to the European Union.
France: Projections for 2010 are based on the
2010 budget and the latest Stability Program and
are adjusted for differences in macroeconomic

Statistical Appendix

assumptions. Projections for the outer years
incorporate the IMF staff’s assessment of current
policies and implementation of announced adjustment measures.
Germany: Projections for 2010 are based on the
2010 budget, adjusted for the differences in the
IMF staff’s macro framework and estimates of the
implementation of the fiscal stimulus measures.
The IMF staff’s projections for 2011 and beyond
reflect the authorities’ adopted core federal government budget plan, adjusted for the differences
in the IMF staff’s macro framework and assumptions on fiscal developments in state and local
governments, the social insurance system, and
special funds.
Greece: Macroeconomic and fiscal projections
for 2010 and the medium term are consistent
with the policies that the IMF has agreed to
support in the context of the Stand-By Arrangement. Fiscal projections assume a strong
front-loaded fiscal adjustment in 2010, followed
by further measures in 2011–13. Growth is
expected to bottom out in late 2010 and gradually rebound after that, coming into positive
territory in 2012.
Hong Kong SAR: Projections are based on the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal projections.
Hungary: The 2010 forecast is based on the
implementation of the budget and the macro
framework discussed during the Sixth Review of
the Stand-By Arrangement. The IMF staff assumes
measures will be undertaken in addition to those
outlined by the authorities for 2011–15: in 2011,
1¾ percent of GDP, to achieve a fiscal target of
2.8 percent of GDP and in the medium term to
ensure fiscal sustainability.
India: Historical data are based on budgetary
execution data. Projections are based on available
information on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with
some adjustments for the IMF staff’s assumptions. Projections are based on the budget itself
as well as the semiannual budget review. Subnational data are incorporated with a lag of up
to two years; general government data are thus
finalized long after central government data. IMF

presentation differs from Indian national accounts
data, particularly regarding subsidies and certain
loans.
Indonesia: The 2009 outturn for the overall
fiscal deficit was 1.6 percent of estimated GDP.
The outturn was lower than the revised budget
deficit, largely as a result of lower interest payments and underspending on personnel, material
goods, and other spending. About 85 percent
of the announced 2009 stimulus measures were
implemented (1.1 percent of GDP), with revenue
measures comprising nearly three-quarters of
the total package. The 2010 revised budget draft
envisages a budget deficit higher than projected by
the IMF staff. The IMF staff builds in a cushion
for a track record of underexecution, the 2010
deficit is likely to be below the announced deficit
target. The IMF staff’s overall deficit projection is
about 1.5 percent of GDP.
Ireland: Fiscal projections for 2010 are based on
the 2010 budget, adjusted for financial sector support and differences in macroeconomic assumptions between the IMF staff and the authorities.
So far during 2010, the government has injected
about €22 billion in capital to banks. The Central
Statistics Office of Ireland has determined that
€8.3 billion of the €22 billion should be reported
as expenditure in the budget. The statistical treatment of the remaining amount is to be determined at a later stage. On this basis, the IMF staff
projections include the €8.3 billion in the 2010
deficit. For 2011–12, IMF staff projections incorporate most of the adjustment efforts announced
by the authorities in their Stability Program
Update, although two-thirds of these measures
have not been specified or agreed to by the
government. For the remainder of the projection
period and in the absence of specifically identified
measures, the projections do not incorporate further budgetary adjustments. The authorities have
announced their intention to further lower the
deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2014 and have
identified broad areas in which to target savings
but have yet to specify and put in place measures
to realize these savings.

World Economic Outlook: Recovery, Risk, and Rebalancing

Box A1 (concluded)
Italy: The fiscal projections incorporate the
impact of the 2010 budget law and fiscal adjustment measures for 2010–13 as approved by the
government in May 2010 and modified during
parliamentary approval during June–July. The
IMF staff projections are based on the authorities’ estimates of the policy scenario, including the
above medium-term fiscal consolidation package
and adjusted mainly for differences in the macroeconomic assumptions and for less optimistic
assumptions concerning the impact of revenue
administration measures (to combat tax evasion).
After 2013, a constant structural primary balance
(net of one-time items) is assumed.
Japan: The 2010 projections assume that fiscal plans will be implemented as announced by
the government. The medium-term projections
typically assume that expenditure and revenue of
the general government are adjusted in line with
current underlying demographic and economic
trends (excluding fiscal stimulus).
Korea: The fiscal projections assume that
fiscal policies will be implemented in 2010 as
announced by the government. The 2010 budget
scales back stimulus measures relative to 2009,
implying a negative fiscal impulse estimated at 2
percent of GDP. Expenditure numbers for 2010
correspond to the expenditure numbers presented
in the government’s budget proposal. Revenue
projections reflect the IMF staff’s macroeconomic
assumptions, adjusted for the estimated costs of
tax measures included in the multiyear stimulus
package introduced last year and discretionary
revenue-raising measures included in the 2010
budget. The medium-term projections assume that
the government will continue with its consolidation plans and balance the budget (excluding
social security funds) in 2014.
Mexico: Fiscal projections are based on (1) the
IMF staff’s macroeconomic projections; (2) the
modified balanced budget rule under the Fiscal
Responsibility Legislation, including the use of
the exceptional clause; and (3) the authorities’

166

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

projections for spending, including for pensions and health care, and for wage restraint. For
2010–11, projections take into account departure
from the balanced budget target under the exceptional clause of the fiscal framework, which allows
for a small deficit reflecting cyclical deterioration
in revenues.
Netherlands: Fiscal projections for the period
2009–11 are based on Bureau for Economic
Policy Analysis budget projections, after adjusting
for differences in macroeconomic assumptions.
For the remainder of the projection period, the
projection assumes unchanged policies.
New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on
the authorities’ 2010 budget and IMF staff estimates. The New Zealand fiscal accounts switched
to generally accepted accounting principles beginning in fiscal year 2006/07, with no comparable
historical data.
Portugal: For 2010, fiscal projections are based
on the 2010 budget, adjusted for differences
between the government’s and the IMF staff’s
macroeconomic assumptions. For 2011 and
beyond, the IMF staff largely incorporates the
specific fiscal measures in the medium-term fiscal
plan, adjusted for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic
projections.
Russia: Projections for 2010 are based on
the nominal expenditures in the 2010 budget,
including the June supplementary budget, and the
IMF staff’s revenue projections. Projections for
2011–13 are based on the non-oil deficit in percent of GDP implied by the draft medium-term
budget and on the IMF staff’s revenue projections.
The IMF staff assumes an unchanged non-oil
federal government balance in percent of GDP
during 2013–15.
Saudi Arabia: The authorities systematically
underestimate revenues and expenditures in the
budget relative to actual outturns. IMF staff projections of oil revenues are based on WEO baseline oil prices discounted by 5 percent, reflecting
the higher sulfur content in Saudi crude oil.

Statistical Appendix

Regarding non-oil revenues, customs receipts are
assumed to grow in line with imports, investment income in line with the London interbank
offered rate (LIBOR), and fees and charges as a
function of non-oil GDP. On the expenditure
side, wages are assumed to rise above the natural
rate of increase, reflecting a salary increase of 15
percent distributed during 2008–10, and goods
and services are projected to grow in line with
inflation over the medium term. In 2010 and
2013, 13th-month pay is awarded based on the
lunar calendar. Interest payments are projected
to decline in line with the authorities’ policy of
repaying public debt. Capital spending in 2010
is projected to be higher than in the budget by
about 32 percent and in line with the authorities’ announcement of $400 billion in spending
over the medium term. The pace of spending is
projected to slow over the medium term, leading
to a tightening of the fiscal stance.
Singapore: For fiscal year 2010/11, projections
are based on budget numbers. For the remainder
of the projection period, the IMF staff assumes
unchanged policies.
South Africa: Fiscal projections are based on the
authorities’ 2010 intentions as stated in the budget
review published February 17, 2010, and on
discussions conducted during the June Article IV
consultation.
Spain: For 2010, fiscal projections incorporate
the impact of measures in the 2010 budget, the
latest Stability Program, and a May fiscal package.
For 2011 and beyond, fiscal projections are based
on the authorities’ medium-term plan, adjusted for
the IMF staff’s macroeconomic projections.
Sweden: Fiscal projections for 2010 are in line
with the authorities’ projections. The impact
of cyclical developments on the fiscal accounts
is calculated using the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s latest
semi-elasticity.
Switzerland: Projections for 2009–15 are based
on IMF staff calculations, which incorporate mea-

sures to restore balance in the federal accounts and
strengthen social security finances.
Turkey: Fiscal projections assume the authorities
adhere to their budget target for 2010 and to their
known policy intentions as stated in the mediumterm program unveiled in September 2009.
United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based on
the authorities’ 2010 budget, announced in June
2010. These projections incorporate the announced
medium-term consolidation plans from 2010
onward. The projections are adjusted for differences in forecasts of macroeconomic and financial
variables.
United States: Fiscal projections are based on policies outlined in the Administration’s Mid-Session
Budget Review for fiscal year 2011. The authorities’
federal projections are adjusted by the IMF staff for
differences in the budget forecasts of key macroeconomic and financial variables and are converted to
a general government basis. The estimates of fiscal
deficit are adjusted for one-off items (the cost of
financial sector support).

Monetary Policy Assumptions
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the
established policy framework in each country.
In most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative
stance over the business cycle: official interest rates
will increase when economic indicators suggest that
inflation will rise above its acceptable rate or range,
and they will decrease when indicators suggest that
prospective inflation will not exceed the acceptable rate or range, that prospective output growth
is below its potential rate, and that the margin of
slack in the economy is significant. On this basis,
the LIBOR on six-month U.S. dollar deposits
is assumed to average 0.6 percent in 2010 and
0.8 percent in 2011 (see Table 1.1). The rate on
three-month euro deposits is assumed to average
0.8 percent in 2010 and 1.0 percent in 2011. The
interest rate on six-month Japanese yen deposits
is assumed to average 0.6 percent in 2010 and
0.4 percent in 2011.

World Economic Outlook: Recovery, Risk, and Rebalancing

See Box 5.4 of the October 1998 World Economic
Outlook for details on how the conversion rates
were established.

What’s New
•• Starting with the October 2010 World Economic
Outlook, the emerging and developing economies’
Western Hemisphere region has been renamed
Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), the
country group composites will be calculated only
when 90 percent or more of the weighted data
are represented, and data for Kosovo are included
in the emerging and developing economies
aggregates.
•• Country weights calculated as nominal GDP
­valued at purchasing-power-parity (PPP)
exchange rates as a share of total world GDP
have been updated to reflect revisions to
­countries’ historical GDP data and ­
projections.

Data and Conventions
Data and projections for 183 economies form the
statistical basis for the World Economic Outlook (the
WEO database). The data are maintained jointly
by the IMF’s Research Department and regional
departments, with the latter regularly updating
country projections based on consistent global
assumptions.
Although national statistical agencies are the
ultimate providers of historical data and definitions,
international organizations are also involved in statistical issues, with the objective of harmonizing methodologies for the compilation of national statistics,
including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions, classifications, and valuation procedures used
in the production of economic statistics. The WEO
database reflects information from both national
source agencies and international organizations.
Most countries’ macroeconomic data presented in
the WEO conform broadly to the 1993 version of
the System of National Accounts (SNA). The IMF’s
sector statistical standards—the Balance of Payments
Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5), the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM 2000), and the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM
168

International Monetary Fund | October 2010

2001)—have all been aligned with the 1993 SNA.
These standards reflect the IMF’s special interest in
countries’ external positions, financial sector stability, and public sector fiscal positions. The process
of adapting country data to the new standards
begins in earnest when the manuals are released.
However, full concordance with the manuals is
ultimately dependent on the provision by national
statistical compilers of revised country data; hence,
the World Economic Outlook estimates are only
partially adapted to these manuals. Nonetheless,
for many countries the impact of conversion to the
updated standards will be small on major balances
and aggregates. Many other countries have partially
adopted the latest standards and will continue
implementation over a period of years.
Consistent with the recommendations of the
1993 SNA, several countries have phased out their
traditional fixed-base-year method of calculating
real macroeconomic variable levels and growth by
switching to a chain-weighted method of computing aggregate growth. The chain-weighted method
frequently updates the weights of price and volume
indicators. It allows countries to measure GDP
growth more accurately by reducing or eliminating
the downward biases in volume series built on index
numbers that average volume components using
weights from a year in the moderately distant past.
Currently, macroeconomic price and volume data
for the following economies are based on chainweighted methodology: Albania, Algeria, Australia,
Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria,
Canada, Colombia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, Estonia, the euro area, Finland, France,
Georgia, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong
SAR, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan,
Kazakhstan, Korea, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta,
Mauritania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore,
Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, the
United Kingdom, and the United States.
Composite data for country groups in the World
Economic Outlook are either sums or weighted averages of data for individual countries. Unless noted
otherwise, multiyear averages of growth rates are
expressed as compound annual rates of change.1
1Averages for real GDP and its components, employment, per
capita GDP, inflation, factor productivity, trade, and commod-

Statistical Appendix

Arithmetically weighted averages are used for all
data for the emerging and developing economies
group except inflation and money growth, for
which geometric averages are used. The following
conventions apply.
•• Country group composites for exchange rates,
interest rates, and growth rates of monetary
aggregates are weighted by GDP converted to
U.S. dollars at market exchange rates (averaged
over the preceding three years) as a share of
group GDP.
•• Composites for other data relating to the domestic economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are
weighted by GDP valued at PPP as a share of
total world or group GDP.2
•• Composites for data relating to the domestic
economy for the euro area (16 member countries
throughout the entire period unless noted otherwise) are aggregates of national source data using
GDP weights. Annual data are not adjusted for
calendar-day effects. For data prior to 1999, data
aggregations apply 1995 European currency unit
exchange rates.
•• Composite unemployment rates and employment
growth are weighted by labor force as a share of
group labor force.
•• Composites relating to the external economy are
sums of individual country data after conversion
to U.S. dollars at the average market exchange
rates in the years indicated for balance of payments data and at end-of-year market exchange
rates for debt denominated in currencies other
than U.S. dollars. Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes and prices, however, are arithmetic averages of percent changes for individual
countries weighted by the U.S. dollar value of
exports or imports as a share of total world or
group exports or imports (in the preceding year).

ity prices are calculated based on the compound annual rate of
change, except for the unemployment rate, which is based on the
simple arithmetic average.
2 See Box A2 of the April 2004 World Economic Outlook for a
summary of the revised PPP-based weights and Annex IV of the
May 1993 World Economic Outlook. See also Anne-Marie Gulde
and Marianne Schulze-Ghattas, “Purchasing Power Parity Based
Weights for the World Economic Outlook,” in Staff Studies for the
World Economic Outlook (International Monetary Fund, December 1993), pp. 106–23.

•• Unless noted otherwise, group composites are
computed if 90 percent or more of the share of
group weights is represented.

Classification of Countries
Summary of the Country Classification
The country classification in the World Economic
Outlook divides the world into two major groups:
advanced economies, and emerging and developing
economies.3 This classification is not based on strict
criteria, economic or otherwise, and it has evolved
over time. The objective is to facilitate analysis by
providing a reasonably meaningful method for
organizing data. Table A provides an overview of
the country classification, showing the number of
countries in each group by region and summarizing some key indicators of their relative size (GDP
valued by PPP, total exports of goods and services,
and population).
Some countries remain outside the country
classification and therefore are not included in
the analysis. Cuba and the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea are not IMF members, and their
economies therefore are not monitored by the IMF.
San Marino is omitted from the group of advanced
economies for lack of a fully developed database.
Likewise, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States
of Micronesia, Palau, Somalia, and Tuvalu are omitted from the emerging and developing economies
group composites because of data limitations.

General Features and Composition of Groups
in the World Economic Outlook Classification
Advanced Economies
The 33 advanced economies are listed in Table
B. The seven largest in terms of GDP—the United
States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United
Kingdom, and Canada—constitute the subgroup of
major advanced economies, often referred to as the
Group of Seven (G7). The 16 members of the euro
3 As used here, the terms “country” and “economy” do not
always refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by
international law and practice. Some territorial entities included
here are not states, although their statistical data are maintained
on a separate and independent basis.

area and the four newly industrialized Asian economies are also distinguished as subgroups. Composite
data shown in the tables for the euro area cover
the current members for all years, even though the
membership has increased over time.
Table C lists the member countries of the
European Union, not all of which are classified as
advanced economies in the World Economic Outlook.

Emerging and Developing Economies
The group of emerging and developing economies (150 countries) includes all those that are not
classified as advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging and developing economies are central and eastern Europe
(CEE), Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),
developing Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean
(LAC), Middle East and north Africa (MENA), and
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Emerging and developing economies are also classified according to analytical criteria. The analytical

criteria reflect the composition of countries’ export
earnings and other income from abroad; a distinction
between net creditor and net debtor countries; and,
for the net debtor countries, financial criteria based
on external financing sources and experience with
external debt servicing. The detailed composition of
emerging and developing economies in the regional
and analytical groups is shown in Tables D and E.
The analytical criterion, by source of export earnings, distinguishes between categories: fuel (Standard International Trade Classification—SITC 3)
and nonfuel and then focuses on nonfuel primary
products (SITCs 0, 1, 2, 4, and 68). Countries are
categorized into one of these groups when their
main source of export earnings exceeds 50 percent
of total exports on average between 2004 and 2008.
The financial criteria focus on net creditor countries, net debtor countries, and heavily indebted poor
countries (HIPCs). Countries are categorized as net
debtors when their current account balance accumulations from 1972 (or earliest data available) to
2008 are negative. Net debtor countries are further

differentiated on the basis of two additional financial criteria: official external financing and experience
with debt servicing.4 Countries are placed in the official external financing category when 65 percent or
more of their total debt, on average between 2004
and 2008, is financed by official creditors.
The HIPC group comprises the countries that
are or have been considered by the IMF and the

World Bank for participation in their debt initiative known as the HIPC Initiative, which aims to
reduce the external debt burdens of all the eligible
HIPCs to a “sustainable” level in a reasonably short
period of time.5 Many of these countries have
already benefited from debt relief and graduated
from the initiative.

4 During 2004–08, 43 countries incurred external payments
arrears or entered into official or commercial-bank debtrescheduling agreements. This group of countries is referred to as
countries with arrears and/or rescheduling during 2004–08.

many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. Data for some countries are for fiscal years.
for some countries refer to real net material product (NMP) or are estimates based on NMP. For many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. The figures should be interpreted only as
indicative of broad orders of magnitude because reliable, comparable data are not generally available. In particular, the output growth of new private enterprises in the informal economy is not fully reflected in the
recent figures.
3Georgia and Mongolia, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.
4Private analysts are of the view that real GDP growth has been lower than the official reports since the last quarter of 2008.
5The percent changes in 2002 are calculated over a period of 18 months, reflecting a change in the fiscal year cycle (from July–June to January–December).
6The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars. IMF staff estimates of U.S. dollar values may differ from the
authorities’ estimates. Real GDP is in constant 2009 prices.

Projections

1In accordance with standard practice in the World Economic Outlook, movements in consumer prices are indicated as annual averages rather than as December–December changes during the year, as is the
practice in some countries. For many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. Data for some countries are for fiscal years.
2December–December changes. Several countries report Q4–Q4 changes.
3For many countries, inflation for the earlier years is measured on the basis of a retail price index. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation data with broader and more up-to-date coverage are typically used for
more recent years.
4Georgia and Mongolia, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.
5Private analysts estimate that CPI inflation has been considerably higher. The authorities have created a board of academic advisors to assess these issues.
6The percent changes in 2002 are calculated over a period of 18 months, reflecting a change in the fiscal year cycle (from July–June to January–December).
7The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars. Staff estimates of U.S. dollar values may differ from authorities’
estimates.

1Debt data refer to the end of the year. Debt data are not always comparable across countries.
2Percent of potential GDP.
3Beginning in 1995, the debt and debt-service obligations of the Treuhandanstalt (and of various other agencies) were taken over by the general government. This debt is equivalent to 8 percent of GDP, and the
associated debt service to ½ to 1 percent of GDP.
4Excludes sizable one-off receipts from the sale of assets, including licenses.
5Excludes one-off measures based on the authorities’ data and, in the absence of the latter, receipts from the sale of assets.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the U.S. dollar values for the
relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook, where the composites were weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities
as a share of total world GDP. For many countries, the estimates of national savings are built up from national accounts data on gross domestic investment and from balance-of-payments-based data on net foreign
investment. The latter, which is equivalent to the current account balance, comprises three components: current transfers, net factor income, and the resource balance. The mixing of data source, which is dictated
by availability, implies that the estimates for national savings that are derived incorporate the statistical discrepancies. Furthermore, errors, omissions, and asymmetries in balance of payments statistics affect the
estimates for net lending; at the global level, net lending, which in theory would be zero, equals the world current account discrepancy. Despite these statistical shortcomings, flow of funds estimates, such as those
presented in these tables, provide a useful framework for analyzing developments in savings and investment, both over time and across regions and countries.
1Calculated from the data of individual Euro Area countries.
2Georgia and Mongolia, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.
