Foreword
For the past 25 years, the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) has published an annual
Statement on the State of the Global Climate
in order to provide authoritative scientific
information about the global climate and
significant weather and climate events
occurring around the world. As we mark the
25th anniversary, and following the entry into
force of the Paris Agreement, the importance
of the information contained in the WMO
Statement is greater than ever. WMO will
continue working to increase the relevance
of the information it provides to the Parties to
the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change through this Statement and the
annual WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin. These
publications complement the assessment
reports that the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) produces every six to
seven years.
Since the inaugural Statement on the State
of the Global Climate, in 1993, scientific
understanding of our complex climate system
has progressed rapidly. This is particularly
true with respect to our understanding of
mankind’s contribution to climate change,
and the nature and degree of such change.
This includes our ability to document the
occurrence of extreme weather and climate
events and the degree to which they can be
attributed to human influences on the climate.
In the past quarter of a century, atmospheric
concentrations of carbon dioxide – whose
rising emissions, along with those of other
greenhouse gases, are driving anthropogenic
climate change – have risen from 360 parts
per million (ppm) to more than 400 ppm. They
will remain above that level for generations
to come, committing our planet to a warmer
future, with more weather, climate and water
extremes. Climate change is also increasingly
manifested in sea level rise, ocean acidification
and heat, melting sea ice and other climate
indicators.
The global mean temperature in 2017
was approximately 1.1 °C above the preindustrial era, more than half way towards
the maximum limit of temperature increase
of 2 °C sought through the Paris Agreement,
which further strives to limit the increase to
1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. The year
2017 was the warmest on record without an

El Niño event, and one of the three warmest
years behind the record-setting 2016. The
world’s nine warmest years have all occurred
since 2005, and the five warmest since 2010.
Extreme weather claimed lives and destroyed
livelihoods in many countries in 2017. Fuelled
by warm sea-surface temperatures, the North
Atlantic hurricane season was the costliest ever
for the United States, and eradicated decades
of development gains in small islands in the
Caribbean such as Dominica. Floods uprooted
millions of people on the Indian subcontinent,
whilst drought is exacerbating poverty and
increasing migration pressures in the Horn of
Africa. It is no surprise that extreme weather
events are identified as the most prominent
risk facing humanity in the World Economic
Forum’s Global Risks Report 2018.
Because the societal and economic impacts
of climate change have become so severe,
WMO has partnered with other United Nations
organizations to include information in the
Statement on how climate has affected
migration patterns, food security, health and
other sectors. Such impacts disproportionately
affect vulnerable nations, as evidenced in a
recent study by the International Monetary
Fund, which warned that a 1 °C increase in
temperature would cut significantly economic
growth rates in many low-income countries.
I would like to take this opportunity to express
my gratitude to the National Meteorological
and Hydrological Services of WMO Members,
international and regional data centres and
agencies, and climate experts from around
the world for their contributions, and to United
Nations sister agencies for their valuable input
on societal and economic impacts. They have
greatly assisted in ensuring that this annual
Statement achieves the highest scientific
standards and societal relevance and informs
action on the Paris Agreement, the Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and
the United Nations Sustainable Development
Goals.

Executive summary
Global mean temperatures in 2017 were
1.1 °C ± 0.1 °C above pre-industrial levels.
Whilst 2017 was a cooler year than the recordsetting 2016, it was still one of the three
warmest years on record, and the warmest not
influenced by an El Niño event. The average
global temperature for 2013–2017 is close
to 1 °C above that for 1850–1900 and is also
the highest five-year average on record.
The world also continued to see rising sea
levels, with some acceleration, and increasing
concentrations of greenhouse gases. The
cryosphere continued its contraction, with
Arctic and Antarctic sea ice shrinking.
The overall risk of heat-related illness or
death has climbed steadily since 1980, with
around 30% of the world’s population now
living in climatic conditions that deliver deadly
temperatures at least 20 days a year.
There were many significant weather and
climate events in 2017, including a very
active North Atlantic hurricane season, major
monsoon floods in the Indian subcontinent,
and continuing severe drought in parts of east
Africa. This contributed to 2017 being the year
with the highest documented economic losses
associated with severe weather and climate
events. Extreme weather events continue to be
rated by the World Economic Forum as amongst
the most significant risks facing humanity, both
in terms of likelihood and impact.1
Massive internal displacement in the context
of drought and food insecurity continues

across Somalia. From November 2016 to
December 2017, 892 000 drought-related
displacements were recorded by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR).
In August and September 2017, the three
major and devastating hurricanes that made
landfall in the southern United States and in
several Caribbean islands in rapid succession
broke modern records for such weather
extremes and for loss and damage.
The information used in this repor t is
sourced from a large number of National
Meteorological and Hydrological Services
(NMHSs) and associated institutions, as
well as Regional Climate Centres, the World
Climate Research Programme (WCRP), the
Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) and Global
Cryosphere Watch (GCW). Information has
also been supplied by a number of other
international organizations, including the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO), the World Food
Programme ( W FP), the World Health
Organization (WHO), the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
the International Organization for Migration
(IOM), the International Monetary Fund

Key climate indicators
TEMPERATURE

The world’s nine warmest years have all
occurred since 2005, and the five warmest
since 2010, whilst even the coolest year of
the 21st century – 2008, 0.09 °C above the
1981−2010 average – would have ranked as
the second-warmest year of the 20 th century.
The five-year mean temperature for 2013–
2017, 0.4 °C above the 1981–2010 average (and
1.0 °C above pre-industrial values), is also the
highest on record. A five-year average gives
a longer-term perspective on recent global
temperatures whilst being less influenced
than annual temperatures by year-to-year
fluctuations such as those associated with
the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

The conventional datasets used are those produced by the US
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA);
the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA); and the Met Office, Hadley Centre/Climatic Research
Unit (CRU), University of East Anglia (United Kingdom). The
two reanalysis datasets used are the ERA-Interim dataset,
produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF), and the JRA-55 dataset, produced by
the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).
For purposes other than comparison of temperatures with
pre-industrial levels, this report uses 1981–2010 as a standard
baseline period, as this is the period for which the widest
range of datasets (especially satellite-based datasets) is
available.
For the purposes of this report, 1850–1900 is used as the
baseline for pre-industrial temperatures. There is no appreciable difference between the temperature change derived
from this baseline and that derived from other baselines
used historically, such as 1880–1900.

Global average temperature anomaly (°C)

The year 2017 was one of the world’s three
warmest years on record. A combination
of five datasets, three of them using
conventional sur face obser vations and
two of them reanalyses, 2 shows that global
mean temperatures were 0.46 °C ± 0.1 °C
above the 1981–2010 average, 3 and about
1.1 °C ± 0.1 °C above pre-industrial levels.4 By
this measure, 2017 and 2015 were effectively
indistinguishable as the world’s second and
third warmest years on record, ranking only
behind 2016, which was 0.56 °C above the
1981−2010 average. The years 2015, 2016
and 2017 were clearly warmer than any year
prior to 2015, with all pre-2015 years being at
least 0.15 °C cooler than 2015, 2016 or 2017.

In the individual datasets, 2017 was secondwarmest in the two reanalysis datasets
(ERA-Interim and JRA-55) and in the dataset
from the US National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), and third-warmest in
the datasets from the US National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and
the UK Met Office Hadley Centre/Climatic
Research Unit (CRU). Differences between
individual datasets primarily relate to different
ways in which they analyse data-sparse areas,
especially in the Arctic which has experienced
some of the world’s strongest warming in
recent years.

year, monthly global temperature anomalies
were between 0.3 °C and 0.5 °C, the smallest
monthly anomaly being 0.34 °C in June.
The year 2017 was clearly the warmest on
record not influenced by an El Niño. Strong
El Niño events, such as the one that occurred
in 2015/2016, typically increase global mean
temperatures by 0.1 °C to 0.2 °C in the year
in which the event finishes, with a smaller
increase in the event’s first year. In the case
of the 2015/2016 event, global temperatures
were strongly boosted from October 2015 to
April 2016, having a substantial influence on
both the 2015 and 2016 annual values. Neutral
ENSO conditions prevailed for most of 2017,
with a weak La Niña developing late in the year.
Warmth in 2017 was notable for its spatial
ex tent. The only land area of any size
outside Antarctica that had annual mean
temperatures in 2017 below the 1981–2010
average in conventional surface analyses
was a section of western Canada centred on
the interior of British Columbia. Reanalysis

data also indicated some areas of belowaverage temperatures in parts of Africa where
conventional data are sparse, including Libya
and parts of the interior of southern Africa.
Temperatures were 1 °C or more above
average over most of the higher latitudes
of Asia, including the Asian part of Russia,
Mongolia and northern China. Other regions
where 2017 temperatures were at least 1 °C
above average included north-west Canada
and Alaska, the southern half of the United
States and parts of northern Mexico, and parts
of eastern Australia. The largest anomalies,
above 2 °C, were found at high northern
latitudes, particularly in eastern Russia and
north-west North America. Some coastal
locations experiencing feedback from reduced
sea-ice presence (such as Svalbard) were as
much as 4 °C above average.
Despite the widespread high temperatures,
only limited regions had their warmest year
on record in 2017. Of 47 countries reporting
mean temperatures at the national scale,
only Argentina, Mauritius, Mexico, Spain and

Uruguay had their warmest year on record.
The Asian part of Russia also had its warmest
year on record (the Russian Federation as a
whole ranked fourth), as did five states in
the southern half of the United States, and
the eastern Australian states of New South
Wales and Queensland.
All continents had one of their six warmest
years on record in 2017, with South America
ranking second, Asia third, Africa fourth,
Europe fifth, and North America and Oceania
sixth5. Temperatures in Africa were at record
levels through mid-year, with monthly records
set in May, June, July and September, but it
cooled considerably from October onwards.
South America had its second-warmest
summer and second-warmest winter on
record, whilst Oceania had its warmest July.

Mauna Loa (Hawaii) and Cape Grim (Tasmania)

yet clear how the rate of increase compares
with that in 2016 or in previous years.
In 2016, GHG concentrations reached new
highs with CO2 at 403.3±0.1 parts per million

PALEO AND CURRENT CONCENTRATIONS OF CO2
The reconstruction of past climate provides
an oppor tunity to learn how the Ear th
system responded to high concentrations
of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2). To
obtain information about the state of the
atmosphere before instrumental records
began, combinations of proxies are used
in which physical characteristics of past
environmental conditions are preserved.
Tiny bubbles of ancient air captured in ice
cores when new snow accumulating at the top
solidified into ice, can be directly measured
and give some insight into the composition
of the atmosphere in the past.
Direct measurements of atmospheric CO2 over
the past 800 000 years (see figure) provide
proof that over the past eight swings between
ice ages (glacials) and warm periods similar to
today (interglacials) atmospheric CO2 varied
between 180 and 280 parts per million (ppm),
demonstrating that today’s CO2 concentration
of 400 ppm exceeds the natural variability
seen over hundreds of thousands of years.
Over the past decade, new high-resolution ice
core records have been used to investigate

how fast atmospheric CO2 changed in the past.
After the last ice age, some 23 000 years ago,
CO2 concentrations and temperature began to
rise. During the period recorded in the West
Antarctica ice core, fastest CO2 increases
(16 000, 15 000 and 12 000 years ago) ranged
between 10 and 15 ppm over 100–200 years.
In comparison, CO2 has increased by 120 ppm
in the last 150 years due to combustion of
fossil fuel.
Periods of the past with a CO2 concentration
similar to the current one can provide estimates
for the associated “equilibrium” climate. In
the mid-Pliocene, 3–5 million years ago,
the last time that the Earth’s atmosphere
contained 400 ppm of CO2, global mean surface
temperature was 2–3 °C warmer than today,
the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets
melted and even some of the East Antarctic
ice was lost, leading to sea levels that were
10–20 m higher than they are today. During
the mid-Miocene (15–17 million years ago),
atmospheric CO2 reached 400–650 ppm and
global mean surface temperature was 3–4 °C
warmer than today.

For CH4, the increase from 2015 to 2016 was
slightly smaller than that observed from 2014
to 2015 but larger than the average over the
past decade. For N2O, the increase from 2015
to 2016 was also slightly smaller than that
observed from 2014 to 2015 and lower than
the average growth rate over the past 10 years.

OZONE
The 2017 Antarctic ozone hole was relatively
small by the standards of recent decades. This
largely reflects local atmospheric conditions
in 2017 and is not, in itself, indicative of a
more sustained downward trend. Most ozone
hole indicators show weak, non-significant
downward trends over the last 20 years.
The daily ozone hole area reached a
maximum for the season of 19.6 million km2
on 11 September. The first part of the season,

up to the second week of September, saw the
size of the Antarctic ozone hole at levels close
to the 1979–2016 average. However, the polar
vortex became unstable and elliptical in the
third week of September, with temperatures
at the polar cap (60–90°S) rising 5–7 °C above
the long-term mean. This resulted in a rapid
decrease in the size of the ozone hole before a
small increase around the end of September.
The average area of the ozone hole through
the peak of the season (from 7 September to
13 October) was 17.4 million km2. This is the
smallest value since 2002 (12.0 million km2)
and also smaller than in 2012, the lowest value
in the 2003–2016 period (17.8 million km2). The
average ozone hole area over the 30 worst
consecutive days was 17.5 million km2. This
is also the lowest value observed since 2002
(15.5 million km 2 ) and again somewhat
smaller than in 2012 (18.9 million km2).

The Global Carbon Budget

Accurately assessing carbon dioxide (CO 2)
emissions and redistribution within the
atmosphere, oceans, and land – the “global
carbon budget” – helps us capture how humans
are changing the Earth’s climate, supports the
development of climate policies, and improves
projections of future climate change.
Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry
have been growing for decades with pauses only during
global economic downturns. For the first time, emissions
stalled from 2014 to 2016 while the global economy
continued to expand. Nonetheless, CO2 accumulated in
the atmosphere at unprecedented rates close to 3 parts
per million (ppm) per year in 2015 and 2016, despite
stable fossil fuel emissions (figure, top). This surprising
dynamic was caused by strong El Niño warming in 2015
and 2016, when the land CO2 sink was less efficient in
removing atmospheric CO2, and emissions from fires
were above average (in 2015). Preliminary data for 2017
show that emissions from fossil fuels and industry
resumed growing at about 1.5% (0.7%–2.4%, leap year
adjusted), from 36.2±2.0 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2016
to a record high of 36.6±2.0 billion tonnes in 2017 – 65%
higher than in 1990.
Carbon dioxide emissions from change in land use were
4.8±2.6 billion tonnes in 2016, accounting for 12% of
all anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and are expected to
remain stable or slightly lower for 2017 on the basis
of initial observations using satellite data. Together,
land use change and fossil fuel emissions reached an
estimated 41.5±4.4 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2017.
Of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions, only about 45%
remained in the atmosphere on an annual average over
the past decade: 25% were removed by the oceans and
30% were removed by the terrestrial biosphere (figure,
bottom). However, due to the strong El Niño conditions,
the increase from 2015 to 2016 in atmospheric CO2

concentration was 22.1±0.7 billion tonnes (54% of total
emissions; 2.85 ppm) which is larger than the average for
2007–2016. Ocean and terrestrial ecosystems removed
9.5±1.8 billion tonnes of CO2 (23%) and 9.9±3.7 billion
tonnes of CO2 (24%), respectively.
There are substantial uncertainties in the quantification
of the land and ocean carbon sinks on sub-decadal
and decadal time scales, and in the reconstruction of
cumulative emissions across centuries of the industrial
era, particularly historical emissions from changes in
land use.

TEMPERATURE

For the second successive year, aboveaverage sea-surface temperatures off the
east coast of Australia resulted in significant
coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef,
this time focused on central areas of the
Reef rather than the northern areas affected
in 2016. 6 Significant bleaching was also
reported in other parts of the western tropical
Pacific,7 including Micronesia and Guam,
although global bleaching was less extensive
than it had been in 2016. Later in the year,
exceptionally warm sea-surface temperatures
(generally 2 °C or more above average, and
0.5 °C or more above previous records for the
time of year) affected the southern Tasman
Sea, coinciding with record high monthly
temperatures in New Zealand (especially the
South Island) and Tasmania. Whilst marine
impacts of this event are still becoming
apparent, there has already been a shift in
the distribution of fish species, with snapper
being caught off Fiordland (far south-west
New Zealand) for the first time.

Ocean heat content, a measure of the heat

reached new record highs in 2017. Mean ocean
heat content for 2017 for the 0–700 metre
layer was 158.1 ZJ, 8 6.9 ZJ higher than the
previous annual mean record set in 2015. The
mean for the October–December 2017 quarter,
163.4 ZJ, was also the highest quarterly
value on record. The ocean heat content for
the 0–2000 metre layer (233.5 ZJ) was also
the highest on record, although records for
this layer only extend back to 2005. Annual
records for the 0–700 metre layer were also

Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, although the
Indian Ocean had its lowest value since 2009.

Heat content (1022 Joules)

Global sea-surface temperatures in 2017
were somewhat below the levels of 2015 and
2016, but still ranked as the third warmest
on record. The most significant sea-surface
temperature anomalies were in the western
tropical Pacific and the western and central
subtropical South Indian Ocean. In both
regions, sea-surface temperatures were
widely 0.5 °C to 1.0 °C above the 1981–2010
average, locally exceeding 1.0 °C above
average in the Indian Ocean, and were
generally at record-high levels. In contrast,
temperatures were slightly below average
over most of the eastern Indian Ocean and
over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific,
the latter being consistent with weak La Niña
conditions which developed late in the year.
They were also slightly below average in
parts of the far southern Atlantic. The area of
cool waters in the north-east Atlantic south
of Iceland was less prominent than in most
recent years.

The pie charts show the contributions of
individual components of the sea-level budget
(expressed in percentage of the observed

that the magnitude of almost all components
has increased in recent years, particularly
melting of the polar ice sheets, mostly in
Greenland and to a lesser extent in Antarctica.
Accelerated ice-mass loss from the ice sheets
is the main cause of acceleration of the global
mean sea-level rise, as revealed by satellite
altimetry. This is even clearer when year-toyear fluctuations due to El Niño and La Niña
as well as temporary cooling from the 1991
Mt Pinatubo eruption are removed.10

The ocean absorbs up to 30% of the annual
emissions of anthropogenic CO 2 into the
atmosphere, helping to alleviate the impacts
of climate change on the planet. However,
this comes at a steep ecological cost, as
the absorbed CO 2 reacts in seawater and
changes acidity levels in the ocean. More
precisely, this involves a decrease in seawater
pH together with closely linked shifts in the
carbonate chemistry of the waters, including
the saturation state of aragonite, which is the
main form of calcium carbonate used by key
species to form shells and skeletal material
(e.g. reef-building corals and shelled molluscs).
Observations of marine acidity in open ocean
and coastal locations have revealed that
present-day conditions are often outside
pre-industrial bounds. In some regions, the
changes are amplified by natural processes
such as upwelling (where cold water that is
rich in CO2 and nutrients rises from the deep
toward the sea surface), resulting in conditions
outside biologically relevant thresholds.
Projections of future ocean conditions show
that ocean acidification affects all areas of
the ocean, while consequences for marine
species, ecosystems and their functioning
vary. Over the past 10 years, various studies
have confirmed that ocean acidification is
directly influencing the health of coral reefs;
the success, quality and taste of aquacultureraised fish and seafood; and the survival and
calcification of several key organisms. These
alterations often affect species at lower trophic
levels and have cascading effects within the

increasing impacts on coastal economies.
Further, ocean acidification does not impact
marine ecosystems in isolation. Multiple
other environmental stressors can interact
with ocean acidification, such as ocean
warming and stratification, de-oxygenation
and ex treme events, as well as other
anthropogenic per turbations such as
overfishing and pollution.
There has been a consistent trend in ocean
acidification over time. Since records at Aloha
station (north of Hawaii) began in the late
1980s, seawater pH has progressively fallen,
from values above 8.10 in the early 1980s to
between 8.04 and 8.09 in the last five years.

THE CRYOSPHERE IN 2017
Sea-ice extent was well below the 1981–2010
average throughout 2017 in both the Arctic and
Antarctic. The winter maximum of Arctic sea
ice of 14.42 million square kilometres, reached
on 7 March, was the lowest winter maximum
in the satellite record, 0.10 million square
kilometres below the previous record low set
in 2015. However, melting during the spring
and summer was slower than in some recent
years. The summer minimum of 4.64 million
square kilometres on 13 September was the
eighth-lowest on record, 1.25 million square
kilometres above the 2012 record low. A slow

for the time of year by the end of December.

Year

The glacial mass balance change has been
negative in every year since 1988.

The mass balance change (the estimated
change of the mass of ice from one year
to the next) of the Greenland ice sheet in
the year from September 2016 to August
2017 was well above the 1981–2010 average,
due mainly to unusually heavy precipitation
during autumn 2016. The mass balance
change from September to December 2017
was close to average. Although the overall
ice mass increased, this was only a small
departure from the trend over the past two
decades, with the Greenland ice sheet having
lost approximately 3 600 billion tons of ice
mass since 2002.

The northern hemisphere snow cover extent
was near or slightly above the 1981–2010
average for most of the year, most significantly
in May (9% above average, 12 th highest on
record). May snow cover extent was the
highest since 1996, and the highest in Eurasia
since 1985, with particularly strong anomalies
in nor th-western Russia and nor thern
Scandinavia, where May temperatures were
well below average. Summer snow cover
extent, which has been showing a strong
downward trend, was close to the long-term
average in 2017 for the first time in more than
a decade, giving June, July and August the
highest values since 2004, 2006 and 1998
respectively. Similar to most recent years,
autumn snow cover extent was above average,
although not to the same extent as in 2016,
with October and November both ranking 9 th
highest. Snow cover extent returned to slightly
below average in December. Contrasting
precipitation anomalies during the 2016/2017
winter saw alpine snow cover well below
average in most of the European Alps, but at
or near record high levels in Corsica.

Mass balance change data for 2017 for
glaciers outside major continental ice sheets
are not yet available. For 2016, mass balance
change, averaged across a set of 26 reference
glaciers with data available at the time of
writing, was approximately −900 mm water
equivalent. This was a smaller decrease than
in 2015, but close to the 2011–2016 mean.

In the southern hemisphere, an extensive
snow event in southern South America from
14 to 21 June saw continental snow cover
extent reach 750 000 square kilometres, the
highest since satellite monitoring began in
2005, whilst the alpine snowpack at high
elevations in south-eastern Australia was
the deepest since 2000.

Antarctic sea-ice extent was at or near record
low levels throughout the year. The summer
minimum of 2.11 million square kilometres,
recorded on 3 March, was 0.18 million square
kilometres below the previous record set
in 1997, whilst the winter maximum of
18.03 million square kilometres, recorded
on 12 October (the equal-latest maximum
date on record), was second behind 1986.

MAJOR DRIVERS OF INTERANNUAL
CLIMATE VARIABILITY IN 2017

In contrast with 2016, which saw the later
part of one of the strongest El Niño events
of the last 50 years, a neutral phase of ENSO
prevailed for most of 2017. The year began
with conditions slightly cooler than average
in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific,
consistent with the borderline cool neutral/
weak La Niña conditions which had existed
in the last part of 2016. These cool anomalies
had weakened by February, before becoming
re-established later in 2017. By November,
conditions had cooled to the point where a
weak La Niña event had been declared by
most agencies.
Whilst there was no basin-wide El Niño in
2017, there was a sharp warming near the
South American coast early in the year, of a
type more often seen during El Niño events.

Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)

There are several large-scale modes of
variability in the world’s climate that influence
conditions over large parts of the world on
seasonal to interannual timescales. The El
Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is probably
the best-known of the major drivers of
interannual climate variability. The equatorial
Indian Ocean is also subject to fluctuations
in sea-surface temperatures, although on a
less regular basis than the Pacific. The Indian
Ocean Dipole (IOD) describes a mode of
variability that affects the western and eastern
parts of the ocean. The Arctic Oscillation (AO)
and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are two
closely related modes of variability in the
atmospheric circulation at middle and higher
latitudes of the northern hemisphere. In
positive mode, the subtropical high-pressure
ridge is stronger than normal, as are areas
of low pressure at higher latitudes, such as
the “Icelandic” and “Aleutian” lows, resulting
in enhanced westerly circulation through
mid-latitudes. In negative mode, the reverse
is true, with a weakened subtropical ridge,
weakened higher-latitude low pressure areas
and an anomalous easterly flow through
mid-latitudes. The Southern Annular Mode
(SAM), also known as the Antarctic Oscillation
(AAO), is the southern hemisphere analogue
of the AO.

Peru were more than 2 °C above average
in February and March, before declining in
the following months. These warm coastal
temperatures were associated with significant
flooding, particularly in Peru (something
which had been largely absent during the
previous year’s El Niño), whilst there were
also heavy rains and flooding in California
to an extent which far exceeded that of the
2015/2016 El Niño.
The Indian Ocean Dipole was generally on
the positive side of neutral for most of 2017,
although the strength of the signal varied
considerably between different datasets (the
strongest cool signal in the eastern Indian
Ocean was also south of the 10°S southern
boundary of the area used to define IOD
indices). The IOD state was associated with
dry conditions in much of Australia between
May and September, and with a return to
average to above-average rains in the Horn
of Africa late in the year after an extended
period of drought.

their season of peak influence, January to
March, with index values of +0.88 and +0.74
respectively, although in both cases these
values were less strongly positive than in

The most extensive area with annual rainfall
above the 90 th percentile in 2017 was in
north-east Europe, extending from northern
European Russia as far west as northern
Germany and southern Norway. European
Russia had its second-wettest year on record
(as did Russia as a whole) and Norway its
sixth-wettest. Autumn was especially wet in
the Baltic region, with Estonia and Lithuania
both having their wettest autumn on record
and Latvia its second-wettest.
Thailand had its wettest year on record, with
national rainfall 27% above average. The
south was especially wet with the east coast
region 56% above average. However, the high
rainfall was more evenly distributed through
the year than it was in the previous record
wet year of 2011. Even though that year’s
extreme flooding was not repeated, there
were significant local floods from time to time,
particularly in the south of the country early
in the year. Rainfall above the 90 th percentile
also occurred in the Philippines, parts of
eastern Indonesia and the interior of Western
Australia.
Other areas with annual rainfall above the 90th
percentile included parts of inland southern
Africa, scattered areas in the southern half
of South America east of the Andes, and
around the Great Lakes in North America.
Michigan had its wettest year on record, with
very wet conditions also in the Great Lakes
and St Lawrence region of Canada. Rainfall
significantly above average also affected many
parts of Central America and the Caribbean
islands, with the largest anomalies in those
parts of the Eastern Caribbean that were most
affected by hurricanes.

17 named storms, and the seventh-highest
value of Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE)
on record, including a record monthly value
for September. The Northeast and Northwest
Pacific basins both had a near-average number
of cyclones but relatively few severe cyclones,
leading to below-average ACE values in both
basins.

The total hemispheric ACE was the lowest
recorded since regular satellite coverage
began in 1970.
Three exceptionally destructive hurricanes
occurred in rapid succession in the North
Atlantic in late August and September. Harvey
made landfall in south Texas as a category
4 system, then remained near-stationary in
the Houston area for several days, producing
exceptionally prolonged extreme rainfall and
severe flooding. An exceptional 1 539 mm of
rain fell from 25 August to 1 September at a
gauge near Nederland, Texas — the largest
amount of rain ever recorded in a tropical
cyclone in the United States — whilst the
storm total rainfall was in the 900–1 200 mm
range in much of metropolitan Houston.17 One

rainfalls during Hurricane Harvey were made
three times more likely by anthropogenic
climate change.
Harvey was followed by Hurricane Irma, in early
September, and by Maria in mid-September.
Both hurricanes peaked at category 5 intensity,
with Irma maintaining that intensity for
60 hours, which is longer than in any North
Atlantic hurricane in the satellite era. Irma’s
initial landfall, at near-peak intensity, led to
extreme damage across numerous Caribbean
islands, most significantly on Barbuda, which
experienced near-total destruction, with only
a few inhabitants having returned as of early
2018. Other islands to experience major
damage included Saint Martin/Sint Maarten,
Anguilla, St Kitts and Nevis, the Turks and

southern Bahamas. Irma went on to track
along the northern coast of Cuba, leading
to extensive damage there, before making
landfall in south-west Florida at category 4
intensity.
Hurricane Maria made initial landfall on
Dominica at near-peak intensity, making it
the first category 5 hurricane to strike the
island, and leading to major destruction there.
The World Bank estimates Dominica’s total
damages and losses from the hurricane at
US$ 1.3 billion or 224% of its Gross Domestic
Product (GDP). The storm weakened slightly
but was still a category 4 hurricane when
it reached Puerto Rico. Maria triggered
widespread and severe damage on Puerto
Rico from wind, flooding and landslides.
Power was lost to the entire island, and
had only been restored to just over half the
population three months after the hurricane,
whilst water supplies and communications
were also severely affected.
All three of these hurricanes were assessed
by the National Centers for Environmental
Information (NCEI) as ranking in the top five
for hurricane-related economic losses in
the United States (alongside Katrina in 2005
and Sandy in 2012), with estimated costs of
US$ 125 billion for Harvey, US$ 90 billion for
Maria and US$ 50 billion for Irma.19 Irma and
Maria also led to substantial losses outside
the United States. At least 251 deaths were
attributed to the three hurricanes in the United
States (including Puerto Rico and the US
Virgin Islands) and 73 elsewhere. 20
Other significant hurricanes during the 2017
North Atlantic season, both in October,
were Hurricane Nate, which was associated
with significant flooding in Central America
19

The total losses reported by NCEI for these three hurricanes
(central estimate US$265 billion) are higher than the assessment by Munich Re (US$215 billion, including losses outside
the United States), but this difference is within the margin
of uncertainty. It may also reflect differences in accounting
for indirect economic losses.

were as reported by NCEI.

NORTH ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON 2017: INDUCED LOSS AND DAMAGE
When Hurricane Irma made landfall, it hit Barbuda
with maximum sustained winds of 295 km/h, record
rainfall and a storm surge of nearly three metres.
Deaths were limited to one but an estimated 90%
of properties were damaged. This prompted the
Prime Minister to order the complete evacuation
of all residents as Hurricane Jose approached. It
was three weeks before residents were permitted
to return, and three months later only an estimated
20% of the population had returned. The long-term
impact remains to be seen, with damage and loss
estimated at US$ 155 million, and recovery and
reconstruction needs estimated at US$ 222.2 million1
– together accounting for approximately 9% of the
gross domestic product of Antigua and Barbuda.
Hurricane Maria proved still more devastating for
Dominica. Total damages and losses were estimated
at US$ 1.3 billion or 224% of GDP, with significant
par ts of the island’s rainforest damaged and
destroyed. This has implications for the whole of

(especially Costa Rica and Nicaragua),
and Hurricane Ophelia, which became the
easternmost hurricane on record to reach
major (category 3) intensity, before crossing
Ireland as a transitioning ex tratropical
storm and leading to widespread damage.
Ophelia’s broader wind field also contributed
to destructive wildfires in Portugal.
Whilst the number of severe cyclones in
the Northwest Pacific in 2017 was low, a
number of systems still brought widespread
destruction and heavy casualties, mostly
from flooding. The largest loss of life from a
tropical cyclone in 2017 was in late December,
when Typhoon Tembin (Vinta) crossed the
island of Mindanao with a peak 10-minute
wind speed of 36 m s −1 (70 kt), resulting in
at least 129 deaths, 21 mostly from flooding.

alone are estimated at 19%, and 38% of housing was
damaged. 2 Maria caused the longest blackout in the
history of the United States in Puerto Rico, which
affected 35% of the island’s population for at least
three months – continued problems following the
hurricane may see the privatization of the Puerto Rico
Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the largest publicly
owned corporation in the United States.3 The disaster
prompted the Federal Emergency Management
Agency to approve US$ 1.02 billion of assistance to
the Individuals and Households Program and obligate
US$ 555 million in Public Assistance grants.4

Two separate events in Vietnam, an unnamed

both associated with over 100 deaths from
flooding. The heaviest economic losses were
from Typhoon Hato (Isang) in August, which
hit Hong Kong, Macau and neighbouring areas
of China on 23 August, with an estimated
US$ 6 billion in losses and at least 32 deaths.22
It was the strongest impact in Macau for more

The two most significant cyclones of the

Ockhi also had major impacts in southern
India, including a great number of fishermen

from Northeast Pacific systems in 2017 were
from flooding, with Tropical Storm Lidia
leading to significant flooding in Mexico in
August, and Tropical Storm Selma (the first
recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall
in El Salvador) doing likewise in El Salvador,
Nicaragua and Honduras.
Although the number of tropical cyclones
in the south-west Indian Ocean was below
average, there were two which had major
impacts. Dineo, with maximum 10-minute
winds of 39 m s −1 (75 kt), was the first to
make landfall in Mozambique since 2008
when it hit in early February. In addition to
its effects in Mozambique, the subsequent
overland low resulted in severe flooding in
Zimbabwe and northern South Africa, and
was the main contributor to the 246 floodrelated deaths reported in Zimbabwe during
the 2016/2017 rainy season.23 Enawo, in early
March, hit the east coast of Madagascar at
near its peak intensity (10-minute winds of
57 m s −1 (110 kt)). Enawo had major impacts

on Madagascar, 24 with at least 81 associated
deaths reported and extensive damage to
houses, infrastructure and crops. Agricultural
losses were estimated by the World Bank at
US$ 207 million, mostly from the destruction
of vanilla plantations.
In the Southwest Pacific, Cyclone Debbie
hit the east coast of Australia in late March,
making landfall in the Whitsunday region
with maximum 10-minute winds of 43 m s −1
(80 kt) after earlier peaking at 49 m s−1 (95 kt),
leading to extensive wind and flood damage.
The system then tracked south and south-east
as a tropical low, with widespread major
flooding, especially on the east coast near the
Queensland-New South Wales border. The
remnant system then went on to be largely
responsible for major flooding in much of the
North Island of New Zealand in early April.

eastern Europe particularly affected during the
spring and early summer. Winds, exceeding
100 km/h during a thunderstorm resulted in
widespread damage and at least 11 deaths
in Moscow on 29 May. Other noteworthy
storms included a severe hailstorm and
tornado that affected the southern suburbs
of Vienna on 10 July, a 165 km/h wind gust
at Innsbruck on 30 July, a hailstorm with
hailstones up to 9 cm in diameter in Istanbul
on 27 July, and widespread thunderstorms
that left 50 000 households without power
in southern Finland on 12 August. Severe
flash flooding affected parts of the Croatian
coast on 11 September, with 283 mm of rain
recorded in 12 hours at Zadar.
For the first time since 2011, the United States
had an above-average tornado season, with
a preliminary annual total of 1 406 tornadoes,
12% above the 1991–2010 average. However,
the number of fatalities during the season
(34) was below the long-term average. The
most destructive storm of the season was
a hailstorm that hit Denver on 8 May, with
hailstones exceeding 5 cm in diameter.
Insured losses from this event exceeded
US$ 2.2 billion.
A severe windstorm (known locally as Zeus)
affected France on 6–7 March. Peak gusts
reached 193 km/h at Camaret-sur-Mer in
Brittany, and the storm was rated by MétéoFrance as the most significant windstorm in
France since 2010. Later in the year, a storm in
late October produced wind gusts exceeding
170 km/h at high elevations and 140 km/h in
the lowlands in Austria and Czechia, with
11 deaths reported in total.

occurred. 26 Exceptionally heavy rain was a
major contributor to this disaster; Freetown
received 1 459.2 mm in the period from 1
to 14 August, about four times the average
rainfall for this period. Another major landslide
associated with heavy rainfall occurred in
Mocoa, in southern Colombia, on 1 April,
with at least 273 deaths reported.
Many parts of the Indian subcontinent were
affected by flooding during the monsoon
season between June and September, despite
overall seasonal rainfall being near average
over the region. The most serious flooding
occurred in mid-August, after extremely
heavy rainfall over a region centred on eastern
Nepal, northern Bangladesh and adjacent
areas of northern and north-eastern India.
Mawsynram (India), near the Bangladesh
border, received 1 479 mm in the four days
from 9 to 12 August. Daily totals in excess
of 400 mm also occurred near the IndiaNepal border, and the Rangpur region of
northern Bangladesh received 360 mm,
approximately the average monthly total, on
11–12 August. Across the period as a whole,
more than 1 200 deaths were reported in
India, Bangladesh and Nepal, 27 whilst more
than 40 million people were affected. The
World Health Organization (WHO) noted that
in Bangladesh alone more than 13 000 cases
of waterborne diseases and respiratory
infections were reported over three weeks
in August, 28 whilst extensive damage was
reported to public health facilities in Nepal.29
Earlier in the season, 292 deaths were reported
in Sri Lanka in late May, principally in southern

and western parts of the country, due to
heavy rains from the precursor low to Cyclone
Mora. Ratnapura received 384 mm of rain in
24 hours on 25/26 May. Some 650 000 people
were affected in some way by the floods,
but the rains did little to alleviate significant
drought in northern and eastern parts of Sri
Lanka. 30 Cyclone Mora also had significant
impacts in Bangladesh and Myanmar.31 Heavy
rains flooded thousands of hectares of crop
and damaged poultry sheds, fishing nets
and boats, severely eroding the livelihoods
of communities that depend on agriculture
and fisheries in the affected rural districts.
Flooding affected many parts of Peru in
March, af ter sustained heav y rains. At
least 75 deaths 32 were reported, and over
625 000 people were affected, including more
than 70 000 who lost their homes. The Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations reported that there were significant
crop production losses,33 particularly maize, in
the main producing regions of Lambayeque,
Piura and Ica. Flooding of this type typically

22

affects Peru during the late phase of El Niño
events. Whilst there was no Pacific-wide El
Niño during 2017, sea-surface temperatures
near the Peruvian coast in March were 2 °C
or more above average, values which would
be more typical of an El Niño year than of
a neutral year such as 2017. Major flooding
occurred mid-year in parts of southern China,
especially within the Yangtze River basin. The
heaviest rain fell in the provinces of Hunan,
Jiangxi, Guizhou and Guangxi. Peak totals
during the period from 29 June to 2 July
were in excess of 250 mm. Fifty-six deaths
were reported and economic losses were
estimated at more than US$ 5 billion. 34

DROUGHT
The drought that affected significant parts of
east Africa during 2016 continued into 2017.
In the March to May rainy season, seasonal
rainfall was at least 20% below average
over most of Somalia, Kenya and southern
Ethiopia, and more than 50% below average
over most of the northern half of Kenya and
parts of Somalia. There was some easing
of conditions late in the year, with near- to
above-average rainfall over most of the region
in the October–December period. Reports for
Somalia indicated that 6.7 million people were
experiencing food insecurity as of October,
this declined to 5.4 million by the end of
December as crop and pasture conditions
improved. 35
Drought worsened significantly during 2017 in
the Cape Province of South Africa. Following
below-average rainfall in 2015 and 2016, Cape
Town had its driest year on record in 2017 with
a total of 285 mm (47% below the 1981–2010
average). The three-year period 2015−2017
was also the driest on record (36% below
average). The dry conditions led to local water
supplies becoming severely depleted, with no
significant recovery as of early 2018. However,
generally average to above-average rainfall
further north in southern Africa during the
2016/2017 rainy season led to an improvement

Many parts of the Mediterranean region
experienced significant drought in 2017, as
did parts of central Europe. In the first part
of 2017, the most severe anomalies were in
Italy, which had its driest January to August
on record (and went on to have its driest
year, with annual rainfall 26% below the
1961–1990 average). Further north, Bratislava
(Slovakia) had its driest December to August
on record and southern Moravia (Czechia) its
second-driest January to August. Later in
the year the focus of the dry conditions was
on south-west Europe. Spain had its driest
autumn on record, the Provence-Haute AlpesCôte d’Azur region in south-east France had
its driest May to November, whilst Portugal
had its driest April to December and its thirddriest year (its four driest having all occurred
since 2004). Autumn was also very dry in
Morocco. The eastern Mediterranean was
also badly affected by drought, including
the eastern half of Turkey, Cyprus and most
of Israel. The coastal plain of Israel had its
driest year on record.
Drought also affected a region of central North
America on both sides of the United StatesCanada border. Particularly affected were
the states of North Dakota and Montana, and
the Prairie provinces of Canada, with areas
of severe drought identified on both sides
of the border. 37 After a period of prolonged
drought, the 2016/2017 winter rainfall season
brought heavy rains to much of California,
and the Sierra Nevada snowpack was 66%
above average, the heaviest since 1998.
Large-scale evacuations were required in
the state’s north in February because of the
risk of failure of the Oroville Dam. However,
dry conditions resumed in the second half
of the year, contributing to numerous major
wildfires.

Although rainfall deficit was not particularly
extreme during 2017, near-average to belowaverage rainfall resulted in a continuation of
multi-year drought in many parts of Brazil
north of 20°S, and in central Chile (where
2017 was the wettest year since 2008, but
still drier than the long-term average). In the
Asia-Pacific region, abnormally dry conditions
were reported in the Korean Peninsula in
the first half of 2017, whilst New Caledonia
experienced significant drought, especially
later in the year.

HEATWAVES, A REGULAR FEATURE
OF 2017
There were numerous significant heatwaves
around the world during 2017, in both the
southern and northern hemisphere summers.
Southern South America experienced
extreme heat on several occasions during
the 2016/2017 summer. The heat peaked
in late January, when numerous Chilean
stations had their hottest days on record,
including Santiago (37.4 °C) and Curico
(37.3 °C) on the 25 th, and Chillan (41.5 °C)
and Concepcion (34.1 °C) on the 26th. The heat
extended eastwards into Argentine Patagonia
where Puerto Madryn reached 43.4 °C on
27 January, the highest temperature ever
recorded so far south. It was also a notably
hot summer in much of eastern Australia,
where Moree had 54 consecutive days of
35 °C or above from 28 December 2016 to
19 February 2017, the longest such sequence
on record in New South Wales. Numerous
locations, including Moree (47.3 °C), Dubbo
(46.1 °C), Scone (46.5 °C), Bathurst (41.5 °C)
and Williamtown (45.5 °C) had their highest
recorded temperature on 11–12 February.
Extreme heat affected south-west Asia at the
end of May. The temperature at Turbat, in the
far south-west of Pakistan, reached 54.0 °C
on 28 May, a national record for Pakistan
and (if confirmed)38 an equal record for Asia.
During this event, sites in the Islamic Republic
of Iran, Oman and the United Arab Emirates
also exceeded 50 °C.

This observation, and another of 54.0 °C at Mitribah
(Kuwait), are currently being reviewed by a WMO evaluation
committee.

SNOW IN THE ALGERIAN SAHARA (AIN SEFRA REGION)

There were numerous heatwaves during
the European summer, particularly in the
Mediterranean region. The most significant
affected Turkey and Cyprus in late June
and early July, the western Mediterranean
(especially Spain and Morocco) in mid-July,
and Italy and the Balkans in early August.
All-time records were set in all three events,
including Antalya, Turkey (45.4 °C on 1 July);
Cordoba (46.9 °C on 13 July), Granada (45.7 °C
on 12 July) and Badajoz (45.4 °C on 13 July)
in Spain; and Pescara (41.0 °C on 4 August),
Campobasso (38.4 °C on 5 August) and Trieste
(38.0 °C on 5 August) in Italy.
The south-western United States had a very
hot summer. Death Valley had the highest
monthly mean temperature (41.9 °C) on
record for an American station in July. Later
in the season, record-high temperatures
occurred in coastal California in early
September, including San Francisco (41.1 °C
on 1 September). Eastern China was another
area to experience extreme summer heat, with
records set at Shanghai (40.9 °C on 21 July)
and at the Hong Kong Observatory (36.6 °C
on 22 August, associated with offshore flow
during Typhoon Hato).

SIGNIFICANT COLD PERIODS IN 2017
Whilst 2017 saw above-average annual mean
temperatures over almost all inhabited land
areas, there were still some noteworthy cold
events during the year.

24

January was a cold month over much of
central and south-east Europe. Several
countries experienced their coldest January
since 1987, with monthly mean temperatures
more than 5 °C below average in places. The
cold also extended to parts of northern Africa
with snowfalls in some elevated parts of the
Algerian Sahara.
A major late-season storm then affected the
region on 20–21 April. Moldova was the hardest
hit, with heavy falls of snow and freezing rain
– exceptional for the time of year – causing
extensive forest and agricultural damage.
Following the storm, severe late-season frosts
contributed to significant agricultural losses,
estimated by Munich Re at EUR 3.3 billion, 39
across many countries, including Switzerland,
Austria, Ukraine, Romania, and Slovenia. The
losses were exacerbated in many areas by
unusually early development of crops due
to an unusually warm March.
Extreme cold affected parts of Argentina in
July. Bariloche fell to −25.4 °C on 16 July,
4.3 °C below its previous record. Very low
overnight temperatures also occurred in parts
of south-eastern Australia in the first few
days of July, with record lows set at locations
including Sale, Deniliquin and West Wyalong.

At the end of the year, a significant cold spell
affected the north-eastern United States and
eastern Canada, with temperatures remaining
significantly below average for two weeks or
more. The cold spell was more notable for its
persistence than its intensity, with a number
of locations setting or approaching records for
the longest continuous period below certain
thresholds: one example was Boston, which
had a record seven consecutive days with
maximum temperatures of 20 °F (−6.7 °C)
or below from 27 December to 2 January.

GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF TEMPERATURE
EXTREMES
W hils t a f ull y glob al a s s e s s men t of
temperature extremes for 2017 is not yet
possible, the GHCNDEX dataset40 of extreme
temperature indices can be used to assess
values over those parts of the world for which
there is coverage. For minimum temperatures,
the main areas of coverage are Europe, North
America, Australia and parts of Russia; for
maximum temperatures, coverage also
extends to much of Asia (except the south
and south-west) and South Africa. There
is little or no coverage in South or Central
America, or in Africa outside South Africa.

cold nights, with minimum temperatures

night, were particularly uncommon in 2017
in north-western Europe, with values in a
region stretching from the United Kingdom
to Germany below 3% for cold days and 4%
for cold nights. Values above 10% were found
only in parts of Australia for cold nights, and
in central Canada for cold days, although

HEAT AND DROUGHT CONTRIBUTE TO
NUMEROUS DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES
Extreme heat and drought contributed to
many destructive wildfires in various parts of
the world in 2017. Whilst a return to near- or
above-average rainfall contributed to reduced
fire activity (compared with recent years)
in various tropical regions, numerous midlatitude regions had severe fire seasons.
Chile had the most significant forest fires in its
history during the 2016/2017 summer, when
exceptionally dry conditions during 2016 were
followed by extreme heat in December and
January. Eleven deaths were reported, and a
total of 614 000 hectares of forest were burnt –
the highest seasonal total on record and eight
times the long-term average.41 There were
also significant fires during the 2016/2017
southern hemisphere summer in various parts
of eastern Australia (especially eastern New
South Wales) and in the Christchurch region
of New Zealand, whilst the southern South
African town of Knysna was badly affected
by fire in June.
It was a ver y active fire season in the
Mediterranean region. The worst single
incident took place in central Portugal in
June, where 64 people died in a fire near
Pedrogao Grande. There were further major
fire outbreaks in Portugal and north-western
Spain in mid-October (exacerbated by strong
winds associated with the circulation of
Hurricane Ophelia), with a further 45 deaths
reported. The area burned in Portugal in the
period from January to October42 was more
than five times the 2007–2016 median. Other
significant fires were reported, including in
Croatia, France and Italy.
It was also an active fire season in western
North America, both in the United States
and Canada. A wet winter, which allowed

the heavy growth of ground fuels, followed
by a dry and hot summer, provided ideal
conditions for high-intensity fires, the worst
of which occurred north of San Francisco in
early October. At least 44 people died, the
worst loss of life in a wildfire in the United
States since 1918. Insured losses from the fire
were assessed as at least US$ 9.4 billion,43 the
worst for a wildfire anywhere in the world,
even surpassing the 2016 Fort McMurray
fires in Canada. Total economic losses for the
2017 California fire season were assessed at
US$ 18 billion. A further fire north-west of
Los Angeles in December became California’s
largest fire in modern history, and indirectly
resulted in 21 deaths in flash floods and debris
flows when heavy rains fell on the burnt area
in early January.44
The total area burned in the contiguous United
States in 2017 was 53% above the 2007−2016
average, 45 just short of the record set in
2015, whilst the area burned in the western
provinces of Canada was also far above
average, with over 1.2 million hectares burned
in British Columbia, about eight times the
2006–2015 seasonal average. 46 Long-lived
fires in British Columbia and the north-west
United States also contributed to heavy
smoke pollution across the region.
A significant tundra fire occurred in August
in the Disko Bay area, on the central west
coast of Greenland.

THE INFLUENCE OF ANTHROPOGENIC
CLIMATE CHANGE ON EXTREME EVENTS
Determining the extent, if any, to which
anthropogenic climate change has influenced
the occurrence of extreme events has been
an active area of research in recent years.

Such analyses are now routinely published
in the peer-reviewed literature, many of them
as part of an annual report prepared as a
supplement to the Bulletin of the American
Meteorological Society (BAMS).
The most-recently published BAMS report
included 27 analyses of extreme events that
occurred in 2016 (some of them multiple
analyses of the same event), and found
that anthropogenic climate change was a
significant driver of the frequency of the
event concerned in 21 of the 27 cases. In
particular, of 15 analyses that assessed
ex treme temperature events (either on
land or in the ocean), 13 found that their
probability had been significantly influenced
by anthropogenic climate change in the
“expected” direction (that is, that a warm
event had become more likely or a cold
event less likely). One counter-example of
interest was a frost event in south-western
Australia in September 2016, where it was
found that anthropogenic climate change
had significantly increased the chance of the
circulation anomalies which were the primary
driver for the event (notwithstanding the
background warming signal). As in previous
years, anthropogenic signals were found
less consistently for extreme precipitation
events, with such signals being found (in

NASA

October wildfires

three different analyses) for extremely high
rainfall in eastern China during the summer
of 2016, but not for extreme precipitation
events in other parts of the world.
Given the timeframes involved, few studies
of 2017 events have yet been published in the
peer-reviewed literature. One exception is
an assessment of the extremely high rainfall
associated with Hurricane Harvey. The WMO
Expert Team on Climate Impacts on Tropical
Cyclones also found 47 that, whilst there is
no clear evidence that climate change is
making the occurrence of slow-moving, landfalling hurricanes more or less likely, it is
probable that anthropogenic climate change
made rainfall rates more intense, and that
ongoing sea-level rise exacerbated storm
surge impacts. Assessments of recent events
– most of which use methods that have been
documented in the peer-reviewed literature,
although the assessments themselves are
not – are regularly published shortly after
the event through a variety of channels, and
it is likely that many of these events will be
documented in the peer-reviewed literature
in due course.

ATTRIBUTION OF EXTREME CLIMATE EVENTS

Answering this question has become a very active
area of research in the last few years. Whilst a range
of approaches has been used, the most common is to
use climate models. The approach consists in running
these models with all known climate forcings, both
anthropogenic and natural, and with natural forcings
only. Comparing the probability of the event in question
using the two sets of model runs allows the attribution
of the event to anthropogenic versus natural factors.
This is often expressed as the Fraction of Attributable
Risk (FAR), which is the probability that the event was
the result of anthropogenic influence on climate as
opposed to natural variability.
Many of these studies have found that the probability
of the extreme event has been influenced by human
activity, either directly, or indirectly through, for example,
affecting the likelihood of occurrence of an unusual
circulation anomaly which triggered the extreme event;
sometimes in conjunction with other influences such
as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Of a set of
131 studies published between 2011 and 2016 in the
Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 65%
found that the event’s probability was significantly
affected by anthropogenic activities.
The strongest anthropogenic influence has been
found on temperature extremes: the likelihood of
warm extremes increases and that of cold extremes
decreases. This is especially true for events considered
over large areas and over a long period of time, such as
a season or a year. As an example, it was found that the
2016 record-breaking global mean temperature would
have been almost impossible without human activity.1
Because there is a higher level of “natural” variability
at individual locations and over shorter timescales, it is
more difficult to find a significant human signal in the
occurrence of short-term extremes at specific places,
although studies of that type are also starting to emerge.
It has been more difficult to identify anthropogenic
influence in the attribution of precipitation extremes.

Meteorological Society, 99:S11-S15.

Whilst some studies have found that the probability
of some extreme precipitation events was increased,
most often indirectly, by climate change, for many
other studies the results have been inconclusive. This
is because the underlying long-term climate signal
in extreme precipitation is less clear than it is for
temperature and, because extreme precipitation events
typically occur on shorter spatial scales than extreme
temperature events.
At present, attribution studies are mostly carried out
in research mode and the most common platform for
publishing these studies is through the traditional
peer-reviewed literature. This is mostly done through
an annual supplement to the State of the Climate
repor t published in the Bulletin of the American
Meteorological Society. Such studies usually appear
several months following the occurrence of the event
under consideration.
For some types of extremes, especially extremes defined
using standard indices, such as national mean monthly
temperature, methods have been developed which
allow an assessment of the FAR for the event in close to
real time. At present, most such reports are published
through other channels than the National Meteorological
and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) such as blogs,
university or NGO websites, or the media. Operational
attribution services under the auspices of NMHSs or
Regional Climate Centres are in their infancy, although
many individual NMHS scientists have contributed to the
studies that are currently being published. Nevertheless,
it is expected that there will be substantial progress
in this area in the next few years due to the increased
demand from governments, the public and the media
for these services on quasi-real time.

0.1
Probability

A common question when an extreme climate event
happens is “was this event caused by climate change?”.
Scientists address this question in a different way: “Was
the chance of this event happening affected by human
influences on the climate, and if it was, by how much?”.

Climate risks and related impacts
Climate-related extreme events and disasters
take a heavy toll on human well-being and
on various sectors of national economies.
The year 2017 was particularly severe for
disasters with high economic impacts.
Munich Re assessed total disaster losses
from weather and climate-related events in
2017 at US$ 320 billion, 48 the largest annual
total on record (after adjustment for inflation).

AGRICULTURE AND FOOD
SECURITY
Exposure and vulnerabilit y to ex treme
events can destroy agricultural assets and
infrastructure, causing serious damage to
the livelihoods and food security of millions
of people. A concern for the World Food
Programme (WFP) is that more than 80% of the
world’s food-insecure people live in countries
with degraded environments prone to natural
hazards. When climate-related events occur,
the situation of already-vulnerable people can
quickly deteriorate into food and nutrition
crises. Problems of acute food insecurity
and malnutrition tend to be magnified where
natural hazards such as droughts and floods
compound the consequences of conflicts.49
The disruption of agricultural production in
rural areas of developing countries affects the
already fragile livelihoods of the poorest and
most vulnerable people in particular. A review
carried out by FAO found that agriculture
(crops, livestock, fisheries, aquaculture and
forestry) accounted for 26% of all the damage
and loss associated with medium to largescale climate-related disasters. 50

In the Horn of Africa, rainfall deficits led to the
failure of the 2016 rainy season, followed by
a harsh January–February 2017 dry season,
and a poor March–May rainy season. As a
result, the number of food-insecure people
rose significantly in Eastern Africa. 51 The
most affected areas include southern and
south-eastern Ethiopia, northern and coastal
Kenya, almost all of Somalia, south-eastern
areas of South Sudan and north-eastern
areas of Uganda. In Somalia, as of June 2017,
more than half of the cropland was affected
by drought, and herds had reduced by 40 to
60% since December 2016 due to increased
mortality and distress sales.

In Ethiopia, prolonged drought jeopardized
crop production and caused a reduction in the
availability of pasture, severely constraining
the purchasing power of pastoral households.
In drought-affected areas of Kenya, according
to the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), as of
May 2017 drought was associated with a sharp
increase in staple crop prices coupled with
declining livestock prices and consequent
erosion of livelihoods and threat to food
security.52

DATA FOR MONITORING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE-RELATED EXTREME
EVENTS AND DISASTERS
At the Seventy-first Session of the United
Nations General Assembly1 and the Fortyeighth Session of the United Nations
Statistical Commission, 2 the data and
indicators for the measurement of progress
in achieving the global targets of the Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
2015–2030 and of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development were adopted.
This enabled integrated monitoring and
reporting by countries of progress in
managing disaster and climate risk and
the corollary impacts, using multi-purpose
datasets and common indicators.
Data are currently available in most countries
to allow some degree of measurement
of the impact of climate-related extreme
events and disasters – including via the
growing number of national disaster
loss accounting systems – as detailed in
the Sendai Framework Data Readiness
Review 2017.3 However, considerable work
is required if countries are to be able to
monitor the agreed indicators in the manner
anticipated by the two intergovernmental
wor k  group s – the Op en - ende d
In ter gover nme n t al E x p er t Wor 
Group on Indicators and Terminology
Relating to Disaster Risk Reduc tion
(OIEWG) and the Inter-agency and Expert
Group on Sustainable Development Goal
Indicators (IAEG-SDGs). Many countries are
confronted with challenges related to data
availability, accessibility and quality, which
will need to be addressed if data are to be
sufficiently consistent and comparable to
allow meaningful measurement of progress
and impact.

Work is ongoing with the international
statistical community to address some
of these challenges. The outcomes of the
Expert Group on Disaster-related Statistics
will be presented at the Seventy-fourth
Session of the Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific. They
include the development of the disasterrelated statistical framework (DRSF) to
monitor the achievement of the global
targets of the Sendai Framework and the
Sustainable Development Goals.
Established by the Conference of European
Statisticians of the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe, the Task Force on
Measuring Extreme Events and Disasters
is clarifying the role of official statistics
in providing data related to ex treme
events and disasters, as well as possible
support of national statistical offices to the
implementation of the Sendai Framework
and the 2030 Agenda.
Countries are supported in systematic
data entry and reporting by the Sendai
Framework Monitoring system, an online
monitoring facility which became available
on 1 March 2018, and which is supported
by detailed guidance on metadata and
c omput a tional me thodologie s . T he
integration of monitoring and reporting
with The Paris Agreement will be discussed
at the Thirteenth Meeting of the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) Adaptation Committee.

In the Philippines, over the las t t wo
decades, 15 times more infants have died
in the 24 months after typhoons than in the
typhoons themselves. Of those infants, 80%
were girls.53 In Ethiopia, children born in an
area affected by disasters are 35.5% more
likely to be malnourished and 41% more likely
to be stunted.54
Over the last three years, agricultural
production and related livelihoods were
heavily compromised by recurrent and intense
floods in many countries. In Malawi, the 2015
floods resulted in more than US$ 60 million
in damage and losses to crops, livestock,
fisheries and forestry assets, and production
flows. More than 37% of the total economic
impact of the 2015 floods in Myanmar occurred
in the agricultural sector.55
In 2017, several flood events affected the
agricultural sector, especially in Asian
countries. Heavy rains in May 2017 triggered
severe flooding and landslides in southwestern areas of Sri Lanka. The adverse
impact of floods on crop production further
aggravated the food security conditions in
the country already stricken by drought.56 In
July 2017, localized floods in south and central
Myanmar contributed to losses in paddy crop,
stored food and livestock, and affected at
least 200 000 people in the Magway, Sagaing,
Bago and Ayeyarwady regions and Mon State.
It was the third consecutive year in which
severe floods affected Myanmar during the
monsoon season.

Excess precipitation in late March and early
April 2017 triggered floods in north-eastern
agricultural areas of Bangladesh, affecting
crop production in the Sylhet, Dhaka and
Mymensingh divisions in particular. 57 The
monsoon season in South Asia brought
the worst flooding in the region for years.
Between June and August 2017, flooding
in Nepal, Bangladesh and northern India
affected millions of people and caused death
and displacement across the three countries.
The end of the climate anomalies associated
with the 2015/2016 El Niño, both on land and
in the ocean, resulted in improved agricultural
and fisheries production in some areas.58 More
normal rainfall patterns have contributed
to two successive record-breaking global
cereal harvests since 2015. World wheat
production hit an all-time high in 2016 and
is expected to remain at near-record levels
in 2017, mainly due to larger crops in India
and the Russian Federation. More abundant
rains since mid-2016 in India, Thailand and
the Philippines have increased rice output
to a level that marked recoveries in these
countries. As a result, world rice production
reached a fresh peak in 2016 and was expected
to expand further in the 2017 season. As to
annual oilcrops, global production recovered
swiftly in 2016/2017, actually posting a new
record, and is anticipated to grow modestly

in 2017/2018. Conversely, the recovery in
palm oil production was more gradual and
is expected to revert to its usual growth rate
only in 2018. There was also a strong recovery
in the Anchoveta fishery off the Pacific coast of
South America as sea-surface temperatures
in the region reverted to near average.

HEALTH
The global health impacts of heatwaves
depend not only on the overall warming trend,
but also on how heatwaves are distributed
across the area where people live. Recent
research shows that the overall risk of heatrelated illness or death has climbed steadily
since 1980, with around 30% of the world’s
population now living in climatic conditions
that deliver potentially deadly temperatures
at least 20 days a year.59 Between 2000 and
2016, the number of vulnerable people
exposed to heatwave events has increased
by approximately 125 million.60
In cholera-endemic countries, an estimated
1.3 billion people are at risk, while in Africa
alone about 40 million people live in cholera
“hotspots”. 61 These cholera “hotspots”
have been identified across most endemic
countries facing recurrent and predictable
cholera outbreaks, often coinciding with the
rainy season. The World Health Organization
has recognized that large cholera outbreaks in

eastern and central, and later southern Africa
were likely aided by El Niño-driven weather
conditions that accelerated transmission
across the region starting in mid-2015, with
control efforts still underway in several
countries in 2017. Flood events are also often
associated with outbreaks of water-borne
diseases or those linked to poor sanitation,
as was reported in Bangladesh during the
August 2017 floods.

POPULATION DISPLACEMENT
One of the adver se consequences of
climate variability and change is population
displacement. Most such displacement
is internal and linked to sudden onset of
extreme weather events. However, slow
onset phenomena, such as droughts,
desertification, coastal erosion and sea-level
rise, can also lead to internal and cross-border
displacement. These slow-onset events can
act as a threat multiplier by, for example,
exacerbating conflict which, in turn, can
contribute to population displacement.
In 2016, weather-related disasters displaced
23.5 million people.62 As in previous years,
the majority of those internal displacements
were associated with floods or storms and
occurred in the Asia-Pacific region. The most
striking example of displacement due to major
climate events is from Somalia, where it was
reported that 892 000 people were displaced
internally, mostly in the first half of 2017.63 Of
the displaced people who were surveyed,
approximately 90% indicated that drought was
the primary reason for displacement, while the
remaining 10% gave reasons closely related
to drought or cited drought as a contributing
factor, such as food or livelihood insecurity.64

ECONOMIC IMPACTS
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) World
Economic Outlook published in October 201765
indicates that increases in temperature have
uneven macroeconomic effects. Adverse
consequences are concentrated in regions
with relatively hot climates, where a
disproportionately large number of lowincome countries are located. In these
countries, a rise in temperature lowers per
capita output, in both the short and medium
term, by reducing agricultural output,
suppressing the productivity of workers
exposed to heat, slowing investment and
damaging health.
The analysis confirms the existence of a
statistically significant nonlinear effect of
temperature on per capita economic growth.
65

In countries with high average temperatures,
an increase in temperature dampens economic
activity, whereas it has the opposite effect in
much colder climates.
For the median emerging market economy,
a 1 °C increase from an average annual
temperature of 22 °C lowers growth in the
same year by 0.9%. For a median low-income
developing country, with an annual average
temperature of 25 °C, the effect of a 1 °C
increase in temperature is even larger: growth
falls by 1.2%. Countries whose economies
are projected to be significantly adversely
af fected by an increase in temperature
produced only about 20% of global GDP in
2016; however, they are currently home to
nearly 60% of the global population and are
projected to be home to more than 75% by
the end of the century.

Vector-borne diseases:
Zika in the Americas
Ángel G. Muñoz,1 Rachel Lowe, 2
Anna M Stewart-Ibarra, 3 Joy ShumakeGuillemot, 4 Madeleine Thomson1
4

Vector-borne diseases are highly climate
sensitive and favourable climate conditions
can trigger and amplify disease transmission.
Warm temperatures increase virus replication
rates and drive the development of juvenile
mosquitoes, adult feeding and egg laying
behaviour. Rainfall excess and deficit have
similar outcomes in terms of mosquito
proliferation, as containers such as domestic
pots, tires, drums and tanks tend to create
suitable breeding sites in both cases.
The emergence of the Zika virus (ZIKV)
epidemic, mainly carried by the Aedes
mosquito in Latin America and the Caribbean in
2014–2016, occurred during a period of severe
drought and unusually high temperatures
developed since at least 2013 (see top and
middle panels of the figure). These conditions
have been shown to be associated with a
cross-timescale combination of signals
including the 2015/2016 El Niño event, decadal
variability and climate change (Muñoz et al.,
2016a,b).
A common approach to assess the potential
ris k of transmis sion of Ae de s - b orne
epidemics is via the estimation of the basic
reproduction number, R0, which is in general
a function of environmental variables, such
as air temperature, and ento-epidemiological
parameters (Mordecai et al, 2017). Using
an R0 model which considers the two most
common Aedes mosquitoes in Latin America
and the Caribbean, a recent study (Muñoz
et al., 2017) showed that high temperatures
enhanced the risk of transmission during the
2014–2016 ZIKV epidemic, and that neither El
Niño nor climate change can be independently
blamed for this event. While the potential

risk of transmission signal (black curve in
the bottom panel of the figure) is consistent
with long-term temperature increase due to
global warming and with inter-annual climate
variability modes (filled red/blue curve shown
in bottom panel of the figure) such as El Niño,
other non-climatic factors come into play to
explain the 2014–2016 ZIKV epidemic.
In fact, in addition to suitable climate conditions,
the rapid transmission that occurred in the
initial Brazilian outbreak appears to have been
aided by a combination of factors including a
massive susceptible population, alternative
non-vector transmission, and a highly mobile
population (Lowe et al., 2018). Furthermore,
the occurrence of shocks such as natural
disasters can also exacerbate population
vulnerability. This was observed following
the major earthquake in coastal Ecuador
in April 2016, which seemingly enhanced
the ZIKV transmission in that region where
suitable hot and dry local climate conditions
were already present (Sorensen et al., 2017).
Currently, local ZIKV transmission and the
associated and resulting fetal malformations
and neurological disorders continue to
be monitored and recorded in the region
and worldwide. Predictions of the timing
and magnitude of outbreaks of multiple
arboviruses, including ZIKV, can be improved
using a combination of climate forecasts
and sero-prevalence survey data (Lowe et
al., 2017). For example, real-time seasonal
climate forecasts have been used to produce
dengue early warnings for Brazil (Lowe et
al., 2014, 2016), and the use of the R0 model
mentioned above and state-of the-art climate
forecasts provided by the North American
Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) project
could have successfully predicted the recent
epidemic at least 1–3 months in advance for
several high-risk ZIKV zones, including its
epicenter in Northeast Brazil (Muñoz et al.,
2017, Epstein et al., 2017).
